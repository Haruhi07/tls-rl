The search continued for 11 workers missing after the explosion late Tuesday on the Deepwater Horizon , though family members said they had been told they probably did not survive . The rig burned for nearly two days until it sank Thursday morning . The fire was out , but officials initially feared as much as 336,000 gallons of crude oil a day could be rising from the sea floor nearly 5,000 feet below . Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said Friday morning that no oil appeared to be leaking from a well head at the ocean floor , nor was any leaking at the water 's surface . But she said crews were closely monitoring the rig for any more crude that might spill out . The crew was finishing the well about 50 miles off the Louisiana coast when the rig exploded . Officials have not said what caused the blast , and the oil they are dealing with now is left over from the explosion and sinking . `` If it gets landward , it could be a disaster in the making , '' said Cynthia Sarthou , executive director for the environmental group Gulf Restoration Network . BP PLC , which leased the rig and took the lead in the cleanup , said Friday it has activated an extensive oil spill response , including using remotely operated vehicles to assess the well and 32 vessels to mop up the spill . BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward said the company will do `` everything in our power to contain this oil spill and resolve the situation as rapidly , safely and effectively as possible . '' Ed Overton , a Louisiana State University environmental sciences professor , said he expects some of the light crude oil to evaporate while much of it turns into a pasty mess that ultimately breaks apart into small chunks of oily residue that can wash ashore . `` It 's going to be a god-awful mess for a while , '' he said . `` I 'm not crying doomsday or saying the sky is falling , but that is the potential . '' Weather forecasts indicate the spill was likely to stay well away from shore at least through the weekend , but if winds change it could come ashore faster , said Doug Helton of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's office of response and restoration . The Coast Guard , which was leading the investigation , had not given up the search early Friday for those missing from the rig . Carolyn Kemp of Monterey , La. , said her grandson , Roy Wyatt Kemp , 27 , would have been on the drilling platform when it exploded . `` They 're assuming all those men who were on the platform are dead , '' Kemp said . `` That 's the last we 've heard . '' Most of the crew -- 111 members -- were ashore , including 17 taken to hospitals . Four were in critical condition . Four others made it off safely were still on a boat operating one of several underwater robots being used to assess whether the flow of oil could be shut off at a control valve on the sea floor , said Guy Cantwell , spokesman for rig owner Transocean Ltd. . Landry said crews saw a 1-mile-by-5-mile rainbow sheen of what appeared to be a crude oil mix on the surface . At the worst-case figure of 336,000 gallons a day , it would take more than a month for the amount of crude oil spilled to equal the 11 million gallons spilled from the Exxon Valdez in Alaska 's Prince William Sound . A turn in winds and currents might send oil toward fragile coastal wetlands -- nurseries for fish and shrimp and habitat for birds . `` As you get closer to shore , you get richer and richer marine habitats , and also get the potential for long-term exposure , '' Helton said . To prevent that , the Marine Spill Response Corp. , an energy industry cleanup consortium , brought seven skimmer boats to suck oily water from the surface , four planes that can scatter chemicals to disperse oil , and 500,000 feet -- 94.6 miles -- of containment boom , a floating barrier with a skirt that drapes down under the water and corrals the oil . In addition to other environmental concerns , the well is in an area where a pod of sperm whales is known to feed , said Kim Amendola of NOAA . Those who escaped the rig did so mainly by getting on lifeboats that were lowered into the Gulf , said Adrian Rose , vice president of Transocean . `` There are a number of uncorroborated stories , a lot of them really quite heroic stories , of how people looked after each other . There was very little panic , '' Rose said . Family members of two missing workers filed separate lawsuits Thursday accusing Transocean and BP of negligence . Both companies declined to comment about legal action against them after the first suit was filed . The U.S. Minerals Management Service , which regulates oil rigs , conducted three routine inspections of the Deepwater Horizon this year -- in February , March and on April 1 -- and found no violations , MMS spokeswoman Eileen Angelico said .

AP Apr. 21 : Fire boat crews battle the blazing remnants of the offshore oil rig Deepwater Horizon . Coast Guard via AP NEW ORLEANS -- The Coast Guard discovered Saturday that oil is leaking from the damaged well that fed a massive rig that exploded this week off Louisiana 's coast , while bad weather halted efforts to clean up the mess that threatens the area 's fragile marine ecosystem . For days , the Coast Guard has said no oil appeared to be escaping from the well head on the ocean floor . Rear Adm. Mary Landry said the leak was a new discovery but could have begun when the rig sank on Thursday , two days after the initial explosion . `` We thought what we were dealing with as of yesterday was a surface residual -LRB- oil -RRB- from the mobile offshore drilling unit , '' Landry said . `` In addition to that is oil emanating from the well . It is a big change from yesterday ... This is a very serious spill , absolutely . '' Coast Guard and company officials estimate that as much as 1,000 barrels -- or 42,000 gallons -- of oil is leaking each day after studying information from remotely operated vehicles and the size of the oil slick surrounding the blast site . The rainbow-colored sheen of oil stretched 20 miles by 20 miles on Saturday -- about 25 times larger than it appeared to be a day earlier , Landry said . By comparison , Exxon Valdez spilled 11 million gallons in Alaska 's Prince William Sound in 1989 -- the worst oil spill in U.S. history . BP PLC , which leased the rig and is taking the lead in the cleanup , and the government have been using the remotely operated vehicles to try to stop the leak by closing valves on the well deep underwater . If that does n't work , the company could drill what 's called an intervention well to control the oil flow . But the intervention drilling could take months . `` Over the next several days , we should determine which method is the best one to follow , '' said Doug Suttles , chief operating officer for BP Exploration and Production . `` A huge number of engineers from ourselves , working with -LRB- the government -RRB- and across the industry are putting together the best technology and know-how to solve this problem . '' Complicating efforts to stop the leak is well head 's depth at 5,000 feet underwater , said Lars Herbst , the regional director for the Minerals Management Service . Leaks have been fixed at similar depths before , but the process is difficult , he said . The bad weather rolled in Friday , bringing with it strong wind , clouds and rain that interrupted efforts to contain the oil spill . Coast Guard Petty Officer John Edwards said he was uncertain when weather conditions would improve enough for the cleanup to resume . So far , crews have retrieved about 1,052 barrels of oily water , he said . The sunken rig may have as much as 700,000 gallons of diesel on board , and an undetermined amount of oil has spilled from the rig itself . Suttles said the rig was `` intact and secure '' on the seabed about 1,300 feet from the well site . BP said it has activated an extensive oil spill response , including the remotely operated vehicles , 700 workers , four airplanes and 32 vessels to mop up the spill . The Marine Spill Response Corp. , an energy industry cleanup consortium , also brought equipment . The 11 missing workers came from Texas , Louisiana and Mississippi . Neither the Coast Guard nor their employers have released their names , though several of their families have come forward . Karl Kleppinger Sr. , whose 38-year-old son , Karl , was one of the missing workers , said he does n't blame the Coast Guard for calling off the search . `` Given the magnitude of the explosion and the fire , I do n't see where you would be able to find anything , '' said Kleppinger , of Zachary , La. . The other 115 crew members made it off the platform ; several were hurt but only one remained hospitalized . The most seriously injured worker was expected to be released within about 10 days . Federal officials had already been working on new safety rules for offshore drilling before Tuesday 's blast . The U.S. Minerals and Management Service is developing regulations aimed at preventing human error , which it identified as a factor in many of the more than 1,400 offshore oil drilling accidents between 2001 and 2007 . An MMS review published last year found 41 deaths and 302 injuries during that period . The cause of Tuesday 's blast has n't been determined . The Deepwater Horizon was the site of a 2005 fire found to have been caused by human error . An MMS investigation determined that a crane operator on the rig had become distracted while refueling the crane , allowing diesel fuel to overflow . Records show the fire was quickly contained , but caused $ 60,000 in damage to the crane . Environmentalists said the rig explosion and oil spill should push the nation to develop new energy sources . `` This should be a wake-up call , '' said David Helvarg , the president of the Blue Frontier Campaign , a marine conservation group , and author of `` Rescue Warriors : The U.S. Coast Guard , America 's Forgotten Heroes . '' `` I would rather risk a ` wind spill ' than an oil spill offshore , '' he said , ruefully pointing out that the source of wind-powered energy ca n't sully the environment .

AP Apr. 21 : An oil slick is seen as the Deepwater Horizon oil rig burns in the Gulf of Mexico . AP BILOXI , Mississippi -- This time , it 's not a hurricane that threatens to wreck their livelihoods -- it 's a blob of black ooze slowly making its way toward the Gulf Coast . Hotel owners , fishermen and restaurateurs are keeping anxious watch as an oil slick spreads from a wrecked drilling rig site like a giant filthy ink blot . Forecasters say it could wash ashore within days near delicate wetlands , oyster beds and pristine white beaches . Crews have not been able to stop thousands of barrels of oil from spewing out of the sea floor since an April 20 explosion destroyed the Deepwater Horizon , which was drilling 50 miles off the Louisiana coast . Eleven workers are missing and presumed dead , and the cause of the explosion has not been determined . Louis Skrmetta , 54 , runs a company called Ship Island Excursions that takes tourists to the Gulf Islands National Seashore , where white-sand beaches and green water create an idyllic landscape . `` This is the worst possible thing that could happen to the Mississippi Gulf Coast , '' he said . `` It will wipe out the oyster industry . Shrimping would n't recover for years . It would kill family tourism . That 's our livelihood . '' As crews struggled to contain the oil slick , Coast Guard officials said Tuesday they were considering setting fire to the contaminated water to burn off the crude . Pools of oil far offshore would be trapped in special containment booms and set aflame as soon as Wednesday . `` If we do n't secure this well , this could be one of the most significant oil spills in U.S. history , '' Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said . A similar burn off the coast of Newfoundland in 1993 eliminated 50 to 99 percent of captured oil . However , burning the oil also creates air pollution , and the effect on marine life is unclear . Ed Overton , a professor emeritus of environmental sciences at Louisiana State University who 's studying the oil spill , questioned whether burning would work . `` It can be effective in calm water , not much wind , in a protected area , '' he said . `` When you 're out in the middle of the ocean , with wave actions , and currents , pushing you around , it 's not easy . '' He has another concern : The oil samples from the spill he 's looked at shows it to be a sticky substance similar to roofing tar . `` I 'm not super optimistic . This is tarry crude that lies down in the water , '' he said . `` But it 's something that has got to be tried . '' According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , birds and mammals are more likely to escape a burning area of the ocean than escape from an oil slick . The agency said birds might be disoriented by the plumes of smoke , but they would be at much greater risk from exposure to oil in the water . In Washington , meanwhile , the Obama administration launched a full investigation of the explosion , and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said they will devote every available resource to the probe . Meanwhile , the glistening sheen of sweet crude continued to grow and began forming long reddish-orange ribbons of oil that , if they wash up on shore , could cover birds , white sand beaches and marsh grasses . The last major spill in the Gulf was in June 1979 , when an offshore drilling rig in Mexican waters -- the Ixtoc I -- blew up , releasing 140 million gallons of oil . It took until March 1980 to cap the well , and a great deal of the oil contaminated U.S. waters and Texas shores . `` In the worst-case scenario , this could also last months , '' said Richard Haut , a senior research scientist at the Houston Advanced Research Center who worked for Exxon for 20 years , 10 of them on an offshore platform in the North Sea . Oil from the Deepwater Horizon is not expected to reach the coast until late in the week , if at all . As of Tuesday , it was about 20 miles offshore , south of Venice , Louisiana . The spill covered an expanding area about 48 miles long and 80 miles wide , but with uneven borders , making it difficult to calculate its area in square miles . `` I understand there 's got to be industry , but it 's so sad for our kids . We do n't have a lot of beaches left , '' Bonnie Bethel , 66 , said as she watched her grandchildren splash in the water on a Mississippi beach . `` Can you imagine these poor birds in oil ? '' Thousands of birds such as egrets and brown pelicans are nesting on barrier islands close to the rig 's wreckage right now . If the oil gets to them , rescuers would need to reach their remote islands , wash them down and release them back into the wild . Michael Ziccardi , director of the Oiled Wildlife Care Network affiliated with the University of California at Davis , said he is standing by to clean up Gulf Coast birds if they are hurt by the spill . Cleaning up brown pelican chicks after a modest spill in Louisiana in 2005 was a major undertaking , he said . `` Just about any petroleum can cause problems for birds because they lose their waterproofing , and that 's what keeps them dry and warm , '' Ziccardi said . `` It 's a really difficult time , and we 're close to the peak of migration . '' The spill also threatens billions of fish eggs and larvae coating the Gulf 's surface this time of year . If the well can not be closed , almost 100,000 barrels of oil , or 4.2 million gallons , could spill into the Gulf before crews can drill a relief well to alleviate the pressure . By comparison , the Exxon Valdez , the worst oil spill in U.S. history , leaked 11 million gallons into Alaska 's Prince William Sound in 1989 . Crews working to clean up the spill from the Deepwater Horizon have other things in their favor . Oil from the Exxon Valdez can still be found under rocks in the cold water of Prince William Sound , but residue in the Gulf will disappear faster . `` You have warm temperatures , strong sunlight , microbial action . It will degrade a lot faster , '' said Ronald S. Tjeerdema , an environmental toxicologist at the University of California at Davis who 's studied the effects of oil on aquatic systems . `` Eventually , things will return to normal . '' And there 's another bit of good news : The oil spilling out is sweet crude , which is low in sulfur , unlike the oil from the Exxon Valdez , which was heavy crude . `` If you had to pick an oil to spill , this would be it , '' Overton , the LSU oil spill expert , said . BP said Tuesday that it planned to begin drilling a relief well to redirect the leaking oil in a $ 100 million effort to take the pressure off the blown-out well . The company said it would begin the drilling by Thursday even if crews can shut off oil leaking from the pipe 5,000 feet underground . Robot subs have tried to activate a shut-off device , but so far that has not worked . Company spokesman Robert Wine said the drilling will take up to three months and will be done from a rig now in place near where the Deepwater Horizon sank . Louisiana-based BP spokesman Neil Chapman said 49 vessels -- oil skimmers , tugboats barges and special recovery boats that separate oil from water -- are working to round up oil . In Pensacola , Florida , the easternmost point likely to be affected , beachgoers and business owners kept watch . `` I 've been looking at this sand all morning and thinking about the oil spill , '' said Shelley Brunson after a morning swim at Pensacola Beach . `` I am praying they clean it up fast and it does n't come here . '' Sal Pinzone , general manager of the fishing pier where anglers catch pompano and cobia , shows up at work at 5:30 every morning to watch the sun rise over the famous white-sand beach . `` We are all worried , '' he said . `` If the spill does hit the beaches along the Gulf , it will shut down everything .

OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO -- It 's a hellish scene : Giant sheets of flame racing across the Gulf of Mexico as thick , black smoke billows high into the sky . This , though , is no Hollywood action movie . It 's the real-life plan to be deployed just 20 miles from the Gulf Coast in a last-ditch effort to burn up an oil spill before it could wash ashore and wreak environmental havoc . Crews late Wednesday afternoon started a test burn to see how the technique was working . Rig operator BP PLC had planned to continue the oil fires after the test , but as night fell , no more were lit . The burns were not expected to be done at night , and the Coast Guard said crews could resume work Thursday morning if the weather cooperated . Late Thursday evening the Coast Guard said there was a new leak from spot where platform exploded , sank in Gulf of Mexico . Crews planned to use hand-held flares to set fire to sections of the massive spill . Crews turned to the plan after failing to stop a 1,000-barrel-a-day leak at the spot where a deepwater oil platform exploded and sank . A 500-foot boom was to be used to corral several thousand gallons of the thickest oil on the surface , which will then be towed to a more remote area , set on fire , and allowed to burn for about an hour . About 42,000 gallons of oil a day are leaking into the Gulf from the blown-out well drilled by the Deepwater Horizon oil rig . Eleven workers are missing and presumed dead . The cause of the explosion has not been determined . Greg Pollock , head of the oil spill division of the Texas General Land Office , which is providing equipment for crews in the Gulf , said he is not aware of a similar burn ever being done off the U.S. coast . The last time crews with his agency used fire booms to burn oil was a 1995 spill on the San Jacinto River . `` When you can get oil ignited , it is an absolutely effective way of getting rid of a huge percentage of the oil , '' he said . `` I ca n't overstate how important it is to get the oil off the surface of the water . '' The oil has the consistency of thick roofing tar . When the flames go out , Pollock said , the material that is left resembles a hardened ball of tar that can be removed from the water with nets or skimmers . `` I would say there is little threat to the environment because it wo n't coat an animal , and because all the volatiles have been consumed if it gets on a shore it can be simply picked up , '' he said . Authorities also said they expect minimal impact on sea turtles and marine mammals in the burn area . A graphic posted by the Coast Guard and the industry task force fighting the slick showed it covering an area about 100 miles long and 45 miles across at its widest point . `` It 's premature to say this is catastrophic . I will say this is very serious , '' said Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry . From the air , the thickest parts of the spill resembled rust-colored tentacles of various thickness . The air was thick with the acrid smell of petroleum . Amid several of the thicker streaks , four gray whales could be seen swimming in the oil . It was not clear if the whales were in danger . More than two dozen vessels moved about in the heart of the slick pulling oil-sopping booms . Earlier Wednesday , Louisiana State Wildlife and Fisheries Secretary Robert Barham told lawmakers that federal government projections show a `` high probability '' oil could reach the Pass a Loutre wildlife area Friday night , Breton Sound on Saturday and the Chandeleur Islands on Sunday . As the task force worked far offshore , local officials prepared for the worst in case the oil reaches land . In Plaquemines Parish , a sliver of Louisiana that juts into the Gulf and is home to Pass a Loutre , officials hoped to deploy a fleet of volunteers in fishing boats to spread booms that could block oil from entering inlets . `` We 've got oystermen and shrimpers who know this water better than anyone , '' said Plaquemines Paris President Billy Nungesser . `` Hopefully the Coast Guard will embrace the idea . '' But there was anxiety that the Gulf Coast was not prepared for the onslaught of oil . `` Our ability to deal with this would be like us having a foot of snow falling in Biloxi tomorrow , '' said Vincent Creel , a spokesman for the city government in Biloxi , Miss. `` We do n't have snow plows , and we 're not equipped to deal with this . '' The parish 's emergency manager planned to meet in Houma on Thursday with a Coast Guard official to discuss whether volunteers can help , Nungesser said . `` We do n't want to just sit by and hope this -LRB- oil -RRB- does n't come ashore , '' Nungesser said . The decision to burn some of the oil came after crews operating submersible robots failed to activate a shut-off device that would halt the flow of oil on the sea bottom 5,000 feet below . BP says work will begin as early as Thursday to drill a relief well to relieve pressure at the blowout site , but that could take months . Another option is a dome-like device to cover oil rising to the surface and pump it to container vessels , but that will take two weeks to put in place , BP said . Winds and currents in the Gulf have helped crews in recent days as they try to contain the leak . The immediate threat to sandy beaches in coastal Alabama and Mississippi has eased . But the spill has moved steadily toward the mouth of the Mississippi River and the wetland areas east of the river , home to hundreds of species of wildlife and near some rich oyster grounds . The cost of the disaster continues to rise and could easily top $ 1 billion . Industry officials say replacing the Deepwater Horizon , owned by Transocean Ltd. and operated by BP , would cost up to $ 700 million . BP has said its costs for containing the spill are running at $ 6 million a day . The company said it will spend $ 100 million to drill the relief well . The Coast Guard has not yet reported its expenses .

AFP April 27 : Weathered oil from a leaking pipeline that resulted the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig is seen in the Gulf of Mexico near Louisiana . NEW ORLEANS -- The U.S. Coast Guard says it is being very aggressive in its response to the oil spill off the Louisiana coast but at the same time is preparing for the worst case scenario of oil reaching the shore . Coast Guard Rear Adm. Sally Brice O'Hare said estimates are that oil could reach landfall in the Mississipi Delta region by late Friday . O'Hare spoke at a White House briefing on Thursday . President Obama is sending top officials from the EPA , and Departments of Homeland Security and Interior to help contain the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . Five times more oil a day than previously believed is spewing into the Gulf of Mexico from a blown-out well of a sunken drilling rig , the Coast Guard said . BP 's Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles also said more oil may be leaking from a Gulf of Mexico drilling site than first estimated . Speaking Thursday on NBC 's `` Today , '' Suttles said the leak is more than the 1,000 barrels of day that was originally estimated last week after a deepwater rig exploded and burned off the coast of Louisiana . He said it may be as much as a new estimate of 5,000 barrels a day that the government first provided late Wednesday . Suttles said BP Plc and government scientists have to estimate the flow based on what reaches the surface because there is no way to measure the oil pouring out on the seabed . A new leak was discovered in the pipes a mile below the ocean 's surface . The news came after crews tried a test burn on the massive spill to try to slow it from reaching the U.S. shoreline . Also , the Secretary of Homeland Security has briefed President Obama on this new information and the government has offered to have the Department of Defense help contain the spill and protect the U.S. shoreline and wildlife , she said . Meanwhile , crews late Wednesday afternoon did a test burn on the massive spill , which Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry noted was successful . BP had planned to continue the oil fires after the test , but as night fell , no more were lit . The burns were not expected to be done at night . No details about when more were planned were given during the news conference . Crews planned to use hand-held flares to set fire to sections of the massive spill . They turned to the plan after failing to stop the leak at the spot where a deepwater oil platform exploded and sank on April 20 . A 500-foot -LRB- 150-meter -RRB- boom was to be used to corral several thousand gallons of the thickest oil on the surface , which will then be towed to a more remote area , set on fire , and allowed to burn for about an hour . The decision to burn some of the oil came after crews operating submersible robots failed to activate a shut-off device that would halt the flow of oil on the sea bottom 5,000 feet -LRB- 1,500 meters -RRB- below . Greg Pollock , head of the oil spill division of the Texas General Land Office , which is providing equipment for crews in the Gulf , said he is not aware of a similar burn ever being done off the U.S. coast . The last time crews with his agency used fire booms to burn oil was a 1995 spill on the San Jacinto River . `` When you can get oil ignited , it is an absolutely effective way of getting rid of a huge percentage of the oil , '' he said . The oil has the consistency of thick roofing tar . When the flames go out , Pollock said , the material that is left resembles a hardened ball of tar that can be removed from the water with nets or skimmers . Authorities also said they expect minimal impact on sea turtles and marine mammals in the burn area . Officials had estimated about 42,000 gallons -LRB- 160,000 liters -RRB- of oil a day was leaking into the Gulf from the blown-out well drilled by the Deepwater Horizon oil rig . That would be closer to 210,000 gallons -LRB- 800,000 liters -RRB- a day with the new estimates . Eleven workers are missing and presumed dead and more than 100 escaped the blast , the cause of which has not been determined . A graphic posted by the Coast Guard and the industry task force fighting the slick showed it covering an area about 100 miles -LRB- 160 kilometers -RRB- long and 45 miles -LRB- 72 kilometers -RRB- across at its widest point . `` It 's premature to say this is catastrophic . I will say this is very serious , '' said Landry . From the air , the thickest parts of the spill resembled rust-colored tentacles of various thickness . The air was thick with the acrid smell of petroleum . Amid several of the thicker streaks , four gray whales could be seen swimming in the oil . It was not clear if the whales were in danger . More than two dozen vessels moved about in the heart of the slick pulling oil-sopping booms . In Plaquemines Parish , a sliver of Louisiana that juts into the Gulf and is home to Pass a Loutre , officials hoped to deploy a fleet of volunteers in fishing boats to spread booms that could block oil from entering inlets . BP says work will begin as early as Thursday to drill a relief well to relieve pressure at the blowout site , but that could take months . Another option is a dome-like device to cover oil rising to the surface and pump it to container vessels , but that will take two weeks to put in place , BP said . Winds and currents in the Gulf have helped crews in recent days as they try to contain the leak . The immediate threat to sandy beaches in coastal Alabama and Mississippi has eased . But the spill has moved steadily toward the mouth of the Mississippi River and the wetland areas east of the river , home to hundreds of species of wildlife and near some rich oyster grounds . The cost of the disaster continues to rise and could easily top $ 1 billion . Industry officials say replacing the Deepwater Horizon , owned by Transocean Ltd. and operated by BP , would cost up to $ 700 million . BP has said its costs for containing the spill are running at $ 6 million a day . The company said it will spend $ 100 million to drill the relief well . The Coast Guard has not yet reported its expenses . The Associated Press contributed to this report .

Fox News As a massive oil slick creeps ever closer to the Gulf Coast , officials in Louisiana , Alabama , Texas , Mississippi and Florida are bracing for the worst . The economic impact over miles of prime coast land has the potential to be catastrophic . Officials say the slick from last week 's offshore drilling rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico may have a devastating impact on one of the coastal states ' most precious commodities -- shrimp -- and the entire industry that surrounds it . And state officials acknowledge that the oil 's effect on travel and tourism to the area could be equally destructive . `` Common sense would tell us that if the shrimp and oyster beds are impacted , that could potentially affect one of the signature items for Louisiana -- our shrimp , '' Louisiana 's assistant secretary of tourism , Jim Hutchinson , told FoxNews.com . About 5,000 barrels of oil a day are coming up from the seabed after a BP-operated rig , the Deepwater Horizon , exploded and sank last week about 40 miles offshore , leaving 11 workers missing and presumed dead . Federal officials say the leading edge of the spill was expected to reach the Mississippi River delta by Thursday night . In an interview with FoxNews.com , Deborah Long , spokeswoman for the Southern Shrimp Alliance , said the oil could have a `` dramatic effect '' on the shrimp industry 's ability to stay in business . `` There 's a deep concern about the potential effects of the spill on the shrimp stocks , '' Long said , adding that the U.S. shrimp industry and BP have deployed booms and other resources as a precautionary measure to protect the shrimp , which commercial fishermen depend on to make a living . Long said that the spill 's impact on the industry depends on a `` number of variables , '' which she said `` are still unknowns at this point . '' The volume of the spill , as well as the outcome of the containment efforts , will be key in determining the damage that the oil slick will have on the country 's most fertile seafood grounds . The shrimp season begins in early May , as the shrimp move from estuaries out to sea , Long said . U.S. landings of shrimp were valued at $ 441.8 million in 2008 -- an increase of $ 9.1 million compared to 2007 . Louisiana leads the nation in its shrimp supply -- with 89 million pounds produced in 2008 -- followed by Texas , Alabama , Florida and Mississippi . Hutchinson said that while the effect on wildlife and the fragile ecosystem along the coastline remains the `` area of biggest and immediate concern , '' officials are hoping that the travel and tourism industries in the region will not also be devastated by the oil spill . The Gulf states play host to tourists from around the world , and industry officials acknowledge that the spill could have a massive economic impact . In states like Florida , where tourism is a $ 65.5 billion industry , and Alabama , which brings in $ 6 billion , officials are closely monitoring any changes in hotel bookings and travel plans . Mike Foster , vice president of marketing at the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau in Orange Beach , Ala. , said he spoke Wednesday with two major hotel and condominium partners and found few changes in reservations . `` There are very few cancellations '' at this time , he told FoxNews.com . Orange Beach , Ala. , saw about 1.3 million visitors from 2008 to 2009 , raking in $ 533 million in travel expenses , including food , lodging and recreation . Foster and Hutchinson both stressed that it is too early to speculate the impact , if any , of the oil slick on the travel and tourism industry . `` It 's a tragedy on so many different levels , '' Hutchinson said . `` As far as specific tourism concerns , none have been broached directly with me .

AP NEW ORLEANS -- An oil spill that threatened to eclipse even the Exxon Valdez disaster spread out of control and drifted inexorably toward the Gulf Coast on Thursday as fishermen rushed to scoop up shrimp and crews spread floating barriers around marshes . The spill was both much bigger and closer than imagined -- five times larger than first estimated , with the leading edge just three miles from the Louisiana shore . Authorities said it could reach the Mississippi River delta by Thursday night . `` It is of grave concern , '' David Kennedy of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , told The Associated Press . `` I am frightened . This is a very , very big thing . And the efforts that are going to be required to do anything about it , especially if it continues on , are just mind-boggling . '' The oil slick could become America 's worst environmental disaster in decades , threatening hundreds of species of fish , birds and other wildlife along the Gulf Coast , one of the world 's richest seafood grounds , teeming with shrimp , oysters and other marine life . The leak from the ocean floor proved to be far bigger than initially reported , contributing to a growing sense among many in Louisiana that the government failed them again , just as it did during Hurricane Katrina . President Barack Obama dispatched Cabinet officials to deal with the crisis . Cade Thomas , a fishing guide in Venice , worried that his livelihood will be destroyed . He said he did not know whether to blame the Coast Guard , the federal government or oil company BP PLC. `` They lied to us . They came out and said it was leaking 1,000 barrels when I think they knew it was more . And they were n't proactive , '' he said . `` As soon as it blew up , they should have started wrapping it with booms . '' The Coast Guard worked with BP , which operated the oil rig that exploded and sank last week , to deploy floating booms , skimmers and chemical dispersants , and set controlled fires to burn the oil off the water 's surface . The Coast Guard urged the company to formally request more resources from the Defense Department . A BP executive said the corporation would `` take help from anyone . '' Government officials said the blown-out well 40 miles -LRB- 60 kilometers -RRB- offshore is spewing five times as much oil into the water as originally estimated -- about 5,000 barrels , or 200,000 gallons , a day . At that rate , the spill could easily eclipse the worst oil spill in U.S. history -- the 11 million gallons that leaked from the grounded tanker Exxon Valdez in Alaska 's Prince William Sound in 1989 -- in the three months it could take to drill a relief well and plug the gushing well 5,000 feet underwater on the sea floor . Ultimately , the spill could grow much larger than the Valdez because Gulf of Mexico wells typically hold many times more oil than a single tanker . Doug Suttles , chief operating officer for BP Exploration and Production , had initially disputed the government 's larger estimate . But he later acknowledged on NBC 's `` Today '' show that the leak may be as bad as federal officials say . He said there was no way to measure the flow at the seabed , so estimates have to come from how much oil rises to the surface . Mike Brewer , 40 , who lost his oil spill response company in the devastation of Hurricane Katrina nearly five years ago , said the area was accustomed to the occasional minor spill . But he feared the scale of the escaping oil was beyond the capacity of existing resources . `` You 're pumping out a massive amount of oil . There is no way to stop it , '' he said . An emergency shrimping season was opened to allow shrimpers to scoop up their catch before it is fouled by oil . Cannons were to be used to scare off birds . And shrimpers were being lined up to use their boats as makeshift skimmers in the shallows . This murky water and the oysters in it have provided a livelihood for three generations of Frank and Mitch Jurisich 's family in Louisiana . Now , on the open water just beyond the marshes , they can smell the oil that threatens everything they know and love . `` Just smelling it , it puts more of a sense of urgency , a sense of fear , '' Frank Jurisich said . The brothers hope to get all the oysters they can sell before the oil washes ashore . They filled more than 100 burlap sacks Thursday and stopped to eat some oysters . `` This might be our last day , '' Mitch Jurisich said . Without the fishing industry , Frank Jurisich said the family `` would be lost . This is who we are and what we do . '' Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency Thursday so officials could begin preparing for the oil 's impact . He said at least 10 wildlife management areas and refuges in his state and neighboring Mississippi are in the oil plume 's path . The declaration also noted that billions of dollars have been invested in coastal restoration projects that may be at risk . As dawn broke Thursday in the oil industry hub of Venice , about 75 miles from New Orleans and not far from the mouth of the Mississippi River , crews loaded an orange oil boom aboard a supply boat at Bud 's Boat Launch . There , local officials expressed frustration with the pace of the government 's response and the communication they were getting from the Coast Guard and BP officials . `` We 're not doing everything we can do , '' said Billy Nungesser , president of Plaquemines Parish , which straddles the Mississippi River at the tip of Louisiana . Tension was growing in towns like Port Sulphur and Empire along Louisiana Highway 23 , which runs south of New Orleans along the Mississippi River into prime oyster and shrimping waters . Companies like Chevron and ConocoPhillips have facilities nearby , and some residents are hesitant to criticize BP or the federal government , knowing the oil industry is as much a staple here as fishing . `` I do n't think there 's a lot of blame going around here . People are just concerned about their livelihoods , '' said Sullivan Vullo , who owns La Casa Cafe in Port Sulphur . A federal class-action lawsuit was filed late Wednesday on behalf of two commercial shrimpers from Louisiana , Acy J. Cooper Jr. and Ronnie Louis Anderson . The suit seeks at least $ 5 million in compensatory damages plus an unspecified amount of punitive damages against Transocean , BP , Halliburton Energy Services Inc. and Cameron International Corp. . In Buras , Louisiana , where Hurricane Katrina made landfall in 2005 , the owner of the Black Velvet Oyster Bar & Grill could n't keep his eyes off the television . News and weather shows were making projections that oil would soon inundate the coastal wetlands where his family has worked since the 1860s . It was as though a hurricane was approaching , maybe worse . `` A hurricane is like closing your bank account for a few days , but this here has the capacity to destroy our bank accounts , '' said Byron Marinovitch , 47 . `` We 're really disgusted , '' he added . `` We do n't believe anything coming out of BP 's mouth . '' Signs of the 2005 hurricane are still apparent here : There are schools , homes , churches and restaurants operating out of trailers , and across from Marinovitch 's bar is a wood frame house abandoned since the storm . A fleet of boats working under an oil industry consortium has been using booms to corral and then skim oil from the surface . The Coast Guard abandoned a plan Wednesday to set fire to the leaking oil after sea conditions deteriorated . The attempt to burn some of the oil came after crews operating submersible robots failed to activate a shut-off device that would halt the flow of oil . Adm. Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , was briefed Thursday on the issue , said his spokesman , Capt. John Kirby . But Kirby said the Defense Department has received no request for help , nor is it doing any detailed planning for any mission on the oil spill . Obama dispatched Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lisa Jackson to help with the spill . The president said the White House would use `` every single available resource '' to respond . Obama has directed officials to aggressively confront the spill , but the cost of the cleanup will fall on BP , White House spokesman Nick Shapiro said .

The White House put a hold on any new offshore oil projects until safeguards are in place to prevent rig explosions like the one that caused the spill . Boats patrolled coastal marshes early Friday looking for areas where the oil has flowed in , the Coast Guard said , and the state of Louisiana diverted thousands of gallons of fresh water from the Mississippi River to try to flush out the wetlands , though that effort was being hampered by wind . The National Weather Service predicted winds , high tides and waves through Sunday that could push oil deep into the inlets , ponds and lakes that line the boot of southeastern Louisiana . Seas of 6 to 7 feet were pushing tides several feet above normal toward the coast , compounded by thunderstorms expected in the area Friday . An animal rescue operation at Fort Jackson , about 70 miles southeast of New Orleans , had its first patient Friday , a young northern gannett found offshore . The bird is normally white with a yellow head and long , pointed beak but was covered in thick , black oil . Workers with Delaware-based Tri-State Bird Rescue and Research used Dawn blue dishwashing soap to scrub it . Volunteers started arriving in Venice , La. , though there was n't much for them to do because the weather was so bad . About two dozen workers in hard hats and lifejackets were stuck on shore at a marina , lounging on small work boats , some laden with boom , ready to go to work . Some smoked cigarettes and spat sunflower seeds as they waited for assignments . Volunteer Valerie Gonsoulin , a 51-year-old kayaker from Lafayette who wore an `` America 's Wetlands '' hat , said she hoped to help spread containment booms to hold back the oil . `` I go out in the marshes three times a week . It 's my peace and serenity , '' she said . `` I 'm horrified . ... I 've been sitting here watching that NASA image grow and it grows . I knew it would hit every place I fish and love . '' President Barack Obama on Friday directed that no new offshore oil drilling leases be issued unless rigs have new safeguards . Obama ordered Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to report within 30 days on what new technologies are needed . `` We are making sure any leases going forward have those safeguards , '' said Obama at a White House Rose Garden event . He recently lifted a drilling moratorium for many offshore areas , including the Atlantic and Gulf . Meanwhile , the Pentagon approved the use of two Air Force planes to dump chemicals on the oil spill , which civilian planes have already been doing . The Navy also sent equipment for the cleanup , and Pentagon officials were talking with the Department of Homeland Security to figure out what other help the military could give . Obama reassured Gulf Coast communities that the federal government is `` fully prepared '' to meet its responsibilities to them as the spill gets worse . The leak from a blown-out well a mile underwater is five times bigger than first believed . More than 200,000 gallons of oil a day are spewing from the site of the rig , which was operated by BP and owned by Transocean Ltd. . It sank two days after the explosion . The Coast Guard is working with BP to deploy floating booms , skimmers and chemical dispersants , and has set controlled fires to burn the oil off the water 's surface . Faint fingers of oily sheen began reaching the Mississippi River delta late Thursday , lapping the Louisiana shoreline in long , thin lines . Thicker oil was farther offshore . Officials have said they would do everything to keep the Mississippi River open to traffic . The Coast Guard defended the federal response so far . Asked on all three network television morning shows Friday whether the government has done enough to push oil company BP PLC to plug the underwater leak and protect the coast , Coast Guard Rear Adm. Sally Brice-O'Hara said the response led by the Coast Guard has been rapid , sustained and has adapted as the threat grew . Brice-O'Hara was also asked on ABC 's '' Good Morning America '' about the possibility of dispersing chemicals about a mile beneath the surface to break up oil . She replied : `` That is a technology that is in new stages . We are working closely with our scientific support from NOAA , and there will be careful scrutiny . But if it has applicability , which we think it does , we want to get that in place very quickly . '' The oil slick could become the nation 's worst environmental disaster in decades , threatening to eclipse even the worst oil spill in U.S. history , the Exxon Valdez , the grounded tanker that leaked 11 million gallons in Alaska 's Prince William Sound in 1989 . The sheen measured about 70 miles by 130 miles as of Thursday , and officials expected to update that figure Friday . It imperils hundreds of species of fish , birds and other wildlife along the Gulf Coast , one of the world 's richest seafood grounds , teeming with shrimp , oysters and other marine life . `` This is a very , very big thing , '' David Kennedy , of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , told The Associated Press about the spill . `` And the efforts that are going to be required to do anything about it , especially if it continues on , are just mind-boggling . '' Volunteers were preparing to help wildlife that might be affected . Oil clumps seabirds ' feathers , leaving them without insulation -- and when they preen , they swallow it . Prolonged contact with the skin can cause burns , said Nils Warnock , a spill recovery supervisor with the California Oiled Wildlife Care Network at the University of California-Davis . Oil swallowed by animals can cause anemia , hemorrhaging and other problems , said Jay Holcomb , executive director of the International Bird Rescue Research Center in California . BP shares continued falling early Friday . Shares were down 2 percent in early trading on the London Stock Exchange , a day after dropping 7 percent in London . In New York on Thursday , BP shares fell $ 4.78 to close at $ 52.56 , taking the fall in the company 's market value to about $ 25 billion since the explosion . BP has requested more resources from the Defense Department , especially underwater equipment that might be better than what is commercially available . A BP executive said the corporation would `` take help from anyone . '' That includes fishermen who could be hired to help deploy containment boom . The Coast Guard and BP have at least six remotely operated vehicles working to close an underwater valve meant to keep the oil from reaching the surface . Meanwhile , crews are drilling a relief well that will essentially suck the oil away from the original well , decreasing the pressure and slowing the leak , though that could take up to three months . Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency and asked the federal government if he could call up 6,000 National Guard troops to help . Florida Gov. Charlie Crist declared a state of emergency for the state 's Panhandle .

ESA As oil from the gigantic spill in the Gulf of Mexico reaches U.S. beaches , scientists warn that the potential long-term effects of the massive disaster are hard to gauge -- but potentially disastrous for some local species . The Exxon Valdez disaster is a similar and telling example . Among the worst oil spills ever , the tanker dumped more than 10 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska 's Prince William Sound in March 1989 . Two decades later , there are still an estimated 21,000 gallons of that oil just below the surface . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently dug 9,000 holes over hundreds of miles of shoreline to ascertain just how much oil was still hanging around . NOAA found Valdez oil in about half of those holes . `` Despite spending $ 2 billion dollars and using every known clean-up method there was , they recovered 8 percent of the spilled Exxon Valdez oil , '' Jeffrey Short , Pacific science director for Washington , D.C. conservation organization Oceana told LiveScience . `` That is typical of these exercises when you have a large marine oil spill . You 're doing really great if you -LRB- get -RRB- 20 percent . '' Yet despite the lingering oil , many local species recovered : 10 recovered completely , 19 are still recovering , and only two never came back , including the local herring . Scientists at the University of California-Davis , which manages California 's Oiled Wildlife Care Network , point out that should the oil hit shore , it could have a serious , long-term impact on marine seabirds , such as brown pelicans . The Mississippi Flyway is a critical thoroughfare for migratory birds , and is now experiencing its peak migratory period , said Michael Ziccardi , an associate professor of clinical wildlife health at the UC Davis Wildlife Health Center and director of the Oiled Wildlife Care Network . Data is limited on the long term effects of oil on wildlife , but Ziccardi pointed out that after the Valdez disaster , two killer whale pods lost approximately 40 percent of their numbers . Since that time , the reproductive capacity of these pods has been reduced by the loss of females , and only about half of newborn calves are surviving . George Crozier , executive director of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab , worried about the potential long term effect on coastal marsh lands as well . `` If they let it come into the passes , and if they do n't protect the marshes , it will cause long-term economic loss for years , because there 's no way to clean it , '' he said . `` They can talk about spraying micro-organisms on the marsh that may help it recover a little faster , but you ca n't spray grass beds and oyster reefs . '' `` It 's an accepted fact that the marshes of Louisiana , Mississippi and Alabama -- the Fertile Crescent -- produce 90 percent of the seafood in the Gulf of Mexico , '' Crozier told the Mississippi Press . `` If you were to pave that over with an oil spill , you 'd see a dramatic drop in seafood recruitment , possibly for years to come . '' As authorities and BP work frantically to clear up the oil and prevent further from leaking , the question of how long it will remain in the environment becomes a factor in determining the oil 's long-term effect . Oil that does n't get skimmed up or burned off disperses naturally , according to U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer 3rd Class Cory Mendenhall . He told LiveScience that `` It eventually breaks up and evaporates . There are different ways , but we 're told it just kind of goes away . '' The rate of dispersal depends on the type of oil . Initial reports suggested the oil leaking into the Gulf was standard Louisiana crude , which biodegrades pretty well , according to Edward Overton , a professor emeritus of environmental sciences at Louisiana State University . But sample testing revealed that the leaking oil was different , with a very high concentration of components that do n't degrade easily , called asphaltenes .

AP MOUTH OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER -- British Petroleum downplayed the possibility of a catastrophic accident at an offshore rig that exploded , causing the worst U.S. spill in decades along the Gulf coast and endangering shoreline habitat . In its 52-page exploration plan and environmental impact analysis for the well , BP suggested it was unlikely , or virtually impossible , for an accident to occur that would lead to a giant crude oil spill and serious damage to beaches , fish , mammals and fisheries . And while the company conceded that a spill would impact beaches , wildlife refuges and wilderness areas , it argued that `` due to the distance to shore -LRB- 48 miles -RRB- and the response capabilities that would be implemented , no significant adverse impacts are expected . '' At least 1.6 million gallons of oil have spilled so far , according to Coast Guard estimates . One expert said Friday the volume of oil leaking from the well could actually be much higher than that and that even more may escape if the remaining drill equipment erodes further . `` Clearly , the sort of occurrence that we 've seen on the Deepwater Horizon is clearly unprecedented , '' BP spokesman David Nicholas told The Associated Press on Friday . `` It 's something that we have not experienced before ... a blowout at this depth . '' Robert Wiygul , an Ocean Springs , Miss.-based environmental lawyer and board member for the Gulf Restoration Network , said he does n't see anything in the document that suggests BP addressed the kind of technology needed to control a spill at that depth of water . `` The point is , if you 're going to be drilling in 5,000 feet of water for oil , you should have the ability to control what you 're doing , '' he said . Amid increased fingerpointing Friday , high winds and choppy seas frustrated efforts to hold back the giant oil spill seeping into Louisiana 's rich fishing grounds and nesting areas , while the government desperately cast about for new ideas for dealing with the growing environmental crisis . President Barack Obama halted any new offshore drilling projects unless rigs have new safeguards to prevent another disaster . The seas were too rough and the winds too strong Friday to burn off the oil , suck it up effectively with skimmer vessels , or hold it in check with the miles of orange and yellow inflatable booms strung along the coast . The floating barriers broke loose in the choppy water , and waves sent oily water lapping over them . `` It just ca n't take the wave action , '' said Billy Nungesser , president of Louisiana 's Plaquemines Parish . The spill -- a slick more than 130 miles long and 70 miles wide -- threatens hundreds of species of wildlife , including birds , dolphins and the fish , shrimp , oysters and crabs that make the Gulf Coast one of the nation 's most abundant sources of seafood . Louisiana closed some fishing grounds and oyster beds because of the risk of oil contamination . Many of the more than two dozen lawsuits filed in the wake of the explosion claim it was caused when workers for oil services contractor Halliburton Inc. improperly capped the well -- a process known as cementing . According to a 2007 study by the federal Minerals Management Service , which examined the 39 rig blowouts in the Gulf of Mexico between 1992 and 2006 , cementing was a contributing factor in 18 of the incidents . In all the cases , gas seepage occurred during or after cementing of the well casing , the MMS said . While the amount of oil in the Gulf already threatened to make it the worst U.S. oil disaster since the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska in 1989 , one expert emphasized that it was impossible to know just how much oil had already escaped into the Gulf and that it could be much more than what BP and the Coast Guard have said . Even at current estimates , the spill could surpass that of the Exxon Valdez supertanker -- which leaked 11 million gallons -- in just two months . Ian D. MacDonald , an oceanography professor at Florida State University , said estimates from both Coast Guard charts and satellite images indicate that 8 million to 9 million gallons had spilled by April 28 . `` I hope I 'm wrong . I hope there 's less oil out there than that . But that 's what I get when I apply the numbers , '' he said . Coast Guard Admiral Mary Landry brushed off a question during a news conference about estimates that suggested the rate of the leak was five times larger than official estimates . `` I would caution you not to get fixated on an estimate of how much is out there , '' Landry said . `` The most important thing is from Day One we stood corralling resources from a worst-case scenario working back . '' Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer for exploration and production , said it 's impossible to measure the flow . But he said remote cameras show the rate does n't appear to have changed since the leak was discovered . `` This is highly imprecise , highly imprecise , '' Suttles said . `` We continue to respond to a much more significant case so that we 're prepared for that in the eventuality that the rate is higher . '' As of Friday , only a sheen of oil from the edges of the slick was washing up at Venice , La. , and other extreme southeastern portions of Louisiana . But several miles out , the normally blue-green gulf waters were dotted with sticky , pea - to quarter-sized brown beads with the consistency of tar . High seas were in the forecast through Sunday and could push oil deep into the inlets , ponds , creeks and lakes that line the boot of southeastern Louisiana . With the wind blowing from the south , the mess could reach the Mississippi , Alabama and Florida coasts by Monday . In Louisiana , officials opened gates in the Mississippi River hoping a flood of fresh water would drive oil away from the coast . But winds thwarted that plan , too . For days , crews have struggled without success to activate the well 's underwater shutoff valve using remotely operated vehicles . They are also drilling a relief well in hopes of injecting mud and concrete to seal off the leak , but that could take three months . U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said he has pressed BP to work more efficiently to clean the spill and has pledged that `` those responsible will be held accountable . '' President Barack Obama has ordered Salazar to report to him within 30 days on what new technology is needed to tighten safeguards against deepwater drilling spills . With the government and BP running out of options , Salazar has invited other companies to bring their expertise to the table . BP likewise sought ideas from some of its rivals and planned to use at least one of them Friday -- applying chemicals underwater to break up the oil before it reaches the surface . That has never been attempted at such depths . Animal rescue operations have ramped up , including the one at Fort Jackson , about 70 miles southeast of New Orleans . That rescue crew had its first patient Friday , a bird covered in thick , black oil . The bird , a young northern gannet found offshore , is normally white with a yellow head . And volunteers have converged on the coast to offer help . Valerie Gonsoulin , a 51-year-old kayaker from Lafayette who wore an `` America 's Wetlands '' hat , said she hoped to help spread containment booms . `` I go out in the marshes three times a week . It 's my peace and serenity , '' she said . `` I 'm horrified . I 've been sitting here watching that NASA image grow , and it grows . I knew it would hit every place I fish and love .

In the aftermath of the blast , an uncapped underwater oil well continues to leak an estimated 200,000 gallons of oil into the Gulf every day -- creating a monstrous oil slick that made landfall in Louisiana 's wetlands Thursday night and could become the nation 's worst environmental disaster in decades . President Obama said Friday that his administration is doing `` everything possible '' to respond to the explosion of the BP PLC-operated rig . A top adviser to Obama -- who last month lifted a drilling moratorium for many offshore areas , including the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico -- said no new drilling will be authorized until the cause of the explosion , which killed 11 people , is determined . Obama also ordered Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to report within 30 days on what new technologies will be needed to prevent future oil spills . The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of the Interior are conducting a joint investigation into the explosion . `` Investigations are ongoing and everything will be examined , '' a DOI official told FoxNews.com in an e-mail Friday when asked if any evidence points to acts of criminality or negligence . `` It 's obviously too early to know . '' Salazar has ordered immediate inspections of all 30 deep-water drilling rigs and 47 platforms in the Gulf of Mexico . `` This operation is underway and will be targeted inspections ensuring that -LRB- blowout preventer -RRB- tests have been completed and those records are available for inspection , '' the e-mail continued . `` We are also verifying that emergency well control exercises are taking place . -LRB- U.S. Minerals Management Services -RRB- inspectors should complete these inspections within seven days . Once drilling rig inspections are complete , we will start immediately on inspecting all deep-water production platforms . '' Along with Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson , Salazar was traveling to the Gulf Coast on Friday to inspect ongoing operations and to evaluate the environmental impact of the April 20 explosion . The officials will conduct an aerial tour of the affected area and meet with federal , state and local officials leading the response effort . DHS officials declined to comment on the cause of the blast and referred to DOI 's statement . But Elmer Danenberger , who retired in January as the head of offshore regulatory affairs for the U.S. Minerals Management Service , said the investigation into one of the biggest oil spills in U.S. history will center around what happened just before the blast , as workers finished pumping cement between the well pipe and a hole bored into the ocean floor . The process is intended to prevent oil and natural gas from escaping , he said . `` That 's what -LRB- investigators -RRB- said the operation was just prior to the blast , '' Danenberger said . `` Now , how much prior we do n't know . Investigators will be all over those issues . '' Danenberger said it appears `` to be the consensus '' among drilling experts that a poor cementing job probably led to the blowout -- when oil and natural gas exit a well with extreme force . `` They 're going to be focusing on the root cause , how the oil and gas were able to enter the -LRB- well -RRB- that should 've been secured , '' he said . `` That will be the primary focus , how the influx got in to the -LRB- well -RRB- . '' Cementing operations could benefit from additional inspection standards , Danenberger said , adding that cementing incidents remain too common . According to a 2007 study by three U.S. Minerals Management Service officials , cementing was a factor in 18 of 39 well blowouts in the Gulf during a 14-year period , making it the single largest factor , the Wall Street Journal reported . Equipment failure and pipe failure were the next leading factors . `` There has been a history of gas influxes during cementing operations , so that is an area of concern , but nothing is confirmed , '' Danenberger said . `` But perhaps additional standards are necessary for cementing operations . '' Meanwhile , critics of British Petroleum say that cost-cutting measures by the London-based oil giant helped to contribute to the rig explosion . Tom Bower , author of the 2009 book `` The Squeeze , Oil , Money and Greed in the 21st Century , '' told Fox News that British Petroleum 's economizing led to a lack of engineers , an overdependence on outsourcing and a lack of supervisors to keep an eye on subcontractors . Transocean Ltd. , which operated the rig on lease from BP , has said Halliburton Co. had finished cementing the 18,000-foot well shortly before the explosion . BP has said while it assumes responsibility for the incident , the company is still waiting for an investigation to show Transocean 's role in the matter . In a statement released late Thursday , BP Group Chief Executive Tony Hayward said the company was increasing cleaning efforts along the shorelines of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . In addition to 180,000 feet of boom already in the coastal waters , an additional 300,000 feet is staged or in the process of being deployed . `` We are doing absolutely everything in our power to eliminate the source of the leak and contain the environmental impact of the spill , '' Heyward 's statement read . `` We are determined to fight this spill on all fronts , in the deep waters of the Gulf , in the shallow waters and , should it be necessary , on the shore . '' In a statement released Friday , Halliburton confirmed it performed a variety of services on the rig and had four employees stationed there at the time of the accident . `` Halliburton had completed the cementing of the final production casing string in accordance with the well design approximately 20 hours prior to the incident , '' the statement read . `` The cement slurry design was consistent with that utilized in other similar applications .

AP VENICE , La. -- The surface area of a catastrophic Gulf of Mexico oil spill quickly tripled in size amid growing fears among experts that the slick could become vastly more devastating than it seemed just two days ago . The newly named federal point man for the oil spill said it was impossible to pinpoint how much oil is leaking from a ruptured underwater well . Commandant Adm. Thad Allen , head of the U.S. Coast Guard , told a conference call Saturday that `` any exact estimation of what 's flowing out of those pipes down there is impossible '' because the site is about a mile underwater . Frustrated fishermen eager to help contain the spill had to keep their boats idle as another day of rough seas kept crews away from the slick , and President Barack Obama planned a Sunday trip to the Gulf Coast . Documents also emerged showing BP PLC downplayed the possibility of a catastrophic accident at the offshore rig that exploded . BP operated the rig , which was owned by Transocean Ltd. . How far the spill will reach is unknown , but the sheen already has reached into precious shoreline habitat and remains unstopped , raising fears that the ruptured well could be pouring more oil into the gulf than estimated . The Coast Guard has estimated that about 200,000 gallons of oil are spewing out each day -- which would mean 1.6 million gallons of oil have spilled since the April 20 explosion that killed 11 workers . The environmental mess could eclipse the Exxon Valdez disaster , when an oil tanker spilled 11 million gallons off Alaska 's shores in 1989 . The slick nearly tripled in just a day or so , growing from a spill the size of Rhode Island to something closer to the size of Puerto Rico , according to images collected from mostly European satellites and analyzed by the University of Miami . On Thursday , the size of the slick was about 1,150 square miles , but by Friday 's end it was in the range of 3,850 square miles , said Hans Graber , executive director of the university 's Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing . That suggests the oil has started spilling from the well more quickly , Graber said . `` The spill and the spreading is getting so much faster and expanding much quicker than they estimated , '' Graber told The Associated Press on Saturday . Louisiana State University professor Ed Overton , who heads a federal chemical hazard assessment team for oil spills , cautioned that the satellite imagery could be deceiving . He said satellites ca n't measure the thickness of the sheen and makes it difficult to judge how much oil is on the water . Another issue is that the oil slicks are not one giant uniform spill the size of an island . Instead , they are `` little globs of oil in an area of big water , '' Overton said . Experts also cautioned that if the spill continues growing unchecked , sea currents could suck the sheen down past the Florida Keys and then up the Eastern Seaboard . The Florida Keys are home to the only living coral barrier reef in North America , and the third largest coral barrier reef in the world . About 84 percent of the nation 's coral reefs are located in Florida , where hundreds of marine species live , breed and spawn . `` If it gets into the Keys , that would be devastating , '' said Duke University biologist Larry Crowder . Ian R. MacDonald , an oceanography professor at Florida State University , said his examination of Coast Guard charts and satellite images indicated that 8 million to 9 million gallons had already spilled by April 28 . Alabama 's governor said his state was preparing for a worst-case scenario of 150,000 barrels , or more than 6 million gallons per day . At that rate the spill would amount to a Valdez-sized spill every two days , and the situation could last for months . `` I hope they can cap this and we talk about ` remember back when , '' ' Gov. Bob Riley said late Friday , `` but we are taking that worst-case and building barriers against it . '' However , officials with the Coast Guard brushed off such fears and said the estimates were imprecise . BP suggested in a 2009 exploration plan and environmental impact analysis for the well that an accident leading to a giant crude oil spill -- and serious damage to beaches , fish and mammals -- was unlikely , or virtually impossible . The plan for the Deepwater Horizon well , filed with the federal Minerals Management Service , said repeatedly that it was `` unlikely that an accidental surface or subsurface oil spill would occur from the proposed activities . '' The company conceded a spill would impact beaches , wildlife refuges and wilderness areas , but argued that `` due to the distance to shore -LRB- 48 miles -RRB- and the response capabilities that would be implemented , no significant adverse impacts are expected . '' The spill -- a slick more than 130 miles long and 70 miles wide -- threatens hundreds of species of wildlife , including birds , dolphins , and the fish , shrimp , oysters and crabs that make the Gulf Coast one of the nation 's most abundant sources of seafood . Although the cause of the explosion was under investigation , many of the more than two dozen lawsuits filed in the wake of the explosion claim it was caused when workers for oil services contractor Halliburton Inc. improperly capped the well -- a process known as cementing . The Coast Guard said Saturday it had shut down two offshore platforms and evacuated one of them near the spill as a safety precaution . A sheen of oil from the edges of the slick was washing up at Venice , La. , and other extreme southeastern portions of Louisiana . Animal rescue operations ramped up as crews found the first oiled bird offshore . Several miles out , the normally blue-green gulf waters were dotted with sticky , pea - to quarter-sized brown beads the consistency of tar . High seas were forecast through Sunday and could push oil deep into the inlets , ponds , creeks and lakes that line the boot of southeastern Louisiana . With the wind blowing from the south , the mess could reach the Mississippi , Alabama and Florida coasts by Monday . Amid increased fingerpointing , the government desperately cast about for new ideas for dealing with the growing environmental crisis . Obama halted any new offshore drilling projects unless rigs have new safeguards to prevent another disaster . Officials have said stemming the flow of oil is their top priority , but the seas have been too rough and the winds too strong to burn off the oil , suck it up effectively with skimmer vessels , or hold it in check with the miles of orange and yellow inflatable booms strung along the coast . The floating barriers broke loose in the choppy water , and waves sent oily water lapping over them . BP also sought ideas from some of its rivals and was using at least one of them Friday -- applying chemicals underwater to break up the oil before it reaches the surface . That had never before been attempted at such depths . BP and federal authorities said the dispersant was released overnight at the site of the leak , nearly 5,000 feet underwater , and they were evaluating the effort Saturday . Many of the oil-cleaning boats remained tied to the docks Saturday in Venice , partly because of the weather . However , charter boat captain Eddie Cerise said he was just awaiting instructions from BP so he could help with containment . He said he attended a safety class , though he had hoped for more practical information -- like what to do if oil gets into his boat -- than what he was taught . `` Basically they say if you walk up on an alligator , do n't kick it , if you see something you do n't recognize , do n't do it , '' he said . The weather also was keeping skimmers and other larger vessels stuck in harbor , said Coast Guard Petty Officer 1st Class David Mosley , a spokesman for a command center in Robert , La. `` Waves are going anywhere from 5 feet to 8 feet high and getting bigger , '' he said . `` It definitely makes it more difficult .

AP WASHINGTON -- What makes an oil spill really bad ? Most of the ingredients for it are now blending in the Gulf of Mexico . Experts tick off the essentials : A relentless flow of oil from under the sea ; a type of crude that mixes easily with water ; a resultant gooey mixture that is hard to burn and even harder to clean ; water that 's home to vulnerable spawning grounds for new life ; and a coastline with difficult-to-scrub marshlands . Gulf Coast experts have always talked about `` the potential for a bad one , '' said Wes Tunnell , coastal ecology and oil spill expert at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi . `` And this is the bad one . This is just a biggie that finally happened . '' It has n't quite become a total disaster yet . But it 's hard to imagine it not being devastating , said Ed Overton , who heads a federal chemical hazard assessment team for oil spills . The Louisiana State University professor has been testing samples of the spilled crude . He compared what 's brewing to another all-too-familiar Gulf Coast threat : `` This has got all the characteristics of a Category 5 hurricane . '' If conditions do n't change quickly , devastation of the highest magnitude is headed for somewhere along the coast , said Overton , who works with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . More than 200,000 gallons of oil a day are spewing from the blown-out well at the site of BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig , which exploded April 20 and sank two days later . Crews are using at least six remotely operated vehicles to try to shut off an underwater valve , but so far they 've been unsuccessful . Meanwhile , high winds and waves are pushing oily water over the booms meant to contain it . Besides BP , a slew of federal and state agencies are scrambling to minimize the onslaught of damage . Experts in oil spills have drills every few years to practice their response for spills of `` national significance . '' One of those practice runs took place just last month in Maine . The Gulf of Mexico leak is a `` combination of all the bad things happening '' and makes it far worse than any disaster imagined in the drills , said Nancy Kinner , director of the Coastal Response Research Center at the University of New Hampshire . `` This is relentless , '' Kinner said . Most Americans think of Exxon Valdez when it comes to spills . But the potential and likelihood here `` is well beyond that , '' said University of Rhode Island ocean engineering professor Malcolm Spaulding . Because the Deepwater Horizon well has not been capped and may flow for months more , it should be compared to a bigger more dangerous one from a well explosion in 1979 , said Tunnell . That was Ixtoc 1 , off the coast of Mexico . It was the worst peacetime oil spill on record . The current spill `` is kind of a worst case scenario , '' Tunnell said . What makes this spill relentless and most similar to Ixtoc 1 is that it 's an active well that keeps flowing . The Exxon Valdez was a tanker with a limited supply of oil . The rig 40 miles from the Gulf Coast may leak for months before a relief well can be drilled to stop the flow , Kinner said . And LSU 's Overton said : `` I 'm not very optimistic that they 'll be drilling a relief well in three months . '' The type of oil involved is also a major problem . While most of the oil drilled off Louisiana is a lighter crude , this is n't . It 's a heavier blend because it comes from deep under the ocean surface , Overton said . `` If I had to pick a bad oil , I 'd put this right up there . The only thing that 's not bad about this is that it does n't have a lot of sulfur in it and the high sulfur really smells bad . '' The first analysis of oil spill samples showed it contains asphalt-like substances that make a major sticky mess , he said . This is because the oil is older than most oil in the region and is very dense . This oil also emulsifies well , Overton said . Emulsification is when oil and water mix thoroughly together , like a shampoo , which is mostly water , said Penn State engineering professor Anil Kulkarni . It `` makes a thick gooey chocolate mousse type of mix , '' Kulkarni said . And once it becomes that kind of mix , it no longer evaporates as quickly as regular oil , does n't rinse off as easily , ca n't be eaten by oil-munching microbes as easily , and does n't burn as well , experts said . That type of mixture essentially removes all the best oil clean-up weapons , Overton and others said . Under better circumstances , with calmer winds and water , the oil might have a chance of rising without immediately emulsifying , but that 's not happening here , Kulkarni said . It 's pretty much mixed by the time it gets to the surface . The wind and waves are also pushing the oil directly toward some of the most sensitive coastal areas : the marshlands of Louisiana and surrounding states . And there are three types of beaches : sandy , rocky and marshy . Sandy beaches , like those in Florida , are the easiest to clean , Overton said . By far the hardest are marshlands and that 's where the oil is heading first . Marshes are so delicate that just trying to clean them causes damage , Kinner said . Once the oily mess penetrates , grasses must be cut . But it also penetrates the soil and that is extremely difficult to get out , she said . The normal bacteria that eats oil needs oxygen to work , and in the soils of the marsh , there 's not enough oxygen for that process , she said . It 's also the time of year in the Gulf of Mexico when fish spawn , plankton bloom and the delicate ecosystem is at a vulnerable stage . Hurricane season is fast approaching in June and experts are sure the oil will still be flowing by then . Though it might seem counterintuitive , a big storm could help by dispersing and diluting the worst of the oil , Overton said . `` A hurricane is Mother Nature 's vacuum cleaner , '' Overton said . Normally it cleans things up . But that 's not a solution with a continuing spill .

VENICE , Louisiana -- BP 's chairman defended his company 's safety record and said Sunday that `` a failed piece of equipment '' was to blame for a massive oil spill along the Gulf Coast , where President Barack Obama was headed for a firsthand update on the slick creeping toward American shores . BP PLC chairman Lamar McKay told ABC 's `` This Week '' that he ca n't say when the well a mile -LRB- 1.6 kilometers -RRB- beneath the sea might be plugged . But he said he believes a dome that could be placed over the well is expected to be deployed in six to eight days . The dome has been made and workers are finishing the plan to get it deployed , McKay said . He said BP officials are still working to activate a `` blowout preventer '' mechanism meant to seal off the geyser of oil . `` And as you can imagine , this is like doing open-heart surgery at 5,000 feet -LRB- 1,500 meters -RRB- , with -- in the dark , with robot-controlled submarines , '' McKay said . BP spokesman Bill Salvin said McKay was talking about the blowout preventer as the failed equipment that caused the April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig , which killed 11 people . The blowout preventer typically activates after a blast or other event to cut off any oil that may spill . The cause of the blast remains undetermined , and Salvin said `` we 're not ruling anything out . '' Crews have had little success stemming the flow from the ruptured well on the sea floor off Louisiana or removing oil from the surface by skimming it , burning it or dispersing it with chemicals . The churning slick of dense , rust-colored oil is now roughly the size of Puerto Rico . Adding to the gloomy outlook were warnings from experts that an uncontrolled gusher could create a nightmare scenario if the Gulf Stream current carries it toward the Atlantic . Long tendrils of oil sheen made their way into South Pass , a major channel through the salt marshes of Louisiana 's southeastern bootheel that is a breeding ground for crab , oysters , shrimp , redfish and other seafood . Venice charter boat captain Bob Kenney lamented that there was no boom in the water to corral the oil , and said BP was `` pretty much over their head in the deep water . '' `` If they were n't , they would have cut the oil off by now , '' he said . `` It 's like a slow version of Katrina , '' he added . `` My kids will be talking about the effect of this when they 're my age . '' About a half-dozen fishing vessels sailed Sunday morning through the marshes of coastal St. Bernard Parish in eastern Louisiana , headed for the Biloxi Wildlife Management area . The oyster and shrimp boats , laden with boom , hoped to seal off inlets , bayous and bays . There is growing criticism that the government and oil company BP PLC should have done more to stave off the disaster , which cast a pall over the region 's economy and fragile environment . Moving to blunt criticism that the Obama administration has been slow in reacting to the largest U.S. crude oil spill in decades , the White House dispatched two Cabinet members to make the rounds on the Sunday television talk shows . Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said on `` Fox News Sunday '' that the government has taken an `` all hands on deck '' approach to the spill since the BP oil well ruptured . Napolitano said that as BP officials realized more oil was spewing than first thought , the government has coordinated federal , state and local resources with the oil company 's response . Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' that it could take three months before workers attain what he calls the `` ultimate solution '' to stopping the leak -- drilling a relief well more than 3 miles -LRB- 5 kilometers -RRB- below the ocean floor . However , as the spill surged toward disastrous proportions , critical questions lingered : Who created the conditions that caused the gusher ? Did BP and the government react robustly enough in its early days ? And , most important , how can it be stopped before the damage gets worse ? The Coast Guard and BP have said it 's nearly impossible to know exactly how much oil has gushed since the blast , though it has been roughly estimated the well was spewing at least 200,000 gallons -LRB- 757,000 liters -RRB- a day . Even at that rate , the spill should eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez incident as the worst U.S. oil disaster in history in a matter of weeks . But a growing number of experts warned that the situation may already be much worse . The oil slick over the water 's surface appeared to triple in size over the past two days , which could indicate an increase in the rate oil is pouring from the well , according to one analysis of images collected from satellites and reviewed by the University of Miami . While it 's hard to judge the volume of oil by satellite because of depth , images do indicate growth , experts said . `` The spill and the spreading is getting so much faster and expanding much quicker than they estimated , '' said Hans Graber , executive director of the university 's Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing . In an exploration plan and environmental impact analysis filed with the federal government in February 2009 , BP said it had the capability to handle a `` worst-case scenario '' at the site , which the document described as a leak of 162,000 barrels per day from an uncontrolled blowout -- 6.8 million gallons -LRB- 26 million liters -RRB- each day . Oil industry experts and officials are reluctant to describe what , exactly , a worst-case scenario would look like . But if the oil gets into the Gulf Stream and carries it to the beaches of Florida -- and potentially loops around the state 's southern tip and up the eastern seaboard -- several experts said it stands to be an environmental and economic disaster of epic proportions . `` It will be on the East Coast of Florida in almost no time , '' Graber said . `` I do n't think we can prevent that . It 's more of a question of when rather than if . '' The concerns are both environmental and economic . The fishing industry is worried marine life will die -- and that no one will want to buy products from contaminated water anyway . Tourism officials are worried vacationers wo n't want to visit oil-tainted beaches . And environmentalists are worried about how the oil will affect the countless birds , coral and mammals in and near the Gulf . `` We know they are out there , '' said Meghan Calhoun , a spokeswoman from the Audubon Aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans . `` Unfortunately , the weather has been too bad for the Coast Guard and NOAA to get out there and look for animals for us . '' Fishermen and boaters want to help but have been hampered by high winds and rough waves that render oil-catching booms largely ineffective . Some coastal Louisiana residents complained that BP was hampering mitigation efforts . `` No , I 'm not happy with the protection , but I 'm sure the oil company is saving money , '' said 57-year-old Raymond Schmitt , in Venice preparing his boat to take a French television crew on a tour . And the oil on the surface is just part of the problem . Louisiana State University professor Ed Overton , who heads a federal chemical hazard assessment team for oil spills , worries about a total collapse of the pipe inserted into the well . If that happens , there would be no warning and the resulting gusher could be even more devastating . `` When these things go , they go KABOOM , '' he said . `` If this thing does collapse , we 've got a big , big blow . '' BP has not said how much oil is beneath the seabed Deepwater Horizon was tapping . A company official , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the volume of reserves , confirmed reports that it was tens of millions of barrels . Obama has halted any new offshore drilling projects unless rigs have new safeguards to prevent another disaster . As if to cut off mounting criticism , on Saturday White House spokesman Robert Gibbs posted a blog entitled `` The Response to the Oil Spill , '' laying out the administration 's day-by-day response since the explosion , using words like `` immediately '' and `` quickly , '' and emphasizing that Obama `` early on '' directed responding agencies to devote every resource to the incident and determining its cause .

VENICE , Louisiana -- Federal officials shut down fishing from the Mississippi River to the Florida Panhandle on Sunday because of the uncontrolled gusher spewing massive amounts of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , and the environmental disaster is still expected to take at least a week to cut off . Even that toxic scenario may be too rosy because it depends on a low-tech strategy that has never been attempted before in deep water . The plan : to lower 74-ton , concrete-and-metal boxes into the gulf to capture the oil and siphon it to a barge waiting at the surface . Whether that will work for a leak 5,000 feet below the surface is anyone 's guess ; the method has previously worked only in shallower waters . If it does n't , and efforts to activate a shutoff mechanism called a blowout preventer continue to prove fruitless , the oil probably will keep gushing for months until a second well can be dug to cut off the first . Oil giant BP PLC 's latest plan will take six to eight days because welders have to assemble the boxes . President Barack Obama toured the region Sunday , deflecting criticism that his administration was too slow to respond and did too little to stave off the catastrophe . Satellite images indicate the rust-hued slick tripled in size in just two days , suggesting the oil could be pouring out faster than before . Wildlife including sea turtles have been found dead on the shore but it is too soon whether the spill , caused by an April 20 oil rig explosion , was to blame . Even if the well is shut off in a week , fishermen and wildlife officials wonder how long it will take for the gulf to recover . Some compare it to the hurricane Louisiana is still recovering from after nearly five years . `` It 's like a slow version of Katrina , '' Venice charter boat captain Bob Kenney said . `` My kids will be talking about the effect of this when they 're my age . '' More than 6,800 square miles of federal fishing areas , from the mouth of the Mississippi to Florida 's Pensacola Bay were closed for at least 10 days on Sunday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco says government scientists are taking samples from the waters near the spill to determine whether there is any danger . Fishermen still were out working , however : They have been dropping miles of inflatable , oil-capturing boom around the region 's fragile wetlands and prime fishing areas . Bad weather , however , was thwarting much of the work ; Alabama Gov. Bob Riley said 80 percent of the booms laid down off his state over the previous three days had broken down . He said boom along other coasts is breaking down also . The Coast Guard and BP have said it 's nearly impossible to know exactly how much oil has gushed since the blast , though it has been roughly estimated to be at least 200,000 gallons a day . At that rate , it would eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez tanker spill -- which dumped 11 million gallons off the Alaska coast -- as the worst U.S. oil disaster in history in a matter of weeks . `` None of us have ever had experience at this level before . It ai n't good , '' said Bob Love , coastal and nongame resources administrator with the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries . `` The longer it goes , the more fish and wildlife impacts there will be . '' Even if the oil stays mostly offshore , the consequences could be dire for sea turtles , dolphins and other deepwater marine life -- and microscopic plankton and tiny creatures that are a staple of larger animals ' diets . Moby Solangi , director of the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Gulfport , Miss. , said at least 20 dead sea turtles were found on the state 's beaches . He said it 's too soon to say whether oil contamination killed them but that it is unusual to have them turning up across such a wide stretch of coast , spanning nearly 30 miles . None of the turtles have oil on them , but Solangi said they could have ingested oily fish or breathed in oil on the surface . Necropsies will be performed Monday . The situation could become even more grave if the oil gets into the Gulf Stream and flows to the beaches of Florida -- and potentially whips around the state 's southern tip and up the Eastern Seaboard . Tourist-magnet beaches and countless wildlife could be ruined . Obama has halted any new offshore drilling projects unless rigs have new safeguards to prevent another disaster . On Sunday he called the spill a `` massive and potentially unprecedented environmental disaster , '' and made clear that he was not accepting blame . `` BP is responsible for this leak . BP will be paying the bill , '' he said , rain dripping from his face in Venice , a Gulf Coast community serving as a staging area for the response . Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has said any comparison between the ruptured BP oil well and Katrina was `` a total mischaracterization '' and that the government has taken an `` all hands on deck '' approach . Plaquemines Parish president Billy Nungesser met with Obama Sunday in Venice and said the president 's `` let 's - get-it-done approach was overwhelming . '' He said he hopes that the president pressures BP to approve funding for a plan to have fishermen start laying oil-sopping booms very soon . Obama acknowledged the booms have n't been working well out in the choppy gulf , Nungesser said . After the oil rig explosion , which killed 11 people , the flow of oil should have been stopped by a blowout preventer , but the mechanism failed , as have continuing efforts to activate it . `` As you can imagine , this is like doing open-heart surgery at 5,000 feet , with -- in the dark , with robot-controlled submarines , '' BP PLC Chairman Lamar McKay said on ABC 's `` This Week . '' He defended his company 's safety record . Charlie Holt , drilling and completing operations manager for BP in the Gulf of Mexico , said Sunday it 's still unclear why the blowout preventer failed . But he suggested something could be in the way , or it could be damaged . `` There is nothing unique about the situation that should have prohibited the BOP from working as designed , '' Holt said of the device . The containment boxes being built to stop the leak -- 40 feet tall , 24 feet wide and 14 feet deep -- were not part of the company 's original response plan . But they appear to be the best hope for keeping the oil well from gushing for months . The approach has been used previously only for spills in relatively shallow water . Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said engineers are still examining whether the valves and other systems that feed oil to a ship on the surface can withstand the extra pressures of the deep . `` This is a completely new way of dealing with this problem , '' said Greg Pollock , commissioner of the oil spill prevention and response program at the Texas General Land Office . `` Generally speaking , nobody 's ever tried anything like this on this scale . '' If the boxes do n't work , BP also has begun work on its only other backup plan : two relief wells that will take as long as three months to drill . Bob Fryar , senior vice president for BP in Angola , said the Bureau of Minerals Management has approved a plan to drill the wells . BP wants to drill two in case one does n't work . He said teams are working 24 hours a day on every possible solution . He said 389 people reported to an emergency center at BP 's Houston office alone . `` What BP 's doing is is throwing absolutely everything we can at this , '' he said Sunday . `` We ceratainly want to do everything we can , everything we can possibly think of , as a company , as an industry . '' BP has not said how much oil is beneath the seabed the Deepwater Horizon rig was tapping when it exploded . A company official , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the volume of reserves , confirmed reports that it was tens of millions of barrels . Fryar said any numbers being thrown out are just estimates at best . The rig was operated by BP and owned by Transocean Ltd. . Teams working to contain the spill have had limited success using airplanes to drop chemical dispersants meant to break up the oil , and rough seas have prevented ships from skimming crude from the surface . In Alabama , National Guard soldiers arrived on the state 's Dauphin Island to build a berm meant to buffer part of the island against the slick .

Thad Allen , second right , and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal aboard Marine One as they fly along the coastline from Venice , La. , to New Orleans on May 2 . -LRB- AP Photo -RRB- President Obama warned Sunday that the vast oil spill nearing the Gulf coastline is a `` potentially unprecedented '' disaster , as he and other top administration officials defended the government 's response and pledged a `` relentless '' federal effort to clean up the slick . The president visited Louisiana to survey the damage and hear from local officials , who told him the oil is about nine miles from the state 's coast . Obama warned that the spill could `` seriously damage '' the local economy and environment . `` We 're dealing with a massive and potentially unprecedented environment disaster , '' Obama said . `` It could extend for a long time . It could jeopardize the livelihoods of thousands of Americans who call this place home . '' But in the face of emerging criticism , Obama and other top officials said the federal government has brought all possible resources to bear , rejecting comparisons to the Bush administration 's handling of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 . They said British Petroleum is ultimately responsible , but that the federal government will do its part to contain the damage and stop the leak . The president cautioned Sunday that the effort could take `` many days , '' and said the federal government would spare no resource in attacking the problem , though BP will foot the bill in the end . `` From day one , we have prepared and planned for the worst , '' Obama said . `` Your government will do whatever it takes , for as long as it takes , to stop this crisis . '' The federal response to the spill has fluctuated since the April 20 oil rig explosion that triggered the rupture . Earlier in the week , officials drastically increased their estimate of the size of the spill , from 1,000 to 5,000 barrels a day . The Department of Homeland Security then declared the spill an incident of `` national significance '' on Thursday , freeing up resources to tackle the spreading problem . And after the White House initially insisted that Obama would not travel to the region , the president flew into New Orleans Sunday -- traveling in his motorcade to Venice , La. , two hours away , while meeting with Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal . The White House also announced Sunday that it was canceling the president 's scheduled visit Wednesday to New Jersey to discuss the economy . White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Sunday that Obama `` just believed it was important to get down there as soon as he could and the quickest we could get down was today . '' Speaking on `` Fox News Sunday , '' top security and environmental officials said the federal government has been doing all it can to try to contain the mess . `` The administration responded all hands on deck from day one , '' Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said , explaining that the response `` evolved '' from a search-and-rescue mission for 11 oil rig workers who are now presumed dead to the cleanup effort under way . She said any comparison to the federal response to Hurricane Katrina , in which hundreds of people were killed and the government had advance warning , is `` a total mischaracterization . '' She said BP is `` ultimately responsible '' for the disaster , an assessment echoed by Adm. Thad Allen , commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard . Allen said the federal government should not completely take over the cleanup because , `` by statute and by law , BP is the responsible party . '' He said the firm bears responsibility and costs in the aftermath of the spill . He said , though , that the cleanup effort will continue to be a collaboration . `` It 's a combination of BP and the federal government , '' he said . `` We both have to execute our responsibilities . '' The spill has already impacted the Gulf Coast economy . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Sunday announced that it was closing commercial and recreational fishing along the coastline from Louisiana to the Florida panhandle . Tim Kant , mayor of Fairhope , Ala. , told Fox News that the federal government needs to step up its response , even if it means sending BP the bill later . `` This is too much for BP or any company to deal with , '' he said . Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told `` Fox News Sunday '' that the federal government is doing all it can to help keep the spill from spreading . `` Every effort is being made to stop the source right now , '' he said . `` There has not been a minute of rest since this started . '' Salazar gave a dire warning about the potential size of the environmental and economic damage that the spill could cause . He said BP 's plans to drill a relief well near the original source in order to relieve pressure -- something he called the `` ultimate solution '' -- could take up to three months . `` There are scenarios that it could be worse than the Exxon Valdez . We 're not sugarcoating this thing , '' he said .

BP In its efforts to minimize the widening oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , BP is deploying a large structure -- essentially a giant concrete funnel -- to capture leaking oil . Here 's how it works . Called the Subsea Oil Recovery System , the 125-ton structure is designed to be placed over the largest source of oil leaking 5,000 feet beneath the Gulf of Mexico . The system collects the leaking oil and pumps it through a funnel and pipe to a tanker at the surface , which stores it and ships the oil to shore . The structure is a 40-foot tall concrete chimney-like structure that conveys leaking oil to a ship on the surface , the Deepwater Enterprise . Once there , oil is separated from water and stored until the ship can return to shore , where it is offloaded and shipped to an on-shore terminal . The ship is capable of storing 139,000 barrels of oil , processing it at a rate of 15,000 barrels per day . BP hopes it will be able to collect as much as 85 percent of the oil leaking from the sea floor . Working in conjunction with contractor Wild Well Controls , BP built the system in Louisiana based on similar designs used during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina . Containment systems used following the hurricane were in shallow water , however ; to deal with the muddy conditions at the bottom of the sea , BP is adding mud flaps to the base of the structure , that should more thoroughly seal off the leak . BP plans two additional containment structures that it will use to collect gas spilling from the other two remaining leaks . Last week officials drastically increased their estimate of the size of the spill , from 1,000 to 5,000 barrels a day .

Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said reimbursement for individuals and state and federal government will be on the agenda when she and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar meet with BP 's top executives in Washington later Monday . White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Monday that the administration will put its `` boot on the throat of BP '' to ensure that they 're doing `` all that is necessary '' to contain the oil spill and minimize harmful effects on the Gulf 's fragile coastline . He also said the law requires BP to pay for all economic losses , including those suffered by local fisherman . `` The economic damages that are incurred are part of the cost of this incident , '' Gibbs said . Napolitano told ABC 's '' Good Morning America '' that the White House wants to make sure there is a clear claims process set up for proper reimbursement . She also wants BP to stop requiring those volunteering with the cleanup to sign waivers limiting the company 's liability .

Hayward also said BP is preparing for a `` worst case scenario '' that it would need to contain the spill for two to three months . The White House has already stated that it is also looking for BP to compensate fisheries whose livelihood has been impacted by the spill of 5,000 barrels a day . But the federal government will pick up the tab for other expenses , like the cost of deploying the National Guard . The Pentagon said Monday that Defense Secretary Robert Gates has approved a request from Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal to have the federal government pay the cost of mobilizing the National Guard . About 6,000 Louisiana National Guard members have been authorized for use in the oil cleanup efforts , and so far 600 of those guardsmen have been formally requested by the on-scene coordinator , Rear Adm. Mary Landry . Gates may be asked to authorize similar numbers of National Guard members in Florida , Mississippi and Alabama , department sources tell Fox News . Obama on Sunday defended the administration 's response to the disaster and said he 's doing all he can to protect the fishing industry , which he called `` the heartbeat of the region 's economic life . '' `` We 're going to do everything in our power to protect our natural resources , compensate those who have been harmed , rebuild what has been damaged and help this region persevere like it has done so many times before , '' Obama said on his trip Sunday to Louisiana . A potential hazard beside the environment is a political one that depends on how the public judges the Obama administration 's response . In 2005 , President George W. Bush stumbled in dealing with Hurricane Katrina in the Gulf and left the impression of a president distant from immense suffering . His presidency never recovered . Administration officials said they were on top of the accident from the first day though White House Press Secretary acknowledged Sunday that the first order of business after the explosion was search and rescue for 11 riggers now presumed dead . A declaration of national significance -- opening the way for greater government involvement -- came nine days later , when a new leak was discovered and it was determined that far more oil was leaking from the site than initially estimated . `` From day one , we have prepared and planned for the worst , '' Obama said . `` Your government will do whatever it takes , for as long as it takes , to stop this crisis . '' Obama took a brief helicopter tour to view the kinds of marshlands and estuaries threatened by the spill . High winds prevented him from flying over the 30-mile spill . It appeared little could be done in the short term to stem the oil flow , which was also drifting toward the beaches of neighboring Mississippi and farther east along the Florida Panhandle . Obama said the slick was 9 miles off the southeastern Louisiana coast . BP Chairman Lamar McKay raised faint hope that the spill might be stopped more quickly by lowering a hastily manufactured dome to the ruptured wellhead a mile deep in the next six to eight days , containing the oil and pumping it to the surface . Such a procedure has been used in some well blowouts but never at the mile-deep waters of this disaster . An investigation is under way into the cause of the explosion and , depending on its outcome , questions may be raised about whether federal regulation of offshore rigs operating in extremely deep waters is sufficient and whether the government is requiring the best available technology to shut off such wells in event of a blowout . Administration officials have been at pains to explain that Obama 's late March decision to expand offshore oil exploration could be altered as a result of the spill and that stricter safety rules would doubtless be written into leases . In reality , oil companies and the government lack the technology to prevent the damage from a well gushing oil , killing wildlife and tainting a delicate ecosystem , though such instances are rare . The Gulf of Mexico alone has had 30,000 wells drilled into it , and the gulf provides 30 percent of the U.S. supply of oil and natural gas . Adm. Thad Allen , the Coast Guard commandant , said the volume of spewing oil could climb to 100,000 barrels a day in the event of a total wellhead failure , a much greater breach than is believed to exist now .

AP FILE : President Obama talks with U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Thad Allen and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal aboard Marine One on May 2 as they fly along the coastline from Venice , La. . `` Let me be clear : BP is responsible for this leak ; BP will be paying the bill , '' Obama said while touring the area Sunday . While it 's true that the federal Oil Pollution Act , enacted in 1990 in response to the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska , makes BP responsible for cleanup costs , the law caps the company 's liability for economic damages -- such as lost wages , shortened fishing seasons or lagging tourism -- at $ 75 million , a pittance compared to potential losses . Administration officials insist BP will be held responsible anyway , noting that if the company is found negligent or criminally liable , the cap disappears . Claims also can potentially be made under other state or federal laws , officials said . Yet the liability cap is problematic enough that a trio of Democratic senators introduced legislation Monday raising it to $ 10 billion , and the administration quickly announced its support . Sens. Robert Menendez and Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and Bill Nelson of Florida voiced concerns that unless the cap is raised , BP would avoid paying for the mess and leave small businesses , local government and fishermen with the bill . `` They 're not going to want to pay any more than what the law says they have to , '' Nelson said . That 's not quite the seemingly ironclad guarantee heard from the president . Then there 's the administration 's rhetoric about anticipating the magnitude of the crisis and bringing all resources to bear on Day One . `` We had -LRB- Defense Department -RRB- resources there from Day One . This was a situation that was treated as a possible catastrophic failure from , from Day One , '' Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said Sunday on NBC 's '' Meet the Press . '' That sense of urgency was not so apparent when White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs was questioned about the incident April 23 , three days after it occurred . At the time he seemed to dismiss its severity and indicated it would n't affect Obama 's plans to open up new areas of the coast to offshore drilling . `` I do n't honestly think it opens up a whole new series of questions , because , you know , in all honesty I doubt this is the first accident that has happened and I doubt it will be the last , '' Gibbs said . A week later , Obama was announcing plans for Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to review whether new technologies were needed to safeguard against oil spills from deep-water drilling rigs . The president said no new offshore oil drilling leases would be issued without any such safeguards . And Napolitano 's comments over the weekend about the Pentagon 's Day One role seemed a change from last Thursday , when she seemed to indicate the Defense Department was not yet involved in responding to the spill : `` If and when they have something to add , we 'll certainly make that known , '' she said . A Homeland Security spokesman , Sean Smith , said Napolitano 's more recent comments referred to the Navy 's help with the Coast Guard 's search and rescue mission early on , and that when she was discussing the Defense Department last Thursday she was alluding to any additional help they could bring to bear . The administration 's evolving rhetoric reflects not only the increasing seriousness of the spill itself , but its determination to be seen as responsive from the get-go and to squelch comparisons to the Bush administration 's slow-footed response to Hurricane Katrina . It 's only natural that administration officials would adjust their response as the spill worsened and its seriousness became evident . But they invite judgment when claiming they responded at 100 percent starting Day One to an incident whose magnitude was not yet apparent , or when black-and-white assertions about taxpayer protections turn out to be tinged with gray .

NEW ORLEANS -- Restaurateurs , hotel owners , fishermen and beachfront property owners watched and waited for the weather and ocean currents to choose where a bulk of the oil from a calamitous Gulf of Mexico spill would finally wash ashore . The consequences of the 200,000 gallons a day of crude spewing from a blown-out underwater well on those whose livelihoods rely on the richness of the sealife in the waters was obvious . Fishing has been shut down in federal waters from the Mississippi River to the Florida Panhandle , leaving boats idle Monday in the middle of the prime spring season . A special shrimping season will close Tuesday evening . Inns and restaurants that count on tourists attracted to the beautiful blue-green waters and sandy white beaches already are getting calls about the spill , which has flirted with the coastlines before receding , mostly because of the weather . `` You mentally want to push it back to the west , and then you feel guilty for doing so , '' said Jan Grant , manager at the St. George Inn on St. George Island , Fla. , about the path the spill might take . Engineers from BP PLC have failed to invent a solution to halt the gusher that 's been spewing into the sea since an offshore drilling platform blew up and sank last month and killed 11 workers . BP operated the rig that was owned by Transocean Ltd. . Chemical dispersants seemed to be helping to keep oil from floating to the surface , but crews have n't been able to activate a shutout valve underwater . And it could take another week before a 98-ton concrete-and-metal box is placed over one of the leaks to capture the oil . Worse , it could take three months to drill sideways into the well and plug it with mud and concrete to stop the worst U.S. oil spill since the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in Alaska , leaking nearly 11 million gallons of crude . Those nowhere near the Gulf who drink coffee , eat shrimp , like fruit or plan to buy a new set of tires , could also end up paying for the disaster . Several river boat pilots said the edge of the slick Monday was 15 to 20 miles off the Southwest Pass , where ships headed to New Orleans enter the Mississippi River . A total shutdown of the shipping lanes is unlikely . However , there could be long delays if cargo vessels that move millions of tons of fruit , rubber , grain , steel and other commodities in and out of the nation 's interior are forced to wait to have their oil-coated hulls power-washed to avoid contaminating the Mississippi . Some cargo ships might choose to unload somewhere else in the U.S. . That could drive up costs . `` Let 's say it gets real bad . It gets blocked off and they do n't let anything in . They lose time , and they are very concerned about that , '' said river pilot Michael Lorino . `` It 's going to be very costly if they have to unload that cargo in another port and ship it back here because it was destined for here . '' BP said Monday it would compensate people for `` legitimate and objectively verifiable '' claims from the explosion and spill , but President Barack Obama and others pressed the company to explain exactly what that means . Those who packed a meeting at a Pensacola Beach church wanted to know the same thing . Betsy Robins , 58 , said she 's lost three houses to a hurricanes , a disaster Gulf Coasters dread but are more accustomed to facing . An oil spill that might foul her properties -- that 's something she 's looking to the oil company to pay for . She wants BP to buy her parcels at pre-slick prices . `` I do n't want to fight another claim , '' Robins said . `` I 've lost three houses to hurricanes so far . And spent 11 years fighting claims . '' For the tourism industry , the spill could n't come at a worse time . `` It 's the beginning of the booking season , the beginning of the summer season , '' said Marie Curren , sales director for Brett\\/Robinson , a real estate firm in Gulf Shores , Ala. `` The only thing that could make it worst now is a hurricane . '' Dana Powell expects at least some lost business at the Paradise Inn in Pensacola Beach , Fla. , and could see a different type of guest altogether : Instead of families boating , parasailing and fishing , workers on cleanup crews will probably be renting her rooms . `` They wo n't be having as much fun , '' she said , `` but they might be buying more liquor at the bar , because they 'll be so depressed . '' And what will she serve in her restaurant ? Hamburgers and chicken fingers instead of crab claws . The latest satellite image of the slick , taken Sunday night , indicates that it has shrunk since last week , but that only means some of the oil has gone underwater . The new image found oil covering about 2,000 square miles , rather than the roughly 3,400 square miles observed last Thursday , said Hans Graber of the University of Miami . The new image also shows that sizable patches have broken away and are moving to the north and east , Graber said . By all accounts , the disaster is certain to cost BP billions . But analysts said the company could handle it ; BP is the world 's third-largest oil company and made more than $ 6 billion in the first three months of this year . The oil spill has drained $ 32 billion from BP 's stock market value . In the Chandeleur Sound on Monday , about 40 miles northeast of Venice , La. , thick , heavy oil formed long clumps that looked like raw sewage . Dying jellyfish could be seen in the water . Sea turtles have been found dead on Mississippi beaches , but necropsies on five of the 30 did not find evidence they died from the effects of oil . The news was better from Mississippi to the Florida Panhandle , where the sheen is n't expected to touch beaches before Thursday . Wind and sea currents have helped to keep the oil away from points farther west , said Coast Guard Capt. Steve Poulin . Some businesses were prepared because of their experience during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 . Folgers Coffee Co. , which ships its coffee through the Port of New Orleans , has several weeks ' worth of green coffee on hand and has made arrangements to use other ports in the event of a shutdown , spokeswoman Mary Beth Badertscher said . `` We 've learned a lot of valuable lessons from Hurricane Katrina about supply logistics , '' she said . About 60 percent of the grain exported from the U.S. goes through the Southwest Pass . If the spill delays barge traffic going down the Mississippi , prices for corn , soybeans and wheat could rise quickly on global markets , said Greg Wagner , a commodity analyst . Grain prices within the U.S. could actually fall if shipments are unable to leave the U.S. and the grain begins piling up at silos in the U.S. . But the price decreases would probably be small and would n't show up at the grocery store anytime soon , said Seth Meyer , an agricultural transportation analyst at the University of Missouri . In Alabama , scores of shrimp boats sat at dock in Bayou La Batre , their crews unable to work . Vietnamese immigrant Minh V.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated . NEIL CAVUTO , ANCHOR : Almost three weeks since the slick began , is this president getting a slick deal that President Bush never got himself ? I 'm Neil Cavuto . The administration all but dismissing criticism it has been slow to react to this Gulf oil spill , instead laying blame solely on British Petroleum , better known as BP -- but not Brownie . Michael Brown took the brunt of the blame for Katrina -- Remember that ? And who now says this president did n't act fast enough and is playing politics with the spill . Michael Brown , the former FEMA director , joining us now . Director , always good to have you . MICHAEL BROWN , FORMER FEMA DIRECTOR : Thank you , Neil . CAVUTO : Robert Gibbs , the White House press secretary , says the differences are night and day . Where do you see the similarities ? BROWN : I think here are the similarities , Neil . First of all , you have a disaster occur , and the Coast Guard shows up immediately . That 's their job . In Katrina , FEMA showed up immediately . The president is off in San Diego strumming the guitar . Obama is back East going to the White House Correspondents Dinner . You 're now nine days into the storm -- into the disaster , and actually now , only now is the president appearing to be engaged . And I think the delay was this : It 's pure politics . This president has never supported big oil . He has never supported offshore drilling . And now he has an excuse to shut it back down . You 've already heard Bill Nelson , senator from Florida , talking about offshore drilling is DOA . They played politics with this crisis and left the Coast Guard out there by themselves doing what they 're supposed to do . CAVUTO : So , Michael , you do n't take him at face value when he says a temporary halt in offshore drilling is just that , a temporary halt ? BROWN : No , no. . Look , Bill Nelson -- and , you know , they do n't say these things without it being coordinated . And so now you 're looking at this oil slick approaching , you know , the Louisiana shore , according to certain -- NOAA and other places , if the winds are right , it will go up the East Coast . This is exactly what they want , because now he can pander to the environmentalists and say , `` I 'm going to shut it down because It 's too dangerous , '' while Mexico and China and everybody else drills in the Gulf . We 're going to get shut down . CAVUTO : But leaving aside what our future exploration plans are , he said early on he relied on reports coming out of BP , remember , when all those guys were injured and 11 went missing , that BP said that it had it relatively contained , and that those were the early reports he relied on . How is that different than the argument your former boss made that local authorities on the ground felt that , ahead of the disaster , things were relatively contained ? BROWN : Here 's what is different , because we were actually on the ground also . We knew what was going on and how bad it was and kept reaching back to the White House , saying , we need these things . We need X , Y , and Z. I 'm assuming -- and I grant you , it 's an assumption -- I 'm making an assumption that , even though BP may have been telling the Coast Guard and others , we 're doing everything we can , EPA should have been there themselves verifying whether that 's true or not . And I think they just dropped the ball . I do n't think they care . CAVUTO : But , Michael , what 's to say we did n't have and do n't have guys like you in this administration now , the dirty little secret , despite you taking the bludgeoning you did during Katrina , is that you had warned that the response was n't adequate and might not be adequate , given the likely severity of something in the New Orleans area ? We learned after the fact that your warnings were largely unheeded by both parties . Having said that , how do we know that there is n't a guy like you making similar warnings now ? BROWN : I hope there is . And I hope that that person , that man or woman , whoever has been making those warnings , will do what I failed to do . And I have admitted this is a mistake . I should have walked away , found Neil Cavuto , walked up to his camera , and said , Neil , I have been saying for weeks this is not working and we need help . Now , Bush would have fired me anyway , but at least we would have gotten the attention we needed right away . And I just hope there 's somebody out there now that will do what I had failed to do . CAVUTO : All right . But it was n't as if you failed to try . So , I guess what I 'm asking here is , the media ... CAVUTO : But now what I 'm asking -- now what I 'm asking is whether you think the media , then , is giving this president a pass on this handling , and , to be fair , because the media still ca n't grasp the dimensions of this , so it is holding back ? BROWN : Well , Neil , with all due respect to you , come on . The media ... CAVUTO : I 'm being fair and balanced , Michael . I 'm being fair and balanced . BROWN : I know . But I do n't have to be . BROWN : The media has been ignoring it for two weeks . You do n't think that there were -- look , they could have gotten on helicopters . They probably were on helicopters . We had other reconnaissance images from there . But we only started to see them when it started to approach the Louisiana coast . And , then , oh , my God , look , we got to do something . I just -- I think the media sat back . And I would not be surprised if the White House said , you know , we might be able to , guess what , do what ? Use this crisis to our advantage . Let this crisis get really bad , and then we will step in . We will be able to shut down offshore drilling . We will be able to turn to all these alternate fuels . And I think the problem they have right now is , they waited too long . CAVUTO : So , by constantly referring to this as the BP still , the BP leak , the BP disaster , that there 's a method to that , right ? Did you ever hear during Katrina anyone asking Ray Nagin or Governor Blanco the questions about why did n't they evacuate , why did they choose the Superdome , how did you let people into the Convention Center ? You heard none of that . CAVUTO : That 's a good point . BROWN : And , so , the media 's responsibility right now is , where was the EPA ? Why was she out talking to David Letterman , instead of down on the Gulf Coast ? She went to New Orleans . She talked to community organizers . BROWN : Thank you , Neil .

AP Photo\\/Transocean BP has begun work on a relief well that could be used to plug the massive oil leak in the gulf coast . The new drill site is about half a mile on the seabed from the leaking well beneath the Gulf of Mexico , and drilling is estimated to take some three months . The company began work on the well early Sunday afternoon , but only announced that work had been begun Tuesday morning . The relief well also in 5,000 feet of water beneath the Gulf of Mexico , is planned to intercept the existing well around 13,000 feet below the seabed and permanently seal it . A relief well is designed to intersect an existing well bore and pump heavy fluids and cement in to stop the leaking oil . BP has described it as the only way to definitively plug the oil leak . `` This is another key step in our work to permanently stop the loss of oil from the well , '' BP Group chief executive officer Tony Hayward said in a statement . The well is being drilled by the ultra-deepwater semisubmersible rig Development Drill III , owned and operated by Transocean , the world 's largest offshore drilling company . While waiting for the relief well to be completed , response crews have been testing a new technique to break up the oil before it reaches the surface -- a remotely operated underwater vehicle dispensing sub-surface dispersant at a rate of nine gallons per minute -- with encouraging results so far . According to a joint statement by BP , the NOAA and other government officials , nearly 3,000 gallons of subsea dispersants have already been applied , and scientists are monitoring the results to determine the feasibility of their continued use .

Its most unnerving feature is that we can not begin to estimate how far-reaching its biological effects will be , let alone the scale of its economic impacts . The most essential facts are still emerging , and changing , each day . How much oil eventually will be released into the high seas ? How far away will the havoc of this expanding oil spill be reached ? How many hundreds -- or thousands -- of miles of coastline will be affected ? How many oyster beds , sperm whale pods , bluefin tuna spawning beds , sea turtle beaches , and bird colonies will fall victim ? Can we ever measure accurately the accumulated effects of this disaster on commercial fishing , and tourism , and human happiness ? Amidst these uncertainties , some essential facts are important to bear in mind . The Gulf of Mexico teems with life all year , and especially during spring days and nights when hundreds of millions of birds migrate northward across it . A large proportion of these will stop to replenish themselves at the very shorelines likely to be blackened by oil over the coming weeks . News reports already feature hopelessly oiled birds being rushed to soapy `` rescues , '' but let 's not fool ourselves . The biology of birds tarred at sea by crude oil is well known -- most will die , even among those few that are found and given a reprieve by well-meaning nature lovers . Birds are tough creatures when it comes to facing natural hazards -- after all , those that could not survive storms , droughts , floods , and fires through the millennia have long since died out without leaving descendants . But birds were never built to handle environmental onslaughts of the scale we humans have thrown at them . In the 1800s we exploited some of them to extinction . In the 1900s we ransacked their habitats with wholesale conversion and industrial pollutants . Now , in the 21st century , we confront birds with burgeoning oil spews of unprecedented scale directly at the peak , and dead-center in the pathway , of their annual migration . Depending on wind directions over the coming weeks , breeding birds of Gulf Coast marshes and estuaries could end up paying the biggest price of all . The most important point , however , is that doomed birds laden with oil are not , themselves , the story . Rather , they play the familiar role of canaries in this coal mine . The blackened gannets and pelicans we see on the evening news are messengers for a much , much larger story that is far harder to see or comprehend , much less to measure . Unwittingly , birds always have been effective communicators to humans , and today is no exception . These oiled birds represent the headlines for myriad untold catastrophes that may unfold over the coming weeks : mass deaths of wildlife , reproductive failures , population crashes , and food-web collapses affecting literally thousands of species within the Gulf ecosystem . Events like this can have ecological effects that may last decades , perhaps much longer . More than 20 years after Exxon Valdez , we are still learning the facts about how populations and ecosystems respond to such unnatural disasters . Certainly , we need to avoid hand-wringing , and mobilize now to begin learning from this one . The Deepwater Horizon gusher was generated by twenty-first century technology , but it symbolizes the nineteenth century ethics we continue to apply when environmental protection contradicts energy exploitation . Although we can not yet know the eventual scale of its biological and economic costs , we should , for once , agree that we must never again forget the fundamental lessons of this disaster . The unthinkable is possible , and must be planned for in advance . As we assess risks versus rewards , as we fully audit the true costs of energy exploration and extraction , we need to incorporate and properly mitigate the enormous risks and costs of disasters like Deepwater Horizon . Finally , with just one planet to steward and only one chance at this game , all of us should be called on to ponder whether some natural systems are just too complex and valuable to risk losing them , regardless of what temporary energy boost lies beneath them .

AP Photo\\/Patrick Semansky Oil-dispersing chemicals used to clean the vast BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico carry their own environmental risks , making a toxic soup that could endanger marine creatures even as it keeps the slick from reaching the vulnerable coast , experts say . `` The concentration of detergents and other chemicals used to clean up sites contaminated by oil spills can cause environmental nightmares of their own , '' said Terry Hazen , a microbial ecologist in Berkeley Lab 's Earth Sciences Division who has studied such notorious oil-spill sites as the Exxon Valdez spill into Alaska 's Prince William Sound . `` It 's important to remember that oil is a biological product and can be degraded by microbes , both on and beneath the surface of the water , '' Hazen said . `` Some of the detergents that are typically used to clean up spill sites are more toxic than the oil itself , in which case it would be better to leave the site alone and allow microbes to do what they do best . '' Manufacturers argue that prompt use of such detergents , also called dispersants , can move oil more rapidly to those microbes . But BP announced late Wednesday that it would halt dispersant of the chemicals while agencies further assess its environmental impact . Dispersants work on an oil spill as dishwashing detergent works on a greasy skillet : They break up oil into tiny droplets that sink below the water 's surface where naturally occurring bacteria consume them . Without dispersants , oil stays on the water 's surface , where bacteria ca n't get at them , said Mani Ramesh , chief technology officer of dispersant manufacturer Nalco . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has approved 14 dispersants for use on oil spills , including Corexit 9500 , which Nalco produces . Crews battling the spill have already used more than 156,000 gallons of dispersants including Corexit . Nalco has exhausted its entire inventory and is producing more , said Mani Ramesh , Nalco 's chief technology officer . Ramesh said Corexit 's active ingredient is an emulsifier also found in ice cream ; he disputed environmental groups ' claims that it is harmful to marine life , although the exact chemical make up of the the product is a trade secret . Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry , the federal on-scene coordinator , called the tests so far `` very promising , very promising . '' He told the Associated Press that sonar and camera images from the first test last week appeared to show a reduction in oil on the surface , although federal officials said they want more information from planes that will examine the leak site from the air . The problem , according to Jackie Savitz , a senior scientist at the marine environmental group Oceana , is that the dispersants themselves can be toxic to wildlife . Dispersants can also enhance oil 's toxicity in the dispersion process . `` A decision is being made where it 's the shore wildlife and oysters and beaches versus the animals that live in the water , '' Savitz said . `` When they use a dispersant , it 's taking the oil and essentially dissolving it in the water so that it does n't wash up on the beach . '' Hazen cities the aftermath of the Amoco Cadiz and the Exxon Valdez disasters , two spills where chemical detergents led to ecological problems . In 1978 , the oil tanker Amoco Cadiz split in two three miles off the coast of Normandy , releasing about 227,000 tons heavy crude oil that ultimately stained nearly 200 miles of coastline . The spill site was so large that only the areas of greatest economic impact were treated with detergents . Large areas in the more remote parts of the coast went untreated . `` The untreated coastal areas were fully recovered within five years of the Amoco Cadiz spill , '' says Hazen . `` As for the treated areas , ecological studies show that 30 years later , those areas still have not recovered . '' A combination of detergents and bioremediation were used to clean up the 1989 spill from the Exxon Valdez . The detergents were nutrient rich , being high in phosphorous and nitrogen compounds . In addition , as part of the bioremediation effort , fertilizers were also used to promote microbial growth . After the first year , the treated areas were dramatically cleaner , Hazen says , but after the second year no improvements were observed . Long-term prospects for the treated area are grim . `` What happened was that we took a low-nutrient environment and added lots of nutrients to it to speed up the degradation of the oil , which we probably did , '' Hazen says . `` However , we upset the ecological balance of the system , which could not handle the influx of nutrients . As a result , the severe environmental damage resulting from the spill is expected to persist for decades to come . '' Improvements to detergents have been made over the years , including some degree of biodegradability . Allison Nyholm , a policy adviser at the American Petroleum Institute , noted that current dispersants are different from the thick solvents used in 1967 on an oil spill off the California coast at Santa Barbara . But all agree that short of capping the leak , there are few good solutions to this ecological disaster . Reuters contributed to this report .

Reuters British Petroleum was able to cap one of the three Gulf of Mexico oil leaks on the Deepwater Horizon overnight , officials confirmed to New Orleans ' Fox 8 on Wednesday , but the oil giant will still move ahead with a specially built giant concrete-and-steel box designed to siphon the oil away . Spokesman Curtis Thomas said that the new cap does not necessarily lessen the amount of oil coming out but will help when trying to cap the other two leaks . A new valve was put on the leak Tuesday night to stop the flow . However , Thomas said 5,000 barrels of oil were still leaking into the Gulf Of Mexico . `` It does n't lessen the flow , it just simplifies the number of leak points they have to address , '' Coast Guard Petty Officer 1st Class David Mosley said . The capped leak was more than 800 feet from the blowout preventer , which sits over the well head on the seafloor . On Wednesday , a barge will haul the 100-ton `` box '' containment system contraption 50 miles offshore to a spot where a mile-deep gusher from a blown-out undersea well has been spewing at least 210,000 gallons of crude a day into the Gulf for two weeks . BP spokesman John Curry said it would be deployed on the seabed by Thursday . It 's the latest idea engineers from BP are trying after an oil rig the company was operating exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers . It sank two days later . Most of the oil is coming from a leak about 460 feet from the preventer , while a smaller leak is still allowing oil to escape from a crack where the pipe casing bent about 5 feet from the top of the preventer . Meanwhile , the effort to protect Louisiana coastal wetlands was expected to pick up . In Plaquemines Parish , officials loaded absorbent boom shortly after dawn to take out to the mouth of the Mississippi River . The barge will be used as a distribution point for local fishermen to lay the boom around sensitive marshes . Parish President Billy Nungesser said the parish has 24 miles of the boom . Workers in yellow rain suits scrubbed air boats . At a nearby marina , local shrimpers planned to use their boats to put down boom as part of a program BP is running . In all , about 7,900 people are working to protect the shoreline and wildlife , and some 170 boats are also helping with the cleanup . A rainbow sheen of oil has reached land in parts of Louisiana , but forecasts showed the oil was n't expected to come ashore for at least a couple more days . `` It 's a gift of a little bit of time . I 'm not resting , '' U.S. Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said . In their worst-case scenario , BP executives told members of a congressional committee that up to 2.5 million gallons a day could spill if the leaks worsened , though it would be more like 1.7 million gallons . In an exploration plan filed with the government in February 2009 , BP said it could handle a `` worst-case scenario '' it described as a leak of 6.8 million gallons per day from an uncontrolled blowout . Containment boxes have never been tried at this depth -- about 5,000 feet -- because of the extreme water pressure . If all goes well , the contraption could be fired up early next week to start funneling the oil into a tanker . `` We do n't know for sure '' whether the equipment will work , said BP spokesman Bill Salvin . `` What we do know is that we have done extensive engineering and modeling and we believe this gives us the best chance to contain the oil , and that 's very important to us . '' The seas calmed Tuesday , allowing more conventional methods to contain the spill to get back on track as businesses and residents kept an eye on the ocean currents , wondering when the sheen washing ashore in places might turn into a heavier coating of oil . Crews put out more containment equipment and repaired some booms damaged in rough weather over the weekend . They also hoped to again try to burn some of the oil on the water 's surface , possibly Wednesday . Chemical dispersants piped 5,000 feet to the main leak have significantly reduced the amount of oil coming to the surface , BP said . From the air Tuesday , the site of the Deepwater Horizon explosion looked similar to a week ago except for the appearance of a massive rig brought in to drill a relief well to shut off the spewing oil . That will take months . People along the Gulf Coast have spent weeks living with uncertainty , wondering where and when the huge slick might come ashore , ruining their beaches -- and their livelihoods . The anxiety is so acute that some are seeing and smelling oil where there is none . And even though the dead turtles and jellyfish washing ashore along the Gulf of Mexico are clean , and scientists have yet to determine what killed them , many are just sure the flow of crude unleashed by the explosion at BP 's Deepwater Horizon is the culprit . The rig was owned by Transocean Ltd. . Some of the 115 surviving workers who were aboard when it exploded are suing that company and BP PLC. . In lawsuits filed Tuesday , three workers say they were kept floating at sea for more than 10 hours while the rig burned uncontrollably . They are seeking damages .

As the White House works with Congress to change a law that caps at $ 75 million the liability of BP and other companies for economic damages on businesses and the tourism industry , administration officials in recent days have repeatedly highlighted the exceptions to the cap . `` Understand this : There is -- they are fully liable for cleanup and recovery costs per the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 , '' White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said this week . `` The cap is not in place if somebody is found to be either grossly negligent , conduct willful -- involved in willful misconduct , or in violation of federal regulations . As you know , there 's an investigation ongoing as to the cause behind -- behind the spill . '' Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer repeated this assertion on the White House blog this week and added : `` The bottom line is that the administration will aggressively pursue compensation from BP for any damages from this spill . '' It 's understandable why the White House is quick to point out exceptions to the cap : The total cost of economic damages from the oil spill is expected to easily exceed the $ 75 million liability limit and the tide in the Gulf of Mexico moves faster than the tide of Congress . The Senate is seeking to raise the cap of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to $ 10 billion . The White House wo n't endorse a specific dollar limit but Gibbs said Wednesday that the administration `` would be in favor of significantly lifting '' the current $ 75 million cap . It 's unclear how much BP will ultimately have to pay but analysts estimate the company is facing billions in containment and clean-up expenses . `` This figure is rising as activity increases , '' the company said in a written statement . `` It is too early to quantify other potential costs and liabilities associated with the incident . '' BP says it is spending more than $ 6 million a day to try and contain the oil slick and just announced $ 25 million grants for four Gulf Coast states affected by the oil spill . But that does n't include federal and state spending , such as the deployment of National Guard troops , that BP is responsible for reimbursing . The Pentagon just approved requests from Louisiana and Mississippi for 6,000 Guard members each , Alabama for 3,000 and Florida for 2,500 . Sen. Mary Landrieu , D-La . , on Wednesday called for BP to assist the devastated Gulf of Mexico fishing industry . She noted that in 2008 , commercial fishermen there generated $ 659 million in revenue from their harvests and Louisiana seafood industry alone is worth $ 2.4 billion and employs more than 27,000 jobs . A Democratic Senate aide working on the new legislation noted a difference between the cleanup costs and `` economic damages to small businesses , fisheries -- businesses that are going to suffer through no fault of their own . '' `` The question is , who 's going to make those businesses and families whole again , '' the aide told FoxNews.com . `` In an instance like this , $ 75 million would be a drop in the bucket compared to what local businesses , fisheries and landowners need to be made whole . '' The White House has not ruled out requesting supplemental funds from Congress to help pay for the cleanup now , but a request has not been made . `` We are monitoring the whole situation and what the impact will be on businesses , communities and individuals in the Gulf Coast , '' Kenneth Baer , spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget , told FoxNews.com . `` But it 's too soon to say whether we need to request supplemental funds from Congress .

AFP\\/Getty Images May 4 : A dead shark is seen laying in the surf as concern continues that the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico may harm animals in its path . Getty NEW ORLEANS -- The best short-term solution to bottling up a disastrous oil spill threatening sea life and livelihoods along the Gulf Coast should be arriving on Wednesday in the form of a specially built giant concrete-and-steel box designed to siphon the oil away . Crews for contractor Wild Well Control were putting the finishing touches Tuesday on the 100-ton containment dome . A barge at about midday would haul the contraption to the spot 50 miles offshore where a mile-deep gusher from a blown-out undersea well has been spewing at least 210,000 gallons of crude a day into the Gulf for two weeks . BP spokesman John Curry said it would be deployed on the seabed by Thursday . It 's the latest idea that engineers from oil giant BP PLC were trying since an oil rig the company was operating exploded on April 20 , killing 11 workers . It sank two days later , when the oil started pouring into the Gulf . BP is in charge of the cleanup and President Obama and many others say the company also is responsible for the costs . Such domes have never been tried at this depth -- about 5,000 feet -- because of the extreme water pressure . The dome , if all goes well , could be fired up early next week to start funneling the oil into a tanker . `` We do n't know for sure '' whether the equipment will work , said BP spokesman Bill Salvin . `` What we do know is that we have done extensive engineering and modeling and we believe this gives us the best chance to contain the oil , and that 's very important to us . '' The seas calmed Tuesday allowing more conventional methods to contain the spill to get back on track as businesses and residents kept an eye on the ocean currents , wondering when the sheen washing ashore in places might turn into a heavier coating of oil . Crews put out more containment equipment and repaired some booms damaged in rough weather over the weekend . They also hoped to again try to burn some of the oil on the water 's surface , possibly Wednesday . Chemical dispersants piped 5,000 feet to the main leak have significantly reduced the amount of oil coming to the surface , BP said . The company also hoped to shut off one of the smaller of three leaks though it might not reduce the flow much , said Doug Suttles , BP PLC 's chief operating officer . Forecasts showed the oil was n't expected to come ashore until at least Thursday . `` It 's a gift of a little bit of time . I 'm not resting , '' U.S. Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said . From the air Tuesday , the site of the Deepwater Horizon explosion looked similar to a week ago except for the appearance of a massive rig brought in to drill a relief well to shut off the spewing oil . That would take months , however . Across the accident zone , oil floated in the ocean in different hues , shapes and textures . In places , it was a rich paisley patterned reds and oranges . In others , it took on varying gray and blue striated shapes , almost like a Vincent Van Gogh 's thick brush strokes . People along the Gulf Coast have spent weeks living with uncertainty , wondering where and when that huge slick might come ashore , ruining their beaches -- and their livelihoods . The anxiety is so acute that some are seeing and smelling oil where there is none . And even though the dead turtles and jellyfish washing ashore along the Gulf of Mexico are clean , and scientists have yet to determine what killed them , many are just sure the flow of crude unleashed by the explosion at BP 's Deepwater Horizon is the culprit . The rig was owned by Transocean Ltd. . Some of the 115 surviving workers who were aboard when it exploded are suing that company and BP PLC. . In lawsuits filed Tuesday , three workers say they were kept floating at sea for more than 10 hours while the rig burned uncontrollably . They are seeking damages . Guy Cantwell , a spokesman for rig owner Transocean Ltd. , defended the company 's response , saying 115 workers did get off alive . Two wrongful death suits also have been filed . In their worst-case scenario , BP executives told members of a congressional committee that up to 2.5 million gallons a day could spill if the leaks worsened , though it would be more like 1.7 million gallons . A rainbow sheen of oil has reached land in parts of Louisiana , but the gooey rafts of coagulated crude have yet to come ashore in most places . While officials worked on cleanup , the long wait took its toll on nerves and incomes . `` It 's aggravating , to a point , '' said Frank Besson , 61 , owner of Nez Coupe Souvenir & Tackle . `` You got people canceling out , thinking we 've got oil on the beaches , and it 's not even at the mouth of the Mississippi . '' Fishermen have complained bitterly about the federal decision to close a large swath of the Gulf to commercial and sport fishing , saying it was an overreaction . Some even vowed to keep catching fish until someone arrested them . But U.S. Sen. David Vitter said it was necessary to reassure the American public that the seafood on restaurant menus and store shelves is safe . `` We do n't want hysteria to take over and hysteria to hurt the industry even more than the oil is , '' said Vitter , R-La . Daryl Carpenter , president of the Louisiana Charter Boat Association , is struggling to get people to understand that three-quarters of the Gulf is still clean and open to fishing . In Gulf Shores , Ala. , the real estate firm Brett\\/Robinson Vacations , sent a note to those renting vacation properties that they would not be penalized for any spill-related cancellations , but urged them not to jump the gun . `` There are many questions and many ` what ifs ' regarding this event , '' the message read . `` Because changes come about hourly and 30 days is a long way away , we are asking you to wait before canceling your vacation , especially those of you who are scheduled to arrive more than 30 days from today .

AFP\\/Getty Images NEW ORLEANS -- The best short-term solution to bottling up a disastrous oil spill threatening sea life and livelihoods -- a tremendous dome BP will lower a mile to the sea floor -- has proven successful in the past . The contraption , called the Subsea Oil Recovery System , is a 100-ton structure is designed to be placed over the largest source of oil leaking 5,000 feet beneath the Gulf of Mexico . The system collects the leaking oil and pumps it through a funnel and pipe to a tanker at the surface , which stores it and ships the oil to shore . Dr. Bill Eustes , an associate professor with the Colorado School of Mines , told Fox News correspondent Phil Keating that he has n't heard of anyone trying anything like this since the 70s , when oil company ARCO attempted a similar feat . The company -LRB- which was subsequently bought by BP -RRB- lowered a rudimentary funnel over a naturally occurring oil leak in Santa Barbara Channel . By all accounts , ARCO 's efforts were a success says the professor , whose Golden , Colorado , school graduates many of the world 's best petroleum engineers . Eustes described as clever BP 's plan to use containment boxes like these ; in the past , such domes have been used only in shallow water for containment during hurricanes . The Subsea Oil Recovery System -- essentially a 40-foot tall steel and concrete chimney -- is being shipped to the Gulf oil leak , where it will be lowered to the ocean floor , a process that can take up to two days . It should be on the seabed by Saturday , and as early as Sunday should start pumping oil up to the Deepwater Enterprise , which is capable of storing 139,000 barrels of oil , processing it at a rate of 15,000 barrels per day . BP hopes it will be able to collect as much as 85 percent of the oil leaking from the sea floor . The company , along with contractor Wild Well Control , are also building two other domes at a manufacturing facility in Port Fourchon , LA , just south of Houma . The other two domes should follow a few days behind the first . `` We do n't know for sure '' whether the equipment will work , BP spokesman Bill Salvin hs said . `` What we do know is that we have done extensive engineering and modeling and we believe this gives us the best chance to contain the oil , and that 's very important to us .

AP May 4 : Workers put the finishing touches on the Pollution Control Dome in Port Fourchon . AFP\\/Getty Images ON THE GULF OF MEXICO -- A 100-ton concrete-and-steel contraption designed to siphon off the oil fouling the Gulf of Mexico was being hauled to the spot in the sea where a blown-out well is spewing hundreds of thousands of gallons of petroleum a day . Engineers hope it will be the best short-term solution to controlling the leak that has only worsened since it began two weeks ago . A boat hauling the specially built containment box and dome structure pushed off Wednesday evening from the Louisiana coast and was expected to arrive at the site of the disaster sometime Thursday . The Joe Griffin will meet up with another BP-chartered boat , the Boa Sub C , a Norwegian vessel that will use a crane to lower the contraption to the seafloor to cover the gusher of oil spewing from the seabed -- something that has never been tried before at such depths . BP spokesman Bill Salvin said the drop is expected at about noon on Thursday . The dome-like top of the structure is designed to act like a funnel and siphon the oil up through 5,000 feet of pipe and onto a tanker at the surface . Oil has been gushing into the Gulf of Mexico at a rate of at least 200,000 gallons a day since an offshore drilling rig exploded and sank last month , killing 11 people . `` We 're a little anxious . They 're gonna try everything they can . If it do n't work , they 'll try something else , '' Capt. Demi Shaffer told The Associated Press aboard his boat just after it set off . The AP is the only news organization with access to the containment effort . A 12-man crew aboard a supply boat was carrying the precious cargo . The 280-foot Joe Griffin , owned by Edison Chouest Offshore , also was involved in helping fight the fire that resulted from the oil rig explosion . The vessel is named for a boat captain who worked with company founder Edison Chouest , when Chouest was still in the shrimping business . The operator of the oil rig , BP PLC , has tried several high-tech undersea tactics to cap the leak . The containment dome endeavor is unprecedented and engineers are fully aware of the risks . First , crews need to properly position the four-story structure above the well as it sinks deep into the mud at the bottom of the Gulf with the help of a remote-controlled robotic submarine . A steel pipe will be attached to a tanker at the surface and connected to the top of the dome to move the oil . `` It 's very dark down there ... and we will have lights on the -LRB- submersibles -RRB- , and we know exactly where to put this and guide it into place , '' said David Clarkson , BP 's vice president for project execution . That process presents several challenges because of the frigid water temperature -- about 42 degrees Fahrenheit -- and exceptionally high pressure at those depths . Those conditions could cause the pipe to clog with what are known in the drilling industry as `` ice plugs . '' To combat that problem , crews plan to continuously pump warm water and methanol down the pipe to dissolve the clogging . They are also worried about volatile cocktail of oil , gas and water when it arrives on the ship above . Engineers believe the liquids can be safely separated without an explosion . Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry tried to moderate expectations that the containment box would be a silver bullet . `` I know we are all hoping that this containment system will work , but I want to remind everybody that this containment system is a first of its kind deployed in 5,000 feet of water , '' Landry said . Asked to handicap the odds of success , Bob Fryer , a senior executive vice president for BP 's Deep Water Angola , offered up this assessment : `` This has never been done before . Typically you would put odds on something that has been done before . '' Fryer also said BP is exploring a technique in which crews would reconfigure the well that would allow them to plug the leak , but that effort is a couple weeks off . The containment effort comes as dozens of boats were deployed across the Gulf to fight back the slick at the surface , including setting fires to burn off oil and laying booms to soak up the crude and block it from reaching the coast . While people anxiously wait for the mess to wash up along the coast , globules of oil are already falling to the bottom of the sea , where they threaten virtually every link in the ocean food chain , from plankton to fish that are on dinner tables everywhere . Hail-size gobs of oil with the consistency of tar or asphalt will roll around the bottom , while other bits will get trapped hundreds of feet below the surface and move with the current , said Robert S. Carney , a Louisiana State University oceanographer . `` The threat to the deep-sea habitat is already a done deal -- it is happening now , '' said Paul Montagna , a marine scientist at the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi . Scientists say bacteria , plankton and other tiny , bottom-feeding creatures will consume oil , and will then be eaten by small fish , crabs and shrimp . They , in turn , will be eaten by bigger fish , such as red snapper , and marine mammals like dolphins . The petroleum substances that concentrate in the sea creatures could kill them or render them unsafe for eating , scientists say . `` If the oil settles on the bottom , it will kill the smaller organisms like the copepods and small worms , '' Montagna said . `` When we lose the forage , then you have an impact on the larger fish . '' Making matters worse for the deep sea is the leaking well 's location : It is near the continental shelf of the Gulf where a string of coral reefs flourishes . Coral is a living creature that excretes a hard calcium carbonate exoskeleton , and oil globs can kill it . Scientists are watching carefully to see whether the slick will hitch a ride to the East Coast by way of a powerful eddy known as the `` loop current , '' which could send the spill around Florida and into the Atlantic Ocean . If that happens , the oil could foul beaches and kill marine life on the East Coast . The cause of the rig explosion is still not known , but investigators from multiple federal agencies are looking into the matter . The rig owner , Transocean Ltd. , said in a filing with regulators Wednesday that it has received a request from the Justice Department to preserve information about the blast .

Oil giant BP PLC 's oil rig exploded April 20 , in the Gulf of Mexico killing 11 workers . It sank two days later , and oil is still pouring into the Gulf . -LRB- AP -RRB- U.S. officials confirmed Thursday the first oil sheen to reach land from the massive spill in the Gulf of Mexico -- washing up on a beach on an uninhibited Louisiana island . There had been reports for the past week that oil had washed ashore , but Coast Guard officials told FoxNews.com that until now , none of those reports had been confirmed by the government agencies responding to the spill . The bulk of the oil spill remains off the coast , and what is arriving on shore now is `` largely just sheen , '' Coast Guard Petty Officer Connie Terrell told Reuters . `` There is no evidence of medium or heavy oil . '' Officials were first notified Wednesday night about the oil on Freemason Island in the Chandeleur chain , and it was confirmed Thursday , a Coast Guard official told FoxNews.com . Winds in the Gulf region are expected to pick up Saturday into Sunday causing the spill to be tougher to contain . Workers , meanwhile , gathered Thursday to begin lowering a giant concrete-and-steel box over the blown-out oil well at the bottom of the sea in a risky and untested bid to capture most of the gushing crude and avert a wider environmental disaster . `` We have n't done this before . It 's very complex and we ca n't guarantee it , '' BP spokesman David Nicholas warned . The 100-ton containment vessel is designed to collect as much as 85 percent of the oil spewing into the Gulf and funnel it up to a tanker . It could take several hours to lower it into place by crane , after which a steel pipe will be installed between the top of the box and the tanker . The whole structure could be operating by Sunday . The technology has been used a few times in shallow waters , but never at such extreme depths -- 5,000 feet down , where the water pressure is enough to crush a submarine . The box -- which looks a lot like a peaked , 40-foot-high outhouse , especially on the inside , with its rough timber framing -- must be accurately positioned over the well , or it could damage the leaking pipe and make the problem worse . Other risks include ice clogs in the pipes -- a problem that crews will try to prevent by continuously pumping in warm water and methanol -- and the danger of explosion when separating the mix of oil , gas and water that is brought to the surface . `` I 'm worried about every part , as you can imagine , '' said David Clarkson , BP vice president of engineering projects . If the box works , a second one now being built may be used to deal with a second , smaller leak from the sea floor . `` Hopefully , it will work better than they expect , '' first mate Douglas Peake told The Associated Press aboard the ship that brought the box to the site . The well blew open on April 20 when the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform exploded 50 miles out in the Gulf of Mexico , killing 11 workers . The well has been spewing an estimated 200,000 gallons a day in the nation 's biggest oil spill since the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska in 1989 . Oil slicks stretched for miles off the Louisiana coast , where desperate efforts were under way to skim , corral and set the petroleum ablaze .

State Department spokesman P.J.

Underwater robots guided the 40-foot-tall box into place . Now that the contraption is on the seafloor , workers will need at least 12 hours to let it settle and make sure it 's stable before the robots can hook up a pipe and hose that will funnel the oil up to a tanker . `` It appears to be going exactly as we hoped , '' BP spokesman Bill Salvin told The Associated Press on Friday afternoon , shortly after the four-story device hit the seafloor . `` Still lots of challenges ahead , but this is very good progress . '' By Sunday , the box the size of a house could be capturing up to 85 percent of the oil . So far about 3 million gallons have leaked in an environmental crisis that has been unfolding since a deepwater drilling platform exploded April 20 , sending toxic oil toward a shoreline of marshes , shipping channels , fishing grounds and beaches . Eleven workers were killed in the accident . The lowering of the containment device was a slow-moving drama playing out 50 miles from Louisiana 's coast , requiring great precision and attention to detail . It took about two weeks to build the 40-foot box , and the effort to lower it by crane and cable to the seafloor began late Thursday night . After it hit bottom Friday afternoon , the crane gradually eased off to allow it to settle . `` We are essentially taking a four-story building and lowering it 5,000 feet and setting it on the head of a pin , '' Salvin said . The task became increasingly urgent as toxic oil crept deeper into the bays and marshes of the Mississippi Delta . A sheen of oil began arriving on land last week , and crews have been putting out floating barriers , spraying chemical dispersants and setting fire to the slick to try to keep it from coming ashore . But now the thicker , stickier goo -- arrayed in vivid , brick-colored ribbons -- is drawing ever closer to Louisiana 's coastal communities . There are still untold risks and unknowns with the containment box : The approach has never been tried at such depths , where the water pressure is enough to crush a submarine , and any wrong move could damage the leaking pipe and make the problem worse . The seafloor is pitch black and the water murky , though lights on the robots illuminate the area where they are working . If the box works , another one will be dropped onto a second , smaller leak at the bottom of the Gulf . At the same time , crews are drilling sideways into the well in hopes of plugging it up with mud and concrete , and they are working on other ways to cap it . The well has been spewing about 200,000 gallons a day in the nation 's biggest oil spill since the nearly 11 million gallons lost in the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska in 1989 . The cause of the blast has not been determined , but investigators have been focusing on the so-called blowout preventer . Federal regulators told The Associated Press that they are going to examine whether these last-resort cutoff valves on offshore oil wells are reliable . At Hopedale , a fishing community in St. Bernard Parish , La. , that has been a staging area for efforts to protect inlets and bayous , Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal stepped out of a helicopter and held aloft a tennis ball-size hunk of tarry oil he said a fisherman had retrieved near the mouth of the Mississippi River . Oil was reported moving west of the Mississippi toward fishing and resort villages on the Louisiana coast . After a flyover , Jindal described the orange and brown goo surrounding Louisiana 's Chandeleur Islands as resembling `` a ring around your bathtub . '' Several members of Congress flew over the spill and then visited Hopedale on Friday as well . U.S. Rep. Ed Markey , D-Mass . , chairman of the House Energy and Environment Subcommittee , said hearings on the explosion will start next week . `` Lives were lost , livelihoods ruined , '' Markey said . `` The lessons that will be learned will become laws .

ON THE GULF OF MEXICO -- Underwater robots positioned a giant 100-ton concrete-and-steel box over a blown-out well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico on Friday as workers prepared to drop the device to the seafloor in a first-of-its-kind attempt to stop oil gushing into the sea . A spokesman for oil giant BP PLC , which is in charge of the cleanup , said the box was suspended over the main leak just after noon EDT Friday and was being moved into position . Several undersea cameras attached to the robots were making sure it was properly aligned before it plunged all the way to the bottom . `` We are essentially taking a four-story building and lowering it 5,000 feet and setting it on the head of a pin , '' Bill Salvin , the BP spokesman , told The Associated Press . If the device works , it could be collecting as much as 85 percent of the oil spewing into the Gulf and funneling it up to a tanker by Sunday . It 's never been tried so far below the surface , where the water pressure is enough to crush a submarine . Once the device in place later Friday , the robots will secure it over the main leak at the bottom , a process that will take hours . The seafloor is pitch black , but lights on the robots illuminate the area where they are working and they have found no problems so far . The cameras are off to the side , not in the path of the oil , Salvin said . About 1,300 feet away is the wreckage of the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon , which BP was leasing when it exploded 50 miles offshore April 20 and blew open the well . It sank two days later . Eleven workers on board were killed . An estimated 200,000 gallons a day have been spewing ever since in the nation 's biggest oil spill since the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska in 1989 . The containment device will not solve the problem altogether . Crews are still drilling a relief well and working on other methods to stop the well from leaking . The quest took on added urgency as oil reached several barrier islands off the Louisiana coast , many of them fragile animal habitats . Several birds were spotted diving into the oily , pinkish-brown water , and dead jellyfish washed up on the uninhabited islands . `` It 's all over the place . We hope to get it cleaned up before it moves up the west side of the river , '' said Dustin Chauvin , a 20-year-old shrimp boat captain from Terrebonne Parish , La. `` That 's our whole fishing ground . That 's our livelihood . '' Out at sea , the crew of the semi-submersible drilling vessel Helix Q4000 waited hours longer than expected to hoist the containment device from the deck of the Joe Griffin supply boat because dangerous fumes rose from the oily water . Joe Griffin Capt. Demi Shaffer told an Associated Press reporter aboard his boat the fear was that a spark caused by the scrape of metal on metal could cause a fire . Crew members wore respirators while they worked . Conditions were safe enough to allow the crane to lift the device into the Gulf after 10 p.m. CDT , dark oil clinging to its white sides as it entered the water and disappeared below the surface . The box -- which looks a lot like a peaked , four-story outhouse , especially on the inside , with its rough timber framing -- must be accurately positioned over the well , or it could damage the leaking pipe and make the problem worse . BP spokesman Doug Suttles said he is not concerned about that happening . Underwater robots have been clearing pieces of pipe and other debris near where the box will be placed to avoid complications . `` We do not believe it could make things worse , '' he said . Other risks include ice clogs in the pipes -- a problem that crews will try to prevent by continuously pumping in warm water and methanol -- and the danger of explosion when separating the mix of oil , gas and water that is brought to the surface . `` I 'm worried about every part , as you can imagine , '' said David Clarkson , BP vice president of engineering projects . If the box works , a second one now being built may be used to deal with another , smaller leak from the sea floor . That leak is coming from a cutoff valve that should have stopped the well from blowing out but did not . The spill has the Minerals Management Service re-examining whether such valves , known as blowout preventers , are reliable enough , Deputy Director Walter Cruickshank said Friday . Meanwhile , a huge oil slick is floating in the Gulf , and residents of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida are anxiously waiting to learn when it might come ashore . Seas were calm Friday , and the Coast Guard hoped to continue skimming oil from the ocean surface , burning it at sea and dropping chemicals from the air to break it up . Oil from the spill is extending west around the Mississippi Delta , according to a radar image taken Wednesday night by a Canadian satellite . That extension looks like a finger reaching out from the main patch , imaging expert Hans Graber of the University of Miami said Friday . The main oil slick has been shifting to the northwest , encroaching on Chandeleur Sound , which lies between the delicate Chandeleur Islands and Mississippi Delta wetlands , he said . A federal judicial panel in Washington has been asked to consolidate at least 65 potential class-action lawsuits claiming economic damage from the spill . Commercial fishermen , business and resort owners , charter boat captains , even would-be vacationers have sued from Texas to Florida , seeking damages that could reach into the billions . `` It 's just going to kill us . It 's going to destroy us , '' said Dodie Vegas , who owns a motel and cabins in Grand Isle , La. , and has seen 10 guests cancel .

AP ON THE GULF OF MEXICO -- The deadly blowout of an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico was triggered by a bubble of methane gas that escaped from the well and shot up the drill column , expanding quickly as it burst through several seals and barriers before exploding , according to interviews with rig workers conducted during BP 's internal investigation . While the cause of the explosion is still under investigation , the sequence of events described in the interviews provides the most detailed account of the April 20 blast that killed 11 workers and touched off the underwater gusher that has poured more than 3 million gallons of crude into the Gulf . Portions of the interviews , two written and one taped , were described in detail to an Associated Press reporter by Robert Bea , a University of California Berkeley engineering professor who serves on a National Academy of Engineering panel on oil pipeline safety and worked for BP PLC as a risk assessment consultant during the 1990s . He received them from industry friends seeking his expert opinion . A group of BP executives were on board the Deepwater Horizon rig celebrating the project 's safety record , according to the transcripts . Meanwhile , far below , the rig was being converted from an exploration well to a production well . Based on the interviews , Bea believes that the workers set and then tested a cement seal at the bottom of the well . Then they reduced the pressure in the drill column and attempted to set a second seal below the sea floor . A chemical reaction caused by the setting cement created heat and a gas bubble which destroyed the seal . Deep beneath the seafloor , methane is in a slushy , crystalline form . Deep sea oil drillers often encounter pockets of methane crystals as they dig into the earth . As the bubble rose up the drill column from the high-pressure environs of the deep to the less pressurized shallows , it intensified and grew , breaking through various safety barriers , Bea said . `` A small bubble becomes a really big bubble , '' Bea said . `` So the expanding bubble becomes like a cannon shooting the gas into your face . '' Up on the rig , the first thing workers noticed was the sea water in the drill column suddenly shooting back at them , rocketing 240 feet in the air , he said . Then , gas surfaced . `` What we had learned when I worked as a drill rig laborer was swoosh , boom , run , '' Bea said . `` The swoosh is the gas , boom is the explosion and run is what you better be doing . '' The gas flooded into an adjoining room with exposed ignition sources , he said . `` That 's where the first explosion happened , '' said Bea , who worked for Shell Oil in the 1960s during the last big northern Gulf of Mexico oil well blowout . `` The mud room was next to the quarters where the party was . Then there was a series of explosions that subsequently ignited the oil that was coming from below . '' According to one interview transcript , a gas cloud covered the rig , causing giant engines on the drill floor to run too fast and explode . The engines blew off the rig and set `` everything on fire , '' the account said . Another explosion below blew more equipment overboard . BP spokesman John Curry would not comment Friday night on whether methane gas or the series of events described in the internal documents caused the accident . `` Clearly , what happened on the Deepwater Horizon was a tragic accident , '' said Curry , who is based at an oil spill command center in Robert , Louisiana . `` We anticipate all the facts will come out in a full investigation . '' The BP executives were injured but survived , according to one account . Nine rig crew on the rig floor and two engineers died . `` The furniture and walls trapped some and broke some bones but they managed to get in the life boats with assistance from others , '' said the transcript . The reports made Bea , the 73-year-old industry veteran , cry . `` It sure as hell is painful , '' he said . `` Tears of frustration and anger . '' A 100-ton concrete-and-steel vault has been lowered onto the ruptured well , an important step in a delicate and unprecedented attempt to stop most of the gushing crude fouling the sea . `` We are essentially taking a four-story building and lowering it 5,000 feet and setting it on the head of a pin , '' BP spokesman Bill Salvin told The Associated Press . Underwater robots guided the 40-foot-tall box into place in a slow-moving drama . Now that the contraption is on the seafloor , workers will need at least 12 hours to let it settle and make sure it 's stable before the robots can hook up a pipe and hose that will funnel the oil up to a tanker . On Saturday , the boat with the plumbing equipment for the containment box was about 1.5 miles from the vessel that lowered the box . It 's unclear exactly when the pipework will begin . `` It appears to be going exactly as we hoped , '' Salvin said on Friday afternoon , shortly after the four-story device hit the seafloor . `` Still lots of challenges ahead , but this is very good progress . '' It could be Sunday or Monday before officials learn whether the box the size of a house can capture up to 85 percent of the oil . The task became increasingly urgent as toxic oil crept deeper into the bays and marshes of the Mississippi Delta . A sheen of oil began arriving on land last week , and crews have been laying booms , spraying chemical dispersants and setting fire to the slick to try to keep it from coming ashore . But now the thicker , stickier goo -- arrayed in vivid , brick-colored ribbons -- is drawing ever closer to Louisiana 's coastal communities . The Coast Guard and BP said Saturday about 2.1 million gallons of an oil-water mix had been collected , with about 10 percent being oil and the rest water . More than 160 miles of boom to contain the oil has been put out and crews have used nearly 275,000 gallons of chemicals to break up the oil on the water 's surface . There are still untold risks and unknowns with the containment box : The approach has never been tried at such depths , where the water pressure is enough to crush a submarine , and any wrong move could damage the leaking pipe and make the problem worse . The seafloor is pitch black and the water murky , though lights on the robots illuminate the area where they are working . If the box works , another one will be dropped onto a second , smaller leak at the bottom of the Gulf . At the same time , crews are drilling sideways into the well in hopes of plugging it up with mud and concrete , and they are working on other ways to cap it . Investigators looking into the cause of the explosion have been focusing on the so-called blowout preventer . Federal regulators told The Associated Press Friday that they are going to examine whether these last-resort cutoff valves on offshore oil wells are reliable . Blowouts are infrequent , because well holes are blocked by piping and pumped-in materials like synthetic mud , cement and even sea water . The pipes are plugged with cement , so fluid and gas ca n't typically push up inside the pipes . Instead , a typical blowout surges up a channel around the piping . The narrow space between the well walls and the piping is usually filled with cement , so there is no pathway for a blowout . But if the cement or broken piping leaves enough space , a surge can rise to the surface . There , at the wellhead of exploratory wells , sits the massive steel contraption known as a blowout preventer . It can snuff a blowout by squeezing rubber seals tightly around the pipes with up to 1 million pounds of force . If the seals fail , the blowout preventer deploys a last line of defense : a set of rams that can slice right through the pipes and cap the blowout . Deepwater Horizon was also equipped with an automated backup system called a Deadman . It should have activated the blowout preventer even if workers could not . Based on the interviews with rig workers , none of those safeguards worked .

Bobby Jindal said Saturday . The project would cost $ 200 million and take four to six months to complete its first phase , adding 43 miles to extend the Chandeleur island chain off the state 's eastern coastline in both directions , said Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser , speaking at a press conference with Jindal . However , even a few days of dredging would improve coastal protections , he added . BP will be asked to fund the project , Jindal said . `` It would be so much easier to clean oil off this -LRB- dredged -RRB- sand than to deal with in our marshes , '' Jindal said . State and parish officials are seeking expedited permitting from the Environmental Protection Agency , and will also need approval from the U.S. Coast Guard , Nungesser said . A BP well 50 miles off Louisiana 's coast has leaked oil into the Gulf of Mexico for more than two weeks , ever since a rig working the site caught fire and sank . The slick has reached the Chandeleur Islands , and a heavy patch of oil is four or five miles off the entrance to Southwest Pass , the commercial shipping route into the Mississippi River , Nungesser said . On Saturday , BP said a containment device it had lowered onto the larger of two leaks had run into a hitch , after the opening at the top clogged with crystallized gas and water . The company plans to take two days to remove the hydrates and determine next steps . One option includes injecting methanol , a chemical used as antifreeze , to prevent hydrates from forming , said Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer . Containment dome technology has never been used at such depths before . Jindal said the dredging plan is one way Louisiana can `` prepare for the worst-case scenario '' in case the well continues to leak for another three months until BP can drill a relief well cutting off the flow of oil . Plaquemines Parish had drafted plans as far back as 2008 to expand its barrier islands to protect the coast against storm surges , but was unable to secure federal funding needed to begin the project , a parish spokesman said . Nungesser said Saturday that the dredging the parish hopes BP will fund can also serve as storm protection once the threat from the oil slick passes .

AP As a massive oil leak spit thousands of gallons more crude into the Gulf of Mexico , a big box that BP hoped would be its savior sat idle hundreds of feet away , encased in ice crystals . The company 's first attempt to divert the oil was foiled , its mission now in serious doubt . Meanwhile , thick blobs of tar washed up on Alabama 's white sand beaches , yet another sign the spill was worsening . It had taken about two weeks to build the box and three days to cart it 50 miles out and slowly lower it to the well a mile below the surface , but the frozen depths were just too much . BP officials were not giving up hopes that a containment box -- either the one brought there or another one being built -- could cover the well . But they said it could be days before another attempt to capture the oil and funnel it to a tanker at the surface would be tried . `` I would n't say it 's failed yet , '' BP chief operating officer Doug Suttles said . `` What I would say is what we attempted to do ... did n't work . '' There was a renewed sense of urgency as dime - to golfball-sized balls of tar began washing up on Dauphin Island , three miles off the Alabama mainland at the mouth of Mobile Bay and much farther east than the thin , rainbow sheens that have arrived sporadically in the Louisiana marshes . `` It almost looks like bark , but when you pick it up it definitely has a liquid consistency and it 's definitely oil , '' said Kimberly Creel , 41 , who was hanging out and swimming with hundreds of other beachgoers . '' ... I can only imagine what might be coming this way that might be larger . '' About a half dozen tar balls had been collected by Saturday afternoon at Dauphin Island , Coast Guard chief warrant officer Adam Wine said in Mobile , and crews in protective clothing patrolled the beach for debris . Authorities planned to test the substance but strongly suspected it came from the oil spill . In the nearly three weeks since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers , about 210,000 gallons of crude a day has been flowing into the Gulf . Until Saturday none of the thick sludge -- those iconic images of past spills -- had reached shore . It had taken more than 12 hours to slowly lower to the seafloor the peaked box the size of a four-story house , a task that required painstaking precision to accurately position it over the well for fear of damaging the leaking pipe and making the problem worse . Nothing like it had been attempted at such depths , where water pressure can crush a submarine . Company and Coast Guard officials had cautioned that icelike hydrates , a slushy mixture of gas and water , would be one of the biggest challenges to the containment box plan , and their warnings proved accurate . The crystals clogged the opening in the top of the peaked box , BP 's Suttles said , like sand in a funnel , only upside-down . Options under consideration included raising the box high enough that warmer water would prevent the slush from forming , or using heated water or methanol . Even as officials pondered their next move , Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said she must continue to manage expectations of what the containment box can do . `` This dome is no silver bullet to stop the leak , '' she said . The captain of the supply boat that carried the hulking , concrete-and-steel vault for 11 hours from the Louisiana coast last week was n't giving up hope . `` Everybody knew this was a possibility well before we brought the dome out , '' Capt. Demi Shaffer , of Seward , Alaska , told an Associated Press reporter stationed with the 12-man crew of the Joe Griffin in the heart of the containment zone . `` It 's an everyday occurrence when you 're drilling , with the pipeline trying to freeze up . '' The spot where the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank now teems with vessels working on containing the rogue well . There are 15 boats and large ships at or near the site -- some being used in an ongoing effort to drill a relief well , considered a permanent if weeks-away fix . News that the containment box plan , designed to siphon up to 85 percent of the leaking oil , had faltered dampened spirits in Louisiana 's coastal communities . `` Everyone was hoping that that would slow it down a bit if not stop it , '' said Shane Robichaux , of Chauvin , a 39-year-old registered nurse relaxing at his vacation camp in Cocodrie . `` I 'm sure they 'll keep working on it till it gets fixed , one way or another . But we were hopeful that would shut it down . '' The original blowout was triggered by a bubble of methane gas that escaped from the well and shot up the drill column , expanding quickly as it burst through several seals and barriers before exploding , according to interviews with rig workers conducted during BP PLC 's internal investigation . Deep sea oil drillers often encounter pockets of methane crystals as they dig into the earth . As the bubble rose , it intensified and grew , breaking through various safety barriers , said Robert Bea , a University of California Berkley engineering professor and oil pipeline expert who detailed the interviews exclusively to an Associated Press reporter .

AP WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON -LRB- AP -RRB- -- The blame game is in full throttle as Congress begins hearings on the massive oil spill threatening sensitive marshes and marine life along the Gulf Coast . Executives of the three companies involved in the drilling activities that unleashed the environmental crisis are trying to shift responsibility to each other in testimony to be given at separate hearings Tuesday before two Senate committees , even as the cause of the rig explosion and spill has yet to be determined . Lawmakers are expected to ask oil industry giant BP , which operated the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig 40 miles off the Louisiana coast , why its drilling plans discounted the risk that such a catastrophic pipeline rupture would ever happen , and why it assumed that if a leak did occur , the oil would not pose a major threat . The morning hearing by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the afternoon session before the Environmental and Public Health Committee give lawmakers their first chance to question the executives publicly about the April 20 rig fire , attempts to stop the flow of oil and efforts to reduce the damage . Copies of planned testimony , obtained Monday by The Associated Press , brought into the open fissures among the companies caught up in the accident and its legal and economic fallout . A top executive of BP PLC , which leased the rig for exploratory drilling , focuses on a critical safety device that was supposed to shut off oil flow on the ocean floor in the event of a well blowout but `` failed to operate . '' `` That was to be the fail-safe in case of an accident , '' Lamar McKay , chairman of BP America , says , pointedly noting that the 450-ton blowout protector -- as well as the rig itself -- was owned by Transocean Ltd. . Of the 126 people on the Deepwater Horizon rig when it was engulfed in flames , only seven were BP employees , said McKay . But Transocean CEO Steven Newman was seeking to put responsibility on BP . `` Offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , in this case BP , '' said Newman , according to the prepared remarks . His testimony says it was BP that prepared the drilling plan and was in charge when the drilling concluded and the crew was preparing to cap the well 5,000 feet beneath the sea . To blame the blowout protecters `` simply makes no sense '' because there is `` no reason to believe '' that the equipment was not operational , Newman argues . Newman also cites a third company , Halliburton Inc. , which as a subcontractor was encasing the well pipe in cement before plugging it -- a process dictated by BP 's drilling plan . A Halliburton executive , Tim Probert , planned to assert that the company 's work was finished `` in accordance with the requirements '' set out by BP and with accepted industry practices . He says pressure tests were conducted after the cementing work was finished to demonstrate well integrity . BP and Transocean are conducting separate investigations into what went wrong . In Louisiana , the Coast Guard and the Interior Department 's Minerals Management Service were beginning two days of hearings on the cause of the explosion . The list of witnesses scheduled to testify includes a Coast Guard search and rescue specialist , crew members from a cargo vessel that was tethered to the Deepwater Horizon rig and two Interior inspectors . -- Interior Secretary Ken Salazar will propose splitting up the Minerals Management Service , an administration official , who asked not to be identified because the plan is not yet public , told The Associated Press . One agency would be charged with inspecting oil rigs , investigating oil companies and enforcing safety regulations , while the other would oversee leases for drilling and collection of billions of dollars in royalties . -- Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Alabama Gov. Bob Riley will tour the Mobile Incident Command Center in Mobile , Ala. , on Tuesday . -- The Environmental Protection Agency gave the go-ahead Monday to use oil dispersing chemicals near the sea bottom where the oil is leaking , although the agency acknowledged ecological effects of the chemical are not yet fully known . Two tests have shown the procedure helps break up the oil before it reaches the surface . -- BP said it has spent $ 350 million so far on spill response activities . -- President Barack Obama , after being briefed on the latest developments Monday , directed that more independent scientists get involved in seeking a solution to the spill .

A top American executive for BP , Lamar McKay , said a critical safety device known as a blowout-preventer failed catastrophically . Separately , the owner of the rig off Louisiana 's coast said BP managed it and was responsible for all work conducted at the site . A third company defended work that it performed on the deepwater oil well as `` accepted industry practice '' before last month 's explosion . `` We are looking at why the blowout preventer did not work because that was to be the fail-safe in case of an accident , '' McKay , chairman and president of BP America , said in testimony prepared for a Senate hearing Tuesday . A copy of his testimony was obtained by The Associated Press . `` Transocean 's blowout preventer failed to operate . '' The chief executive for Swiss-based Transocean , which owned the oil rig and the blowout preventer , shifted blame to BP . `` All offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , in this case BP , '' CEO Steven Newman said in his Senate testimony , also obtained by the AP . Newman said BP was responsible for submitting a detailed plan specifying where and how a well is to be drilled , cased , cemented and completed . Newman also said BP 's contractor , Halliburton Inc. , was responsible for encasing the well in cement , putting a temporary plug in the top of the well and ensuring the cement 's integrity . That cementing process was dictated by BP 's well plan , Newman said . A Halliburton executive , Tim Probert , said the company safely finished a cementing operation 20 hours before the rig went up in flames . Probert said Halliburton completed work on the well according to accepted industry practice and at the direction of federal regulators . The blame-game took hold on Capitol Hill as Congress and federal investigators were to begin a series of hearings in Washington and on the Gulf Coast . Two Senate hearings were set for Tuesday , and a House hearing was scheduled for Wednesday . In Louisiana , near the disaster site , a six-member panel that includes investigators from the Interior Department and Coast Guard was to begin two days of hearings . McKay , the BP executive , said the company wants answers itself . He disclosed that the company has at least 40 people internally investigating the accident , but he acknowledged that the cause is still a mystery . Transocean has its own investigative team , Newman said . `` We are looking at our own actions and those of our contractors , '' McKay wrote in his Senate testimony . Newman said it makes no sense to suggest the blowout preventer caused the accident . He said it was ironic that attention was being focused on the blowout preventer because at the time of the explosion drilling at the site was finished . The blowout preventer , made by Houston-based Cameron Inc. , is a 450-ton piece of equipment that sits on top of the wellhead during drilling operations . It contains valves that can be closed remotely in case of an accident or increase in pressure . `` The systems are intended to be fail-safe ; sadly and for reasons we do not yet understand , in this case , they were not , '' McKay said . The cause of the explosion is under investigation , but lawsuits filed after the disaster have alleged it occurred when Halliburton workers improperly capped the well -- a process known as cementing . According to a 2007 study by the Minerals Management Service , an agency within the Interior Department , cementing was a factor in 18 of 39 rig blowouts in the gulf between 1992 and 2006 . Probert of Halliburton said the company had four workers stationed on the rig performing several tasks , including cementing -- a process of applying cement and water to a pipe to prevent the wall of the hole from collapsing during drilling . A positive pressure test was conducted after the work was finished to demonstrate the integrity of the cement job , Probert said . Transocean , the well owner , decided to continue operating the well after the cement job was completed , he said . Probert said a `` negative '' pressure test , which measures the integrity of the casing seal assembly , was conducted by BP at the direction of Transocean and according to requirements of the Minerals Management Service . After the test was completed , BP `` then continued to displace the riser with seawater before the planned placement of the final cement plug , which would have been installed inside the production string and enabled the planned temporary abandonment of the well , '' Probert said . Before Halliburton personnel could set the final cement plug , the explosion occurred . `` As a result , the final cement plug was never set , '' Probert said . David Nagel , a senior vice president and head of BP America 's Washington office , emphasized in a meeting with reporters Monday that the company is making every effort to find a way to halt the spill , pay for cleanup and address claims from people that are being harmed -- a theme that will be repeated by BP executives to senators . `` We want to do the right thing , '' Nagel said .

'' But he declined to say whether BP would lobby against efforts to increase the cap to $ 10 billion .

Lamar McKay , chairman of BP America , told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee , that his company was focused on a critical safety device that was supposed to shut off oil flow on the ocean floor in the event of a well blowout but which `` failed to operate . '' `` That was to be the fail-safe in case of an accident , '' McKay said , pointedly noting that the 450-ton blowout protector -- as well as the rig itself -- was owned by Transocean Ltd. . Of the 126 people on the Deepwater Horizon rig when it was engulfed in flames , only seven were BP employees , said McKay . But Steven Newman , CEO of Transocean , which owns the rig , suggested it was n't his company at fault . `` The most significant clue is that these events occurred after the well construction process was essentially complete . Drilling had been finished on April 17 as the well had been sealed with casing and cement . For that reason , the one thing we do know is that on the evening of April 20 there was a sudden , catastrophic failure of the cement , casing or both , '' Newman said . `` Without a failure of one of those elements , the explosion could not have occurred . It is also clear the drill crew had little if any time to react . The initial indications of trouble and the subsequent explosion were almost instantaneous . '' But Tim Probert , an executive with Halliburton Inc. , the subcontractor responsible for encasing the well pipe in cement before plugging it -- a process dictated by BP 's drilling plan -- said his company finished its work `` in accordance with the requirements '' set out by BP He said pressure tests were conducted after the cementing work was finished to demonstrate well integrity . While the hearings are under way , BP is looking for new ways to plug the gushing leak after plans to cap it with a 100-ton containment box failed . The company is trying another tactic , which involves plugging the leak with trash and , if that works , filling the well with mud and cement . McKay said the first of two relief wells is being drilled and a second is to begin later this week Ahead of the testimony , lawmakers debated among themselves the impact of the spill on drilling . Sen. Jeff Bingaman , D-N.M. , chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committe , said it is not enough `` to label this catastrophic failure an unpredictable and unforeseeable occurrence . '' Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski , the panel 's top Republican , said it is essential to determine if the rig operators followed regulations and the law . But she said the accident should not interfere in continued offshore oil development . The morning hearing by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the afternoon session before the Environmental and Public Works Committee give lawmakers their first chance to question the executives publicly about the rig fire , attempts to stop the flow of oil and efforts to reduce the damage . BP and Transocean are also conducting separate investigations into what went wrong . But while the environmental and economic damages have yet to unfold completely , Tuesday 's hearings could take on a showboating quality as recent hearings with executives from Toyota , in trouble for faulty braking systems , and Goldman Sachs , in trouble for fraud charges , offered more corporate condemnation than problem-solving . `` I hear one message -- do n't blame me , '' said Sen. John Barrasso , R-Wyo . `` Shifting the blame game does n't get us very far . '' `` We are all in this together , '' Murkowski added , warning that without cooperation none of the companies will be in business . Separately , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar is proposing splitting up the Minerals Management Service . One agency would be charged with inspecting oil rigs , investigating oil companies and enforcing safety regulations , while the other would oversee leases for drilling and collection of billions of dollars in royalties . A senior administration official told Fox News that legislation is not required for the change . `` DOI has the authority to implement changes '' by itself , the official said . The administration 's outer-continental shelf drilling plan still can not technically be characterized as on hold , though Salazar is conducting a review of drilling safety . The official left open the door for the drilling plan to be nixed , saying , `` Everything could be informed and impacted by the 30-day DOI review .

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated . GRETA VAN SUSTEREN , FOX NEWS HOST : Well , it simply will not stop . Oil is continuing to pour into the Gulf of Mexico . Crews are working frantically 24\\/7 to try and stop it . Now , plan A has just failed , and now crews are moving on to plan B. British Petroleum CEO Tony Hayward goes `` On the Record . '' VAN SUSTEREN : Mr. Hayward , thank you for joining us . TONY HAYWARD , BP CEO : Thank you very much for the opportunity . VAN SUSTEREN : I know that this is both a catastrophe and an emergency . Tell me , where do you stand right now in trying to contain that leak ? HAYWARD : Well , we are working this , as you know very aggressively in three ways , in the subsea to eliminate the leak , on the surface to contain the spill to the greatest extent possible in the area of the leak , and thirdly to defend the shoreline and prevent any oil from getting to the shore . In terms of the subsea interventions , we are pursuing multiple occupy shuns in parallel . So we tried the large dome over the weekend . It was n't successful . Too much hydrate formation , a consequence of there being much greater gas in the flow of hydrocarbons than we had anticipated . So we are now moving to deploy over the next 72 hours , a smaller containment device , a so-called top hat , which is described like that because it looks like a top hat , put in the water , on the end of a piece of drill pipe to fit over the leak . We 'll be doing that over the next 72 hours . In parallel there are a series of other operations being planned on the blow-out preventer , most importantly the so-called top kill or junk shot whereby we would pump into the blowout preventer material to clog it up and stop the flow . VAN SUSTEREN : Where the hydration is , is n't that ineffective because it blocks it ? Is that why that 's been ineffective ? And why has n't that effective in containing the leak ? HAYWARD : The issue is the quantity of gas and seawater in the large dome . That is a difficult combination . So , by moving to a smaller dome we 'll have less seawater and , hopefully , a better chance of minimizing the hydrate formation and being able to get in sort of system to work . VAN SUSTEREN : Are you getting everything you need ? I realize BP is scrambling . I think it is too early to start blaming . We have a catastrophe with we need to contain . But are you getting assistance from around the world in terms of scientific assistant from the government , man power ? Do you need anything at all at this point ? HAYWARD : This is now an oil and gas industry task force with significant input from government scientists and technologists from the Department of Energy , the Navy , Department of Defense . So there is gathered in Houston , which is where I 'm talking to you from , a team of nearly 1,000 people , many of them technologists and scientists grappling with this problem . This is , if you like , the oil and gas industry now focused on an oil and gas industry global problem . VAN SUSTEREN : What the odds this smaller dome is going to work ? I realize we do n't know you are just implementing it . But the bigger dome did n't work . When you talked to the scientists the people in Houston , are they hopeful , or is this also a high-risk operation ? HAYWARD : I think we need to recognize that none of this has been done in 5,000 feet of water . That is the reality . We are working on the absolute frontier of the industry . It is -- a number of people have made this analogy , I think it is not unreasonable -- this is a lot like the Apollo 13 moon shot . We have the piece as assembled on the table and we are trying to figure out what is the right intervention . An important thing is that we are learning all the time . We are learning all the time about what is likely to work from the interventions that we are making . So , we ca n't be overly confident that this next intervention will work . But it will not have the same scale of hydrate problem that we had with the first go . VAN SUSTEREN : Let 's say Plan A failed , the bigger dome , Plan B is the smaller dome , hoping less of a hydrate problem . In the horrible , awful event that Plan B does n't work , what is Plan C ? HAYWARD : So Plan C is the so-called junk shot , top kill , where we connect two flexible hoses to the top of the blowout preventer and pump material to block up the blowout preventer . Plan D is to remove what is called the riser with which is sitting above the blowout preventer and put in place another blowout preventer . There 's a Plan E and a Plan F. So we are working through a whole series of options that are being developed and engineered in parallel and deploying them in time sequence . VAN SUSTEREN : Any idea the estimate of how much oil is being pumped - - how much is that leak right now ? I 've seen lots of estimates . HAYWARD : There is no accurate way of estimating this , I 'm afraid . There is not a meter on the sea bed . You have to estimate what is on the surface , which itself is something of an estimation , and then back calculate based on the amounts of oil that evaporates and is dispersed as it travels up through the sea column . So the numbers are genuinely guesstimates at this point . But what we can say that the containment efforts of subsea dispersant , on the surface , skimming on the surface , and booming on the surface is retaining the vast majority of the oil in the vicinity of the leak . VAN SUSTEREN : In terms of other drilling rigs are there any other ones right now at risk in the Gulf of Mexico ? There 's a lot of attention on this one . But as you look around the Gulf , should we be worried tonight ? HAYWARD : BP has no other drilling operations ongoing at the current time . The MMS , regulatory agency has put out a series of safety alerts to other rigs that are drilling requiring them to make additional safety measures and assessments . VAN SUSTEREN : As I understand , I 'm sure it is obvious I 'm not an expert in this , but the blowout preventer failed us in this particular instance , leading to this catastrophe . Did it not have redundancy ? And in terms of the MMS , the department of interior in Washington that is supposed to regulate safety , did they have requirements that it have a redundancy ? HAYWARD : The blowout preventer had three levels of redundancy . They 've all failed . We do n't understand why that is the case . That will clearly be something that the investigation focuses on very significantly . I think that -- this is a terrible accident , and , as you say , something that is very , very serious . We need to understand what has happened here . It is the first time in 20 years of drilling in the deep water globally that we 've had an incident of this sort to deal with . And clearly the investigation will make findings which , I would expect , would change in a significant way industry practices and regulation over this sort of equipment . VAN SUSTEREN : Sir , there 's no question that everyone wants a full and thorough investigation so that never happens again . There are some congressional hearings that are starting this week . And I 'm all in favor of your company being grilled and looked at to see what did wrong or right or whatever . But I 'm curious , are these hearings coming too soon so some of your resources that should be diverted or some of you attention to stopping this leak is being distracted by the hearings ? Are these hearings creating a time problem for you at all ? HAYWARD : I think it is reasonable and right that Congress should take a very active interest in this . And we have found a way of managing to deal with their concerns while not interrupting our ongoing operations . VAN SUSTEREN : Good luck , sir . We sure hope that gets contained soon , thank you sir . HAYWARD : Thank you very much for the opportunity . Content and Programming Copyright 2010 Fox News Network , Inc. .

AP Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano expressed hope Tuesday that the worst could be over in the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico but it may be wishful thinking . Napolitano , on a trip to Alabama , said it would be `` good news '' if scientists determine more gas is spilling out than oil . `` There are some tests that suggest there is a lot of natural gas coming out of the well , as opposed to oil and if that is so I think that is probably good news but I do n't know if the tests are verified so rather than confirm it here , why do n't you let us come back with you with today 's answers , '' she told a reporter . A BP official told the Associated Press late Tuesday that there has always been a mixture of gas and oil coming up since a crippled oil rig sank last month . Company spokesman Mark Proegler said scientists have n't noticed any significant change in the leak . Napolitano was in Alabama to tour the Mobile Incident Command Center in Mobile , Ala. , with Gov.

Executives of the three companies involved in the drilling activities that unleashed the environmental crisis are trying to shift responsibility to each other in testimony to be given at separate hearings Tuesday before two Senate committees , even as the cause of the rig explosion and spill has yet to be determined . Lawmakers are expected to ask oil industry giant BP , which operated the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig 40 miles off the Louisiana coast , why its drilling plans discounted the risk that such a catastrophic pipeline rupture would ever happen , and why it assumed that if a leak did occur , the oil would not pose a major threat .

May 10 : Boats work with containment boom on the shoreline of Grand Isle , La. -LRB- AP -RRB- A key safety device known as a blowout preventer used in the BP oil rig in the Gulf had a hydraulic leak and other problems that likely prevented it from working as designed -- a malfunction that BP may have known about before the April 20 explosion , congressional investigators said Wednesday . They also said documents from BP PLC and others also indicated confusion over whether poor pipe integrity was allowing methane gas to leak into the well just hours before the explosion that killed 11 workers and blew the well open . Rep. Henry Waxman , a California Democrat , said that BP had informed his House committee that at some point when the well was being closed with cement , an influx of methane entered the wellhead , indicating that cementing the well had not produced needed pipe integrity . Waxman , opening a hearing into the April 20 well explosion that unleashed a massive oil spill , said while `` we have far more questions than answers '' it appeared clear -- from BP and other documents -- that there were problems with the blowout preventers before the accident and confusion almost right up to the time of the explosion over the success of the cementing process . The committee said that there were at least `` four significant problems with the blowout preventer '' used on the Deepwater Horizon drill rig . Rep. Bart Stupak , a Michigan Democrat , said that a 2001 report by Transocean , which made the device , indicated there can be as many as 260 failure possibilities in the equipment . The device is supposed to be the final safeguard against a well blowout by clamping down and sealing a gushing oil well . `` How can a device that has 260 failure modes be considered fail-safe ? '' The House Energy and Commerce Committee was to hear from executives of BP , Transocean Ltd , Halliburton , which conducted the cementing on the BP rig , and Cameron Inc. . Stupak said BP confirmed in documents that a leak had been found in the hydraulic system that provides emergency power to a part of the blowout preventer . When a remote underwater vehicle tried to activate the safety device , a loss of hydraulic pressure was detected , said Stupak . In the Gulf , crews lowered a new containment box to the seafloor in preparation for the latest bid to funnel the gusher to a waiting tanker . The blown well has spewed at least 4 million gallons -LRB- 15 million liters -RRB- of oil into the Gulf over three weeks . `` If this is like other catastrophic failures of technological systems in modern history , whether it was the sinking of the Titanic , Three Mile Island , or the loss of the Challenger , we will likely discover that there was a cascade of failures and technical and human and regulatory errors , '' said Sen. Jeff Bingaman , chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee . BP 's latest bid to stop the oil leak was a new containment box that reached the seafloor overnight after being lowered late Tuesday by a crane from the deck of the Viking Poseidon . The box , dubbed a top hat , was initially set down away from the gusher while engineers work to avoid problems that scuttled an earlier effort , BP spokesman Bill Salvin said . The first box sent down last week weighed 100 tons and company officials had hoped it could contain 85 percent of the oil . However , it was never tried at such depths -- about a mile -LRB- 1.6 kilometers -RRB- below the surface . A slushy mixture of gas and water clogged the opening in the top of the peaked box and it was cast aside . The latest box is much smaller -- just 2 tons . It wo n't be placed over the spewing well right away because engineers want to make sure everything is configured correctly and avoid the same buildup , Salvin said . Crews also planned to pump in heated water and methanol so ice wo n't amass . Coast Guard Petty Officer Connie Terrell said it is about 35 degrees -LRB- 1.7 Celsius -RRB- Fahrenheit at the bottom of the sea floor where the oil is spilling . And , in yet another sign the spill is getting worse , Louisiana wildlife officials said Wednesday that tar balls had washed ashore in South Pass in the state 's southeastern tip . The marshy area is home to prime waters for shrimp and other seafood .

AP2010 ON THE GULF OF MEXICO -- Political patience was whittling away for BP executives who ca n't stop a broken underwater well from pouring oil into the Gulf where crews tried the latest solution -- submerging a second containment box designed to funnel the gusher to a waiting tanker . In back-to-back U.S. Senate inquiries on Tuesday , lawmakers chastised officials from BP PLC and its drilling partners over attempts to shift blame to each other . They were asked to explain a `` cascade of failures '' that led to the catastrophic explosion on aboard a drilling rig and the blown-out wellhead that has spewed at least 4 million gallons of oil into the Gulf over three weeks . `` If this is like other catastrophic failures of technological systems in modern history , whether it was the sinking of the Titanic , Three Mile Island , or the loss of the Challenger , we will likely discover that there was a cascade of failures and technical and human and regulatory errors , '' said Sen. Jeff Bingaman , D-N.M. , chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee . Later Tuesday , a crane lifted the new box from the deck of the Viking Poseidon , one of the more than a dozen boats helping the containment effort , and lowered it into the sea about 50 miles off the Louisiana coast , a process expected to last several hours or more . The first box sunk last week weighed 100 tons and company officials had hoped it could contain 85 percent of the oil . However , it was never tried at such depths -- about a mile below the surface -- and in 40-degree water . A slushy mixture of gas and water clogged the opening in the top of the peaked box and it was cast aside . The latest box is much smaller -- just 2 tons . It wo n't be placed over the spewing well right away because engineers want to make sure everything is configured correctly and avoid the same buildup , BP spokesman Bill Salvin said . Crews also planned to pump in heated water and methanol so ice wo n't amass . It could be in place by Thursday . Lawmakers ' focus was on what failures may have led to the disaster . The corporate finger pointing prompted an admonishment from Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of oil-rich Alaska that `` we are all in this together '' in trying to shut off the oil and find a safer way to exploit vital energy . `` This accident has reminded us of a cold reality , that the production of energy will never be without risk or environmental consequence , '' she said . Still , she said , `` there will be no excuse '' if operators are found to have violated the law . `` Let me be really clear , '' Lamar McKay , chairman of BP America , told the hearing . `` Liability , blame , fault -- put it over here . '' He said : `` Our obligation is to deal with the spill , clean it up and make sure the impacts of that spill are compensated , and we 're going to do that . '' By `` over here , '' McKay meant the witness table at which BP , Transocean and Halliburton executives sat shoulder to shoulder . And despite his acknowledgment of responsibility , each company defended its own operations and raised questions about its partners in the project gone awry . In the crowded hearing room , eight young activists sat in quiet protest , with black T-shirts saying , `` Energy Should n't Cost Lives . '' Several wore black painted spots near their eyes to symbolize tear drops made from oil . The spreading disaster in the Gulf intensified the political impatience all the way to the White House . `` The president is frustrated with everything , the president is frustrated with everybody , in the sense that we still have an oil leak , '' spokesman Robert Gibbs said . Uncertainty over what was happening a mile underwater seemed to confuse Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , who was touring the Alabama coast . While admitting it had not been verified , she said there was cause for hope that the spill was slowing down because tests indicated less oil and more natural gas was coming out . But BP spokesman Mark Proegler said there has always been a mixture of gas and oil coming up and that scientists have n't noticed any significant change in the leak . Senators sought assurances that BP PLC will pay what could amount to billions of dollars in economic and environmental damages . McKay repeatedly said his company would pay for cleanup costs and all `` legitimate '' claims for damages , and not try to limit itself to an existing federal limit of $ 75 million on such damages . BP was the exploratory well 's owner and overall operator , Transocean , the rig 's owner and Halliburton , a subcontractor that was encasing the well pipe in cement before plugging it in anticipation of future production . The April 20 explosion is thought to have begun with a surge of methane gas from deep within the well , and while the cause is still under early investigation , testimony provided some insight into what might have been involved . Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama grew frustrated grilling the executives on why engineers replaced a heavy `` mud '' compound in the well with much lighter sea water when they were temporarily capping the site for future exploitation . `` I 'm not familiar with the individual procedure on that well , '' McKay said . Steven Newman , Transocean 's president and CEO , and Halliburton executive Tim Probert repeatedly told Sessions they did not know how often sea water instead of the compound was used to seal Gulf wells . `` Well , you do this business , do you not ? '' `` You 're under oath . I 'm just asking you a simple question . '' New Jersey Democrat Frank Lautenberg remarked in the day 's other hearing : `` The conclusion that I draw is that nobody assumes the responsibility . '' McKay said that a key piece of safety equipment , the aptly named blowout preventer , had failed to work and made it clear it was owned by Transocean . `` That was the fail safe in case of an accident , '' said McKay . But Transocean 's Newman said offshore production projects `` begin and end with the operator , in this case BP '' and that his company 's drilling job was completed three days before the explosion and there 's `` no reason to believe '' the blowout protector mechanics failed . Halliburton 's Probert said his company followed BP 's drilling plan , federal regulations and industry practices .

On Friday , President Obama bluntly said of the situation , `` the system failed , and it failed badly . '' Earlier this week oil companies who do business in the Gulf of Mexico endured a sound thrashing from Senators on Capitol Hill seeking answers for what happened . The motive behind these hearings , which the president deemed a `` ridiculous spectacle , '' was not nefarious . We should discover exactly what happened and what we can do in the future to make sure it 's never repeated . We should demand an independent investigation , as was done after the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 , to determine what went wrong and how we can improve drilling in the future . In fact , after Exxon Valdez , Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act which created a new oil spill trust fund to guarantee payment for future spills and smarter contingency planning for responding to future accidents . An investigation today may yield a need to utilize new safety standards and update OPA . After all , available technology today is dramatically different than what it was two decades ago . But amidst this push for answers we can not ignore the reality of America 's energy needs . Many lawmakers have lost sight of this and are using the Gulf oil spill as political ammunition to torpedo offshore drilling . Senator Bill Nelson -LRB- D-Fla . -RRB- said any new energy bill with expanded offshore drilling provisions would be `` dead on arrival '' in the wake of the Gulf spill . Senator Robert Menendez -LRB- D-N.J. -RRB- likened offshore drilling to `` Russian roulette '' \\* for America 's beaches . Senator Ben Cardin -LRB- D-Md . -RRB- asked President Obama , `` in light of the devastating BP oil spill , '' to remove the Atlantic coast from consideration for offshore drilling . Their concerns for oil development safety are valid , but their solution is unsound . A recent letter from those Senators to President Obama noted that `` the costs and benefits of offshore drilling need to be reassessed . '' Such an assessment is necessary , although the Senators wo n't like the results . Consider : According to the Minerals Management Service , which oversees offshore drilling in the U.S. , the Gulf 's 3,500 platforms produce 1.2 million barrels of oil per day , or 30 % of all domestic production , and support more than 35,000 jobs . Put another way , offshore drilling in the Gulf employs the equivalent of a small U.S. city and keeps us from sending an astounding $ 35 billion every year to countries like Venezuela and Iran . The current spill will have enormous environmental impacts , but would halting offshore drilling fix that ? The National Academy of Sciences found that tankers carrying oil from other countries account for four times as much spillage as offshore platforms , countries on whom we 'd have to depend more for our oil . Stopping drilling thus puts the environment in more jeopardy , not less . It 's also important to note that while many advocates for a `` clean energy future '' want to reduce our dependence on foreign oil through a panacea of windmills and solar panels , their solution does not work . Wind and solar provide electricity , not transportation fuel , and oil provides only about 1 % of America 's electricity . So what 's the best way to fix the problem ? After the Russians launched Sputnik in 1957 and America saw it was losing the space race , the Defense Department created what would become the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency -LRB- DARPA -RRB- to guarantee that America would not lose its technological superiority . Given that where we get our energy constitutes an economic and national security issue , we should tackle this problem in a similar manner by researching and developing the safest drilling technology in the world . This is how America responds to national crises . We tackle the problem head on , fix it , and move forward . President Obama articulated this perfectly when he acknowledged drilling is part of our energy strategy , and that `` our job to make sure this kind of mess does n't happen again . '' We do not , and should not , stop in our tracks , litigate , and move backward as some in Congress are proposing . Affordable and reliable energy are requirements for American prosperity , not luxuries that can be abandoned . We should push for safer energy , not zero energy .

'' Earlier this week , executives of BP , Transoceans and Halliburton blamed each other for the widening environmental catastrophe at back-to-back Senate hearings . `` I did not appreciate what I considered to be a ridiculous spectacle during the congressional hearings into this matter , '' Obama said in brief remarks from the Rose Garden . `` The American people could not have been impressed with that display and I certainly was n't . ...

'' Obama vowed to halt the `` cozy relationship '' between oil companies and federal regulators , as he called for new permitting rules and procedures governing offshore oil drilling . Obama said he has ordered Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to do a `` top-to-bottom '' reform of the Minerals and Management Service , the agency now under fire for allowing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico without requiring oil companies to provide necessary permits from a separate agency . `` For too long , a decade or more , there 's been a cozy relationship between the oil companies and the federal agencies that permits them to drill , '' he said . `` Seems as if permits were too often issued based on a little more than assurances of safety from the oil companies . '' `` That can not and will not happen anymore , '' he said , adding that the government `` will trust , but we will verify . '' Salazar has called for a plan to split the agency in two . One agency would be charged with inspecting oil rigs , investigating oil companies and enforcing safety regulations , while the other would oversee leases for drilling and collection of billions of dollars in royalties . That would separate the agency 's two core responsibilities , which critics say are diametrically opposed -- making money off the industry , while also cracking down on it in ways that may affect the industry 's bottom line . Environmental groups have criticized the agency for giving the Deepwater Horizon a `` categorical exclusion '' from a environmental impact study of the operation or a serious assessment of its inherent risks . That exemption was granted 11 days before the underwater exploratory rig exploded . The agency , which is part of the Interior Department , has also given a light regulatory touch to other offshore projects . Obama also said that no one knows exactly how much oil is leaking because human inspectors can not reach the mile-deep well head . He said he would not rest until the leak is stopped , the oil is contained and cleaned up , and people of the Gulf region resume normal lives . Fox News ' Major Garrett contributed to this report .

BP ROBERT , Louisiana -- BP was confident Saturday its latest experiment using a mile-long pipe would capture much of the oil flowing into the Gulf of Mexico , even as the company disclosed yet another setback in the environmental disaster . Engineers hit a snag when they tried to connect two pieces of equipment a mile below the water 's surface . BP PLC chief operating officer Doug Suttles said one piece of equipment , called the framework , had to be brought to the water 's surface so that adjustments could be made to where it fits with the long tube that connects to a tanker above . The framework holds a pipe and stopper , and engineers piloting submarine robots will try to use it to plug the massive leak and send the crude through the lengthy pipe to the surface . `` The frame shifted , so they were unable to make that connection , '' said Suttles , who believes the adjustments will make the device work . At least 210,000 gallons of oil has been gushing into the Gulf of Mexico since an oil rig exploded April 20 and sank two days later . Eleven people were killed in the blast . BP 's latest idea seems to have the best chance for success so far , said Ed Overton , a LSU professor of environmental studies . At the surface this would be easy , Overton said , but using robots in 5,000 feet of water with oil gushing out of the pipe makes things much more difficult . `` It 's something like threading the eye of a needle . But that can be tough to do up here . And you can imagine how hard it would be to do it down there with a robot , '' Overton said . The tube could capture more than three-quarters of the leak ; BP also must contend with a smaller leak that 's farther away . If the tube works , it would be the first time the company has been able to capture any of the oil before it fouls the Gulf waters . A week ago , the company tried to put a massive box over the leak , but icelike crystals formed and BP scrapped that plan . BP is also drilling a relief well that is considered the permanent solution to stopping the leak . It 's about halfway done and still months away from being completed . The company also is still considering using a smaller containment dome known as a `` top hat , '' as well as a `` junk shot , '' in which golf balls and rubber would be inserted to try to clog the leak . Meanwhile , BP began spraying undersea dispersants at that leak site and said the chemicals appear to have reduced the amount of surface oil . This unprecedented use of chemical dispersants underwater , and the depth of the leak has created many unknowns regarding environmental impact , and researchers hurriedly worked to chart its effects . Researchers from the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology reported this week that they had detected large oil plumes from just beneath the surface of the sea to more than 4,000 feet deep . Researchers Vernon Asper and Arne Dierks said in Web posts that the plumes were `` perhaps due to the deep injection of dispersants which BP has stated that they are conducting . '' Three or four large plumes have been found , at least one that is 10 miles long and a mile wide , said Samantha Joye , a marine science professor supporting the mission from her University of Georgia lab . These researchers were also testing the effects of large amounts of subsea oil on oxygen levels in the water . The oil can deplete oxygen in the water , harming plankton and other tiny creatures that serve as food for a wide variety of sea critters . Oxygen levels in some areas have dropped 30 percent , and should continue to drop , Joye said . `` It could take years , possibly decades , for the system to recover from an infusion of this quantity of oil and gas , '' Joye said . `` We 've never seen anything like this before . It 's impossible to fathom the impact . '' Joye 's lab was waiting for the research boat to return so a team of scientists can test about 75 water samples and 100 sediment samples gathered during the voyage . Researchers plan to go back out in about a month and sample the same areas to see if oil and oxygen levels have worsened . Federal regulators on Friday approved the underwater use of the chemicals , which act like a detergent to break the oil into small globules and allow it to disperse more quickly into the water or air before it comes ashore . The decision by the Environmental Protection Agency angered state officials and fishermen , who complained that regulators ignored their concerns about the effects on the environment and fish . `` The EPA is conducting a giant experiment with our most productive fisheries by approving the use of these powerful chemicals on a massive , unprecedented scale , '' John Williams , executive director of the Southern Shrimp Alliance , said in a news release . Louisiana Health and Hospitals Secretary Alan Levine sent a letter to BP outlining similar concerns , but the company and the Coast Guard said several tests were done before approval was given . `` We did n't cross this threshold lightly , '' Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said . `` This is a tool that will be analyzed and monitored . '' As crews worked to limit the environmental hazards , Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano pressured BP to make clear whether the company would limit how much it will pay for clean up and compensation to those hurt by the spill . In a letter to chief executive Tony Hayward , she noted that he and other executives have said they are taking full responsibility for cleaning up the spill and will pay what they call `` legitimate '' claims . Napolitano said the government believes this means BP will not limit its payments to a $ 75 million cap set by law for liability in some cases . `` The public has a right to a clear understanding of BP 's commitment to redress all of the damage that has occurred or that will occur in the future as a result of the oil spill , '' Napolitano wrote . On Friday , President Barack Obama assailed oil drillers and his own administration as he ordered extra scrutiny of drilling permits . He condemned the shifting of blame by oil executives and denounced a `` cozy relationship '' between the companies and the federal government .

Chris Oynes , the associated director of the Offshore Energy and Minerals Management Program within the Mineral Management Service at the Interior Department , announced his departure in an e-mail to his staff . President Obama , meanwhile , has decided to have a presidential commission investigate the cause of the rig explosion that unleashed millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , where engineers are struggling after three weeks to stop the flow . The presidential panel will be similar to ones that examined the Challenger space shuttle disaster and Three Mile Island nuclear power plant accident , said a White House official , speaking on condition of anonymity because the decision had not been formally announced . Oynes is responsible for the Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas program , as well as developing and implementing the new alternative energy program . Oynes ' biography on the Mineral Manager Service 's website notes that he has been involved in how the agency conducts its resource projections , environmental reviews and operational safeguards . He also was directly responsible for 30 lease sales . The agency specifically has been accused of being too cozy with the oil and gas lessees it oversees . In Congress , more attention was focused on the Gulf spill . Sen. Barbara Boxer , D-Calif . , and seven other senators asked the Justice Department to determine whether BP PLC made false and misleading claims to the government about its ability to prevent a serious oil spill when it applied for permission last year to drill the Deepwater Horizon well that has unleashed environmental havoc along the Gulf coast . But lawmakers are taking aim not only at BP at hearings this week , but also the Interior Department 's regulation of offshore drilling that allowed BP to operate without assurance a massive spill could be prevented . Anticipating tough questioning on Capitol Hill at hearings this week , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Monday announced a tightening of requirements for onshore oil and gas drilling . The new measures would not apply to oil rigs at sea . `` The BP oil spill is a stark reminder of how we must continue to push ahead with the reforms we have been working on and which we know are needed , '' Salazar said . Oynes is the first person to resign at his agency since an April 20 explosion at the Deepwater Horizon oil rig sunk the rig and caused the massive oil spill . The spill continues to grow as oil officials and federal authorities race to stop the flow and protect the coast . Rep. Darrell Issa , R-Calif . , ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , issued a statement saying that Oynes ' departure is a start . `` For more than a decade spanning three administrations , MMS has been a corrupt agency with an extensive history of mismanagement . This was n't the doing of one , single person , but rather the culmination of a bureaucratic breakdown . Removing one person might be a start , but MMS is in need of an exhaustive overhaul and comprehensive reform , '' Issa said .

BP BP 's mile-long tube is only collecting about one-fifth of the oil spewing into the Gulf of Mexico , its executives said Monday . The energy giant 's chief operating officer , Doug Suttles , said the tube has been siphoning more than 1,000 barrels a day , or 42,000 gallons , in an interview Monday with NBC 's `` Today Show . '' BP has estimated about 5,000 barrels a day , or 210,000 gallons a day , has been leaking out . Suttles said they hope to be able to collect more oil as they ramp up the effort but they wo n't be able to get all of it . In a major step toward containing the massive oil leak , BP PLC crews on Sunday hooked up the tube to funnel the crude into a tanker ship . However , millions of gallons of crude are already in the Gulf . The contraption was hooked up successfully and sucking oil from a pipe at the blown well Sunday afternoon after being hindered by several setbacks . Engineers remotely guiding robot submersibles had worked since Friday to place the tube into a 21-inch -LRB- 53-centimeter -RRB- pipe nearly a mile -LRB- 1.6 kilometers -RRB- below the sea . Kent Wells , BP 's senior vice president for exploration and production , said during a news conference that the amount being drawn was gradually increasing , and it would take several days to measure it . Company spokesman Mark Proegler at the joint spill command center in Louisiana had initially said the tube was containing most of the oil coming from the pipe , which is contributing an estimated 85 percent of the crude in the spill . In a statement Sunday , BP said that the tube was `` successfully tested and inserted into the leaking riser , capturing some amounts of oil and gas . '' `` While not collecting all of the leaking oil , this tool is an important step in reducing the amount of oil being released into Gulf waters , '' BP said . Previous attempts to use emergency valves and a 100-ton container had failed to stop the leak that has spilled millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf , threatening sea life , commercial fishing and the coastal tourism industry from Louisiana to Florida . BP PLC has also been burning small amounts of floating oil and spraying chemical dispersants above and below the surface . The tube 's success gave crews partial control of the leak for the first time in more than three weeks . Oil has been spewing since the rig Deepwater Horizon exploded April 20 , killing 11 people and sinking two days later . The government shortly afterward estimated the spill at 210,000 gallons -LRB- 795,000 liters -RRB- -- or 5,000 barrels -- a day , a figure that has since been questioned by some scientists who fear it could be far more . BP executives have stood by the estimate while acknowledging there 's no way to know for sure . Researchers warned Sunday that miles-long -LRB- kilometers-long -RRB- underwater plumes of oil from the spill could poison and suffocate sea life across the food chain , with damage that could endure for a decade or more . Researchers have found more underwater plumes of oil than they can count from the blown-out well , said Samantha Joye , a professor of marine sciences at the University of Georgia . She said careful measurements taken of one plume showed it stretching for 10 miles -LRB- 16 kilometers -RRB- , with a 3-mile -LRB- 5-kilometer -RRB- width . The hazardous effects of the plume are twofold . Joye said the oil itself can prove toxic to fish swimming in the sea , while vast amount of oxygen are also being sucked from the water by microbes that eat oil . Dispersants used to fight the oil are also food for the microbes , speeding up the oxygen depletion . `` So , first you have oily water that may be toxic to certain organisms and also the oxygen issue , so there are two problems here , '' said Joye , who 's working with a group of scientists who discovered the underwater plumes in a recent boat expedition to the Gulf . `` This can interrupt the food chain at the lowest level , and will trickle up and certainly impact organisms higher . Whales , dolphins and tuna all depend on lower depths to survive . '' She said it could take years or even decades for the ecosystem to recover . BP has been casting about for ways to contain the leak since it was discovered several days after the blast . First robot submarines were unable to get valves to work on machinery at the well head called the blowout preventer . Then the company failed to capture the oil with a 100-ton box after icelike crystals formed in it . A relief well , considered the permanent solution the leak , is still being drilled and is months away from completion . The Associated Press contributed to this report .

Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen told another committee that the growing size and scattershot nature of the spill were creating `` severe challenges '' in containing it and cleaning it up .

The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee was set to address the spill at a hearing Wednesday . Government scientists were surveying the Gulf to determine if the oil had entered a powerful current that could take it to Florida and eventually up the East Coast .

American voters think the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico will cause more damage than Hurricane Katrina , according to a Fox News poll . As the oil spill enters its fourth week , the poll also finds that support for increasing offshore drilling continues to erode , though a majority still favors it . When asked which disaster will cause more damage , 50 percent of voters say the gulf oil spill , while 36 percent say Hurricane Katrina .

There 's little difference in views regionally , as about half of those living in all areas agree the oil spill will be worse . Overall , 54 percent of voters favor increasing offshore drilling for oil and gas in U.S. coastal areas . That 's down from 60 percent two weeks ago and a high of 72 percent in 2009 .

AP GRAND ISLE , La. -- Officials closed the public beach here Friday as thick gobs of oil resembling melted chocolate washed up , a very visible reminder of the blown-out well that has been spewing crude into the Gulf of Mexico for a month . Up to now , only tar balls and a light sheen had come ashore . But oil was starting to hit the beach at this island resort community in various forms -- light sheens , orange-colored splotches and heavier brown sheets -- said Chris Roberts , a local official who surveyed the area Friday morning . `` It 's difficult to clean up when you have n't stopped the source , '' said Roberts , a councilman for Jefferson Parish , which stretches from the New Orleans metropolitan area to the coast . `` You can scrape it off the beach but it 's coming right back . '' BP PLC was leasing the Deepwater Horizon rig when it exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers and triggering the massive spill . The company conceded Thursday what some scientists have been saying for weeks : More oil is flowing from the leak than BP and the Coast Guard had previously estimated . There has been frustration with the pace of efforts to stop the oil , and BP said Friday that it will likely be at least Tuesday before crews can begin a process known as a `` top kill '' that would stop the flow by shooting heavy drilling mud into the well . Brown and vivid orange globs and sheets of foul-smelling oil the consistency of latex paint have also begun coating the reeds and grasses of Louisiana 's wetlands , home to rare birds , mammals and a rich variety of marine life . A deep , stagnant ooze sat in the middle of a particularly devastated marsh off the Louisiana coast where Emily Guidry Schatzel of the National Wildlife Federation was examining stained reeds . `` This is just heartbreaking , '' she said with a sigh . `` I ca n't believe it .

The BP executive in charge of fighting the spill , Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles , said he understands the public is frustrated with the response . He told the CBS `` Early Show '' on Friday that in the worst case scenario , the gusher could continue until early August , when a new well being drilled to cap the flow permanently could be finished . But Suttles said he believes the rich Gulf environment will recover , in part because it is a large body of water and has withstood other oil spills . `` I 'm optimistic , I 'm very optimistic that the Gulf will fully recover , '' Suttles said on CBS . A live video feed of the underwater gusher , posted online after lawmakers exerted pressure on BP , shows what appears to be a large plume of oil and gas still spewing into the water next to the stopper-and-tube combination that BP inserted to carry some of the crude to the surface . The House committee website where the video was posted promptly crashed because so many people were trying to view it . At least 6 million gallons have gushed into the Gulf since the explosion , more than half of what the Exxon Valdez tanker spilled in Alaska in 1989 . A growing number of scientists believe it 's more . BP spokesman Mark Proegler told The Associated Press on Thursday that the mile-long tube inserted into a leaking pipe over the weekend was at one point capturing 210,000 gallons of oil a day -- the total amount the company and the Coast Guard have estimated is gushing into the sea -- but some was still escaping . He would not say how much . Suttles said Friday that the pipe is capturing an average of about 84,000 gallons a day , though the amount varies depending on what 's happening on the seafloor . Washington , meanwhile , has turned up the pressure on BP . The Obama administration asked the company to be more open with the public by sharing such information as measurements of the leak and the trajectory of the spill . BP has been accused of covering up the magnitude of the disaster . Also , the Environmental Protection Agency directed BP to employ a less toxic form of the chemical dispersants it has been using to break up the oil and keep it from reaching the surface . BP is marshaling equipment to try the `` top kill , '' which involves pumping heavy mud into the top of the blown-out well to try to plug the gusher . If it does n't work , the backup plans include a `` junk shot '' -- shooting golf balls , shredded tires , knotted rope and other material into the well to clog it up . `` We 're now looking at a scenario where response plans include lighting the ocean on fire , pouring potent chemicals into the water , and using trash and human hair to stop the flow of oil , '' said Michael Brune , executive director of the Sierra Club , in a letter to President Barack Obama calling for a formal moratorium on new offshore drilling permits . `` If this is the backup plan , we need to rethink taking the risk in the first place . '' Patience was wearing thin among state and local officials who called on Obama to take a larger role in the fight against oil invading the Louisiana coast . `` We 've given BP enough time , '' said Jefferson Parish Councilman John Young .

The Gulf oil spill began after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded off the coast of Louisiana on April 20 , killing 11 workers .

But Gibbs added that `` the president has told the team to spare nothing in trying to cap this well . '' Gibbs said he did not think that the oil spill would be the administration 's `` Hurricane Katrina , '' which deeply wounded President George W. Bush 's second term . Gibbs said the Obama administration is aggressively dealing with the aftermath of the spill . `` Well , I think if you look back at what happened in Katrina , the government was n't there to respond to what was happening . That , quite frankly , was the problem , even tracking the hurricane for days and knowing fairly precisely where it was going to hit , '' Gibbs said . `` I think the difference in this case is , we were there immediately . We have been there ever since . '' Gibbs agreed that government and the oil companies do n't get into a cozy relationship . `` We have to regulate this industry . We have to make sure that their safety standards are up to the very latest and highest standards whenever they do something like this , drilling in such a precious ecosystem as the Gulf of Mexico , '' Gibbs said . Palin too said she still supports offshore drilling , but also thinks oil companies need to be accountable for accidents . `` I am still a strong supporter of domestic energy supplies being extracted . Having said that , these oil companies have got to be held accountable when there is any kind of lax and preventative measures to result in a tragedy like we 're seeing right now in the Gulf , '' she said . As the administration continues to fight the perception that it has n't done enough to cap the gusher , three top Obama administration officials were returning to the Gulf Coast to monitor the spill response . U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief Lisa P. Jackson headed there to Louisiana on Sunday while Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano were to lead a Senate delegation to the region on Monday to fly over affected areas and keep an eye on the response . Obama also named a special independent commission to review what happened and the Justice Department has also been down on the scene to `` gather information '' though Gibbs would not say whether a criminal investigation is underway . Meanwhile , Coast Guard Commandant Thad Allen , who 's leading the official response , said he understands the frustration . `` If anybody is frustrated with this response , I would tell them their symptoms are normal , because I 'm frustrated , too , '' Allen said . `` Nobody likes to have a feeling that you ca n't do something about a very big problem .

AP2010 BARATARIA BAY , La. -- As the Gulf of Mexico oil spill seeps deeper into the Louisiana marshes , the fragile grasses get difficult to clean , and the rescue efforts of wildlife like the brown pelican become harder . The biggest looming uncertainty of all -- when will BP be able stop the leak ? With each day , the anger and questions grow with the untold millions of gallons of oil that has spewed into the Gulf since an offshore rig exploded more than a month ago . BP PLC is getting barges and other equipment ready to prepare for a risky procedure midweek that the company hopes will finally halt the gusher . But the `` top kill '' maneuver , which shoots heavy mud and then cement into the blown well , has never been tried at 5,000 feet underwater and BP officials caution they are working on a range of backup plans . Even if it works , the damage has been done . On Sunday , some brown pelicans coated in oil could n't fly away on Barataria Bay of the Louisiana coast . All they could do was hobble . Their usually brown and white feathers were jet black , and eggs were glazed with rust-colored gunk . When wildlife officials tried to rescue one of the pelicans , the birds became spooked . Officials were n't sure whether they would try again , and U.S. Fish and Wildlife spokeswoman Stacy Shelton said it is sometimes better to leave the animals alone than to disturb their colony . Pelicans are especially vulnerable to oil . Not only could they eat tainted fish and feed it to their young , but they could die of hypothermia or drown if they 're soaked in oil . Just six months ago , the birds had been removed from the federal endangered species list . Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano were to lead a Senate delegation to the region Monday to fly over affected areas . Obama administration officials continued defending their response while criticizing BP , which leased the rig and is responsible for the cleanup . Salazar said he was `` not completely '' confident that BP knows what it 's doing . `` If we find they 're not doing what they 're supposed to be doing , we 'll push them out of the way appropriately , '' Salazar said . But federal officials have acknowledged that BP has expertise that they lack in stopping the deep-water leak . With oil pushing at least 12 miles into Louisiana 's marshes and two major pelican rookeries now coated in crude , Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said the state has begun work on a chain of berms , reinforced with containment booms , that would skirt the state 's coastline . `` As we talk , a total of more than 65 miles of our shoreline now has been oiled , '' Jindal said . Jindal , who visited one of the affected pelican nesting grounds Sunday , said the berms would close the door on oil still pouring from a mile-deep gusher about 50 miles out in the Gulf . The berms would be made with sandbags ; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers also is considering a broader plan that would use dredging to build sand berms across more of the barrier islands . At least 6 million gallons of crude have spewed into the Gulf , though some scientists have said they believe the spill already surpasses the 11 million-gallon 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska as the worst in U.S. history . A mile-long tube operating for about a week has siphoned off more than half a million gallons in the past week , but it began sucking up oil at a slower rate over the weekend . Even at its best , the effort did not capture all the oil leaking . The spill 's impact now stretches across 150 miles , from Dauphin Island , Ala. to Grand Isle , La. . At Barataria Bay , globs of oil soaked through containment booms set up in the area . Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser said BP needed to send more booms . He said it would be up to federal wildlife authorities to decide whether to try to clean the oil that has already washed ashore . `` The question is , will it do more damage because this island is covered with the mess ? '' Officials have considered some drastic solutions for cleaning the oil -- like burning or flooding the marshes -- but they may have to sit back and let nature take care of it . Plants and pelican eggs could wind up trampled by well-meaning humans . If the marshes are too dry , setting them ablaze could burn plants to the roots and obliterate the wetlands . Flooding might help by floating out the oil , but it also could wash away the natural barriers to flooding from hurricanes and other disasters -- much like hurricanes Katrina and Rita washed away marshlands in 2005 . State and federal officials spent millions rebuilding the much-needed buffer against tropical storms . On Sunday , oil reached an 1,150-acre oyster ground leased by Belle Chasse , La. , fisherman Dave Cvitanovich . He said cleanup crews were stringing lines of absorbent boom along the surrounding marshes , but that still left large clumps of rust-colored oil floating over his oyster beds . Mature oysters might eventually filter out the crude and become fit for sale , but this year 's crop of spate , or young oysters , will perish . `` Those will die in the oil , '' Cvitanovich said . `` It 's inevitable .

BARATARIA BAY , La. -- The executive in charge of fighting a Gulf of Mexico oil spill acknowledged Monday everyone is frustrated at BP 's failure to plug the ocean gusher more than a month into a disaster that is spreading damage in Louisiana 's wetlands , including miring pelican colonies . Doug Suttles , chief operating officer at BP PLC , went on all three U.S. network morning talks shows with the same message : BP knows frustration is growing that it has n't been able to halt the spill of millions of gallons of oil from a well that blew out after a rig explosion April 20 off the Lousiana coast . `` We are doing everything we can , everything I know , '' Suttles said on the NBC `` Today '' show . The Obama administration questioned BP 's competence Sunday , when Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar told reporters he was `` not completely '' confident that BP knows what it 's doing . `` If we find they 're not doing what they 're supposed to be doing , we 'll push them out of the way appropriately , '' Salazar said . Asked about Salazar 's criticism , Suttles said BP is working with experts from other oil companies and the government to find a solution . `` What I do know is , everyone is frustrated . I think the people of the region are frustrated . I know we are , I know the government is , '' Suttles said on NBC . `` The fact that it 's taken this long is painful to everybody . '' Suttles said on ABC 's '' Good Morning America '' that BP 's next shot at plugging the well this week stands a very good chance of success . But he said the global oil company has more plans in case the latest efforts fails , like several before it . BP plans to use heavy mud and cement to stop the breach , a maneuver called a top kill . Suttles said on the CBS `` Early Show '' the effort should start Wednesday morning and they 'll know the same day if it works . The White House said Sunday the Justice Department has been gathering information about the oil spill . Press secretary Robert Gibbs did n't say whether the department has opened a criminal investigation . He would only tell CBS ' `` Face the Nation '' that department representatives have been to the Gulf as part of the response to the oil leak . Salazar and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano were to lead a Senate delegation to the region Monday to fly over affected areas . BP said Monday its costs for responding to the spill had grown to about $ 760 million , including containment efforts , drilling a relief well to stop the leak permanently , grants to Gulf states for their response costs and paying damage claims . BP said it 's too early to calculate other potential costs and liabilities . Even if BP 's top kill procedure works this week , the damage has been done . On Sunday , some brown pelicans coated in oil could n't fly away on Barataria Bay of the Louisiana coast . All they could do was hobble .

At a recent White House meeting on the oil spill , the president reportedly snapped , `` just plug the damn hole . '' `` Obviously he 's frustrated as the rest of the people are , particularly along the Coast , '' White House energy adviser Carol Browner told Fox News . `` We want this thing to shut down . '' Obama was in no mood Tuesday to discuss the spill after praising the Small Business Administration for the work it has done to help those affected by the disaster . At the Rose Garden event celebrating small businesses , Obama refused to answer a question shouted out by a reporter on whether he has confidence in BP to plug the hole . With anger building , Obama will travel to the region Friday for the second time . Unlike the first time , he 'll see the sludgy catastrophe from the shore . Meanwhile , Coast Guard Commandant Thad Allen retired Tuesday . He will , however , remain national incident commander of the spill . `` This job will be needed for a long long time because of the natural resources damage assessments and the clean up that will be doing on , '' he said . The new Coast Guard commandant , Adm. Robert Papp , compared it to a sprint relay race . `` I had to be up to speed to be ready to take that baton , '' Papp said . `` I think we 're there .

The blast killed 11 workers . Since then , oil has been pouring into the Gulf from a blown-out undersea well at a rate of at least 210,000 gallons per day . BP is going in for the kill . The trick is to do the job quickly and cleanly . As early as dawn Wednesday , the oil company will try to choke the gusher at the bottom of the sea by force-feeding it heavy drilling mud and cement . The tactic , called a `` top kill , '' is routinely used above ground but has never been tried 5,000 feet underwater . If it 's not done just right , it could make the leak worse . BP CEO Tony Hayward pegged its chances of success in this case at 60 percent to 70 percent . Engineers were doing at least 12 hours of diagnostic tests Tuesday . They planned to check five spots on the well 's crippled five-story blowout preventer to make sure it could withstand the heavy force of the mud . A weak spot in the device could blow under the pressure , causing a brand new leak . Bob Bea , an engineering professor at the University of California at Berkeley , estimated that anything above 1.6 million gallons a day would be too much for a top kill to work . Live video of the leak has been available online for the past few days . Rep. Edward J. Markey , D-Mass . , said he learned that it would be shut off while BP attempts the top kill . But BP said late Tuesday that it has agreed at the request of the Obama administration to show video of the top kill . Recently , the video has shown the underwater plume getting significantly darker . A top oil engineering expert says that suggests heavier , more-polluting oil is spewing out . The color of the oil gushing from the main pipe has changed in color from medium gray to black . Two scientists noticed the change , which oil company BP downplayed as a natural fluctuation that is not likely permanent . If the top kill does n't work , or makes the problem worse , BP will probably turn to a containment box resting on the seafloor . It is a smaller version of the 100-ton box the company lowered several weeks ago in hopes of capturing much of the oil . That larger device was clogged with ice crystals and BP had to abandon it , but the company hopes the smaller version might work better . BP says it siphoned more oil with a mile-long tube after two days of falling totals from a leaking seafloor well in the Gulf of Mexico . BP PLC spokesman John Curry told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the tube collected some 256,200 gallons of oil on Monday . The collections were further evidence that a previous estimate -- that the entire spill was 210,000 gallons a day -- was too low . BP is complying with the government 's request to use less of a toxic dispersant in fighting the Gulf oil spill , but alternative dispersants are n't so readily available , the White House 's energy adviser said Tuesday . In a letter to BP last week , the Environmental Protection Agency gave the oil giant three days to find a less toxic alternative to the dispersant , Corexit 9500 , that it is using to break up the oil . But in a series of meetings that followed , White House energy adviser Carol Browner said , it became clear the alternatives were not as widely available as needed . Staff members at an agency that oversees offshore drilling accepted tickets to sports events , lunches and other gifts from oil and gas companies and used government computers to view pornography , according to an Interior Department report alleging a culture of cronyism between regulators and the industry . In at least one case , an inspector for the Minerals Management Service admitted using crystal methamphetamine and said he might have been under the influence of the drug the next day at work , according to the report by the acting inspector general of the Interior Department . The report cites a variety of violations of federal regulations and ethics rules at the agency 's Louisiana office . Previous inspector general investigations have focused on inappropriate behavior by the royalty-collection staff in the agency 's Denver office . President Barack Obama , seeking to show command of a crisis that has exasperated the nation , will head back to Louisiana on Friday to review efforts to stop the disastrous Gulf oil spill . The White House announced Obama 's trip but did not yet release details of exactly where he will go . The president will be in Louisiana for the day on Friday , flying there from Chicago , where he will be spending the long holiday weekend , and returning there at night . Eleven men who died in the offshore rig explosion that triggered the Gulf oil spill were honored at a somber memorial service with tributes from country music stars and drilling company executives . Transocean , owner of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig , organized the event , held under tight security at the Jackson Convention Complex . It was impossible to judge the reactions of those attending . Reporters were n't allowed inside but were ushered to a room where the service was broadcast on closed-circuit television . The Gulf of Mexico oil spill has constantly been measured against the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster , which leaked nearly 11 million gallons of crude , killed countless animals and tarnished the owner of the damaged tanker , Exxon . Yet the leader of botched containment efforts in the critical hours after the tanker ran aground was n't Exxon Mobil Corp. . It was BP PLC , the same firm now fighting to plug the Gulf leak . People who had a front row seat to the Alaska spill tell The Associated Press that BP 's actions in the Gulf suggest it has n't changed much at all . As the thick oil from the BP spill bubbles through the Gulf of Mexico , threatening sea life and wetlands , foodies are taking up knife , fork and wine glass to defend the equally vulnerable reputation of the coast 's seafood industry . The New Orleans Wine and Food Experience , an annual celebration of the city 's love of all things tasty , is pairing wines from around the world with the cooking of some of the city 's best chefs to help deliver the message : Louisiana seafood is still safe , available and delicious . Florida tourism officials are taking to the airwaves to try and combat worries over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . The Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association is running radio advertisements across the U.S. that say `` our coast is clean and our beaches are open . '' It 's also running a full-page ad in USA Today with a similar message . The Coast Guard says around 100 tar balls have been recovered throughout the Florida Keys in the last week , but none have been linked to the massive Gulf of Mexico spill . Capt. Pat DeQuattro said Tuesday an early analysis has been able to rule out that the tar balls came from the Deepwater Horizon spill . More analysis is needed to determine where they did come from .

The White House is being pounded for not acting more aggressively in the month-old oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico . The administration is hitting back , mostly at BP . Louisiana is threatening to take matters into its own hands . The truth is , the government has little direct experience at either the national or state level at stopping deepwater oil leaks -- and few realistic options . With the oil flowing and spreading at a furious rate , President Barack Obama has accused BP of a `` breakdown of responsibility . '' He named a special independent commission to review what happened . But the administration seems to want to have it both ways -- insisting it 's in charge while also insisting that BP do the heavy lifting . The White House is arguing that government officials are n't just watching from the sidelines , but also acknowledging there 's just so much the government can do directly . `` They are 5,000 feet down . BP or the private sector alone have the means to deal with that problem down there . It 's not government equipment that is going to be used to do that , '' Coast Guard Commandant Thad Allen told a White House briefing on Monday . `` They are the responsible party . But we have the authority to direct them , '' he added . There are political risks both ways . If the federal government took control somehow , it would own the problem and any failure would belong to Obama . But the flip side is that Obama could suffer politically if his administration is seen as falling short of staying on top of the problem or not working hard to find a solution . All of BP 's attempts to stop the leak have failed . It was to try another technique on Wednesday in which heavy mud and cement would be shot into the well to plug it up . White House energy adviser Carol Browner made the rounds of morning television news shows on Tuesday , expressing continued frustration but also voicing hope that Wednesday 's procedure would succeed where others have failed . As to who is running the show , `` We have been in charge and we 'll continue to be in charge . But clearly BP has expertise and that needs to be brought to bear , '' she told CBS . In the past , the government has turned to oil industry experts to deal with oil disasters . It famously recruited legendary oil well fighters Paul N. `` Red '' Adair and Edward `` Coots '' Matthews to help in the first Iraq war . Retreating Iraqi troops deliberately spilled 462 million gallons of oil into the Persian Gulf and set more than 700 oilfield fires . After the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska , Congress dictated in the 1990 Oil Pollution Act that oil companies be responsible for dealing with major accidents -- including paying for all cleanup -- with oversight by federal agencies . That has pretty much been the model ever since . And the administration insists that 's exactly what it is doing -- although clearly not everyone agrees . Anger grows as the slick spreads and washes ashore into environmentally sensitive marshes and waterways . Nerves are frayed and finger-pointing in full swing . The administration says it is losing patience with BP PLC 's efforts . `` If we find they 're not doing what they 're supposed to be doing , we 'll push them out of the way appropriately , '' Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told reporters outside BP 's headquarters in Houston on Sunday . Just what did Salazar mean by `` push them out of the way '' ? Officials have struggled since in explaining . `` That 's more of a metaphor , '' the Coast Guard 's Allen said Monday . '' ` Push BP out of the way ' would raise the question -- replace them with what ? '' Allen , responsible for oversight of the spill response , said he 's frustrated too , along with other Americans . Salazar and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano led a Senate delegation to the region Monday . `` We are going to stay on this and stay on BP until this gets done and it gets done the right way , '' Napolitano said after flying over the affected area . Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal , a Republican , has taken swipes at BP and other oil companies involved in the disaster as well as the federal government . Jindal said he was going to call out members of the Louisiana National Guard to join state wildlife and fisheries agents to supplement a federal response he called inadequate . In particular , Jindal assailed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for failing to sign off on a plan to build a chain of protective sand barriers -- or berms -- off the coast to help block the oil . `` We are not waiting for them . We are going to build it '' ourselves , Jindal said . U.S. officials say the Corps is nearing a final decision . The spill began April 20 after the Deepwater Horizon rig owned by driller Transocean and leased by BP exploded , killing 11 workers . Millions of gallons of oil have spewed from the blown well . Doug Suttles , chief operating officer at BP PLC , made the round of network news shows Monday with the same message : `` We are doing everything we can , everything I know . '' He said the energy giant , formerly known as British Petroleum , understands and shares everyone 's frustration . But history is n't encouraging when it comes to underwater ruptures . The last major spill in the Gulf was in June 1979 , when an offshore drilling rig in Mexican waters -- the Ixtoc I -- blew up , releasing 140 million gallons of oil . The well was owned by Mexico 's state oil company , known as Pemex . It took Pemex and a series of U.S. contractors nearly nine months to cap the well , and a great deal of the oil contaminated Mexican and U.S. waters . If patience is necessary , it is n't a particularly forthcoming quality in these tense times . Even as strong an Obama ally as Democratic consultant James Carville has been taking shots at the administration . A Louisiana native , Carville told CNN the administration was `` risking everything by this ` go along with BP ' strategy . ... If you let BP handle it ... it 's not going to go away . It is a disaster of the first magnitude and they 've got to go to Plan B. '' EDITOR 'S NOTE : Tom Raum covers economics and politics for The Associated Press .

Accepting gifts from the oil companies . Apparently , all that went on in the Lake Charles , Louisiana office of the federal Minerals Management Service between 2000 and 2008 . And some of the workers involved were inspectors on offshore drilling platforms in the Gulf of Mexico . The long and troubling list of employee behavior is outlined in a new report from the Interior Department 's Inspector General . The IG released her findings early because of attention to the BP oil spill . Acting Inspector General Mary Kendall says her greatest concern is the cozy relationships between federal inspectors and oil companies , and how easily inspectors move back and forth between industry and government . For example , the report found one worker conducted four inspections on an oil company platform while he was actively negotiating for a job with that same company . The investigation also found that oil companies invited inspectors to all kinds of events including `` skeet-shooting contests , hunting and fishing trips , golf tournaments , crawfish boils and Christmas parties . '' Investigators confirmed that inspectors attended many of these events . Investigators found emails containing porn or links to porn sites . They found additional emails containing racist or sexist humor . Two workers admitted using illegal drugs . Perhaps the most damning allegation was that some inspectors allowed oil company workers to fill out the federal inspection forms . The inspector general was not able to conclusively substantiate that tip from a confidential source . Interior Secretary Ken Salazar responded to the report in a statement , calling it `` deeply disturbing '' and `` further evidence of the cozy relationship between some elements of MMS and the oil and gas industry . '' But Salazar was quick to defend his own record . Both he and the inspector general point out that the report covers ethical lapses before he became Interior Secretary . Salazar notes that he implemented new ethics rules in 2009 . He has asked the inspector general to expand her investigation to the period after 2009 , looking into any possible failures to enforce standards at the Deepwater Horizon oil platform . Some of the employees mentioned in the report have resigned , been fired or referred for prosecution . The rest are on administrative leave . Several weeks after the BP oil spill Salazar announced that he would break up the Minerals Management Service , reorganizing it into three separate bureaus . -LRB- Fox 's Kristin Brown contributed to this report . -RRB- FOX News covers the action from all the angles .

AP2010 WASHINGTON -- Responding to the massive BP oil spill , Congress is getting ready to quadruple -- to 32 cents a barrel -- a tax on oil used to help finance cleanups . The increase would raise nearly $ 11 billion over the next decade . The tax is levied on oil produced in the U.S. or imported from foreign countries . The revenue goes to a fund managed by the Coast Guard to help pay to clean up spills in waterways , such as the Gulf of Mexico . The tax increase is part of a larger bill that has grown into a nearly $ 200 billion grab bag of unfinished business that lawmakers hope to complete before Memorial Day . The key provisions are a one-year extension of about 50 popular tax breaks that expired at the end of last year , and expanded unemployment benefits , including subsidies for health insurance , through the end of the year . The House could vote on the bill as early as Wednesday , though Democrats were still working Monday to round up the votes . Democratic leaders had wanted to hold a vote Tuesday . There has been little public opposition to the oil tax from the petroleum industry . But the overall bill would add about $ 134 billion to the federal budget deficit , drawing opposition from Republicans and some Democrats . Senate leaders hope to complete work on the bill before Congress goes on a weeklong break next week . The Obama administration issued a statement Monday supporting the bill . Lawmakers want to increase the current 8-cent-a-barrel tax on oil to make sure there is enough money available to respond to oil spills . At least 6 million gallons of crude have spewed into the Gulf of Mexico since a drilling rig exploded April 20 off the Louisiana coast . President Barack Obama and congressional leaders have said they expect BP to foot the bill for the cleanup . `` Taxpayers will not pick up the tab , '' Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nev . BP executives told Congress last week they would pay `` all legitimate claims '' for damages . But the government needs upfront money to respond to spills , as well as money to pay for cleanups when the responsible party is unable to pay , or is unknown . Money spent from the fund can later be recovered from the company responsible for the spill . The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund has about $ 1.5 billion available . Under current law , only $ 1 billion can be spent from the fund on a single incident . The bill would increase the spending limit to $ 5 billion . The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the tax increase was hastily put together , without adequate study , to help pay for an unrelated bill . The tax increase was unveiled Thursday , without any congressional hearings to study its impact . `` I have seen no analysis on how this would impact energy security , how this would impact domestic production , how this would impact the overall economics in the country , '' said Christopher Guith , vice president of the chamber 's energy institute . `` There has n't been any sort of deliberation on this . '' Guith said the tax could be passed on to consumers , depending on the ability of oil companies to raise gas prices in response to a tax increase . Lawmakers felt the tax increase , to 32 cents a barrel , was reasonable , said Rep. Sander Levin , D-Mich . , chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee . `` We just decided to take a look at what we thought would be a reasonable increase , '' Levin said . The American Petroleum Institute has not taken a position on the tax increase , though a spokeswoman said Congress should study the ramifications before acting . `` We understand we need to have an insurance policy in order to cover people in the event of a spill , '' said the spokeswoman , Cathy Landry . `` At the same time we need to have a vital oil and gas industry . '' The bill does not address a federal law that caps liability at $ 75 million for economic damages beyond direct cleanup costs . Democratic Senators tried to pass a bill last week that would have increased the cap to $ 10 billion , but they were blocked by Republicans . The oil industry says such a high cap would make it difficult , if not impossible , to insure oil rigs . BP said Monday its costs for responding to the spill had grown to about $ 760 million .

U.S. Coast Guard Some Louisiana fishermen affected by the massive oil spill in the Gulf -- including some hired by BP to help in the cleanup -- are reporting cases of debilitating headaches , burning eyes and nausea , and some industry and public officials are pointing the finger at chemical dispersants as the cause . Gary Burris , a fisherman who works along the Gulf Coast , said he has observed planes spraying dispersants into the water , a chemical rain meant to stop oil slicks from forming and break down the crude more quickly . Now Burris says that after breathing in the dispersants he grew ill and disoriented , confining himself to bed for days and ultimately going to a doctor for treatment and antibiotics . `` It filled my lungs with fluid , '' he said . `` I 'm hurting -- I 'm sore from coughing . '' Burris and other residents of the Gulf are reporting a slew of symptoms that some biologists say are directly attributable to the chemicals now gushing into the Gulf on a daily basis . `` These are the exact symptoms that you could expect from overexposure to crude oil and to the chemicals that are being used out on the cleanup , '' said Riki Ott , a marine toxicologist and activist who worked on the cleanup in Alaska after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill . Ott said she had been in contact with several Louisiana fishermen suffering a range of ailments -- `` sore throats , burning headaches , burning eyes , skin rashes , nausea , dizziness '' -- that track with those suffered in the aftermath of the Valdez spill . The dispersants , she says , compound the health risks created by exposure to crude oil . `` This is like throwing kerosene on a fire , '' she said . BP has sprayed more than 800,000 gallons of dispersant into the Gulf since an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig on April 20 . At the same time , the oil giant has been enlisting the paid help of Gulf fishermen , whose fleet of hundreds of boats provides them broad access to areas affected by the spill . BP 's '' Vessels of Opportunity '' program employs commercial fishermen to hem in surface oil and help clean oil clumping along the coast , creating work for the industry likely to suffer most in the fallout from the oil spill . But critics say the rudimentary safety training given to the fishermen is n't enough . While BP 's `` key requirements '' include a four-hour training session and a dockside examination by the Coast Guard , the company does not appear to be providing special Hazmat equipment for the ad hoc cleanup crews . `` We are not seeing correct personal protection equipment , '' said Clint Guidry , secretary of the Louisiana Shrimp Association , who touted his own experience with toxins from working on oil rigs before he became a fisherman . Guidry 's colleague , Acy Cooper , gave a blunt assessment of the situation faced by fishermen patrolling the Gulf 's oily waters . `` They 're putting themselves at risk ... -LRB- with -RRB- nothing to protect themselves , '' he said Thursday . `` Their eyes are burning , their noses are burning , but all of them need to go -- they need the money . '' The Coast Guard referred inquiries about the health of service members patrolling the Gulf to a unified command team set up by BP . Calls and an e-mail message sent to BP seeking comment about their safety measures were not returned . Some fishermen aiding in the cleanup are reluctant to speak out against BP in public for fear of losing their temporary jobs , while others are willing to abide the hazards in order to keep earning paychecks from the company , according to fishermen who spoke to FoxNews.com . `` The problem is some of the fishermen do n't want to lose the jobs they 've got , '' said George Barisich , head of the United Commercial Fishermen 's Association . `` Kind of a Catch-22 situation . '' Members of Congress are now demanding better safety precautions for fishermen surrounding the use of dispersants in order to protect those involved in the cleanup . Rep. Edward Markey , chairman of the House subcommittee on energy and the environment , criticized BP for ignoring a directive from the Environmental Protection Agency to use less toxic chemicals to help disperse the oil . `` The release of hundreds of thousands of gallons of chemicals into the Gulf of Mexico could be an unprecedented , large and aggressive experiment on our oceans , '' said Markey , a Democrat from Massachusetts . '' -LRB- T -RRB- he reality is we know almost nothing about the potential harm from the long-term use of any of these chemicals on the marine environment in the Gulf of Mexico , and even less about their potential to enter the food chain and ultimately harm humans , '' Markey said in a written statement Sunday . Rep. Charlie Melancon , D-La . , is urging the White House to establish temporary health clinics in the Gulf to help afflicted workers . `` Many residents and volunteers are being exposed to hazardous materials on a daily basis , and some will have to travel hours to get treatment at the nearest health care facility , '' he said in a letter to Kathleen Sebelius , secretary of Health and Human Services . `` It is imperative that temporary health care clinics be established to provide basic health care services in this geographic area . '' Melancon argued that BP should foot the bill for the clinics if any are set up , though it remains unclear how many would be necessary or how long they would be required . `` What is most frightening about the long-term effects of the oil and the dispersant chemicals is n't what we know , it is what we just do n't know , '' said Markey .

AP COVINGTON , La. -- COVINGTON , La. -LRB- AP -RRB- -- The Gulf oil spill has surpassed the Exxon Valdez as the worst in U.S. history , according to new estimates released Thursday , but the Coast Guard and BP said an untested procedure to stop it seemed to be working . A team of scientists trying to determine how much oil has been flowing since the offshore rig Deepwater Horizon exploded April 20 and sank two days later found the rate was more than twice and possibly up to five times as high as previously thought . Even using the most conservative estimate , that means the leak has grown to nearly 19 million gallons over the past five weeks , surpassing the size of the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska , which at about 11 million gallons had been the nation 's worst spill . Under the highest Gulf spill estimate , nearly 39 million gallons may have leaked , enough to fill 30 school gymnasiums . `` Now we know the true scale of the monster we are fighting in the Gulf , '' said Jeremy Symons , vice president of the National Wildlife Federation . `` BP has unleashed an unstoppable force of appalling proportions . '' BP did not immediately comment on the new estimate . U.S. Geological Survey Director Marcia McNutt said two different teams of scientists calculated that the well has been spewing between 504,000 and more than a million gallons a day . BP and the Coast Guard estimated soon after the explosion that about 210,000 gallons a day was leaking , but scientists who watched underwater video of well had been saying for weeks it was probably more . Last week , BP inserted a mile-long tube to siphon some of the oil into a tanker . The tube sucked up 924,000 gallons , but engineers had to dismantle it so they could start the risky procedure known as a top kill to try to cut off the flow altogether by shooting heavy drilling fluid into the well . If that works , BP will inject cement into the well to seal it . The top kill has been used above ground but has never been tried 5,000 feet beneath the sea . BP pegged its chance of success at 60 to 70 percent . Lt. Commander Tony Russell , an aide to Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , said Thursday that the mud was stopping some oil and gas but had a ways to go before it proved successful . The top kill started Wednesday night and it could be several days before officials know if it is working . `` As you inject your mud into it , it is going to stop some hydrocarbons , '' Russell said . `` That does n't mean it 's successful . '' BP spokesman Tom Mueller also discounted news reports that the top kill had worked . `` We appreciate the optimism , but the top kill operation is continuing through the day today -- that has n't changed , '' he said Thursday morning . `` We do n't anticipate being able to say anything definitive on that until later today . '' Oil is coating birds and delicate wetlands along the Louisiana coast , and the political fallout from the spill has reached all the way to Washington , where the head of the federal agency that oversees offshore drilling resigned Thursday . Minerals Management Service Director Elizabeth Birnbaum stepped down just hours before a planned White House press conference where President Barack Obama was expected to extend a moratorium on new deepwater oil drilling . Birnbaum and her agency came under withering criticism from lawmakers of both parties over lax oversight of drilling and cozy ties with industry . An internal Interior Department report released earlier this week found that between 2000 and 2008 , agency staff members accepted tickets to sports events , lunches and other gifts from oil and gas companies and used government computers to view pornography . Birnbaum had run the service since July 2009 . After receiving the results of a 30-day safety review from Interior Secretary Ken Salazar , Obama also planned to delay controversial lease sales off the coast of Alaska and cancel entirely plans for drilling lease sales in the Western Gulf and off the coast of Virginia , according to a White House aide . Polls show the public is souring on the administration 's handling of the catastrophe , and fishermen , hotel and restaurant owners , politicians and residents along the 100-mile stretch of Gulf coast affected by the spill are fed up with BP 's failures to stop the oil . `` I have anxiety attacks , '' said Sarah Rigaud , owner of Sarah 's Restaurant in Grand Isle , La. , where the public beach was closed because blobs of oil that looked like melted chocolate had washed up on shore . `` Every day I pray that something happens , that it will be stopped and everybody can get back to normal . '' The Coast Guard pulled commercial fishing boats from oil cleanup efforts in Breton Sound off the Louisiana coast on Wednesday after several people became ill . Crew members on three vessels reported nausea , dizziness , headaches and chest pains , the Coast Guard said . Four people were hospitalized , including one who was flown to a hospital . If the top kill fails , BP says it has several backup plans , including sealing the well 's blowout preventer with a smaller cap , which would contain the oil . An earlier attempt to cap the blowout preventer failed . BP could also try a `` junk shot '' -- shooting golf balls and other debris into the blowout preventer to clog it up -- during the top kill process . The only permanent solution is drilling a second well , but that will take a couple of months . BP plans to go ahead with that even if the top kill works . Borenstein reported from Washington .

Coast Guard via AP Oil giant BP PLC told congressional investigators that a decision to continue work on an oil well in the Gulf of Mexico after a test warned that something was wrong may have been a `` fundamental mistake , '' according to a memo released by two lawmakers Tuesday . The document describes a wide array of mistakes in the fateful final hours aboard the Deepwater Horizon -- but the main revelation is that BP now says there was a clear warning sign of a `` very large abnormality '' in the well , but work proceeded anyway . The rig exploded about two hours later . The congressional memo outlines what the lawmakers say was a briefing for congressional staff by BP officials early Tuesday . Company representatives provided a preliminary report on their internal investigation of the April 20 disaster , which killed 11 workers and continues to spill thousands of barrels of oil daily into the Gulf of Mexico . The new developments come as President Barack Obama , working to tame a political storm over the spill , is expected to announce Thursday that the government will impose tougher safety requirements and more rigorous inspections on off-shore drilling operations . According to the memo , BP identified several other mistakes aboard the rig , including possible contamination of the cement meant to seal off the well from volatile natural gas and the apparent failure to monitor the well closely for signs that gas was leaking in , the congressmen wrote in their post-meeting memo . An immense column of natural gas , erupting from the oil well , fueled the fireball that destroyed the rig . A BP spokesman declined to comment on the memo 's specific statements . He said the company had identified `` what we believe to be a series of underlying failures '' that caused the accident . Although the memo identifies some of the problems that led to these mistakes , it does n't identify who made the key decisions . Most of the work aboard the rig was performed by employees of Transocean Ltd. , the rig 's owner and operator , and other contractors , but BP had managers aboard the rig to supervise the work at the time of the accident .

We do not know just how much oil has really been gushing into the Gulf of Mexico . Some estimates of the flow of oil exploding from the sea floor put the volume equal to the Exxon Valdez spill -- every four days . We do not know where that oil will eventually go . Some scientists believe that the prevailing winds will force the oil deeply into the coasts of Louisiana , Alabama , and Mississippi , while currents will carry the oil west to Texas and east to Florida . Some projections have the oil being carried up the East Coast , to Canada , and then to Europe . Huge plumes of undersea oil , some of it frozen for now , may move into any sea and onto any beach in the world . We do not know how much of the oil will make landfall , where it will make landfall , or what the oil will do to the fish and wildlife of the Gulf Coast when it does make landfall . We do not know how to completely eliminate the oil from our beaches , rivers , and precious wetlands . It is sobering to realize that oil still remains from the Exxon Valdez spill , a spill that occurred over 20 years ago . We do not know whether the hundreds of thousands of gallons of chemical dispersants being used to break up the oil will prove far worse than the oil itself . These dispersants , which are highly toxic in their own right , can cause the oil to sink and settle on the delicate coral reefs of the Gulf . Indeed , we do not know whether any of the few remaining coral reefs of the Gulf will even survive this poisoning . We do not know if the shrimp , the oysters , or the fish will ever come back . We do not know whether the dolphins and the turtles will survive this ordeal , or if they will simply leave or die . We do not know if the complex system of living things will be able to tolerate this catastrophe , or if the Gulf will be a dead sea , poisoned by oil and chemicals -- and greed . We do not know what effects this oil spill will have on the economy of the South or the nation 's economy for that matter . We do not know what impact it will have at the gas pump . We do not know how many jobs will be lost . We do not know how many communities will be wiped out . We do not know how many irreplaceable , invaluable , and distinctly American heritages along the Gulf Coast will be lost . We do not even know when the oil will stop . The `` Top Hat , '' the `` Junk Shot , '' and the `` Top Kill , '' all are just theories that BP would like to try or have unsuccessfully tried . A relief well is the most certain solution , but even this approach will take months and is very difficult to accomplish on land . At a mile below the surface , the uncertainty grows exponentially . However , we do know a few things : - We know that BP will act consistent with its own interests . It always has , and always will . Make no mistake ; this foreign oil company will first and foremost protect itself . If this means creating an information campaign designed to make people think that it will be fully accountable when the reality could not be further from the truth , then so be it . - If it means approaching fisherman at their lowest point and trying to get them to sign away their only chance at real , meaningful compensation later for a few thousand dollars now , then BP will do this too . - If it means spending more on lawyers than it does on clean up to avoid paying what it owes , then BP will do it . - We know that the government will not be able to solve this problem . - We know that the government chose to neglect close supervision of BP 's action even knowing BP 's long and remarkable history of serious safety violations and significant criminal conduct . - We know three years before the spill , the government inexplicably agreed with BP that any spills would likely be `` sublethal . '' - We know that after the spill , the government can not even get the key government employee responsible for overseeing BP to appear before Congress . - We know that the government can not get BP to stop using the chemicals being pumped into the ocean at a horrific rate . We know the government will not be able to help us in this situation . So , what can be done ? Who can help us ? At this point , our only hope is that the American people will take this matter into their own hands , use the laws and the civil process that exist to right these types of wrongs , and hold BP and the other companies involved accountable .

AP BP has launched a two-pronged attempt to plug the blown-out oil well in the Gulf of Mexico using heavy mud and dense rubber balls , but the company 's CEO said it wo n't be clear for 48 hours whether the efforts will stop the massive oil spill . CEO Tony Hayward said in an interview Friday morning that the `` junk shot '' method -- which pumps rubber and other man-made material into the gushing well -- has been added to the `` top kill , '' which has been slowing the flow of oil by pumping mud into the source since Thursday . Speaking on the same program , U.S. incident commander Thad Allen said the flow of oil and gas from the broken well has been stopped , but that the real test will be whether the stoppage can be sustained . `` The real challenge is to put enough mud into the well to keep the pressure where they can put a cement plug over the top , '' he said on ABC 's Good Morning America . The next 12 to 18 hours will be `` very critical '' in the attempt to protect the fragile ecosystem in the Gulf , which is being overwhelmed by the largest oil spill in U.S. history . Hayward said BP 's efforts have been going `` pretty well according to plan , '' and that the company planned to begin pumping more mud into the well again later today . President Obama arrived Friday in the Gulf , where he planned to tour a beach with Allen and visit with local officials . A day earlier , he acknowledged that his administration could have done a better job dealing with the spill and that it misjudged the industry 's ability to handle a worst-case scenario . `` I take responsibility . It is my job to make sure that everything is done to shut this down , '' he said . Friday 's trip was the president 's second to the coast since the BP-leased oil rig Deepwater Horizon exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers and triggering the spill . He will be briefed in Grand Isle , La. , where the public beach has been closed since globs of oil started washing up a week ago . Buggie Vegas , who owns Bridge Side Cabins and Marina there , said Obama needs to see the disaster for himself . `` I think he 's going to get the message when he comes down and sees how bad it is , '' Vegas said . The top kill is oil and gas giant BP PLC 's latest untested bid to end a spill that has , by the most conservative estimate , surpassed the Exxon Valdez disaster by gushing more than 18 million gallons into the Gulf . It has worked on land but never been tried 5,000 feet underwater , and Hayward gave it a 60 to 70 percent chance of success . He said Friday morning the top kill was progressing as planned and BP engineers had completed a second phase by pumping what he called `` loss prevention material '' into a crippled piece of equipment known as a blowout preventer to form a bridge against which crews could pump more heavyweight mud . `` Clearly I 'm as anxious as everyone in America is to get this thing done , '' Hayward said . If the top kill fails , BP 's next best hope for controlling even part of the leak is a tinier version of something that has already been tried : a steel containment box to cap the well . A 100-ton box lies junked on the ocean floor , abandoned by BP after ice-like crystals clogged it . While BP officials say the smaller box should n't have that problem , it 's clearly not their preferred method . It has been sitting in reserve on the seabed for more than a week while engineers first tried to siphon off oil through a mile-long tube . That succeeded in collecting 924,000 gallons before crews took it out to allow room for the top kill attempt . If the small box does n't work , BP officials say they will go back to the tube , crossing their fingers that a relief well still weeks away from being drilled far enough to affect the leak will help stop the bleeding . And even that 's not a sure bet . Obama said Thursday that authorities insisted BP drill a second relief well as a backup since such wells often miss their mark . BP said in a regulatory filing Friday that it has spent $ 930 million so far responding to the ruptured well , including costs for cleanup and prevention work , drilling relief wells , and paying grants to Gulf states , damage claims and federal costs . BP says it 's too early to quantify other potential costs and liabilities associated . Two teams of scientists calculated the well has been spewing between 504,000 and more than a million gallons a day , which in the worst-case scenario means about 39 million gallons could have leaked . The larger figure would be nearly four times the size of the Exxon Valdez disaster , in which a tanker ran aground in Alaska in 1989 , spilling nearly 11 million gallons . The new Gulf spill estimates released Thursday were far higher than the 210,000 gallons that BP and the Coast Guard had guessed was pouring from the well . But even the highest estimate would not make the spill the biggest ever in the Gulf . In 1979 , a drilling rig in Mexican waters -- the Ixtoc I -- blew up , releasing 140 million gallons of oil .

But President Obama 's decision to skip the traditional Memorial Day ceremony in Arlington while on his second vacation since the BP oil spill began has some wondering what the schedule says about his priorities . On `` vacation , '' Obama still holds staff meetings , occasionally attends local events and often gets his `` relaxation '' time swallowed up by pressing national and international business -- his vacation to Hawaii in December coincided with the attempted Christmas Day airline bombing . The retreat this weekend is marked by a side-trip to Louisiana to inspect the damages from the oil spill . But some conservatives , still smarting over the criticism George W. Bush fielded for his frequent trips to Crawford , Texas , say Obama 's trip to Chicago over Memorial Day weekend is conspicuously poor in its timing . Obama , who was headed to Chicago Thursday night , will not be at Arlington National Cemetery for the Memorial Day ceremony -- which he attended last year . Instead , the president plans to be at Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery in Elwood , Ill. , while Vice President Biden takes his place in Arlington for the wreath-laying at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier . Pete Hegseth , director of the conservative Vets for Freedom , said he does n't want to `` extrapolate too much , '' but questioned why a war-time president would not pencil in that ceremony . `` It does n't mean he does n't care , but I think it is a reflection of priorities , '' he said . `` We 're still at war ... and he 's not called out to the carpet on that . '' Dana Perino , former Bush White House press secretary , called the decision a `` curious choice . '' `` I do think that symbolically that probably was not a very good choice , '' she told Fox News . The Arlington visit is a fairly recent tradition . Former President Ronald Reagan attended four of them in his eight years in office , while former President George H.W. Bush sent Vice President Dan Quayle to every one . Former President Bill Clinton , though , attended every year and George W. Bush missed only one , in 2002 , when he was in Normandy , France , visiting the American cemetery . Philip Molfese , a Chicago-based Democratic political consultant , said Obama will still be able to `` pay tribute '' at the Lincoln National Cemetery . And he dismissed the idea that Obama would somehow be stepping away from the oil spill crisis in the Gulf while in Chicago . The president plans to visit the Gulf coast Friday before returning to the Windy City . `` He 's never really out of touch with what 's happening , '' said Molfese , president of the political firm Grainger Terry , Inc. `` These guys are never off the clock . ... They 're constantly surrounded by people , they 're constantly getting updates . Whether they 're operating in Chicago or they 're operating in the White House , they 're still going to be getting constant communication . '' The White House has tried to fend off suggestions that it has not acted forcefully enough to mitigate the damage from the oil spill -- Obama held a full-scale press conference Thursday afternoon where he spoke extensively about mitigation efforts . The Obamas have not made an extensive visit to Chicago in more than a year and in a sense are trying to make good on prior pledges to visit their home town more often . But critics point out that the trip is their second since the Gulf oil rig exploded April 20 -- the first family traveled to Asheville , N.C. , that weekend .

The blast killed 11 workers . Since then , oil has been pouring into the Gulf from a blown-out undersea well at a rate of at least 210,000 gallons per day . BP 's chief executive cautioned Friday that it will be two more days before anyone knows if the latest fix attempt will stop the oil spewing into the sea . Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said Friday the mud was able to push down the oil and gas coming up at great force from underground , but had not overwhelmed the gusher or stopped the flow . President Barack Obama arrived on the Gulf Coast to tell residents they are not alone in dealing with the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . He inspected a fouled beach and pledged that the government would `` keep at it '' until the spill that has become the worst in U.S. history is stopped and cleaned up . He also had a message for Gulf residents . `` I 'm here to tell you that you are not alone , you will not be abandoned , you will not be left behind , '' he said . `` The media may get tired of the story , but we will not . We will be on your side and we will see this through . '' Friday 's trip was the president 's second to the coast since the BP-leased oil rig Deepwater Horizon exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers and triggering the spill . BP said in a regulatory filing Friday that it has spent $ 930 million so far responding to the ruptured well , including costs for cleanup and prevention work , drilling relief wells , and paying grants to Gulf states , damage claims and federal costs . BP says it 's too early to quantify other potential costs and liabilities . As Americans grow more outraged by the spill , and frustrated at the fumbling efforts to stop it , President Barack Obama announced new steps to restrict drilling , including the suspension of planned exploratory drilling off the coasts of Alaska and Virginia and ordering a halt to 33 exploratory deep-water rigs in the Gulf of Mexico . From the Arctic Ocean to the Chesapeake Bay , the decision announced Thursday is stirring passions on both sides of the issue . Some politicians , especially in Virginia where lease sales scheduled for 2012 were canceled , are accusing Obama of a `` knee-jerk '' reaction that could bring to a halt to their expected economic boon from drilling . But many who make their living from Virginia 's waters say Obama is right to tread carefully in the wake of the devastation in the Gulf . President Barack Obama says he is ordering an increase in manpower in the Gulf Coast to deal with the massive oil spill . Obama says he will triple the manpower in places where oil has already hit the shore or is within 24 hours of doing so . The president says the increase will help contain the spill more quickly and minimize the amount of time oil is on the coastline . Since last month 's rig explosion and spill of millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , more than 3 million feet of so-called boom has been deployed along the coast . But it 's not a fail-safe method of keeping the oil from washing ashore . It 's not always sturdy enough and high winds and waves can send the slime cascading over the barriers . The key line of defense is sometimes defenseless itself against the elements . `` Even if it 's working properly , the best it will do is move the problem somewhere else , '' said Doug Helton , incident operations coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Emergency Response Division . A thick , 22-mile plume of oil discovered by researchers off the BP spill site was nearing an underwater canyon , where it could poison the food chain for sea life in the waters off Florida . The discovery by researchers on the University of South Florida College of Marine Science 's Weatherbird II vessel is the second significant undersea plume reported since the Deepwater Horizon exploded on April 20 . The plume is more than 6 miles wide and its presence was reported Thursday . The cloud was nearing a large underwater canyon whose currents fuel the food chain in Gulf waters off Florida and could potentially wash the tiny plants and animals that feed larger organisms in a stew of toxic chemicals , another researcher said Friday . An annual list of top 10 beaches released Friday includes two in Florida . The list 's creator says he 's not worried about pollution from the oil spill . Dr. Stephen Leatherman , director of Florida International University 's Laboratory for Coastal Research , who is also known by the nickname Dr. Beach , included Siesta Beach in Sarasota and Cape Florida State Park in Key Biscayne , on his list of best beaches . He said Cape Florida , on the southeast coast , `` does n't get the wave activity '' that can lead to tar balls washing up . As for Siesta Beach , he said he had looked at currents and believes `` there 's very low probability the oil will get to southwest Florida . '' The No. 1 beach on this year 's list is Coopers Beach in Southampton , N.Y. , on the east end of Long Island .

AP ROBERT , Louisiana -- BP admitted defeat Saturday in its attempt to plug the Gulf of Mexico oil leak by pumping mud into a busted well , but is readying yet another approach after repeated failures to stop the crude that 's fouling marshland and beaches . BP PLC Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said the company determined the `` top kill '' had failed after it spent three days pumping heavy drilling mud into the crippled well 5,000 feet underwater . More than 1.2 million gallons of mud was used , but most of it escaped out of the damaged riser . In the six weeks since the spill began , the company has failed in each attempt to stop the gusher , as estimates of how much oil is leaking grow more dire . The spill is the worst in U.S. history -- exceeding even the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster -- and dumping between 18 million and 40 million gallons into the Gulf , according to government estimates . `` This scares everybody , the fact that we ca n't make this well stop flowing , the fact that we have n't succeeded so far , '' Suttles said . `` Many of the things we 're trying have been done on the surface before , but have never been tried at 5,000 feet . '' The company failed in the days after the spill to use robot submarines to close valves on the massive blowout preventer atop the damaged well , then two weeks later ice-like crystals clogged a 100-ton box the company tried placing over the leak . Earlier this week , engineers removed a mile-long siphon tube after it sucked up a disappointing 900,000 gallons of oil from the gusher . Frustration has grown as drifting oil closes beaches and washes up in sensitive marshland . The damage is underscored by images of pelicans and their eggs coated in oil . Below the surface , oyster beds and shrimp nurseries face certain death . President Barack Obama visited the coast Friday to see the damage as he tried to emphasize that his administration was in control of the crisis . He told people in Grand Isle , where the beach has been closed by gobs of oil , that they would n't be abandoned . After BP announced the top kill failure , Obama said from Chicago that the continued flow of oil into the Gulf is `` as enraging as it is heartbreaking . '' Suttles said BP is already preparing for the next attempt to stop the leak that began after the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded on April 20 , killing 11 people . The company plans to use robot submarines to cut off the damaged riser from which the oil is leaking , and then try to cap it with a containment valve . The effort is expected to take between four and seven days . `` We 're confident the job will work but obviously we ca n't guarantee success , '' Suttles said of the new plan , declining to handicap the likelihood it will work . He said that cutting off the damaged riser is n't expected to cause the flow rate of leaking oil to increase significantly . The permanent solution to the leak , a relief well currently being drilled , wo n't be ready until August , BP says . Experts have said that a bend in the damaged riser likely was restricting the flow of oil somewhat , so slicing it off and installing a new containment valve is risky . `` If they ca n't get that valve on , things will get much worse , '' said Philip W. Johnson , an engineering professor at the University of Alabama . Johnson said he thinks BP can succeed with the valve , but added : `` It 's a scary proposition . '' Word that the top-kill had failed hit hard in fishing communities along Louisiana 's coast . `` Everybody 's starting to realize this summer 's lost . And our whole lifestyle might be lost , '' said Michael Ballay , the 59-year-old manager of the Cypress Cove Marina in Venice , Louisiana , near where oil first made landfall in large quanities almost two weeks ago . Johnny Nunez , owner of Fishing Magician Charters in Shell Beach , Louisiana , said the spill is hurting his business during what 's normally the best time of year -- and there 's no end in sight . `` If fishing 's bad for five years , I 'll be 60 years old . I 'll be done for , '' he said after watching BP 's televised announcement .

AP In what is measuring up to be the biggest environmental disaster in U.S. history , the government is nearly helpless to stop the oil flowing from the Deepwater Horizon well that exploded in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20 . The White House said Sunday that it expects the spill to grow by 20 percent after BP gets started with its latest effort to contain the spill , beginning Monday or Tuesday . The White House also said it is tripling its environmental cleanup crew . But the additional spillage is opposite what BP Managing Director Bob Dudley said on `` Fox News Sunday '' -- that the decision to cut open the pipes in order to put a cap on the well will likely not add to the amount of oil flowing into the water . `` What we need is a clean cut across the top of that riser package at the bottom of the sea . The amount of oil will not change . The oil was coming out anyway from just above it at a broken area of the pipe at the end of the pipe . So that is not going to change the flow , '' he said . President Obama 's top environmental adviser Carol Browner said Sunday the government is responding with what she called the largest environmental mobilization effort ever , but it looks like it could be up to BP to dig a new well before the gushing spill stops pouring into the Gulf of Mexico . `` There 's not just one being dug , there are two . Because we insisted -- the government insisted that there be a second one in case something went wrong with the first one , '' Browner said on NBC 's '' Meet the Press . '' That 's after BP 's `` top kill '' effort to plug the hole with hundreds of thousands of pounds of mud failed . BP is looking at the next alternative -- trying to grab the oil that 's spilling into the water and move it onto a vessel that will pull the oil onshore . `` Obviously that 's not the preferred scenario . We always knew that the relief well was the permanent way to close this , to get it killed so there was n't oil coming up while the relief well was being drilled was the second option . Now we move to the third option which is to contain it , '' Browner said . The federal government has placed 150 scientists on the case , and concerns have been raised to BP about putting additional pressure on the leaking well that could make the spill worse . The government estimates that 12,000-19 ,000 barrels of oil are being released daily from 5,000 feet below the sea . Estimates are at about 18 million to 40 million gallons have been dumped into the Gulf since the explosion . Dudley said after the last containment dome failed because ice crystals formed in the pipe , scientists learned to pump warm sea water down the column of the pipe to prevent the same kind of problems while trying to get the oil up into the vessel . Dudley said he was hopeful the odds of success are greater than the 60 to 70 percent odds put on the top kill method . `` We feel like the percentages are better that we 'll be able to contain the oil . The question is how much of the oil we 'll be able to contain , and the objective is to try to collect the majority of it through this vessel , '' he said . Rep. Ed Markey , D-Mass . , chairman of the House energy committee investigating the oil spill , told CBS he has no faith in BP to get the gusher contained . `` I have no confidence whatsoever in BP . I think that they do not know what they are doing . They started off talking about golf balls going in as a junk shot . People thought they would be dependent on MIT or Cal Tech instead of the PGA and golf balls . That was in the first couple of weeks . So I do n't think that people should really believe what BP is saying in terms of the likelihood of anything that they 're doing is going to turn out as they 're predicting , '' he said . Browner said whatever the worst-case scenario , if there is any good news , it is that the environmental response is up and running , and systems have been put in place `` to manage and decrease the amount of oil that comes onshore . '' Among those , Browner said 80 burns have been conducted to get the oil off the top of the water , but those are limited by weather . In addition , booms have been set in place to capture the oil slicks before they come ashore . Lastly , 1,400 vessels are using skimmers to try to get the oil out of the water . `` We are using skimmers that skim up the oil sheen , they bring up water , I think they over 11 billion barrels of oil and water that have been skimmed up , '' Browner said . But Louisiana Sen. David Vitter and other lawmakers and state officials have complained that not enough booms have been put up to shield Louisiana 's shores , where 150 miles of coastline are already affected . He said he is very dissatisfied with the administration 's response . `` The state and locals came up with a plan on emergency dredging barrier islands well over two weeks ago . For over two weeks , the corps and other federal agencies dragged their feet . 9:16:49 Then , they approved moving forward with 2 percent of that plan , '' he told CNN . Vitter said the disaster has not turned him against offshore drilling -- that would be like saying he 's opposed to air travel after a plane crash . More importantly , Vitter said , the key is to finding out what went wrong and making sure it does n't happen again . To that extent the Republican senator is on the same page as the administration , though Vitter and Browner part ways on stopping deep water drilling until that investigation is complete , a situation Browner acknowledged only compounds economic troubles for the region and the country . `` In the Arctic they 've been shut down . In the Gulf of Mexico they 've been shut down , including 33 rigs that were out there drilling right now , which we understand is going to be hard on those people , '' she said . `` We have to learn from this accident . In the interim we have shut down all deep water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico until we have an answer to , one , how can you make sure that these operations are safe , that there are redundancies in place ? ... Secondly , what happens when those redundancies do n't work ? '' In the meantime , the nation 's top environmental advocate acknowledged that the devastation is beyond any scope the U.S. has ever seen . `` More oil is leaking into the Gulf of Mexico than as any other time in our history . It means there 's more and more -- more oil than the Exxon Valdez , '' she said . Fox News ' Malini Wilkes contributed to this report .

AP PORT FOURCHON , La. -- PORT FOURCHON , La. -LRB- AP -RRB- -- The 40-foot-long corrugated steel boxes , resembling oversized white shipping containers , are stacked two high and three wide atop a barge at Port Fourchon , the oil industry 's hub on the Gulf of Mexico . The words `` Martin Quarters '' painted in black offer the only clue that they 're not stuffed with cargo . This barge is a floating hotel , or `` flotel , '' set up by BP and several subcontractors to accommodate more than 500 workers hired to clean up the worst oil spill in U.S. history . Temporary housing is the only way to station workers at Port Fourchon , a massive shipyard that serves offshore oil rigs and is surrounded by ecologically sensitive marshes and beaches . `` There are no permanent residents here on the port , '' said Dennis Link , a manager from a BP refinery who 's handling logistics at the 1,300-acre site that 's easily accessible by ship , but reachable on land only by a state road that snakes through the bayous . With the ambitious `` top kill '' having failed over the weekend and a relief well at least two months away , BP was ramping up its efforts to clean up the Louisiana coast . Another temporary fix -- an effort to saw through the pipe leaking the oil and cap it -- could be tried as soon as Wednesday . In the meantime , more than 125 miles of the state 's coastline already have been hit with oil , including the resort of Grand Isle near Port Fourchon . The cleanup , relief wells and temporary fixes were being watched closely by President Barack Obama 's administration . Obama planned to meet for the first time Tuesday with the co-chairmen of an independent commission investigating the spill , while Attorney General Eric Holder was headed to the Gulf Coast to meet with state attorneys general . On Monday afternoon , the living quarters on the flotel sat empty . Generators pumped in cool air and powered the lights , and at the foot of each bunk sat a towel , washcloth and individually wrapped bar of soap . If necessary , four tents on dry land nearby can house 500 more workers . Workers will likely be trucked in on the two-lane state road . The accommodations on the barge are Spartan , but comfortable -- similar to military barracks . Each pod contains 12 bunks , with a bathroom for every four . Per Coast Guard standards , each resident gets 30 square feet of space in the quarters . The barge has 10 washers , 10 dryers and a kitchen , although food will be served in a tent on land . The quarters are typically floated alongside offshore oil rigs to supplement housing on the drilling operations . The flotel could be moved if significant amounts of oil wash up at another location . Another flotel sits about 15 miles away , off Grand Isle , and BP plans to establish them elsewhere along the coast . Port Fourchon and Grand Isle were quiet Monday , with only a handful of people seen walking on the beaches by an Associated Press reporter and photographer flying over in a helicopter . BP is hiring local workers and ones from other states , and Link acknowledged that some from Louisiana might prefer a long drive home each to staying on the flotel . For Chad Martin , co-owner of Martin Quarters , business is booming . His company has 200 living quarters , and 60 were available when a BP subcontractor called . The oil giant rented every single one . But Martin understands the gravity of the situation . `` This is not the way to get work , '' he said Cleanup efforts are being ramped up while BP also tries the latest in a series of patchwork fixes , this one a cut-and-cap process to put a lid on the leaking wellhead so oil can be siphoned to the surface . The risky procedure could , at least temporarily , increase the oil flowing from the busted well . Using robot submarines , BP plans to cut away the riser pipe this week and place a cap-like containment valve over the blowout preventer . On Monday , live video feeds showed robot submarines moving equipment around and using a circular saw-like device to cut small pipes at the bottom of the Gulf . BP failed to plug the leak Saturday with its top kill , which shot mud and pieces of rubber into the well but could n't beat back the pressure of the oil . The oil company also announced plans Monday to try attaching another pipe to a separate opening on the blowout preventer with some of the same equipment used to pump in mud during the top kill . The company also wants to build a new freestanding riser to carry oil toward the surface , which would give it more flexibility to disconnect and then reconnect containment pipes if a hurricane passed through . Neither of those plans would start before mid-June and would supplement the cut-and-cap effort . But the best chances for sealing off the leak are two relief wells , the first of which wo n't be ready until August . The spill has already leaked between 19.7 million and 43 million gallons , according to government estimates . For the relief well to succeed , the bore hole must precisely intersect the damaged well , which experts have compared to hitting a target the size of a dinner plate more than two miles into the earth . If it misses , BP will have to back up its drill , plug the hole it just created , and try again . `` The probability of them hitting it on the very first shot is virtually nil , '' said David Rensink , incoming president of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists , who spent most of his 39 years in the oil industry in offshore exploration . `` If they get it on the first three or four shots they 'd be very lucky . '' The trial-and-error process could take weeks , but it will eventually work , scientists and BP said . Then engineers will then pump mud and cement through pipes to ultimately seal the well . On the slim chance the relief well does n't work , scientists were n't sure exactly how much -- or how long -- the oil would flow . The gusher would continue until the well bore hole collapsed or pressure in the reservoir dropped to a point where oil was no longer pushed to the surface , said Tad Patzek , chair of the Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering Department at the University of Texas-Austin . BP said it does n't know how much oil is in the reservoir because it was starting to collect and analyze data on its size when the rig exploded April 20 . In Patzek 's mind , failing to get the relief wells to work is n't an option . `` I do n't admit the possibility of it not working , '' he said .

Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said Tuesday that BP is in the middle of its first major pipe cut in the company 's latest bid to contain the oil spewing into the Gulf of Mexico . Allen , the national incident commander , said it could be as many as three days before oil can be contained and siphoned to the surface . BP has another major cut to do before a cap can be lowered on to the leak . It 's the company 's latest attempt to contain the leak . The effort to plug the spill failed over the weekend and the best chance to stop the gusher is now at least two months away . Robot submarines carried equipment and cut small pipes at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico on Monday to prepare to place a new containment valve over the blown-out well this week , while BP crews began working on yet another containment plan that could be added after the cut-and-cap effort . The giant British oil company could begin cutting through the riser that 's spewing oil and gas into the Gulf as soon as Wednesday , after which they will attempt to place the cap-like containment device that would siphon the mixture to the surface . In a new plan announced Monday , BP said that after it places the containment valve over the leaking riser , it plans to connect a pipe to a separate opening on the blowout preventer at the blown-out well to suck oil to the surface . The opening is the same one they used to inject mud during the failed top kill procedure over the weekend , and the new effort will re-use some of the machinery left on the ocean floor . BP said in a news release that the new maneuver would supplement the cut-and-cap procedure and help keep more oil from leaking into the gulf . That mission could start in mid-June . In another step announced Monday , BP said it was also working on building a sturdier , free-standing pipe to carry oil from its containment efforts toward the surface . This new free-standing pipe would end about 300 feet -LRB- 90 meters -RRB- below the surface , and a flexible hose would carry the oil the rest of the way to a surface ship . It 's intended to give BP a way to disconnect its containment pipes in the event of a hurricane , and reconnect them after a storm . BP said the construction of the free-standing riser , which crews could begin in late June or early July , would provide a `` more permanent '' way to capture the oil and gas as crews work to finish a pair of relief wells expected to plug the gusher for good . The first of the wells is n't expected to be completed before August . BP did n't return calls seeking further comment on the new plans . The company has repeatedly failed to stop the leak , which has gushed millions of gallons -LRB- liters -RRB- of oil into the Gulf of Mexico since an oil rig exploded on April 20 , killing 11 . The most ambitious attempt , called the `` top kill , '' involved trying to force heavy-mud down the well and then seal it with cement . But BP engineers were forced to call it off Saturday when it failed to suppress the oil and gas oozing to the surface . In this week 's operation , BP engineers plan to cut the pipe leaking at the wellhead with a diamond-edged saw and then place a cap-like containment valve over the well . If successful , the company said it could siphon a majority of the gushing oil to the surface . Video feeds throughout the day Monday showed the robots using a circular saw-like device to cut small pipes around the leaking riser , clearing the way for the operation which could begin as soon as Wednesday . BP spokesman Graham MacEwen said the robots were working to clear the way before they cut into the riser . The Associated Press contributed to this report .

The Obama administration appears to be preparing the public for the possibility that BP 's daring and untested attempts to staunch the leak at its source will continue to end in failure . The oil company , after acknowledging one of those failures over the weekend , was trying another method on Tuesday . White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said that the administration `` will continue to push BP to do whatever we feel is necessary to respond to the leak . '' But he repeated White House energy adviser Carol Browner 's warning that oil could continue to leak until August , when so-called relief wells are expected to be finished . And he acknowledged that even August is not a firm estimate . `` Regardless of the success of the operation currently ongoing , that 's the permanent solution , '' he said . `` I assume it could be both earlier and later -LRB- than August -RRB- , '' Gibbs said . He described the president as both `` enraged '' and `` frustrated '' by BP 's response . `` I think he 's enraged at the time that it 's taken , yes . I think he 's been enraged over the course of this , as I 've discussed , about the fact that , when you 're told something is fail-safe and it clearly is n't , that that 's the cause for quite a bit of frustration , '' Gibbs said . The Obama administration , which had been facing pressure to claim more of an assertive role in responding to the crisis , is taking an increasingly firm public tone with regard to BP . Attorney General Eric Holder said Tuesday that the federal government has opened a criminal investigation into the explosion , while President Obama pledged to conduct a `` full and vigorous accounting '' of what went wrong in the lead-up to the `` worst oil spill in U.S. history . '' But while the administration pursues investigations and calls for policy changes in the wake of the tragedy , officials acknowledge that BP has both the expertise and the equipment to stop the leak at its source . The administration has focused more on deploying ships and workers to the Gulf to mitigate the spread of the leak as much as possible . BP was trying to pick up the pieces this week after its `` top kill '' method -- in which the company tried to inject mud into the leak -- was added to the long list of tactics that have failed to plug the well . The new plan involves cutting through pipe and capping the spill . Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said it could take up to three days for oil to then be siphoned to the surface . The Obama administration , though , warned that the new method could lead to a temporary 20 percent increase in the amount of oil flowing out of Gulf floor . Gibbs said Tuesday that BP was not entirely honest about the impact of what it calls its `` cut and cap '' procedure . `` Do I think that BP was forthcoming on what the impact would be of cutting the riser off ? No , obviously , '' Gibbs said . BP claims the latest procedure could suck most of the oil to the surface if it works properly .

NEW ORLEANS -- BP 's stock plummeted and took much of the market down with it Tuesday as the federal government announced criminal and civil investigations into the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . BP engineers , meanwhile , tried to recover from a failed attempt to stop the gusher with an effort that will initially make the leak worse . Attorney General Eric Holder , who was visiting the Gulf to survey the fragile coastline and meet with state and federal prosecutors , would not say who might be targeted in the probes into the largest oil spill in U.S. history . `` We will closely examine the actions of those involved in the spill . If we find evidence of illegal behavior , we will be extremely forceful in our response , '' Holder said in New Orleans . BP 's stock nose-dived on Tuesday , losing nearly 15 percent of its value on the first trading day since the previous best option -- the so-called `` top kill '' -- failed and was aborted at the government 's direction . It dipped steeply with Holder 's late-afternoon announcement , which also sent other energy stocks tumbling , ultimately causing the Dow Jones industrial average to tumble 112 . After six weeks of failures to block the well or divert the oil , BP was using robotic machines to carve into the twisted appendages of the crippled well . The latest attempt involved using tools resembling an oversized deli slicer and garden shears to break away the broken riser pipe so engineers can then position a cap over the well 's opening . Even if it succeeds , it will temporarily increase the flow of an already massive leak by 20 percent -- at least 100,000 gallons more a day . And it is far from certain that BP will be able to cap a well that one expert compared to an out-of-control fire hydrant . `` It is an engineer 's nightmare , '' said Ed Overton , a Louisiana State University professor of environmental sciences . `` They 're trying to fit a 21-inch cap over a 20-inch pipe a mile away . That 's just horrendously hard to do . It 's not like you and I standing on the ground pushing -- they 're using little robots to do this . '' The operation has never been performed in such deep water , and is similar to an earlier failed attempt that used a larger cap that quickly froze up . BP PLC officials said they were applying lessons learned from the earlier effort , and plan to pump warm water through pipes into the smaller dome to prevent any icing problems . `` If all goes as planned , within about 24 hours we could have this contained , '' BP 's Doug Suttles said Tuesday after touring a temporary housing facility set up for cleanup workers in Grand Isle . `` But we ca n't guarantee success . '' Since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 , killing 11 workers and eventually collapsing into the Gulf of Mexico , an estimated 20 million to 40 million gallons of oil has spewed , eclipsing the 11 million that leaked from the Exxon Valdez disaster . Oil has fouled many fishing areas and miles of ecologically sensitive coastline . Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour said oil from the spill was found in his state for the first time , on a barrier island , and newly expanded federal restrictions mean that nearly a third of federal waters are closed to fishing . President Barack Obama on Tuesday ordered the co-chairmen of an independent commission investigating the spill to thoroughly examine the disaster , `` to follow the facts wherever they lead , without fear or favor . '' The commission is led by Bob Graham , a former Florida governor and U.S. senator , and William K. Reilly , a former head of the Environmental Protection Agency . Holder said the laws under review for the criminal and civil probes include the Clean Water Act , the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 , the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Endangered Species Act . He said the government would pursue criminal charges `` if warranted , '' a caveat he did not include for civil action . `` We will ensure that every cent , every cent of taxpayer money , will be repaid and that damage to the environment and wildlife will be reimbursed , '' he said . Washington lawyer Stan Brand said that two likely criminal law theories the Justice Department would pursue are false statements to the Interior Department 's Minerals Management Service and obstruction by failing to produce evidence to investigators . But Brand and longtime Washington lawyer Stephen Ryan , a former federal prosecutor and ex-congressional investigator , predicted it will be difficult to prove criminality . `` Bad business judgment is n't a crime , '' said Ryan . BP is part owner of the blown well . Other companies involved include rig operator Transocean ; oil services company Halliburton , which handled the cementing of the well ; and Cameron Inc. , which made the blowout preventer that apparently failed . Criminal charges have met with mixed results in two previous high-profile U.S. oil spills . Joseph Hazelwood , captain of the Exxon Valdez supertanker that ran aground off Alaska 's coast in 1989 , was acquitted of being drunk when the accident occurred , but convicted of a misdemeanor for negligent oil discharge . He was fined $ 50,000 and ordered to perform 1,000 hours of community service . Hong Kong-based Fleet Management Ltd. paid a $ 10 million fine after pleading 1\\/4 to obstruction charges following a 2007 oil spill after one of the company 's cargo ships struck the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge . The ship 's pilot pleaded guilty to misdemeanors and was sentenced to 10 months in prison . The government would have a lower burden of proof in a civil case . In the Valdez spill , thousands of fishermen , cannery workers , landowners and Native Americans were initially awarded $ 5 billion in punitive damages , but the amount was eventually reduced to $ 507.5 million . BP is part owner of the blown well . Other companies involved include rig operator Transocean ; oil services company Halliburton , which handled the cementing of the well ; and Cameron Inc. , which made the blowout preventer that apparently failed . BP engineers began putting underwater robots and equipment in place this week after an attempt to plug the well by force-feeding it heavy mud and cement -- called a `` top kill '' -- was aborted over the weekend . Crews pumped thousands of gallons of the mud into the well but were unable to overcome the pressure of the oil . The next plan has BP engineers placing a cap-like containment valve over the well . Not all the gushing oil will be captured through the `` cut and cap '' method , but the company said it could siphon most of the crude to a vessel on the surface . Eric Smith , an associate director of the Tulane Energy Institute , likened the procedure to trying to place a tiny cap on a fire hydrant that 's blowing straight up . Crews have forged two different caps in case one of them does n't work . Before it can place either one , the company plans to cut the riser in two different places , keeping it aloft with a crane so it does n't collapse . Gigantic shears will cleave off the far end of the riser while a diamond cutter , lowered on top of the blowout preventer early Tuesday , will try to make an even cut through the other end of the tube . A clean cut from the diamond cutter , which resembles a deli slicer , is important because engineers will then lower a heavy cap on top of the sheared-off tube to seal the leak . BP 's best chance to actually plug the leak rests with a pair of relief wells that likely wo n't be completed until August .

It 's the worst thing that could happen , and we wo n't know what the effects are until later . '' And as thousands of gallons of oil continue to spill every day , it seems the majority of Hollywood , a community often given to preaching on `` green '' issues , is staying away . Granted , there were some celebrities like Conan OBrien and Jimmy Fallon who took to Twitter to express their thoughts on the issue , but unlike the tragedy in Haiti in January , there has n't been an outpouring of donations , large-scale fund-raisers , contribution-driven websites and hotlines , or PSAs encouraging Americans to do all they can to help out . `` Hollywood stars have a romance with saving foreign countries , they see America as this rich and powerful country that should fix problems on its own , '' said media expert Michael Levine . `` Celebrities feel heroic in saving people from other places . Patriotism is n't of interest , sometimes Hollywood forgets that America needs care and consideration too . '' Hollywood 's heavyweights are certainly not afraid to dig very deep into their pockets in times of global disaster . It was well-documented in the press that celebrities including Brad Pitt , Angelina Jolie , Sandra Bullock and Madonna collectively donated millions to the earthquake relief . Actor George Clooney used his star status to raise over $ 57 million in his `` Hope For Haiti '' telethon . Queen Latifah , Sean `` Diddy '' Combs and Pharrell Williams hosted another telethon in conjunction with BET , and Sean Penn even hightailed it to the poverty-stricken country to personally lend his hand with refugee efforts . But according to other entertainment industry experts , it 's not a case of celebrities only wanting to help out foreign countries : it 's a case of this being a man-made disaster as opposed to a natural one . `` It 's politically safer when its victims on one side and a catastrophic event on the other . In that case , there is only one side to be on . Man-made catastrophes are not as clear-cut . This one is filled with politically loaded issues of off-shore oil drilling , dependence on foreign oil and the environment , '' explained Glenn Selig , founder of The Publicity Agency . `` Plus BP employees died . You do n't want to make those victims part of an ` evil ' oil company that created the mess . It 's complicated , which makes it a very tough issue to rally around . '' Media expert Dana Livingston Ward echoed Selig 's sentiments . `` We 're all referring to this environmental mishap as ` the BP oil spill , ' which automatically places blame on BP , therefore no one - Hollywood included - feels the need to pay for a problem caused by someone else , '' said Ward . `` In the end , the Gulf oil spill is an issue that does indeed affect our people , so celebs and the rest of Americans should be just as quick to help create a solution for this latest disaster ... even if it 's simply speaking up to raise awareness and thus force the guilty party to remedy the situation in more timely manner . '' Still , there are some stars that are n't afraid to bypass the politics to do what they can for the sake of the environment and those affected . `` Waterworld '' star Kevin Costner , who 15 years ago began funding the work of Louisiana-based firm Ocean Therapy solutions , has offered up his multi-million dollar machines which function like a vacuum to separate water and oil , purifying both in the process . Director James Cameron has loaned the submersibles used to shoot `` Titanic '' to the crews trying to stop the underwater geyser , and Robert Redford appeared in a commercial encouraging Americans to `` Call For Clean Energy Now . '' In addition Lenny Kravitz , John Legend , and Mos Def recently performed at a benefit for the Gulf Relief Foundation in New Orleans to raise funds for fisherman affected by the disaster , and 90 's pop sensation Sophie B. Hawkins is donating 100 percent of the net proceeds from her new song `` The Land , the Sea & the Sky '' to the Waterkeeper Alliance 's clean-up efforts in the region . But despite her concern over the wildlife affected by the spill , Anderson has faith that President Obama , despite the harsh criticism he has been under for not doing enough . `` I -LRB- totally blame -RRB- the oil people . They made a big mistake of not having a back-up plan , '' Anderson added . `` I would definitely like to see Obama do more , but I also want to support him and what he stands for . I think he 's a good president and he 's very compassionate , and we have to just trust that he knows best .

The multinational oil company dropped its full name almost a decade ago for the less geographically specific BP . Those two letters are now synonymous with ecological disaster . Perhaps BP should stand for Bad Publicity . Nationwide consumer boycotts are underway . While it s difficult to gauge their overall economic impact on the oil giant , a BP wholesale distributor in Fort Myers , Florida said local sales are down 20 percent . Edison Oil , VP Patrick Eakins , believes angry BP customers are taking their business elsewhere . Another measure of BP s public relations problem is its stock price . Since the disaster , the company s valuation dropped 75 billion dollars . In a statement to Fox News BP said we re not really focused on public relations , adding the focus is on fighting this thing offshore , fighting it in the seabed , and keeping people informed . Despite downplaying PR concerns , BP has hired Anne Wolmack Kolton , the former head of Public Affairs for the US Department of Energy , and Dick Cheney s former campaign spokeswoman . In her new job at BP , Kolton will deal with the media . Some public relations experts say BP is a text book example of what not to do in the aftermath of a corporate crisis . Experts said significant mistakes included low balling the size of the spill and trying to pull the plug on a real time video feed showing oil gushing into the Gulf . Last week , BP s CEO , Tony Hayward said that no one wants this thing over more than I do . I d like my life back . Hayworth failed to mention the families of the 11 men who died when the Deepwater Horizon rig burst into flames . BP s CEO has since apologized to relatives of the dead . In a statement posted on Facebook , Hayward acknowledged making a hurtful and thoughtless comment . Hayward s critics said throughout the crisis he has made a number of other public relations blunders . Soon after oil began spewing into the Gulf , Hayward pointed the finger of blame at other corporations telling the BBC this was not our drilling rig and not our equipment . It was not our people , our system or our processes . As for the size of the problem he famously said the Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean . The amount of volume of oil and dispersant we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume . Later , Hayward would describe oil containment as extraordinarily successful and claiming there would be very , very modest environmental impact . Public Relations expert Michael Gordon , who during the Clinton administration served as spokesman for Attorney General Janet Reno , said if he were running BP s PR machine the first thing he would do is publicly silence Hayward . Gordon added I d be surprised , if -LRB- Hayward -RRB- had a job a year from now . While Gordon and other BP critics said the company s failed PR efforts made a bad situation worse , not everyone agrees . Author and crisis management consultant Eric Desenhall said when you are dealing with legitimate outrage the company is going to be criticized for everything it does . Desenhall compares BP to a doctor who has to tell the family the patient has died . He said in those situations they always say the doctor is cold and terrible . According to Desnehall the way for BP to repair its image is to stop the leak and clean up the mess . He said in the oil business , the best PR is no PR .

AP Photo\\/Jae C. Hong The Superdome in New Orleans is the largest fixed-dome structure in the world -- and so much oil will have gushed from the leak beneath the Gulf of Mexico that only that enormous structure would be able to contain it . According to current estimates , between 20 million and 40 million gallons of oil have already spewed from a blown-out well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico -- and as much as 1 million gallons are still gushing out each and every day . BP has been struggling to cap the leak , but may not be able to do so until a relief well is drilled , sometime in August . How much oil will have been spilled into the Gulf by that time ? For arguments sake , let 's say 30 million total gallons have spilled to date , and some 750,000 gallons are flowing out per day . By August 15 , some 86 million gallons of oil will have spilled in the Gulf , and by August 31 , that figure will soar to 98 million gallons of oil . 86 million gallons would fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool 136 times over . And 86 million one gallon milk jugs put side by side would stretch more than 8,300 miles -- a little more than the distance from New York to Hong Kong or about the distance from New York to Rome and back . The Superdome , the football stadium where the New Orleans Saints play , is the largest fixed-domed structure in the world : It 's located on 52 acres of land and has an interior space of 3.5 million cubic meters . Those 86 million gallons would fill 325,000 cubic meters , or about 9 percent of the Superdome . By the end of the month , it will fill 371,000 cubic meters , closer to 11 percent . One barrel of oil -LRB- that 's 42 gallons of oil -RRB- refined will produced 19-20 gallons of motor gasoline , meaning those 86 million gallons would have created about 41 million gallons of gas . The best-selling American auto at present is the Ford F150 , which has a gas tank that holds 26 gallons of gas . So the 86 million raw gallons of oil that could be polluting the Gulf of Mexico by August 15 would have filled 1.6 million Ford gas tanks . Or a generic , 20-gallon tank about 2 million times . Assuming an average consumption of 25 miles per gallon , that 's well over a billion miles of highway U.S. cars would have traveled . And with gasoline averaging $ 2.73 in the U.S. , that 's $ 112 million dollars at retail gas pumps .

AP Photo\\/BP PLC BP 's underwater robots used huge shears to slice through a pipe connected to seabed equipment at the site of the Gulf of Mexico 's massive oil spill . The move is part of BP 's latest effort to contain most of the leak by capping the opening left once the pipe remnants are sawed off . The company also is making plans to use equipment installed at the seabed for the `` top kill '' to enhance its containment efforts , and to interrupt containment efforts if a hurricane blows through the Gulf . Here is an explanation of how the cap is supposed to work , as well as other technologies BP is employing to attempt to bring the well under control : . . BP 's underwater robots used huge shears to slice through the main pipe from which the leak emanates , a so-called riser which extended from a lower marine riser package , or LMRP . The LMRP sits atop a failed blowout preventer at the seabed ... The robots then began using a diamond saw to shear off the remaining parts of the riser to create a smooth opening at the top of the LMRP . The saw got stuck during the process , and the robots and clamps are trying to free it to finish the job ... If the saw shears a smooth opening , BP will lower a containment cap with a grommet seal over it . The leak will continue gushing from the top of the LMRP during the process ... The containment cap is intended to capture about 80 percent of the oil and gas . The rest is expected to escape ... The cap will be connected by pipe to a drillship at the water 's surface a mile above the well ... The captured oil and gas is expected to be channeled to the ship , where the oil will be stored to bring ashore later for processing and the gas will be flared ... BP expects the process to take four to seven days , though Chief Executive Tony Hayward said before the saw became stuck that it would take four days ... BP monitored pressure data from the failed blowout preventer during the top kill operation , and determined that cutting off the pipe at the top of the LMRP would not have a significant impact on the flow of the leak . Dispersants are being sprayed at the leak site during the LMRP operation ... U.S. government scientists estimated the flow could temporarily increase by as much as 20 percent ... The cap effort is , in theory , similar to a much larger 98-ton containment dome that was placed at the end of the broken pipe in early May . That dome also was connected to the ship by pipe and was intended to corral and channel oil and gas to the surface ... In that cap effort , too much seawater got inside , mixed with natural gas at high pressures and cold temperatures , and formed ice-like hydrates that blocked oil from flowing up the pipe to the ship ... The smaller cap and seal are designed to exclude seawater and avoid the hydrate problem ... The cut at the top of the LMRP needs to leave a smooth surface for the containment cap 's seal to work as planned ... If the containment cap does n't work , BP can try to install a `` top hat '' already at the seabed , or a smaller version of the containment dome that does not have a seal ... Other backup containment caps and domes are being manufactured with variations on the seal to have options if needed . ENHANCEMENT TO LMRP CAP PLAN . . BP will use seabed equipment installed to conduct the top kill to enhance the containment cap system ... The top kill involved pumping heavy drilling fluid into the failed blowout preventer to try to smother the leak . Mud was pumped from a ship to a service rig , down to a manifold , which routed the fluid to `` choke and kill '' hoses connected to the blowout preventer ... BP will try to reverse direction and pull oil and gas from the blowout preventer through the hoses and manifold to a vessel at the water 's surface ... That system is expected to be ready by mid-June ... BP also is planning a system to allow the drillship connected by pipe to the containment cap to suspend operations and move if a hurricane approaches ... BP will install a pipe that extends about 300 feet below the drillship . Then a hose would connect the pipe to the containment cap ... Described by BP as a `` long-term option , '' the system would allow BP to disconnect the hose from the pipe and move the ship out of a storm 's path , then return when weather calms to resume the operation ... BP has not yet worked out how it would cap or corral the leak while the storm passes and the hose is disconnected from the pipe ... The system is expected to be implemented in late June or early July ... The Atlantic hurricane season began June 1 ... Drilling continued on a relief well begun May 2 intended to intercept and cap the leaking well beneath the seabed . Drilling was suspended last week on a second relief well begun May 16 while the top kill was in progress , but that rig resumed drilling Sunday . Both wells are expected to be finished in August .

BP 's stock plummeted and took much of the market down with it , and the federal government announced criminal and civil investigations into the spill . The stakes could n't be higher . After six weeks of failures to block the well or divert the oil , the latest mission involved using a set of tools akin to an oversized deli slicer and garden shears to break away the broken riser pipe so engineers can then position a cap over the well 's opening . But it 's a big gamble : Even if it succeeds , it will temporarily increase the flow of an already massive leak by 20 percent -- at least 100,000 gallons more a day . That 's on top of the estimated 500,000 to 1 million gallons gushing out already . In Florida , officials confirmed an oil sheen about nine miles from the famous white sands of Pensacola beach . Crews shored up miles of boom and prepared for the mess to make landfall as early as Wednesday . `` It 's inevitable that we will see it on the beaches , '' said Keith Wilkins , deputy chief of neighborhood and community services for Escambia County . Florida would be the fourth state hit . Crude has already been reported along barrier islands in Alabama and Mississippi , and it has impacted some 125 miles of Louisiana coastline . More federal fishing waters were closed , too , another setback for one of the region 's most important industries . More than one-third of federal waters were off-limits for fishing , along with hundreds of square miles of state waters . Fisherman Hong Le , who came to the U.S. from Vietnam , had rebuilt his home and business after Hurricane Katrina wiped him out . Now he 's facing a similiar situation . `` I 'm going to be bankrupt very soon , '' Le , 53 , said as he attended a meeting for fishermen hoping for help . `` Everything is financed , how can I pay ? No fishing , no welding . I weld on commercial fishing boats and they are n't going out now , so nothing breaks . '' Le , like other of the fishermen , received $ 5,000 from BP PLC , but it was quickly gone . `` I call that ` Shut your mouth money , '' ' said Murray Volk , 46 , of Empire , who 's been fishing for nearly 30 years . `` That wo n't pay the insurance on my boat and house . They say there 'll be more later , but do you think the electric company will wait for that ? '' BP may have bigger problems , though .

The federal government also ramped up its response to the spill with President Barack Obama ordering the co-chairmen of an independent commission investigating the spill to thoroughly examine the disaster , `` to follow the facts wherever they lead , without fear or favor . '' The president said that if laws are insufficient , they 'll be changed . He said that if government oversight was n't tough enough , that will change , too . BP 's stock nose-dived on Tuesday , losing nearly 15 percent of its value on the first trading day since the previous best option -- the so-called top kill -- failed and was aborted at the government 's direction . It dipped steeply with Holder 's late-afternoon announcement , which also sent other energy stocks tumbling , ultimately causing the Dow Jones industrial average to tumble 112 . If BP 's new effort to contain the leak fails , the procedure will have made the biggest oil spill in U.S. history even worse . `` It is an engineer 's nightmare , '' said Ed Overton , a Louisiana State University professor of environmental sciences . `` They 're trying to fit a 21-inch cap over a 20-inch pipe a mile away .

The company said if the small dome is successful it could capture and siphon a majority of the gushing oil to the surface . But the cut and cap will not halt the oil flow , just capture some of it and funnel it to vessels waiting at the surface . The British oil giant has tried and failed repeatedly to halt the flow of the oil , and this attempt like others has never been tried before a mile beneath the ocean . Experts warned it could be even riskier than the others because slicing open the 20-inch riser could unleash more oil if there was a kink in the pipe that restricted some of the flow . Eric Smith , an associate director of the Tulane Energy Institute , likened the procedure to trying to place a tiny cap on a fire hydrant that 's blowing straight up . `` Will they have enough weight to overcome the force of the flow ? '' `` It could create a lot of turbulence , but I do think they 'll have enough weight . '' But BP 's best chance to actually plug the leak rests with a pair of relief wells but those wo n't likely be completed until August . The company has carefully prepared the next phase , knowing that another failure could mean millions more gallons spew into the ocean and lead to even more public pressure . And they say they have learned valuable lessons from the failure of a bigger version of the containment cap last month that was clogged with icelike slush .

BP PENSACOLA BEACH , Fla. -- PENSACOLA BEACH , Fla. -LRB- AP -RRB- -- The smell of oil hangs heavy in the sea air . Children with plastic shovels scoop up clumps of goo in the waves . Beachcombers collect tarballs as if they were seashells . The BP catastrophe arrived with the tide on the Florida Panhandle 's white sands Friday as the company worked to adjust a cap over the gusher in a desperate and untested bid to arrest what is already the biggest oil spill in U.S. history . The widening scope of the slow-motion disaster deepened the anger and despair just as President Barack Obama arrived for his third visit to the stricken Gulf Coast . The oil has now reached the shores of four Gulf states -- Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida -- turning its marshlands into death zones for wildlife and staining its beaches rust and crimson in an affliction that some said brought to mind the plagues and punishments of the Bible . `` In Revelations it says the water will turn to blood , '' said P.J. Hahn , director of coastal zone management for Louisiana 's Plaquemines Parish . `` That 's what it looks like out here -- like the Gulf is bleeding . This is going to choke the life out of everything . '' He added : `` It makes me want to cry . '' Six weeks after the April 20 oil rig explosion that killed 11 workers , the well has leaked somewhere between 22 million and 47 million gallons of oil , according to government estimates . A device resembling an upside-down funnel was lowered over the blown-out well a mile beneath the sea late Thursday to try to capture most of the oil and direct it to a ship on the surface . But crude continued to escape into the Gulf through vents designed to prevent ice crystals from clogging the cap . Engineers hoped to close several vents throughout the day . `` Progress is being made , but we need to caution against overoptimism , '' said Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man for the crisis . Early in the day , he guessed that the cap was collecting 42,000 gallons a day -- less than one-tenth of the amount leaking from the well . Similarly , later in the day , in a visit to Louisiana , Obama said it was `` way too early to be optimistic '' about the latest attempt to stanch the spill . One unanswered question was whether the cap fit snugly . BP sheared off the well pipe before installing the cap but was unable to make a smooth cut . As the operation went on at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico , the effect of the BP spill was increasingly evident . Swimmers at Pensacola Beach rushed out of the water after wading into the mess , while other beachgoers inspected the clumps with fascination , some taking pictures . Children were seen playing with the globs as if they were Play-Doh . David Lucas of Jonesville , La. , and a group of friends abruptly cut their visit short after wading into oily water . `` It was sticky brown globs out there , '' Lucas said after he and the others cleaned their feet and left . Health officials said that people should stay away from the mess but that swallowing a little oil-tainted water or getting slimed by a tarball is no reason for alarm . Steven Majerus and his 11-year-old nephew walked along Pensacola Beach and checked out the oil clumps as family members splashed in the surf . Majerus filled a plastic bag with tar and photographed it with his phone . `` It 's really hot . See how hot it gets in this bag with the sun beating down on it ? '' Randy Ivie , a charter boat captain , broke down in tears as he tried to explain how sad he was to think that his grandchildren might not see the same white beach and turquoise waters he enjoyed . `` It kills me , '' he said . `` I grew up here . '' At Grand Isle , La. , whose population usually swells to welcome 20,000 beachgoers during the summer months , pelicans coated in chocolate syrup-like oil flailed in the surf . At Gulf Shores , Ala. , Wendi Butler spotted clumps of tar in the surf and was repelled by the heavy odor of oil . `` It smells like a flight line . I know , my ex-husband was in the Air Force . He would come home from work every day smelling like this , '' said Butler , of Perdido Bay , Fla. `` You do n't smell the beach breeze at all . '' On Grand Isle , where homes bear quirky names like `` Shore Thing '' and `` The Sand Bar , '' residents hung new signs before Obama 's visit . `` Tony Bologna , '' read one , a dig at BP CEO Tony Hayward . On another home , named `` Mama-Pappy Dream , '' a new sign was added : `` Dream is Gone . '' Still another said : `` End this nightmare . '' `` He ai n't much of a leader , '' Eugene Ryman Jr. said of Obama . `` The beach you can clean up . The marsh you ca n't . Where 's the leadership ? I want to hear what 's being done . We 're going to lose everything . '' At a meeting with a BP representative , residents vented . `` Sorry does n't pay the bills , '' said Susan Felio Price , who lives near Grand Isle . Meanwhile , BP 's Hayward assured investors that the company `` considerable firepower '' to cope with the severe costs . Hayward and other senior BP executives struck a penitent note in their first comprehensive update to shareholders since the oil rig explosion .

In the past week , 11 workers who have been out on the water cleaning up oil from BP 's blown-out well have been treated for what Dietrich calls `` a pattern of symptoms '' that could have been caused by the burning of crude oil , noxious fumes from the oil or the dispersants dumped in the Gulf to break it up . All workers were treated and released . `` One person comes in , it could be multiple things , '' he said . `` Eleven people come in with these symptoms , it makes it incredibly suspicious . '' Few studies have examined long-term health effects of oil exposure . But some of the workers trolling Gulf Coast beaches and heading out into the marshes and waters have complained about flu-like symptoms -- a similar complaint among crews deployed for the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska . BP and U.S. Coast Guard officials have said dehydration , heat , food poisoning or other unrelated factors may have caused the workers ' symptoms . The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals is investigating . Brief contact with small amounts of light crude oil and dispersants are not harmful . Swallowing small amounts of oil can cause upset stomach , vomiting and diarrhea . Long-term exposure to dispersants , however , can cause central nervous system problems , or do damage to blood , kidneys or livers , according to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention . In the six weeks since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded , killing 11 workers , an estimated 21 million to 45 million gallons of crude has poured into the Gulf of Mexico . Hundreds of BP contractors have fanned out along the Gulf , deploying boom , spraying chemicals to break up the oil , picking up oil-soaked debris and trying to keep the creeping slick out of the sensitive marshes and away from the tourist-Mecca beaches . Commercial fisherman John Wunstell Jr. spent a night on a vessel near the source of the spill and left complaining of a severe headache , upset stomach and nose bleed . He was treated at the hospital , and sued -- becoming part of a class-action lawsuit filed last month in U.S. District Court in New Orleans against BP , Transocean and their insurers . Wunstell , who was part of a crew burning oil , believes planes were spraying dispersant in the middle of the night -- something BP disputes . `` I began to ache all over ... '' he said in the affidavit . `` I was completely unable to function at this point and feared that I was seriously ill . '' Dozens of complaints , most from spill workers , have been made related to oil exposure with the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals , said spokeswoman Olivia Watkins , as well as with the Louisiana Poison Center , clinics and hospitals . Workers are being told to follow federal guidelines that recommend anyone involved in oil spill cleanup wear protective equipment such as gloves , safety glasses and clothing . Michael J. Schneider , an attorney who decided against filing a class-action lawsuit in the 1990s involving the Valdez workers , said proving a link between oil exposure and health problems is very difficult . `` As a human being you listen to enough and you 've got to believe they 're true , '' he said . `` The problem is the science may not be there to support them ... Many of the signs and symptoms these people complained of are explainable for a dozen different reasons -- it 's certainly coincidental they all shared a reason in common . '' Similar to the Valdez cleanup , there have been concerns in the Gulf that workers are n't being supplied with enough protective gear . Workers have been spotted in white jumpsuits , gloves and booties but no goggles or respirators . `` If they 're out there getting lightheaded and dizzy every day then obviously they ought to come in , and there should be respirators and other equipment provided , '' said LuAnn White , director of the Tulane Center for Applied Environmental Public Health . She added that most of the volatile components that could sicken people generally evaporate before the oil reaches shore . BP PLC 's Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said reports of workers getting sick are being investigated but noted that no one has pinpointed the cause . Suttles said workers were being given `` any safety equipment '' needed to do their jobs safely . Unlike with Exxon Valdez , in the Gulf , the oil has been lighter , the temperatures warm and humid , and there have been hundreds of thousands of gallons of chemicals used to break up the oil . Court records showed more than 6,700 workers involved in the Exxon Valdez clean up suffered respiratory problems which the company attributed to a viral illness , not chemical poisoning . Dennis Mestas represented the only known worker to successfully settle with Exxon over health issues . According to the terms of that confidential settlement , Exxon did not admit fault . His client , Gary Stubblefield , spent four months lifting workers in a crane for 18 hours a day as they sprayed the oil-slicked beaches with hot water , which created an oily mist . Even though he had to wipe clean his windshield twice a day , Stubblefield said it never occurred to him that the mixture might be harming his lungs . Within weeks , he and others , who wore little to no protective gear , were coughing and experiencing other symptoms that were eventually nicknamed Valdez crud . Now 60 , Stubblefield can not get through a short conversation without coughing and gasping for breath like a drowning man . He sometimes needs the help of a breathing machine and inhalers , and has to be careful not to choke when he drinks and eats . Watching the Gulf situation unfold , he says , makes him sick .

Bob Graham , D-Fla . , left , and former EPA Administrator William Reilly , walks after the president made a statement in the Rose Garden of the White House . -LRB- AP -RRB- Each day oil continues to spew into the Gulf of Mexico , investors are shaving billions of dollars off of BP 's value and raising the uncomfortable prospect of the British oil giant collapsing into the arms of the U.S. government as Wall Street and the auto industry did . A grassroots campaign called Seize BP is protesting in more than 50 cities from Thursday through Saturday . And a former labor secretary has urged President Obama to take over BP , at least temporarily , until the oil spill is stopped . Analysts said it appeared unlikely that the U.S. could or , if even possible , would take over BP in the event of its demise but did n't rule out the possibility . James Gattuso , a senior research fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation , told FoxNews.com that it is more likely that a British bankruptcy court would put BP into receivership and continue the cleanup efforts . `` There 's no advantage in having the federal bureaucracy in charge no matter how bad the crisis may get , '' he said . A Treasury official told FoxNews.com that it 's unclear whether the U.S. can put BP into receivership . `` I have no idea what the answer is , '' the Treasury official said . `` It 's not clear we even have the authority -LRB- to put BP into receivership -RRB- . We have no plans to pursue this . '' On Tuesday alone , the first trading day since BP 's latest attempt at a fix failed -- and the day the government announced it had opened a criminal probe into the disaster -- BP 's stock took a hit of 15 percent . BP is worth $ 75 billion less on the open market than it was when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded six weeks ago . Other companies involved in the spill -- Transocean , Halliburton and Cameron -- have all lost at least 30 percent in value . BP says it has spent $ 990 million so far on fighting and cleaning the spill . White House spokesman Robert Gibbs expressed no concern about BP going bankrupt or being broken up . `` I believe you 've got a company with the type of market capitalization that can and will fully pay for the damage caused on the disaster they 're responsible for , '' he said . President Obama has repeatedly stated that the government is in charge of the cleanup operation but that BP is responsible for the costs . Still , the oil giant 's struggle to contain the oil slick has led to heavy criticism of the administration 's response and calls from some for Obama to temporarily take over BP 's Gulf operations . `` We have a national emergency on our hands , '' Robert Reich , President Bill Clinton 's labor secretary , wrote on his website Monday . `` No president would allow a nuclear reactor owned by a private for-profit company to melt down in the United States while remaining under the direct control of that company . The meltdown in the Gulf is the environmental equivalent . '' Reich said a federal takeover of BP is the only way to provide transparency , guarantee competency and ensure Obama is in charge . `` If the government can take over giant global insurer AIG and the auto giant General Motors and replace their CEOs in order to keep them financially solvent , it should be able to put BP 's North American operations into temporary receivership in order to stop one of the worst environmental disasters in U.S. history , '' he wrote . `` I 'm not entirely sure what legal mechanism one would have to do that , '' Gibbs said Tuesday . Gattuso called Reich 's proposal `` stunning , '' and said he must be having some fun and trying to stir the pot . `` For the U.S. to take over , unless there 's some statute Reich knows about that he 's not citing , he 's proposing a Venezuelan-style takeover and worrying about legal justifications later , '' he said . He also criticized Reich 's reasoning behind the proposal . `` From what we 've learned from the Minerals Management Service '' -- the agency that oversees offshore drilling that has come under heavy fire for a seemingly cozy relationship with the oil industry -- `` and the way the administration has handled the oil spill , the last things we could expect to get is transparency or competency , '' he said . Reich did not return phone calls seeking comment . Susan Bloch , a professor of law at Georgetown University and an expert on constitutional law , told FoxNews.com that it 's unclear when the U.S. could seize BP but that it 's possible if Congress would authorize it . She cited President Harry Truman 's takeover of the steel mills during the Korean War . The Supreme Court later ruled it unconstitutional because Truman did n't get congressional approval . `` I 'm not sure what good it would do , '' she said about the U.S. seizing BP . `` I do n't know why we would want to run BP .

BP , via AP BP CEO Tony Hayward said the company should know within 12 or 24 hours whether their latest attempt to cap the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is working , touting a `` milestone '' maneuver that he admitted was risky . Hayward hailed the company 's work Thursday after underwater robots successfully sheared off a busted oil pipe spewing millions of gallons of crude into the Gulf , telling reporters that the company would have a `` fully sealed '' containment system in place by the end of June . But Hayward added that BP will be on the Gulf Coast for a very long time working to clean up the spill and restore life to the threatened region . BP used giant shears to slice off a busted pipe that has bedeviled their containment efforts , but the cut was irregular and placing the cap will now be more challenging , Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said . Government officials have warned that cutting away the pipe could , at least temporarily , increase the flow of oil by 20 percent . BP turned to the shears after a diamond-tipped saw became stuck in the pipe halfway through the job , yet another frustrating delay in six weeks of the Gulf of Mexico spill . The cap will be lowered and sealed over the coming hours , Allen said . It wo n't be known how much oil BP can siphon to a tanker on the surface until the cap is fitted , but the irregular cut means it wo n't fit as snug as officials had hoped . `` We 'll have to see when we get the containment cap on it just how effective it is , '' Allen said . `` It will be a test and adapt phase as we move ahead , but it 's a significant step forward . '' Even if it works , BP engineers expect oil to continue leaking into the ocean . The next chance to stop the flow wo n't come until two relief wells meant to plug the reservoir for good are finished in August . This latest attempt to control the spill , the so-called cut-and-cap method , is considered risky because slicing away a section of the 20-inch-wide riser could remove kinks in the pipe and temporarily increase the flow of oil by as much as 20 percent . Allen said it was unclear whether the flow had increased . `` I do n't think we 'll know until the containment cap is seated on there , '' he said . `` We 'll have to wait and see . '' BP 's top executive acknowledged Thursday the global oil giant was unprepared to fight a catastrophic deepwater oil spill . Chief executive Tony Hayward told The Financial Times it was `` an entirely fair criticism '' to say the company had not been fully prepared for a deepwater oil leak . Hayward called it `` low-probability , high-impact '' accident . `` What is undoubtedly true is that we did not have the tools you would want in your tool-kit , '' Hayward said in an interview published in Thursday 's edition of the London-based newspaper . Oil drifted six miles from the Florida Panhandle 's popular sugar-white beaches , and crews on the mainland were doing everything possible to limit the catastrophe . The Coast Guard 's Allen directed BP to pay for five additional sand barrier projects in Louisiana . BP said Thursday the project will cost it about $ 360 million , on top of about $ 990 million it had spent on response and clean up , grants to four Gulf coast states and claims from people and companies hurt by the spill . As the edge of the slick drifted toward Pensacola 's beaches , emergency workers rushed to link the last in a miles-long chain of booms designed to fend off the oil . They were slowed by thunderstorms and wind before the weather cleared in the afternoon . Forecasters said the oil would probably wash up by Friday , threatening a delicate network of islands , bays and white-sand beaches that are a haven for wildlife and a major tourist destination dubbed the Redneck Riviera . `` We are doing what we can do , but we can not change what has happened , '' said John Dosh , emergency director for Escambia County , which includes Pensacola . The effect on wildlife has grown , too . The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reported 522 dead birds -- at least 38 of them oiled -- along the Gulf coast states , and more than 80 oiled birds have been rescued . It 's not clear exactly how many of the deaths can be attributed to the spill . Dead birds and animals found during spills are kept as evidence in locked freezers until investigations and damage assessments are complete , according to Teri Frady , a spokeswoman for the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration . `` This includes strict chain-of-custody procedures and long-term locked storage until the investigative and damage assessment phases of the spill are complete , '' she wrote in an e-mail . As the oil drifted closer to Florida , beachgoers in Pensacola waded into the gentle waves , cast fishing lines and sunbathed , even as a two-man crew took water samples . One of the men said they were hired by BP to collect samples to be analyzed for tar and other pollutants . A few feet away , Martha Feinstein , 65 , of Milton , Fla. , pondered the fate of the beach she has been visiting for years . `` You sit on the edge of your seat and you wonder where it 's going , '' she said . `` It 's the saddest thing . '' Officials said the slick sighted offshore consisted in part of `` tar mats '' about 500 feet by 2,000 feet in size . County officials set up the booms to block oil from reaching inland waterways but planned to leave beaches unprotected because they are too difficult to defend against the action of the waves and because they are easier to clean up . `` It 's inevitable that we will see it on the beaches , '' said Keith Wilkins , deputy chief of neighborhood and community services for Escambia County . Florida 's beaches play a crucial role in the state 's tourism industry . At least 60 percent of vacation spending in the state during 2008 was in beachfront cities . Worried that reports of oil would scare tourists away , state officials are promoting interactive Web maps and Twitter feeds to show travelers -- particularly those from overseas -- how large the state is and how distant their destinations may be from the spill .

The tourism , fishing , energy and shipping economies tied to the Gulf are all expected to take a colossal hit from the spreading leak , which may not be plugged until August . While images of oil-soaked wildlife give a glimpse into the potential environmental impact of the worst oil spill in U.S. history , the economic damage could be just as devastating . The Obama administration is pledging to protect the coastal communities and hit up BP for all recovery costs -- it sent BP a `` preliminary bill '' Thursday for $ 69 million to reimburse taxpayers for cleanup costs and has started a Small Business Administration program to provide low-interest loans to coastal businesses while they await BP compensation . But the question remains whether the oil giant will be able to cover the extent of the economic damages and whether the federal government may be forced to step in to provide aid . `` This 'll set things back for some time , '' David Yoskowitz , socio-economics chairman with the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies , said of the coastal economy . The Harte institute did an early analysis of the impact last month that put the annual damage at $ 1.8 billion . The center is working on a new estimate now . `` The $ 1.8 billion is just the tip of the iceberg , '' Yoskowitz said . The law caps economic damage liability for companies like BP at $ 75 million . Yoskowitz speculated that BP will probably end up paying more than that but said more aid may be needed . `` It 's going to depend upon what BP steps up and offers to do . ... If they do n't , then you have to look to the various government entities to do that , '' he said . The affected industries in the Gulf region are worth billions of dollars , and they 're already starting to feel the squeeze . A recent Texas A&M University study estimated that the oil , tourism , fishing and shipping economies in the region are worth $ 234 billion a year -- with the U.S. accounting for two-thirds of that . Since the spill , new offshore drilling in the region has been shut down , tourism reportedly has declined and fishing has been halted in a swath of waters bigger than 88,000 square miles . That 's more than one-third of federal waters in the Gulf . Nathaniel Karp , chief U.S. economist for the Birmingham-based BBVA Compass bank , released a study early last month estimating the total economic impact to the region at $ 4.3 billion . He , too , is working on new numbers and said the estimate will surely rise . Asked what the new estimate might look like , he said : `` That 's a scary number . '' The Democratic Policy Committee put out a snapshot last week pegging the Louisiana commercial fishing economy at $ 2.4 billion and the Florida tourism industry at $ 60 billion . The document said economic damage `` will be significant , '' citing reports of 70 percent declines in hotel occupancy along the Florida panhandle over Memorial Day and other signals that tourists are being spooked . Karp explained that the impact will be huge on the Florida panhandle if the situation worsens because of its dependence on tourism . `` The region will suffer , '' he said . `` Even if you manage to clean what your eyes can see in front of you , if people do n't feel safe it 's going to be very difficult to bring them back , '' he said . The economies were already on shaky ground . Florida 's jobless rate was 12 percent in April . Mississippi 's was 11.5 percent . The situation sets the stage for an aggressive fight by politicians and communities to get BP to cough up as much as possible . Though by law the liability cap for economic damages is set at $ 75 million , that cap is lifted if BP is nailed for negligence -- and investigations are under way . The government can also dip into an industry-backed fund -- called that Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund -- to pay out up to $ 1 billion for `` removal costs or damages . '' The White House insists it will go after BP 's piggy bank . `` The president is well aware of the pain and suffering that this accident is causing , '' Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Thursday . `` We will hold BP responsible throughout this process . '' Aaron Saunders , spokesman for Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu , said the senator 's office will be `` holding BP 's feet to the fire . '' `` The senator expects BP to pay every penny of the cleanup and related damages , '' he said . Adele Morris , policy director for climate and energy economics at the Brookings Institution , said she `` ca n't imagine '' BP will be limited to paying just $ 75 million in economic damages . But she said the regional economies will nevertheless be hit hard while the issue is being litigated . `` There 's no question that this adds insult to injury for some already-suffering state and local economies , '' she said .

BP , via AP PENSACOLA , Fla. -- The BP oil slick drifted perilously close to the Florida Panhandle 's famous sugar-white beaches Wednesday as a risky gambit to contain the leak by shearing off the well pipe ran into trouble a mile under the sea when the diamond-tipped saw became stuck . BP engineers will turn to giant shears to slice off the leaking pipe , said Lt. Commander Tony Russell , an aide to Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man for the crisis . The saw had sliced through about half of the pipe when it snagged , and it took BP 12 hours to free it . The company said it hoisted the saw back to the surface after finally yanking it out of the pipe . The plan is to fit a cap on the blown-out well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico to capture most of the spewing oil ; the twisted , broken pipe must be sliced first to allow a snug fit . The company had said preparations were being made to resume cutting , but did n't give a timetable . The shears have already been used to slice off another part of the riser , but crews hoped to use the diamond saw to get a finer cut so they could use a dome that would fit the pipe more snugly . `` I do n't think the issue is whether or not we can make the second cut . It 's about how fine we can make it , how smooth we can make it , '' Allen had said earlier . As the edge of the slick drifted within seven miles of Pensacola 's beaches , emergency workers rushed to link the last in a miles-long chain of booms designed to fend off the oil . They were slowed by thunderstorms and wind before the weather cleared in the afternoon . Forecasters said the oil would probably wash up by Friday , threatening a delicate network of islands , bays and white-sand beaches that are a haven for wildlife and a major tourist destination dubbed the Redneck Riviera . `` We are doing what we can do , but we can not change what has happened , '' said John Dosh , emergency director for Escambia County , which includes Pensacola . Allen said more staff , boats and helicopters were sent to the eastern Gulf Coast as the slick spread , including a cutter in Mobile Bay , Ala. , and one off Pensacola . The boats will help skim oil and add more boom to collect it . Four helicopters would help skimmers spot threatening oil . Since the biggest oil spill in U.S. history began to unfold April 20 with an explosion that killed 11 workers aboard an offshore drilling rig , crude has fouled some 125 miles of Louisiana coastline and washed up in Alabama and Mississippi as well . Over the past six weeks , the well has leaked anywhere from 21 million to 45 million gallons by the government 's estimate . The latest attempt to control the leak is considered risky because slicing away a section of the 20-inch-wide riser could remove kinks in the pipe and temporarily increase the flow of oil by as much as 20 percent . The cap could be placed over the spill as early as Wednesday . If the strategy fails -- like every other attempt to control the leak 5,000 feet underwater -- the best hope is probably a relief well , which is at least two months from completion .

Florida 's beaches play a crucial role in the state 's tourism industry . At least 60 percent of vacation spending in the state during 2008 was in beachfront cities .

They called it `` unfathomable '' that BP would pay out a dividend before the total cost of the cleanup is known . BP had no comment . -- More fishing grounds were closed . More than one-third of federal waters in the Gulf are now off-limits to fishing , along with hundreds of square miles of state waters . `` I 'm going to be bankrupt very soon , '' said fisherman Hong Le , who came to the U.S. from Vietnam and rebuilt his home and business after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 wiped him out . `` Everything is financed . How can I pay ? No fishing , no welding . I weld on commercial fishing boats and they are n't going out now , so nothing breaks .

Calls from his supporters to show `` he gets it '' have only grown since the president visited the Gulf last week amid complaints he was n't focused on the leak . Obama , who landed in Louisiana Friday afternoon and headed immediately into a briefing , says he 's made the spill his top priority , but in recent days the White House has tried to show the president is as angry about the mess as he is determined to solve it . `` I am furious at this entire situation , because this is an example of where somebody did n't think through the consequences of their actions , '' Obama said in an interview Thursday . Asked whether BP was feeling the anger , he said : `` They have felt the anger . '' The president , in a sudden move , canceled plans to travel to Indonesia and Australia later in the month -- a trip that was already canceled earlier in the year because Obama wanted to concentrate on the health care debate in Congress . White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Tuesday that the president was `` enraged '' about how long it 's taken for BP to plug the leak . At the same time , the White House is pushing back on the notion that the president should be jumping up and down about the spill . `` I would love to just spend a lot of my time venting and yelling at people . But that 's not the job I was hired to do . My job is to solve this problem , '' Obama said in a televised interview Thursday night . `` Pounding on a podium is n't going to fix a hole in the ocean , '' Gibbs said Thursday . `` I think what the American people and the citizens of the Gulf are expecting are results . And I think that 's what the president will be measured by . I 'll leave emotional psychiatry to others . '' The president 's tone has been ripe for criticism even among his supporters . Democratic strategist James Carville demanded that Obama `` get down here , '' and film director Spike Lee urged the `` calm '' and `` cool '' president to , `` one time , go off ! '' Jon Stewart , on '' The Daily Show , '' ridiculed the president for trying to balance the ceremonial duties of the president -- like attendance at cultural heritage events -- with management of the spill .

BP GRAND ISLE , La. -- A cap was seated atop a blown-out Gulf well but the volcano of oil obscured it from view early Friday making it impossible to tell if BP 's latest attempt to curtail the nation 's worst spill was having any success . Robots a mile beneath the Gulf of Mexico positioned the inverted funnel-like lid over the main pipe on the leaking well on Thursday night . Live video footage , though , showed that the oil seemed unimpeded . BP spokesman Toby Odone said he had no immediate information on whether the cap was successfully attached . The placement was a positive step but not a solution , said Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man for the disaster . `` Even if successful , this is only a temporary and partial fix and we must continue our aggressive response operations at the source , on the surface and along the Gulf 's precious coastline , '' Allen said in a statement . A rubber seal on the inside of the cap will attempt to keep oil from escaping , though engineers acknowledge some crude will still come out . The plan is to capture most of the spewing oil and bring it to a surface ship . To put the cap in place , BP had to slice off the pipe with giant shears , which was risky because it could temporarily increase the flow by as much as 20 percent . Also , the shears made a less-precise cut , making it more difficult for the lid to fit . If the idea fails -- like every other attempt to control the six-week-old leak -- the best chance is probably a relief well , which is at least two months away . The well has spit out between 21 million and 46 million gallons of oil since a rig exploded on April 20 about 50 miles from the Louisiana coast , killing 11 workers . BP was leasing the rig and is responsible to fix and clean up the spill . In oil-soaked Grand Isle , Jason French might as well have painted a bulls-eye on his back . His mission was to be BP 's representative at a meeting for 50 or so residents who had gathered at a church to vent . `` We are all angry and frustrated , '' he said . `` Feel free tonight to let me see that anger . Direct at me , direct it at BP , but I want to assure you , the folks in this community , that we are working hard to remedy the situation . '' `` Sorry does n't pay the bills , '' said Susan Felio Price , a longtime resident . `` Through the negligence of BP we now find ourselves trying to roller-skate up a mountain , '' she said . `` We 're growing really weary . We 're sick and tired of being sick and tired . Someone 's got to help us get to the top of that mountain . '' President Barack Obama might also hear some of that anger . He will return to the Louisiana coast Friday to assess the latest efforts , his third trip to the region since the disaster unfolded and his second in a week . He told CNN 's Larry King that he , too , was frustrated and used his strongest language in assailing BP . `` I am furious at this entire situation because this is an example where somebody did n't think through the consequences of their actions , '' Obama said . `` This is imperiling an entire way of life and an entire region for potentially years . '' Crews will also use methanol to try to prevent icylike crystals from forming on the inside of the cap . At this depth a mile underwater , the near-freezing temperatures can cause a buildup up of hydrates , which foiled the company 's attempt to place a 100-ton , four-story dome over the leak about a month ago . Meanwhile , newly disclosed internal Coast Guard documents from the day after the explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon rig indicated that U.S. officials were warning of a leak of 336,000 gallons per day of crude from the well in the event of a complete blowout . The volume turned out to be much closer to that figure than the 42,000 gallons per day that BP first estimated . Weeks later that was revised to 210,000 gallons . Now , an estimated 500,000 to 1 million gallons of crude is believed to be leaking daily . The Center for Public Integrity , which initially reported the Coast Guard logs , said it obtained them from Rep. Darrell Issa , R-Calif . , ranking Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee . The logs also showed early in the disaster that remote underwater robots were unable to activate the rig 's blowout preventer , which was supposed to shut off the flow from the well in the event of such a catastrophic failure . The damage to the environment was chilling on East Grand Terre Island along the Louisiana coast , where workers found birds coated in thick , black goo . Images shot by an Associated Press photographer show Brown pelicans drenched in thick oil , struggling and flailing in the surf . BP CEO Tony Hayward promised that the company would clean up every drop of oil and `` restore the shoreline to its original state . '' `` BP will be here for a very long time . We realize this is just the beginning , '' he said . Those on Grand Isle seemed less than convinced by BP 's assurances . `` We want you to feel what we feel , '' said Leoda Bladsacker , a member of the town 's council , as her voice trembled . `` We 're not going to be OK for a long , long time .

Lawmakers and industry groups warn that the moratorium could cost thousands of jobs and drain hundreds of millions of dollars out of the local economy . That 's on top of the billions of dollars studies predict could be lost from hits to the tourism and fishing industries along the Gulf . President Obama , in an interview Thursday , defended the decision as necessary to give officials time to figure out what went wrong before the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 -- killing 11 workers and triggering the historic leak -- and how to prevent such a disaster from happening again . `` Until that happens , it would be irresponsible of me to lift that moratorium , '' Obama said on CNN . Following conflicting signs from his administration , Obama said that the moratorium only applies to deepwater wells , as opposed to those in shallow water . But with the ban on new deepwater drilling extended for a six-month period , lawmakers are adamant that a compromise be reached . They are also concerned new restrictions on shallow-water drilling could hinder the local industry . `` Obviously we need to learn the lessons from this incident ... but to completely shut down deepwater -LRB- drilling -RRB- and even threaten shallow water is a huge economic blow , '' Sen. David Vitter , R-La . , told Fox News on Friday . `` And on top of the recession and on top of the hit that the oil is directly making on our economy , that is another big , big economic blow that is going to knock us down . '' Vitter suggested the administration instead start an `` immediate and very rigorous '' safety inspection program , while only shutting down those rigs that have problems that ca n't be addressed immediately . Vitter said he planned to speak with Obama about the issue during his visit to the Gulf coast Friday -- the president 's third since the oil leak began . The senator wrote in a letter to Obama on Thursday that the deepwater drilling ban , which is estimated to affect 33 rigs in the Gulf , could eliminate up to 4,000 Louisiana jobs in the short-term and `` possibly 20,000 jobs throughout the course of the year . '' Sen. Mary Landrieu , D-La . , warned about the danger of a permanent flight of the industry from the region . `` If these big rigs ever leave the Gulf ... it 's not like you can make those every day or every year . Some of them take years to build . If they leave the Gulf and go drill under long-term contracts off the coast of Africa , they 're not coming home any time soon , '' she said . The Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association , a trade group representing oil and gas interests in the Gulf region , estimates that lost wages from all 33 rigs could total $ 330 million per month . The National Ocean Industries Association , citing the figures , said in a statement that the six-month moratorium will `` make things much worse by putting more Gulf citizens out of work . '' Obama was looking to expand offshore drilling before the BP disaster . The explosion led him to rethink that element of his energy plan , as he delayed or canceled lease sales in the Gulf , off the coast of Virginia and off the coast of Alaska . The White House on Thursday acknowledged there will be job losses from the moratorium . `` I do n't think there 's any doubt , '' Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said . But he argued that the commission investigating the incident needs to be able to first determine what `` failsafe '' measures can be implemented to prevent future disasters . `` I think that 's important . The president thought that was important . I think that the citizens of the Gulf think that 's important , '' Gibbs said .

The president informed the leaders of both countries of the news in phone calls Thursday night , offering his `` deep regret '' and pledging to reschedule soon , White House press secretary Robert Gibbs announced in a statement just after midnight . Obama was to depart on a weeklong trip to both countries , along with a quick stop in Guam , on June 13 . Asked the reason for the delay , Gibbs told The Associated Press that Obama was staying home `` to deal with important issues , one of which is the oil spill . '' Obama had a sensitive political decision to make : Risk putting off two allies in a strategic part of the world once again or endure all the downsides , including an inevitable level of backlash , for being on the other side of the world during a huge crisis at home . The domestic agenda proved dominant . Already , his administration faces scrutiny for its leadership in trying to end the oil spill in the Gulf even as the White House insists it has been forceful from the start . What began with an exploding oil rig on April 20 has turned into an environmental disaster . Obama had planned this Asia trip in March -- first shortening it to be in Washington and lobby for health care legislation and then scrapping it altogether to stay for the final crucial days of debate on that top domestic priority . Congress ultimately passed the health care law after a huge investment from Obama . Obama called Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to explain his decision on Thursday . Gibbs said Obama planned to meet with both leaders separately on the sidelines of the G-20 meeting , which is to be held near the end of June in Canada . The announcement came as Defense Secretary Robert Gates was meeting with Indonesian defense officials at a security conference in Singapore . Gates spokesman Geoff Morrell said the postponement did not come up in the meeting . As the trip drew closer and attempts by the BP oil company to plug the gushing oil well proved futile , speculation grew that Obama would be forced to delay the visit for a second time .

Workers scrambled to close the safety valves but within moments the platform caught fire and collapsed . Tens of millions of gallons of oil gushed into the Gulf of Mexico . Numerous attempts to stanch the spill failed . Three decades later , the 1979 Ixtoc disaster remains the Gulf 's -- and the world 's -- worst peacetime oil spill . The parallels between that disaster and the current BP oil spill offer sobering lessons . There were no quick fixes for Ixtoc : It took 10 months to stop the leak , with Mexico 's state-owned oil company , Pemex , trying methods similar to those that BP has attempted at its Deepwater Horizon rig . Pemex managed to slow the spill a little using several methods including forcing metal spheres into the well . But it could n't stop the leak until two relief wells were drilled -- and even that did n't work right away : the oil kept gushing for another three months after the first well was completed . In the end , Ixtoc spewed a record 140 million gallons of oil . Massive slicks reached the northern Mexican Gulf coast and Texas , where it would eventually coat almost 170 miles -LRB- 275 kilometers -RRB- of U.S. beaches . But the most tragic thing about Ixtoc may be the lessons not learned . After the oil stopped gushing and crude was no longer washing up on beaches , funding for research largely dried up and the oil industry missed an opportunity to study the disaster and apply what it learned to future offshore drilling endeavors , said Larry McKinney , the director of the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A&M University . `` Unfortunately , from a science standpoint , not much was followed up on , to learn from , '' says McKinney . `` That was a mistake that was made that hopefully wo n't be repeated . '' So far , Deepwater Horizon has spilled an estimated 21 million to 45 million gallons of oil . BP managed to place a funnel-like cap on the well late Thursday with the aim of pumping some crude to the surface , but it was too early to tell if would work or how much oil they could collect . If the Pemex disaster serves as a precedent , the BP spill could continue even after the two relief wells are expected to be finished in August . By then , it could surpass Ixtoc as the worst oil spill in history , said Tad Patzek , chair of the Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering Department at the University of Texas-Austin . `` We are looking at an August time frame for stopping it , '' Patzek said . `` If for one reason or another that stopping is left imperfect or it takes another drill or what have you , we 're looking at another four months , at that time this spill would look like the Ixtoc spill . '' The BP spill , at a depth of nearly 5,000 feet , is proving more complicated to choke off than Ixtoc , a shallow-water rig about 150 feet deep . The Ixtoc well could be accessed directly , while the Deepwater spill must be combated remotely , using robots to wield clamps , saws and other tools while monitoring the action by video feed . `` They could fight Ixtoc from and at the surface , '' said Robert Bea , a professor of engineering at University of California at Berkeley who has studied offshore drilling for 55 years and worked for Pemex for a number of years . For Deepwater , `` they must fight from the sea floor remotely , from the sea surface miles above . '' Most recently , BP tried to stop the gusher by pumping in heavy drilling mud and cement . The tactic , called a `` top kill , '' had never been tried 5,000 feet underwater . It did n't work . The good news is the Ixtoc experience suggests the Gulf of Mexico has natural properties that help it cope with massive oil spills , scientists say . Warm waters and sunlight helped break down the oil faster than many expected . Weathering reduced much of the oil into tar balls by the time it reached Texas . Two decades after the Ixtoc disaster , marine biologist Wes Tunnell sank his diving knife into an area where he had spotted a tar patch just after the spill . The blade came out black and tarry but the hardened surface of the patch was under sand , shells and algae that had completely covered it . `` No one else would know that it was anything other than a rock ledge , '' said Tunnell of the Harte institute . `` I think that the Gulf of Mexico is hugely resilient , or at least it was 30 years ago . We 've insulted it a lot since then in various ways . '' The Gulf has also long dealt with oil that naturally seeps from the seafloor . Some experts estimate that tens of millions of gallons seep into the Gulf from natural up-wellings each year , fostering large populations of oil-eating bacteria and microorganisms . However , it is unclear how much any of that will help this time around . The Deepwater spill is closer to sensitive coastlines than Ixtoc was . And it is affecting Louisiana marshlands that are more sensitive than the more sparsely populated Texan and Mexican coastlines that Ixtoc reached . `` Obviously there were some helping factors -- nature , climate , current -- that in the end helped people -LRB- with Ixtoc -RRB- so that 's good news , '' said Patzek . `` However ... the Ixtoc well seemed to have been a little farther out from sensitive places . '' The depth of the BP spill could also complicate the Gulf 's ability to cope . The oil-eating bacterial populations are located mainly on the surface or near shore , where the Ixtoc oil appeared . BP has tried to break up the oil deep underwater , pumping chemical dispersants directly into the damaged well . That could be a mistake , McKinney said . While chemically dispersing the oil keeps the spill less visible and ugly than Ixtoc , it prevents the oil from floating up to the surface where wind , waves , bacteria and sunlight could help break it up , he said . And some environmentalists question the safety of the dispersant itself . `` I know , out of sight , out of mind , '' McKinney said . `` But also , out of sight is what can kill you , like a cancer , and that may be the bigger problem . '' Pemex estimates that about half the Ixtoc oil may have burned away in the rig fire that lasted months . About a quarter dispersed and the rest was either recovered or evaporated . Ixtoc threatened coral , sea turtles , shrimp and commercially valuable fish . Some species have rebounded while others have drastically declined . Jack Woody , a retired officer with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , was in northern Mexico a month after the Ixtoc spill , leading the U.S.-Mexico effort to save the Kemp 's ridley sea turtles . He watched as the oil slick closed in and tar balls began washing up at the Rancho Nuevo beach , the only significant nesting ground for the female turtles , which had dwindled to a population of about 300 . Hatchlings were just emerging , and helicopters desperately tried to ferry the baby turtles to open ocean beyond the slick . `` I thought we were too late , '' Woody said . The turtle population continued to dwindle until 1988 but has since rebounded to up to 12,000 , due in part to programs to relocate hatchlings to safer beaches in Texas and cut down on turtle deaths in shrimp nets . `` I was wrong . This is the one time I like to be wrong , '' Woody said . Scientists say it is difficult to know how much long-term damage Ixtoc caused because it is hard to separate the effects of the spill from overfishing , sediment , runoff and other pollution . Tunnel said his students saw coral islands ringed by oil `` like black doughnuts '' after Ixtoc . Many of those islands have since lost most of their coral cover but Tunnel could not say whether the spill was to blame . Other causes , he said , could include overfishing of coral-friendly fish , coral collecting and sewage . After five years or so , the tar mats on Texas beaches largely disappeared , probably broken up and swept seaward , and Ixtoc was largely forgotten for 30 years , until another explosion on an offshore oil rig in a different part of the Gulf .

AP A BP program to hire the owners of small boats to help clean the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has reportedly resulted in windfalls for rich pleasure-craft owners -- and not commercial fishermen who have seen their livelihoods covered in crude . The British oil giant announced its '' Vessels of Opportunity '' program in early May , roughly two weeks after the April 20 oil rig explosion that killed 11 workers . To qualify , operators need to attend a four-hour training session , a dockside examination by the U.S. Coast Guard and meet crew requirements based on the size of their vessels . But a `` large number '' of the 1,900 contracts issued by BP for the program have gone to owners of pleasure boats , such as doctors and lawyers , the Daily Beast reports . `` We have these weekend warriors taking away jobs from those who fish for a living , '' boat captain Tom Becker told the website . `` Every day I see the boat trailers fill the parking lot as the pleasure boats get their assignment for -LRB- the -RRB- day while the commercial fleet sits idle . '' Becker , an officer of the National Association of Charterboat Operators , estimated that up to 90 percent of the BP contracts in his Mississippi harbor had gone to pleasure vessels . The program pays boat captains $ 1,200 to $ 3,000 per day , depending on the size of the vessel , the website reports . Deckhands , meanwhile , can earn up to $ 200 daily . A BP spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment when reached by FoxNews.com , but company spokesman Graham MacEwen told the Daily Beast changes have been made to the program to favor fishermen .

But officials and scientists still do n't know for certain how much oil is spilling out each day -- estimates range from 12,000 to 25,000 barrels a day , so the containment cap could be collecting as much as 80 percent or as little as 40 percent of the oil . As thousands of marine animals die and the Louisiana marshland is polluted with the sticky slick , Allen said BP is responsible for getting out the resources to clean up the mess . `` We are accountable for oversight . BP is the responsible party , supposed to put the resources out there . In the long run the government is accountable . And frankly , I 'm accountable . '' Sen. John Cornyn , R-Texas , said that he is glad to hear Allen say that the U.S. has the `` human and physical assets '' to deal with the problem , but he 's still confused about who 's in charge . `` Is it the president of the United States ? Is it the CEO of British Petroleum ? Is it Admiral Allen ? So I think really , we need the president to step up and assert himself and to say , ` Let 's cut through the red tape , let 's cut through the chain of command , and let 's get the assets where they need to be in order to protect the beaches and the people of that important region , ' '' he said . But Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour said he could n't be happier to have Allen running the operation . `` You interviewed Admiral Allen , who , by the way , we think the world of . He came in here after -LRB- Hurricane -RRB- Katrina and did a great job , '' Barbour said on `` Fox News Sunday . '' `` You know , governors have a little bit different attitude about things like this than Washington . You know , Washington -- everybody 's playing the blame game . Who 's at fault ? ... Governors -- we 're trying to solve a problem . We 're working the problem here . '' Barbour , who is the former chairman of the Republican National Committee and currently heads the Republican Governors Association , said when he asks Allen -- or BP -- for something , they try to get it done . He added that Americans want to see problems solved and `` do n't need Republican politicians like me piling on . '' `` The American people are making up their minds pretty clearly about what they think of the administration 's performance in this disaster . And I 'll let it stand at that . You know , Napoleon said never interfere with the enemy while he 's in the process of destroying himself , '' Barbour said , adding that a complete shutdown of the oil spill is the only truly satisfactory response to the spill . Sen. John Kerry , D-Mass . , said it 's fashionable to blame the Obama administration , but `` every major person in the administration '' has been to the Gulf coast and the `` best minds in the country '' are consulting on the cleanup . `` Here 's what 's important . Not to be throwing the blame around , but to put America on the course to true energy independence and self-reliance and to begin to wean ourselves from our addiction to oil , '' Kerry , who is leading the charge for a climate change bill on Capitol Hill , said on ABC 's `` This Week , '' where he appeared with Cornyn . Kerry , whose bill would tax carbon emissions while trying to promote alternative energy development , said the U.S. imports more oil now than it did before the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , so the only way to prevent future catastrophes is to look for safe alternatives . But Barbour said if the U.S. wants to achieve energy independence it should continue to drill because a six-month moratorium on offshore drilling that has been instituted by the Obama administration means oil companies will start drilling elsewhere , putting the U.S. into a more dependent relatinship . `` If you shut this down , do n't kid yourself , you 're not shutting it down for six months . ... In six months , these oil rigs are n't going to be sitting around the gulf waiting . They 're going to be in west Africa . They 'll be in Indonesia . They 're going to be in China . They 're going to be drilling oil wells elsewhere in the world . And the loss of production that we 're going to suffer will make us even more dependent on the Middle East , on Venezuela , on people that are n't our friends , '' he said .

Waves of gooey tar blobs were washing ashore in growing numbers on the white sand of the Florida Panhandle Friday as a slick from the BP spill drifted closer to shore . AP2010 In this May 22 . 2010 photo , nesting pelicans are seen landing as oil washes ashore on an island that is home to hundreds of brown pelican nests as well at terns , gulls and roseate spoonbills in Barataria Bay , just inside the the coast of Louisiana . Oil from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill affected large stretches of the Louisiana Coast . AP NEW ORLEANS -- A device that 's now sucking up significant amounts of the oil spewing from the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico offered a measure of optimism Sunday even as the government 's point man on the spill warned problems would persist for months . Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said on CBS ' `` Face the Nation '' that the spill , which is ravaging beaches and wildlife , will not be contained until the leak is fully plugged and that even afterward `` there will be oil out there for months to come . '' The disaster , which began with an oil rig explosion in mid-April , will persist `` well into the fall , '' Allen said . A containment cap placed on the gusher near the sea floor trapped about 441,000 gallons of oil Saturday , BP spokesman Mark Proegler said , up from around 250,000 gallons of oil Friday . It 's not clear how much is still escaping ; an estimated 500,000 to 1 million gallons of crude is believed to be leaking daily . BP chief executive Tony Hayward told the BBC on Sunday that he believed the cap was likely to capture `` the majority , probably the vast majority '' of the oil gushing from the well . The gradual increase in the amount being captured is deliberate , in an effort to prevent water from getting inside and forming a frozen slush that foiled a previous containment attempt . The next step is for BP engineers to attempt to close vents on the cap that allow streams of oil to escape and prevent that water intake , and Hayward told the BBC that the company hopes a second containment system will be in place by next weekend . Allen told CBS that the oil would stop flowing only when the leak was plugged with cement . Hawyard , who has faced criticism over his company 's response to the spill , told the BBC that he would n't step down and that he had the `` absolute intention of seeing this through to the end . '' `` We 're going to clean up the oil , we 're going to remediate any environmental damage and we are going to return the Gulf coast to the position it was in prior to this event , '' he told the BBC . Allen took issue on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' on Sunday with BP officials who said they were pleased with results of the latest effort . He said progress was being made , `` but I do n't think anybody should be pleased as long as there is oil in the water . '' He said on `` Fox News Sunday '' that he does n't `` want to create any undue encouragement '' and that `` we need to underpromise and overdeliver . '' While BP plans to eventually use an additional set of hoses and pipes to increase the amount of oil being trapped , the ultimate solution remains a relief well that should be finished by August . The urgency of that task was apparent along the Gulf Coast nearly seven weeks after the BP rig exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers and rupturing the wellhead a mile below the surface . Since then , millions of gallons of oil have been rising to the surface and spreading out across the sea . The oil is coating and miring waterfowl in the sticky mess , and dead birds and dolphins are washing ashore . Scientists say the wildlife death toll remains relatively modest , though , because the Deepwater Horizon rig was 50 miles off the coast and most of the oil has stayed in the open sea . The oil has steadily spread east , washing up in greater quantities in recent days . Small tar balls have washed up as far east as Fort Walton Beach , about a third of the way across the Florida Panhandle . Government officials estimate that roughly 23 million to 49 million gallons have leaked into the Gulf . A line of oil mixed with seaweed stretched all across the beach Sunday morning in Gulf Shores , Ala. . The oil was often hidden beneath the washed-up plants . At a cleaning station outside a huge condominium tower , Leon Baum scrubbed oil off his feet with Dawn dishwashing detergent . Baum had driven with his children and grandchildren from Bebee , Ark. , for their annual vacation on Alabama 's coast . They had contemplated leaving because of the oil , but they 've already spent hundreds of dollars on their getaway . `` After you drive all this way , you stay , '' Baum said . At Pensacola Beach , Buck Langston and his family took to collecting globs of tar instead of sea shells on Sunday morning . They used improvised chopsticks to pick up the balls and drop them into plastic containers . Ultimately , the hoped to help clean it all up , Langston said . `` Yesterday it was n't like this , this heavy , '' Langston said . `` I do n't know why cleanup crews are n't out here . '' With no oil response workers on Louisiana 's Queen Bess Island , Plaquemines Parish coastal zone management director P.J. Hahn decided he could wait no longer , pulling an exhausted brown pelican from the oil , slime dripping from its wings . `` We 're in the sixth week , you 'd think there would be a flotilla of people out here , '' Hahn said . `` As you can see , we 're so far behind the curve in this thing . '' At the mouth of Alabama 's Mobile Bay , hundreds of seagulls squawked on a beach dotted with countless small tar balls but not a cleanup crew in sight .

Not the president of the United States . Not the chief executive of BP . Not Congress , federal agencies or local elected officials . From its fiery beginning , the Gulf oil spill has stood as a concentrated reminder of why , over four decades , Americans have lost faith in nearly every national institution . Like Hurricane Katrina , a natural disaster that caused voters to question then-President George W. Bush 's credibility , the poisonous geyser at the Gulf 's floor threatens to undermine Barack Obama 's presidency . More alarmingly , the spill exacerbates the worry that this nation founded on the principle of trust now faces a crisis of faith in its public and private institutions -- government and big business particularly . `` This spill , it 's another blow to the body politic , '' says John Baick , professor of history at Western New England College in Springfield , Mass. . It is , he says , another excuse to be cynical and uninvolved -- `` exactly the opposite of what has always been the American zeitgeist , a sense that we , collectively and through our institutions , can be something greater than ourselves . '' It 's hard to summon that rising-sun aspiration when the unemployment rate hovers near double digits . When wars in Afghanistan and Iraq continue unabated . When terrorists take aim from inside and outside U.S. borders . When the U.S. Treasury writes massive IOUs to China and public schools write off millions of poorly educated children . Then along comes the oil spill to remind people of why they do n't trust leaders -- and why so many Americans , looking for information and action , are turning instead to blogs , Twitter feeds and their friends . Consider this revealing scene : With reddish-brown oil globs washing ashore at Fort Morgan , Ala. , Faith Kaiser and Bertice McPherson decided to do what generations of Americans have done when government ca n't -- or wo n't -- tackle a big problem : They handled it themselves . Before paid cleanup crews started work , the volunteers pulled on rubber gloves and picked up the gooey mess . As they did so , Kaiser said this : `` Six months from now the government will lie to us and say everything is fine . '' At the 1787 Constitutional Convention , Benjamin Franklin famously observed that he had been trying to determine throughout the debate whether a sun painted on George Washington 's chair was rising or setting . `` But now at length , '' he said , `` I have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting sun . '' And with that , the Founders created a nation upon the fundamental principle of trust . They had an untested belief in the ability of people to lead themselves -- to choose leaders from their own ranks and to hold those leaders accountable . Even our currency , once backed by the promise of precious metal , is today built upon a faith-based system called `` fiat '' -- a Latin term meaning `` let it be done . '' In a dictatorship , people can lose faith in institutions and the apparatus of state can step in . But democracy ca n't survive without faith in its institutions because the people , by definition , create and control them . While there were surely crises of faith during the Civil War , the Progressive Era and others times of tumult , the early 20th century was marked by a reflexive sense of trust in the nation 's institutions . Even as Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal vastly expanded the government safety net , a new breed of private charities and social reformers did n't bother waiting on government to help the poor , infirm and abused . But things started to change in the mid-20th century , when polls showed a steady decline on the question of whether Americans trusted government in Washington to do what is right . From 1958 , when more than 70 percent said they trusted government most or all of the time , the trend line steadily drops until it hits the mid-20s in the post-Watergate era . The trust line creeps up for a few years -- without getting nowhere near the 1958 mark -- and plunges again in 1994 , the year President Bill Clinton 's political faltering caused Democrats to lose control of Congress after more than 40 years in power . Just two months ago , a Pew Research Center poll showed that only 22 percent of the public say they can trust the government in Washington always or most of the time , among the lowest measures in a half a century . `` This spill has just got to make matters worse , '' said Pew pollster Andy Kohut . `` People are asking , Who 's in charge ? Why ca n't they plug it ? What going on here ? '' Just 25 percent of the public has a favorable opinion of Congress . Favorability ratings also have fallen significantly for seven of 13 federal agencies included in the Pew survey , including the Environmental Protection Agency . Faith in institutions across the board has fallen since the 1970s , at least among the sample of institutions tracked by Gallup : churches , the U.S. Supreme Court , banks , public schools , newspapers , Congress and organized labor . One of the least-trusted institutions is big business , no surprise after corporate wrongdoing and lax government oversight combined to help create the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression . Sixteen percent of Americans said they had a `` great deal '' or `` quite a lot '' of confidence in big corporations in 2009 , compared to 32 percent 30 years prior . The only exception to this trend is the military , which has increased from a 54 percent favorability rating in the post-Vietnam era to 82 percent this year . Part of the problem : Americans today might expect too much of government and other institutions . Take the oil spill , for example . Accidents happen and , right or wrong , the government is not in the drilling or drill-capping business . `` I take responsibility . It is my job to make sure that everything is done to shut this down , '' Barack Obama declared a few days ago . In the same news conference , Obama also acknowledged his administration could have done better in dealing with the biggest oil spill in the nation 's history and misjudged the industry 's ability to cope with a worst-case scenario . It was a new twist for the U.S. presidency , an office normally filled by men who accept responsibility or admit fault only grudgingly . Obama may be recognizing that accountability breeds trust . Less than two years removed from an election victory built on his promise to fix Washington 's broken institutions , Obama now seems a captive of them . His administration 's regulators cozied up to the oil industry before the spill and moved slowly afterward to seize control . The president himself often seemed detached . Who else dropped the ball ? -- BP and its chief executive , Tony Hayward . As his company 's oil filled up the Gulf , he had the audacity to complain that `` I 'd like my life back . '' -- The Minerals Management Service , the regulatory agency that failed to clean up its act despite Obama 's promise during the campaign to end the `` cozy relationship '' between the oil industry and federal regulators . -- Even the Coast Guard -- the one agency that survived Katrina with its image enhanced -- is now being criticized for its lack of transparency and command . And the public stews . Listen to Billy Nugesser , president of the coastal Plaquemines Parish : `` We are dying a slow death here . '' The public 's unconditional faith in national institutions is dying , too . We ca n't buy a `` Shrek '' drinking glass at McDonald 's because it might be laced with cadmium . We ca n't talk about the Catholic church without wondering whether something untoward might be afoot . We ca n't watch a home run without wondering if our pro-ballplayer heroes are juiced . Which may be why an umpire 's blown call denying a rookie pitcher a historic `` perfect game '' became a viral story this week . Americans saw in the umpire 's apology and the pitcher 's gracious acceptance a sign that one of their institutions -- the made-by-America game of baseball -- still includes leaders who do the right thing even when the situation is less than perfect . From their government , Americans do n't expect perfection . But the system requires that people at least have faith in their political leaders to be competent and accountable . `` If people do n't believe , if people do n't give , if people do n't trust , they will pick the politicians who are the loudest rather than the most sincere , '' said Baick , the history professor . `` They will pick the rabble rouser rather than the technocrat who gets things done .

Gnarly trees shroud its slow-moving waters , rich with crabs and mullet . Docks have mailboxes ; letters are delivered by boat . Seafood boils with friends are a weekend staple . Jamie Hinton loves this place , just like everyone in this idyllic community off Mobile Bay , and he wants to do all he can to protect it from what he and others see as a twin threat -- oil and bumbling on the part of both government leaders and corporate executives . Hinton , chief of the Magnolia Springs Volunteer Fire Department , said Monday he spent three weeks tangled in red tape before finally getting approval to do something that 's never before been needed , much less tried : using a combination of barges and oil-blocking booms to keep crude out of the Magnolia River . On Sunday , the new system was finally in place at the mouth of Weeks Bay . Locals hope it will safeguard both the Magnolia River and the nearby Fish River , where the U.S. Postal Service operates what locals proudly call the nation 's last waterborne mail route . `` What you 've got here is a community that has taken charge of the situation and said , ` To hell with the system , ' '' said Gib Hixon , an old friend of Hinton and chief of Fish River\\/Marlow Fire and Rescue . `` It 's illegal to block this waterway . But if the oil comes , we 're going to bring a barge in and use it as a gate to block it , '' said Hixon . `` They can arrest me and Jamie if they want to . '' The story began when Hinton called his local county emergency management office to ask about plans for protecting coastal waters and was shocked by the response . `` The first thing the guy said was , ` People are blowing this thing out of proportion , it 's just light crude , '' Hinton said . `` I told him I do n't care if it 's light crude or dark crude or sweet crude , I do n't want it in my damn river . '' Baldwin County officials deny that anyone ever told Hinton such a thing . But whatever happened , Jamie Hinton was fired up . Hinton and other leaders got together to kick around ideas for safeguarding their river shortly after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 and sank in the Gulf of Mexico in about 5,000 feet of water off the Louisiana coast . Someone suggested using barges at the mouth of Weeks Bay to block waves out of the adjoining Mobile Bay , then adding layers of boom . `` It 's not rocket science , but it sounded like it might work , '' Hinton said . The engineering did n't seem that hard since the passage into Weeks Bay is only about 530 feet wide and fairly shallow . `` That protects the Fish River and the Magnolia River . I thought , ` that 's awesome , ' '' he said . Community members honed the plan , and Hinton set out to find barriers to supplement the single strand of narrow boom that BP provided , a meager allocation Hinton called `` overly ridiculous . '' He submitted the blueprint in mid-May believing he 'd get an answer quickly from the unified incident command in Mobile . And then , with the oil oozing toward the northern Gulf Coast , Hinton waited . After fits and starts , supposed approvals and later balks , Hinton finally got the OK last week on his fourth try to protect the river just as oil began washing ashore on Alabama beaches . With a $ 200,000 allocation from the $ 25 million that BP gave Alabama for oil spill response , rented barges , a tug and other barriers are now in the water . So far , no oil is in Weeks Bay or either river , but the slick has n't gotten to the barrier yet . If and when it does , Hinton and the mayor will make the decision to close the bay and block off access to the Magnolia River . `` We can shut it down in three hours , '' Hinton said . Why did it take so long for Hinton to get an answer about the protection plan ? Scott Hughes , a spokesman for the Alabama Department of Environmental Management , said the delay sounded like an issue for the unified command in Mobile to address . The head of the command , Coast Guard Capt. Steve Poulin , said it sounded like an issue related to the state 's approval process . Hixon , Hinton 's buddy , said the whole system is broken . `` This is the biggest damn mess I 've ever seen , '' he said . Patricia Sevening , a member of the Magnolia Springs Garden Club who lives on a canal off the Fish River , is just happy someone is protecting her water .

The leak resulted from last week 's explosion and collapse of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig . AP NEW ORLEANS -- Photographs showing a sheen of oil in the Gulf of Mexico southwest of the big BP spill are evidence only of government-approved work long under way , not a second major leak , an energy company said Tuesday . Site owner Taylor Energy Co. . LLC said in a written statement that a production platform about 70 miles -LRB- 112 kilometers -RRB- southwest of the Deepwater Horizon disaster was collapsed during Hurricane Ivan in 2004 by an underwater mudslide . Pictures taken by an aerial photographer over the weekend and posted on the Internet suggested that oil was leaking from the drilling rig Ocean Saratoga , owned by Diamond Offshore Inc. , and that a nearby vessel with a hose overboard was applying dispersant . But Taylor said the work boat was conducting scheduled drainage of the subsea containment system . The site has three containment domes below the surface , the company said . The domes had `` substantially reduced '' sheening over time , Taylor said , and leakage was slight because more than 100 feet -LRB- 30 meters -RRB- of mud and sediment cover the wells . Federal authorities have approved the cleanup project , which is under about 500 feet -LRB- 152 meters -RRB- of water , Taylor said . Taylor Energy president Will Pecue said in the statement that the company had been working with both the Coast Guard and the Mineral Management Service `` to address the resulting environmental impacts of one of the 10 most intense hurricanes ever recorded . '' Diamond Offshore said late Tuesday there had been no leak from its rig . The Coast Guard and MMS said earlier Tuesday that they were putting information together about the site but had not commented again by late in the day . MMS records show Taylor Energy has been working on cleaning up , decommissioning and abandoning the site since 2005 . Hundreds of platforms and wells dot the Gulf of Mexico , and releases of oil are not uncommon . Although Taylor Energy sold virtually all its properties in 2009 to Ankor Energy LLC , which retained most of Taylor 's staff and top management , Ankor said Tuesday that the lease was still owned and handled by Taylor .

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated . SEAN HANNITY , HOST : It has been 49 days since oil began spilling into the Gulf , and thus far BP and the Obama administration have not been able to plug the hole . But tonight on `` Hannity '' three Americans are here to share their ideas on how to stop the flow of oil and clean up this mess . Let me bring in the chairman of WOW Environmental Solutions , Engineer Nicholas Pozzi is with us . And the vice president of CW Roberts Contracting , Darryl Carpenter . And a 21-year-old prodigy professor Alia Sabur is with us . Guys , welcome to the program . I got to get to it . You have an amazing life story . So I want to get to you . You have a terrific idea here as well . All right , Darryl , why do n't we start with you . What you have been involved in has become an Internet sensation . I understand too that you have some guys there to demonstrate . I think over 700,000 hits now on YouTube using hay . They 're not doing it . Why do n't you tell us what you 've come up with ? DARRYL CARPENTER , CW ROBERTS CONTRACTING : We got a couple of guys here that 's going to demonstrate first while I kind of explain what we 're doing . We got George Roberts and Otis Goodson . We 're going to put some oil in the water . We actually have seawater from the Gulf of Mexico that we brought in and this is actually some crude oil from an oil well in Alabama . So we 're actually doing what would actually be out there in the ocean . George is going to take some hay , regular old hay like you have on the farm . Put it on top of the oil and it will actually absorb the oil up . Otis has got some polyester reinforced fabric . This stuff works great . It actually does better -- almost immediately it will absorb the oil up . So there 's two different products we 've been working with the hay and we 've -- in that timeframe we 've actually found some more products that work , too . And -- so we want to show a little bit of every one of it . But we 've not had any response on any of our products . HANNITY : Well , can I just -- CARPENTER : And we do n't -- we do n't know why . HANNITY : Can you ask one of your demonstrators there if it 's possible , turn it over ? Because what you do is you lay this on the surface , obviously , of the ocean and then you 'd just scoop up the hay -- HANNITY : -- and along with the hay you 're getting -- what percentage of the oil would you get ? CARPENTER : You can see right there . We can 95 percent of it right there . You can see how much is on the hay right there now . CARPENTER : Just with that little bit . And it just sucks it right up . HANNITY : And nobody is listening to your idea even though this has become an Internet sensation ? Nobody 's -- nobody reaching out to you ? CARPENTER : Nobody is -- look how clean the water is . Nobody is reaching out to us . Look at the clean the water is right there . CARPENTER : If it was n't saltwater you could drink it . Honestly , look at that . It 's clean as -- that is a great demonstration . All right , well -- HANNITY : I appreciate that . All right , let 's bring in Nick Pozzi . Nick , welcome to the program . Now you are a -- NICHOLAS POZZI , ENGINEER : Thank you . HANNITY : You 're a contractor . And you came up with a pretty interesting idea to suck the crude off the water 's surface . Let 's go to your idea and tell us what you 've got . POZZI : First of all , I want to say that hay sucks up -- just so you know -- 80 percent of its weight in oil so it 's very , very effective . It 's usually -- was used all over the world . It 's been used for years and years and years . It is nature 's most effective way and safe way to pick up oil . That 's number one . Number two is the fact that I 'm actually the chairman of WOW Environmental Solutions . And -- but I 've been a contractor , worked in Saudi Arabia for 18 years where we had , unfortunately , a lot of oil spills . And through lessons learned we developed ways to clean up oil everywhere , including at all level , all depths through different currents that hand off each other , to basically supply oxygenated water as well as nutrients to oyster beds and shrimp and so on and so forth in the Gulf of Arabia . HANNITY : All right , Nick -- HANNITY : Let me just -- because we only limited on time here . And you guys have three great ideas . HANNITY : So in other words , regardless of currents , regardless of depth you have been able to basically -- you have techniques that can suck up this oil . So in other words , if we would have started using that 10 days into the spill the chances of this reaching shore in the quantities that we 're going to be looking at here are negligible . And again , I ask you , did anybody from the government , BP , anyone reach out to you ? POZZI : No , we 've actually shared this idea on day two of the oil spill . POZZI : Went down to home and to BP headquarters and basically we could not get an audience . We have sent them over and over again information and they basically said it 's not an applicable for this particular spill . And I 've challenged them to an actual open debate about it and to tell me why it 's not effective and to demonstrate how it is effective . And I have not received any response back . Everybody seems to be looking at it but no one seems to be doing anything . HANNITY : I got to -- these are two great ideas that obviously work . It 's very frustrating . Let me bring Alia Sabur in here . First all , you were 10 years old when you were going to college . ALIA SABUR , NANOTECHNOLOGY PROFESSOR : Yes . HANNITY : How -- and your parents are here , they must be so proud . And you were teaching in college at 18 . HANNITY : You 're a professor . Now I read your story first in The New York Post . And you came up with a brilliant idea . Why do n't you tell everybody ? We have a picture of it but I want you to explain it yourself . SABUR : Well , the basic idea is that instead of trying to put something on to the pipe or around the pipe . SABUR : To try and basically stop it or to put a cork in it even . HANNITY : Put a cork in it . HANNITY : All right . Now just -- we have on the screen a diagram of what you came up with here . And the pipe is where -- you decided that you would try and plug it up with tires , right ? And it would be like rings of tires in a row -- SABUR : Like donuts around it . And then you have them deflated . It would be tricky enough to get that kind of construction in there with them deflated . So they need to be as small as possible and then we fill them up with hydraulic fluid . HANNITY : How do -- as I read this I was thinking to myself , but I 'm not the brilliant engineer , you are . How would you inflate the tires at that point ? SABUR : They are doing everything with robots . HANNITY : So you think they 'd be able to inflate them even 5,000 feet down ? SABUR : That 's how robots work on hydraulic fluid . HANNITY : All right , I 'm not the engineer , you are . But now you did meet with , I understand -- you did meet with the head of BP . You initiated the meeting , correct ? SABUR : Yes , and it was somewhat similar to what -- what was just mentioned . And I went down there and I tried to get a hold of someone just to listen to me . And I guess that it happened to work out well and then I met this guy , a BP executive . And I said , you know , look , I have this idea , can you take a look at it ? And first he did n't think it was my idea , because -- SABUR : Look at you and look at your two other guests , and then look at me . Do I look like the kind of person that comes up with this kind of idea ? HANNITY : You look like the person that I would like to invest a lot of money in the future , because you 're all very smart . I hope -- I mean this in all sincerity . I 'm worried about the fishermen . I 'm worried about the tourism industry . I 'm worried about our environment and our beaches . I want to say congratulations to you and to all of you for what you 're doing , your efforts . I hope somebody , you know , as Santelli said on the -- on the floor of the stock exchange : White House are you listening ? We have smart people here . They have some good ideas .

Their assertions -- combined with BP 's rush to build a bigger cap and its apparent difficulty in immediately processing all the oil being collected -- have only added to the impression that BP and the government are still floundering in dealing with the catastrophe and may be misleading the public . The cap that was put on the ruptured well last week collected about 620,000 gallons -LRB- 2.3 million liters -RRB- of oil on Monday and another 330,000 gallons -LRB- 1.25 million liters -RRB- by noon Tuesday , funneling it to a ship at the surface , said Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man on the crisis . That would mean the cap is capturing better than half of the oil , based on the government 's estimate that around 600,000 gallons -LRB- 2.25 million liters -RRB- to 1.2 million gallons -LRB- 4.5 million liters -RRB- a day are leaking from the bottom of the sea . The undersea efforts came as BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles struck an upbeat tone about the anticipated progress of the oil containment , saying that the spill `` should be down to a relative trickle by Monday or Tuesday . '' Suttles told The Associated Press in a stop in Alabama that the arrival of a second vessel in the coming days to help pump the oil from the deepwater gusher will allow engineers to make significant progress , even as others involved in the disaster were much less optimistic and continued to criticize BP over its litany of failures to control the spill . A team of researchers and government officials assembled by the Coast Guard and run by the director of the U.S. Geological Survey is studying the flow rate and hopes to present its latest findings in the coming days on what is already the biggest oil spill in U.S. history . In an interview with The Associated Press , team member and Purdue University engineering professor Steve Wereley said it was a `` reasonable conclusion '' but not the team 's final one to say that the daily flow rate is , in fact , somewhere between 798,000 gallons -LRB- 3 million liters -RRB- and 1.8 million gallons -LRB- 6.8 million liters -RRB- . `` BP is claiming they 're capturing the majority of the flow , which I think is going to be proven wrong in short order , '' Wereley said . `` Why do n't they show the American public the before-and-after shots ? '' He added : `` It 's strictly an estimation , and they are portraying it as fact . '' To install the device snugly , BP engineers had to cut away the twisted and broken well pipe . That increased the flow of oil , similar to what happens when a kink is removed from a garden hose . BP and others warned that would happen . The government said the increase amounted to about 20 percent . Asked about the containment effort and the uncertainties in estimating how much oil is escaping , Allen said : `` I have never said this is going well . We 're throwing everything we 've got . '' Paul Bommer , a University of Texas petroleum and geosystems engineering professor and member of the flow rate team , said cap seems to have made a `` dent '' in reducing the flow , but there is still a lot of oil coming out . That seemed clear from the underwater `` spillcam '' video , which continued to show a big plume of gas and oil billowing into the water . The current equipment collecting the oil being brought to the surface is believed to be nearing its daily processing capacity . BP said it will boost capacity by bringing in a floating platform it believes can process most of the flow , and believes the extra pumping power can help reduce the spill by early next week , when President Barack Obama is scheduled to make his fourth visit to the Gulf since the disaster began . The company also said it will use a device that vaporizes and burns off oil while working to design a new cap that can capture more crude . At the same time , BP is working to design a new cap that can capture more oil . In the seven weeks since the oil rig explosion that set off the catastrophe , BP has had to improvise at every turn . The most recent government estimates put the total amount of oil lost at 23.7 million to 51.5 million gallons . `` I think virtually everybody from BP to the state to the Coast Guard was caught flat-footed and did not expect a spill of this magnitude , '' said Ed Overton , a professor of environmental sciences at Louisiana State University . `` Everybody has been playing catch-up . '' When asked why BP did not have containment systems on standby in case of a leak , BP spokesman Robert Wine said there was no reason to think an accident on this scale was likely . `` It 's unprecedented , '' he said . `` That 's why these caps were n't there before . '' Kenneth Arnold , an offshore drilling consultant and engineer , said the reason a bigger cap was n't installed first was that BP probably wanted to start with what it could do quickly , which he said makes sense . He said BP has been working several solutions all along in parallel and deploying them as they can . `` They have n't been waiting for one to fail and then employing the next one , '' Arnold said . He added : `` The idea you can wave your arm at this and come to a magical solution is just from someone who does n't understand the problem . We as a nation are used to instant gratification . There is a problem . We want someone to fix it tomorrow . Things are not always that easy . '' Some answers may emerge next week , when BP CEO Tony Hayward will make his first appearance before Congress to answer questions in what will probably be a heated session , given the anger directed at BP . The debate over the flow rate came as workers in bulldozers piled sand 6 feet -LRB- 1.83 meters -RRB- high along barrier islands bordering Louisiana to protect the environmentally fragile areas from the spill , which has already coated islands and pelican rookeries in thick , brown , sticky crude . `` This is finally something that can help , '' fishing guide Dave Marino said of the sand barrier effort . `` It looks like this is something that may work . '' Attempts to skim the oil progressed as well . Boats fanned out across the Gulf , dragging boom in their wake in an attempt to corral the oil . But it 's an enormous task . In some spots , the oil is several inches thick -LRB- centimeters -RRB- and forms a brown taffy-like goo that sticks to everything it touches . John Young , chairman of Louisiana 's Jefferson Parish Council , said additional equipment has been ordered and more dredgers will be moving into the area soon , along with barges that will help block the passes . `` It 's nice that BP has put up the money , but they need to ramp up not only the manpower but the equipment out there because we 're losing the battle , '' Young said . `` Unfortunately , we 're on day 50 and it 's too little too late , but I guess it 's better late than never . '' Meanwhile , researchers are beginning to obtain a clearer picture of the spill as they analyze water samples . For example , marine scientists found a 100-foot -LRB- 30-meter -RRB- - thick layer of oil 1,300 feet -LRB- 390 meters -RRB- below the surface about 45 miles -LRB- 72 kilometers -RRB- from the well site . And officials in the Florida Panhandle are posting signs warning beachgoers not to swim or fish off a six-mile -LRB- 10-kilometer -RRB- stretch of oil-fouled beaches near the Alabama state line -- the first time such restrictions have been imposed in the state since the spill began .

Samantha Joye Vast undersea plumes of oil that can choke off marine life stretch from the site of the DeepWater rig explosion , argued a scientist on Tuesday -- plumes BP has stated do not exist . Dr. Samantha Joye , professor of marine sciences at the University of Georgia , insists that the Gulf oil disaster wo n't go away anytime soon , and the massive plumes of oil she and her colleagues have been observing for the past two weeks are an essential part of the problem . When the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded on April 20 , Joye was researching methane leakage from oil drilling aboard a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency-funded research vessel 8 miles from the disaster site . She shifted her focus promptly to the site and quickly discovered a massive oil plume she and her colleagues estimate to be more than 15 miles long , 5 miles wide and some 300 feet thick at depths ranging from approximately 2,300 feet to 4,200 feet . `` It 's a disaster zone , '' Joye told reporters at a press conference Tuesday morning , though she did praise NOAA 's ability to coordinate the number of vessels in the area and the sheer scope of the cleanup efforts . Joye is one of several scientists who have been reporting on the existence of the oil plumes , which BP has said several times do not exist . The oil company believes most oil from the leak is on the surface of the ocean . During a tour of a BP PLC staging area for cleanup workers May 30 , CEO Tony Hayward said the company 's sampling showed `` no evidence '' that oil was suspended in large masses beneath the surface . He did n't elaborate on how the testing was done . Hayward said that oil 's natural tendency is to rise to the surface , and any oil found underwater was in the process of working its way up . `` The oil is on the surface , '' Hayward said . `` There are n't any plumes . '' `` The plume is largely water , '' Joye wrote on her website Gulf Oil Blog , `` not thick oil like you see on the surface in some places , it 's diluted oil and it 's most concentrated closest to the leaking riser pipe . The substance making up the plume is different from the oil on the surface of the Gulf , however . `` Think of it as gas-saturated oil that has been shot out of a deep sea cannon under intense pressure , '' she writes . `` It 's like putting olive oil in a spray can , pressurizing it and pushing the spray button . What comes out when you push that button ? A mist of olive oil . This well is leaking a mist of oil that is settling out in the deep sea . '' BP has insisted that oil from the leaking well is on the surface of the water . `` It 's having a clear impact that you can see throughout the water column , '' she said , and the NOAA finally admitted its existence as well . In a separate news conference , NOAA head Jane Lubchenco confirmed the finding , acknowledging that `` yes , there is oil in the water column . '' The agency planned to analyze the several studies that have pointed to the existence of subsurface oil , which the U.S. agency confirms reach as far as 142 miles from the spill . Joye and her team have just returned from a two-week research expedition to document the plume 's distribution , to measure the activity of microbes that break down the oil , and to measure variables such as dissolved oxygen concentration . `` There is a tremendous amount of oxygen consumption in the plumes , '' she wrote on her blog , at least 5-10 times higher than elsewhere in the ocean . Joye worries that the high rate of oxygen depletion will starve any oxygen-breathing life in the waters . One of the main tacks BP has taken to clean up the spilled oil has been the use of dispersants , which break the oil up into smaller elements . `` The solution to pollution is not dilution , '' Joye quipped . `` This is an excuse , and it takes away from the important things we should be thinking about . '' In August , the Gulf currents will reverse and slosh back , she noted , meaning that the substances in the water will remain for a long time , and will have a long-term impact . She stressed the need to document and assess the scale of the impact the oil will have on the environment .

WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama says his talks with Gulf fishermen and oil spill experts are not an academic exercise . They 're `` so I know whose ass to kick . '' One target for the presidential foot : Tony Hayward , the embattled chief executive of BP . Obama was asked by Matt Lauer of NBC 's `` Today '' about Hayward 's past comments that `` I want my life back , '' that the Gulf was `` a big ocean '' and that `` the environmental impact of this disaster is likely to be very , very modest . '' `` He would n't be working for me after any of those statements , '' Obama said , according to excerpts released by NBC . The interview was to air Tuesday . NBC aired portions and put out some excerpts Monday night . It was part of a stepped-up White House effort to show Obama is actively engaged in dealing with the worst oil spill in the nation 's history , and to distance itself from the London-based oil giant , formerly known as British Petroleum . Polls have shown a majority of Americans believe Obama has handled the crisis poorly . The administration is n't even using the same figures as BP any more for how much oil is flowing from the blown-out well and how much is being captured . Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen told a White House briefing Monday that a cap on the damaged oil well is now keeping up to 462,000 gallons of oil a day from leaking into the Gulf , up sharply from previous amounts . But his figures conflicted slightly with BP 's numbers . In a statement , BP put the amount being captured at 466,200 gallons . Allen said the government was using its own flow-rate calculations and no longer wanted to rely on those from BP . Obama met Monday with his Cabinet and Allen for a briefing on the oil spill , which began April 20 with an explosion and fire that killed 11 workers on a BP-leased rig . In remarks after that meeting , Obama sought to reassure the nation that the Gulf Coast would `` bounce back '' from the spill -- but not without time , effort and reimbursement from BP . BP is the majority owner of the oil well that blew , but other energy companies are also partners and will bear proportionate financial responsibility . Obama stepped up his rhetoric with NBC 's Lauer while on a trip to Kalamazoo , Mich. , to deliver a high-school commencement address . He strongly defended his role in dealing with the crisis , including his three visits to the region since the spill began . `` I was down there a month ago before most of these talking heads were even paying attention to the Gulf , '' Obama said . Obama said he has talked to a variety of `` experts '' on the oil spill in addition to the fishermen . `` I do n't sit around just talking to experts because this is a college seminar , we talk to these folks because they potentially have the best answers -- so I know whose ass to kick , '' the president said .

AP NEW ORLEANS -- Glaring errors and omissions in BP 's oil spill response plans have exposed a slapdash effort to follow environmental rules , outraging Gulf Coast residents who can see on their beaches how unprepared the company was . BP PLC 's 582-page regional spill plan for the Gulf , and its 52-page , site-specific plan for the Deepwater Horizon rig vastly understate the dangers posed by an uncontrolled leak and vastly overstate the company 's preparedness to deal with one , according to an Associated Press analysis . The lengthy plans were approved by the federal government last year before BP drilled its ill-fated well . Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal was incensed Wednesday after reading the AP story and said BP has been reactive -- not proactive -- all along . `` Look , it 's obvious to everybody in south Louisiana that they did n't have a plan , they did n't have an adequate plan to deal with this spill , '' Jindal said . `` They did n't anticipate the BOP -LRB- blowout preventer -RRB- failure . They did n't anticipate this much oil hitting our coast . From the very first days , they kept telling us , ` Do n't worry , the oil 's not going to make it to your coast . ' '' Among the glaring errors in the report : A professor is listed in BP 's 2009 response plan for a Gulf of Mexico oil spill as a national wildlife expert . He died in 2005 . The plan lists cold-water marine mammals including walruses , sea otters , sea lions and seals as `` sensitive biological resources . '' None of those animals live anywhere near the Gulf . Also , names and phone numbers of several Texas A&M University marine life specialists are wrong . So are the numbers for marine mammal stranding network offices in Louisiana and Florida , which are disconnected . `` The AP report paints a picture of a company that was making it up as it went along , while telling regulators it had the full capability to deal with a major spill , '' Sen. Bill Nelson , D-Fla . , wrote in an e-mail to the AP . `` We know that was n't true . '' Nelson said he and Sen. Barbara Boxer , D-Calif . , have asked for a criminal investigation into some of the company 's claims . Earlier this month , the federal government announced criminal and civil investigations into the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . Attorney General Eric Holder has not said who might be targeted in the probes into the largest oil spill in U.S. history . Legal experts say that to file criminal charges , the Justice Department will have to find evidence that BP or other companies involved in the deadly oil rig explosion and subsequent spill orchestrated a coverup , destroyed key documents or lied to government agents . Charges and civil penalties can be brought under a variety of environmental protection laws . In its Deepwater Horizon plan , the British oil giant stated : `` BP Exploration and Production Inc. has the capability to respond , to the maximum extent practicable , to a worst case discharge , or a substantial threat of such a discharge , resulting from the activities proposed in our Exploration Plan . '' In the spill scenarios detailed in the documents , fish , marine mammals and birds escape serious harm ; beaches remain pristine ; water quality is only a temporary problem . And those are the projections for a leak about 10 times worse than what has been calculated for the ongoing disaster . Rep. Darrell Issa of California , the top Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform committee , is investigating failures by the federal Minerals Management Service , which regulates oil rigs . He said Wednesday that if there had been a serious effort to reform the agency , the `` mistakes '' in BP 's report would have been caught . `` This is yet another example of MMS acting as a rubber stamp for industry , and industry settling for the lowest possible standard of safety at the expense the environment and economic vitality of the Gulf region , '' he said . BP spokesman Daren Beaudo said the response plans will be reviewed `` so that we can determine what worked well and what needs improvement . '' `` Thus far we have implemented the largest spill response in history and many , many elements of it have worked well . However , we are greatly disappointed that oil has made landfall and impacted shorelines and marshes . The situation we are dealing with is clearly complex , unprecedented and will offer us much to learn from , '' Beaudo said . The plans contain wildly false assumptions about oil spills . BP 's proposed method to calculate spill volume judging by the darkness of the oil sheen is way off . The internationally accepted formula would produce estimates 100 times higher . The Gulf 's loop current , which is projected to help eventually send oil hundreds of miles around Florida 's southern tip and up the Atlantic coast , is n't mentioned in either plan . The website listed for Marine Spill Response Corp. -- one of two firms that BP relies on for equipment to clean a spill -- links to a defunct Japanese-language page . In early May , at least 80 Louisiana state prisoners were trained to clean birds by listening to a presentation and watching a video . It was a work force never envisioned in the plans , which contain no detailed references to how birds would be cleansed of oil . And while BP officials and the federal government have insisted that they have attacked the problem as if it were a much larger spill , that is n't apparent from the constantly evolving nature of the response . Asked if he was angry about the inadequate plans , Jindal said : `` Absolutely . You ca n't just assume the best . Your plan ca n't be , well , the BOP is going to work . Your plan ca n't be , well , the oil is not going to travel more than 50 miles and reach our coast . Your plan ca n't be that if the BOP does n't work , then the junk shot is going to work , then the mud kill shot is going to work . '' This week , after BP reported the seemingly good news that a containment cap installed on the wellhead was funneling some of the gushing crude to a tanker on the surface , BP introduced a whole new set of plans mostly aimed at capturing more oil . The latest incarnation calls for building a larger cap , using a special incinerator to burn off some of the recaptured oil and bringing in a floating platform to process the oil being sucked away from the gushing well . In other words , the on-the-fly planning continues . One of the most glaring errors in BP 's plans involves Dr. Peter Lutz , a Florida professor , one of several dozen experts recommended as resources to be contacted in the event of a spill . Lutz is listed as a go-to wildlife specialist at the University of Miami . But Lutz , an eminent sea turtle expert , left Miami almost 20 years ago to chair the marine biology department at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton . He died four years before the plan was published . Molly Lutcavage , a research professor at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst who worked closely with Lutz on a groundbreaking report on the effects of oil on sea turtles , was dismayed to hear that Lutz was still listed in the response plan . `` It 's horribly depressing and shocking that so little attention is paid to a bona fide contingency plan , '' she said . `` What would Peter think ? I think he would think it was typical of bureaucracy . '' There are other examples of how BP 's plans have fallen short : -- Beaches where oil washed up within weeks of a spill were supposed to be safe from contamination because BP promised it could marshal more than enough boats to scoop up all the oil before any deepwater spill could reach shore -- a claim that in retrospect seems absurd . `` The vessels in question maintain the necessary spill containment and recovery equipment to respond effectively , '' one of the documents says . BP asserts that the combined response could skim , suck up or otherwise remove 20 million gallons of oil each day from the water . But that is about how much has leaked in the past six weeks -- and the slick now covers about 3,300 square miles , according to Hans Graber , director of the University of Miami 's satellite sensing facility . Only a small fraction of the spill has been successfully skimmed . Plus , an undetermined portion has sunk to the bottom of the Gulf or is suspended somewhere in between . The plan uses computer modeling to project a 21 percent chance of oil reaching the Louisiana coast within a month of a spill . In reality , an oily sheen reached the Mississippi River delta just nine days after the April 20 explosion . Heavy globs soon followed . Other locales where oil washed up within weeks of the explosion were characterized in BP 's regional plan as safely out of the way of any oil danger . -- BP 's site plan regarding birds , sea turtles or endangered marine mammals -LRB- `` no adverse impacts '' -RRB- also have proved far too optimistic . While the exact toll on the Gulf 's wildlife may never be known , the effects clearly have been devastating . More than 400 oiled birds have been treated , while dozens have been found dead and covered in crude , mainly in Louisiana but also in Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . More than 200 lifeless turtles , several dolphins and countless fish also have washed ashore . The response plans anticipate nothing on this scale . There were n't supposed to be any coastline problems because the site was far offshore . `` Due to the distance to shore -LRB- 48 miles -RRB- and the response capabilities that would be implemented , no significant adverse impacts are expected , '' the site plan says . But that distance has failed to protect precious resources . And last week , a group of environmental research center scientists released a computer model that suggested oil could ride ocean currents around Florida and up to North Carolina by summer . -- Perhaps the starkest example of BP 's planning failures : The company has insisted that the size of the leak does n't matter because it has been reacting to a worst-case scenario all along . While a disaster as devastating as a major oil spill will create unforeseen problems , BP 's plans do not anticipate even the most obvious issues , and use mountains of words to dismiss problems that have proven overwhelming . In responses to lengthy lists of questions from AP , the Interior Department , which oversees the MMS , appears to concede there were problems with the two oil spill response plans . `` Many of the questions you raise are exactly those questions that will be examined and answered by the presidential commission as well as other investigations into BP 's oil spill , '' said Kendra Barkoff , spokeswoman for Interior Secretary Ken Salazar . She added that Salazar has undertaken reforms of MMS . A key failure of the plan 's cleanup provisions was the scarcity of boom -- floating lines of plastic or absorbent material placed around sensitive areas to deflect oil . From the start , local officials all along the Gulf Coast have complained about a lack of supplies , particularly the heavier , so-called ocean boom . But even BP says in its regional plan that boom is n't effective in seas more than three to four feet ; waves in the Gulf are often bigger . And even in calmer waters , oil has swamped vital wildlife breeding grounds in places supposedly sequestered by multiple layers of boom . The BP plans speak of thorough resources for all ; there 's no talk of a need to share . Still , Alabama Gov. Bob Riley said his shores were left vulnerable by Coast Guard decisions to shift boom to Louisiana when the oil threatened landfall there . Meanwhile , in Louisiana 's Plaquemines Parish , some have complained that miles of the boom now in the water were not properly anchored . AP reporters saw evidence they 're right -- some lines of boom were so broken up they hardly impeded the slick 's push to shore .

That 's 20 percentage points higher than the 37 percent who think the administration did as much as it could as fast as it could . Not unexpectedly , most Republicans -LRB- 72 percent -RRB- think the administration could have done more . A majority of independents -LRB- 63 percent -RRB- , as well as a substantial minority of Democrats -LRB- 43 percent -RRB- , agree . And while many voters -- 36 percent -- think the Obama administration is `` up to the job '' of fixing the problem in the gulf , a 54 percent majority thinks the administration is `` in over its head . '' BP garners even less confidence : 25 percent think it 's `` up to the job '' and 68 percent `` in over its head . '' Just over half of voters -LRB- 51 percent -RRB- now disapprove of the job the White House is doing on the spill . Some 38 percent approve , down from 44 percent approval in mid-May , and 50 percent approval the week after the rig explosion . BP gets worse marks : 13 percent approve and 79 percent disapprove of how the company is handling the spill . A majority of Democrats -LRB- 60 percent -RRB- approves of how the Obama administration is dealing with the spill , while majorities of Republicans -LRB- 74 percent -RRB- and independents -LRB- 55 percent -RRB- disapprove . Large majorities of Democrats -LRB- 84 percent -RRB- , Republicans -LRB- 74 percent -RRB- and independents -LRB- 80 percent -RRB- disapprove of BP 's job performance . President Obama 's overall job rating holds steady this week : 46 percent of voters approve and 45 percent disapprove . In mid-May , 45 percent approved and 46 percent disapproved -LRB- 18-19 May 2010 -RRB- . While a majority of voters think the president has been `` compassionate '' in reacting to the spill -LRB- 60 percent -RRB- , far fewer describe his response as `` strong leadership '' -LRB- 42 percent -RRB- or as `` aggressive '' -LRB- 28 percent -RRB- . In the six weeks since the rig disaster , President Obama has visited the gulf three times and is expected to go again next week . Nearly half of voters -- 45 percent -- think he is spending the right amount of time working on the spill . That 's slightly more than the 40 percent who think he 's spending too little time . Only 4 percent say he 's spending too much time . For comparison , a month after Hurricane Katrina hit the gulf coast some 51 percent of voters thought President Bush was spending the right amount of time on hurricane relief , 27 percent said too little time and 12 percent said too much -LRB- 27-28 September 2005 -RRB- . The national telephone poll was conducted for Fox News by Opinion Dynamics Corp. among 900 registered voters from June 8 to June 9 . For the total sample , the poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points . Who 's responsible for the oil spill ? More people -LRB- 58 percent -RRB- point to BP for not being prepared than point to anyone else . Ten percent blame environmentalists for opposing drilling on land and in shallow water . Similar numbers put the blame on consumers for relying on large quantities of oil and gas -LRB- 8 percent -RRB- and the federal government for allowing the drilling -LRB- 7 percent -RRB- . In addition , more voters think the lesson learned from the BP disaster is that drilling should be done in shallow waters or on land so problems can be more easily addressed -LRB- 40 percent -RRB- than think it 's that drilling should be seriously limited in the future -LRB- 31 percent -RRB- or that it should be done in extremely remote areas -LRB- 14 percent -RRB- . The number in favor of increasing offshore drilling has dropped below half for the first time and now stands at 44 percent . That 's down from 54 percent three weeks ago -LRB- 18-19 May 2010 -RRB- . In early April , before the Deep Water Horizon oil rig exploded on April 20 , fully 70 percent said they favored increasing offshore drilling in U.S. coastal waters . Similarly , opposition has increased to 48 percent , up from 38 percent in mid-May and 22 percent in early April . The largest decline in support for drilling comes from Democrats . Just 28 percent of Democrats favor increasing drilling in the latest poll . That 's a 33 percentage point drop from the 61 percent who favored it in April . For Republicans , 62 percent favor it today , while 79 percent favored it before the BP disaster . There is a similar drop in support among independents : 52 percent favor it now , down from 71 percent . Spill Stirs More Heartbreak than Anger When asked about their personal reactions to the spill , more voters expressed heartbreak than anger . A significant number also worry about the economic fallout . Nearly 7 in 10 voters -LRB- 69 percent -RRB- are `` very '' worried about the economic impact of the spill and another 23 percent are `` somewhat '' worried . Most people -- 95 percent -- say they feel heartbroken about the people and wildlife affected by the spill -LRB- 76 percent `` very '' and 19 percent `` somewhat '' -RRB- . Fully 83 percent are angry at those responsible -LRB- 52 percent `` very '' and 31 percent `` somewhat '' -RRB- . Women react more intensely than men on both measures : Women are more likely to be very angry -LRB- by 7 percentage points -RRB- as well as very heartbroken -LRB- by 8 points -RRB- .

Joseph Carafano of the Heritage Foundation has been studying the matter and wonders , Are we accepting all the international assistance in the maritime domain that we can , and is the Jones Act an impediment to that ? The Coast Guard and the Administration are quick to point out that some foreign technology is being used in the current cleanup effort . Including : - Canada s offer of 3,000 meters of containment boom - Three sets of COSEQ sweeping arms from the Dutch - Mexico s offer of two skimmers and 4200 meters of boom - Norway s offer of 8 skimming systems But that is largely technology transferred to US vessels . Some of the best clean up ships owned by Belgian , Dutch and the Norwegian firms are NOT being used . Coast Guard Lt. Commander , Chris O Neil , says that is because they do not meet the operational requirements of the Unified Area Command . One of those operational requirements is that vessels comply with the Jones Act . `` Yes , it does apply , said ONeil , I have heard no discussions of waivers . Waivers to the Jones Act were granted by the administration of George W. Bush in the days following hurricane Katrina . And today , the Obama White House said waivers might again be considered . If there is the need for any type of waiver , that would obviously be granted , said White House Spokesman Robert Gibbs . But , we 've not had that problem thus far . Democratic Senator Bill Nelson is not so sure about that . He s hearing from the folks back home in Florida , where they want all the skimmer ships they can get . He sent a letter to Admiral Thad Allen today which read in part : Admiral , I believe the orange mousse of oil that is now in Florida s waters is more than enough evidence that we need to take advantage of every appropriate global resource . Please advise as to whether we are taking full advantage of the offers of assistance from other countries . When asked about this by Fox News , Admiral Allen said , If it gets to the point where a Jones Act waiver is required , we 're willing to do that too Nobody has come to me with a request for a Jones Act waiver . After 50 plus days of oil flowing freely into the gulf , the question could be asked : Why do effective and proven foreign clean up ships remain on the sidelines ? Carafano believes it may have something to do with the Obama administration s close relationship with labor unions . Cause this is a big thing for unions , Carafano said . The unions see it as protecting jobs . They hate when the Jones Act gets waived , and they pound on politicians when they do that . So are we giving in to unions and not doing everything we can , or is there some kind of impediment that we do n't know about ? If the Obama Administration needs an example of what can happen when global assets are allowed to tackle a massive oil spill , they need look no further than Saudi Aramco s clean up of a massive wartime spill off the Kuwaiti coast in 1991 . Aramco summoned every available ship to assist in the cleanup . The company claims it recovered 900,000 barrels of oil in roughly three months .

GRAND ISLE , La. -- The financial toll of the oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico escalated Wednesday as BP 's stock plummeted to a 14-year low and fishermen , businesses and property owners who have filed damage claims with the company angrily complained of delays , excessive paperwork and skimpy payments that have put them on the verge of going under . The oil company captured an ever larger-share of the crude gushing from the bottom of the sea and began bringing in more heavy equipment to help in the effort , including a production ship and a tanker from the North Sea that will allow the system to process larger quantities of oil and better withstand tropical storms . The containment efforts played out as investors deserted BP amid fears that the company might be forced to suspend dividends , end up in bankruptcy and find itself overwhelmed by the cleanup costs , penalties , damage claims and lawsuits generated by the biggest oil spill in U.S. history . Shrimpers , oystermen , seafood businesses , out-of-work drilling crews and the tourism industry all are lining up to get paid back the billions of dollars washed away by the disaster , and tempers have flared as locals direct outrage at BP over what they see as a tangle of red tape . `` Every day we call the adjuster eight or 10 times . There 's no answer , no answering machine , '' said Regina Shipp , who has filed $ 33,000 in claims for lost business at heea rigs to the shores of Scotland , and its deployment in the Gulf has been part of the broader plan to expand the amount of crude brought to the surface once a new and improved cap-and-collection system is installed over the leaking well . The government has estimated 600,000 to 1.2 million gallons are leaking per day , but a scientist on a task force studying the flow said the actual rate may be between 798,000 gallons and 1.8 million . Crews working at the site toiled under oppressive conditions as the heat index soared to 110 degrees and toxic vapors emanated from the depths . Fireboats were on hand to pour water on the surface to ease the fumes . Allen also confronted BP over the complaints about the claims process , warning the company in a letter : `` We need complete , ongoing transparency into BP 's claims process including detailed information on how claims are being evaluated , how payment amounts are being calculated and how quickly claims are being processed . '' The admiral this week created a team including officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help with the damage claims . It will send workers into Gulf communities to provide information about the process . He also planned to discuss the complaints with BP officials Wednesday . Under federal law , BP is required to pay for a range of damage , including property losses and lost earnings . Residents and businesses can call a telephone line to report losses , file a claim online and seek help at one of 25 claims offices around the Gulf . Deckhands and other fishermen generally need to show a photo ID and documentation such as a pe was instructed to gather the same documents and this time go to a claims office . There , an adjuster told Walter he would be eligible for only a $ 5,000 payment since his tax returns showed a technical business loss when depreciation was factored in . `` I said that 's not fair because if you say that , then I have to go out of business and I lose everything , '' Walter said . He is now working with an accounting firm to calculate his losses . Not everyone had complaints about the claims process . Bart Harrison of Clay , Ala. , filed his first claim on Wednesday morning for lost rental income on his coastal property and expected to have a check for $ 1,010 within a few hours . The only documentation required was tax returns and rental histories for his units , which were both easy to provide . `` The guy I talked to was knowledgeable and respectful . It seemed like he really wanted to write a check and please me since it was my first time in , '' Harrison said .

GRAND ISLE , La. -- BP said Thursday that it plans to boost its ability to directly capture hundreds of thousands of oil gushing from a well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico by early next week . Kent Wells , BP 's senior vice president of exploration and production , said a semi-submersible drilling rig would capture and burn about 420,000 gallons of oil daily . Once on board , the oil and gas collected from the well will be sent down a boom and burned at sea . A drill ship already at the scene can process a maximum of 756,000 gallons of oil daily that 's sucked up through a containment cap sitting on the well head . The containment effort played out as BP stock continued to plunge amid fears that the company might be forced to suspend dividends and find itself overwhelmed by the cleanup costs , penalties , damage claims and lawsuits generated by the biggest oil spill in U.S. history . But markets were also beginning to heed warnings from analysts who said Wednesday 's 15.8 percent sell-off of BP shares in New York was an overreaction . BP shares dropped as much as 11 percent to a 13-year low at the open in London on Thursday , then recovered some ground by early afternoon , trading 6.1 percent lower at $ 5.39 . In New York , the stock opened 9.8 percent higher at $ 32.05 . BP has lost around half its market value since the spill began with the April 20 rig explosion that killed 11 workers and set off the spill in the Gulf . In the seven weeks since then , the company has lost half its market value . In a federal filing Thursday , the company said the cost of its response to the oil spill has grown to $ 1.43 billion . The latest slide came after Interior Secretary Ken Salazar promised a Senate energy panel to ask BP to compensate energy companies for losses if they have to lay off workers or suffer economically because of the Obama administration 's six-month moratorium on deep-water drilling . In an interview Thursday on ABC 's '' Good Morning America , '' Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu reiterated her call to end the moratorium , saying it will cause economic hardship in the region . `` Every one of these 33 deep-water wells employs , directly , hundreds of people and indirectly thousands , '' she said . Cleanup continued along the Gulf Coast . In Orange Beach , Ala. , reddish-brown globs of oil the size of credit cards littered the beach at the tide line as a blue farm tractor loaded with shovels and other cleanup equipment chugged down the beach . Dozens of workers in orange vests and blue jeans prepared to start their day combing the beach for oil . Shrimpers , oystermen , seafood businesses , out-of-work drilling crews and the tourism industry who have filed damage claims with BP also are angrily complaining of delays , excessive paperwork and skimpy payments that have put them on the verge of going under as the financial and environmental toll of the seven-week-old disaster grows . `` Every day we call the adjuster eight or 10 times . There 's no answer , no answering machine , '' said Regina Shipp , who has filed $ 33,000 in claims for lost business at her restaurant in Alabama . `` If BP does n't pay us within two months , we 'll be out of business . We 've got two kids . '' BP spokesman Mark Proegler disputed any notion that the claims process is slow or that the company is dragging its feet . Proegler said BP has cut the time to process claims and issue a check from 45 days to as little as 48 hours , if the necessary documentation has been supplied . BP officials acknowledged that while no claims have been denied , thousands and thousands had not been paid by late last week because the company required more documentation . At the bottom of the sea , the containment cap on the ruptured well is capturing 630,000 gallons a day and pumping it to a ship at the surface , and the amount could nearly double by next week to roughly 1.17 million gallons , said Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , who is overseeing the crisis for the government . A second vessel expected to arrive within days should greatly boost capacity . BP also plans to bring in a tanker from the North Sea to help transport oil and an incinerator to burn off some of the crude . The additional system will use equipment previously employed to shoot heavy drilling mud down the well in an attempt to stop the flow , although this time the process will work in reverse . Oil will flow in lines from beneath the blowout preventer , a stack of piping on the sea floor , to a semi-submersible drilling rig called the Q4000 . Oil and gas siphoned from the well will flow up the rig , where it will be sent down a boom , turned into a mist and ignited using a burner designed by Schlumberger Ltd. . BP opted to burn the oil because storing it would require bringing in even more vessels to the already crowded seas above the leaking well . `` It was going to become too congested , it was not the safest way to do it , '' Wells said . Testing on the oil-burning system should begin over the weekend , and full production should start early next week , Wells said . The government has estimated 600,000 to 1.2 million gallons are leaking per day , but a scientist on a task force studying the flow said the actual rate may be between 798,000 gallons and 1.8 million . A task force member said an estimate come Thursday or Friday . Crews working at the site toiled under oppressive conditions as the heat index soared to 110 degrees and toxic vapors emanated from the depths . Fireboats were on hand to pour water on the surface to ease the fumes . Allen also has confronted BP over the complaints about the claims process , warning the company in a letter : `` We need complete , ongoing transparency into BP 's claims process including detailed information on how claims are being evaluated , how payment amounts are being calculated and how quickly claims are being processed .

Residents and businesses can call a telephone line to report losses , file a claim online and seek help at one of 25 claims offices around the Gulf . To jump-start the process , BP was initially offering an immediate $ 2,500 to deckhands and $ 5,000 to fishing boat owners . Workers can receive additional compensation once their paperwork and larger claims are approved . BP said it has paid 18,000 claims so far and has hired 600 adjusters and operators to handle the cases .

But the BP oil spill and the subsequent American outrage against one of Britain 's most prominent industrial giants has turned the match into somewhat of a proxy battle for the finger-pointing over the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history . President Obama plans to speak with British Prime Minister David Cameron on Saturday in what will surely be a diplomatic dance as Cameron faces pressure from his electorate to push back on the BP browbeating . Thousands of miles away , that dance will be a stomp as the U.S. team squares off against England in South Africa . Tensions in both countries have flared over BP , injecting the soccer face-off with an added layer of competition . The opportunity for revenge and shin-kicking has not gone unnoticed . On the U.S. side , director Spike Lee -- who 's been on the vanguard of outrage over the spill -- reportedly told a gathering of New York bloggers the U.S. team should wear shirts that say `` BP Sucks '' on Saturday . A Facebook page calling for BP `` payback '' hopes against hope that `` our boys will get some retribution in South Africa . '' In Britain , newspapers and politicians on Friday slammed the Obama administration 's treatment of the company . The timing of the match fed the fire . The Times of London ran a cartoon that showed soccer player Obama `` booting '' a ball with a BP logo on it . His uniform showed the president was sponsored by `` Mid Term Elections Inc. '' Facing public pressure , Obama has taken a tougher tone toward BP in recent days . He said earlier in the week that he 'd fired BP CEO Tony Hayward and claimed that he was scouting for an `` ass to kick . '' U.S. senators called on BP to stop dividend payments , and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi echoed that call on Friday . Times Editor James Harding told Fox News it sends a troubling signal when the president is in `` ass-kicking mode . '' `` It does n't help anyone when you start getting personal , '' he said . Officials insist things are n't that bad . Martin Longden , a spokesman for the British Embassy in Washington , said there 's a `` huge amount of understanding for where the administration is here '' and that the match is unrelated . `` I do n't think the two do play into each other in any meaningful way , '' he said . Does that mean there 's no sense of rivalry ? The Embassy is opening up its doors to staff members , families and a few `` football aficionados '' to watch the game Saturday -- the American staff members are invited , but only so they can be shamed . `` They want them to be there to witness England 's triumph , '' Longden said . Nile Gardiner , director of The Heritage Foundation 's Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom , said the BP issue has developed into a `` major confrontation '' between London and Washington . But he said the rage is mostly political and that the relationship between the American and British people will remain strong . `` You are going to see that in the aftermath of tomorrow 's World Cup match , no matter what the result , '' he said . Gardiner , who came to the United States from Britain eight years ago , will be rooting for England .

Scientists now say the blown-out well could have been spewing as much as 2 million gallons of crude a day before a cut-and-cap maneuver started capturing some of the flow , meaning more than 100 million gallons may have leaked into the Gulf of Mexico since the start of the disaster in April . That is more than nine times the size of the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster , previously the worst oil spill in U.S. history . The larger estimates , while still preliminary and considered a worst-case scenario , could contribute to breathtaking liabilities against BP . Penalties can be levied against the company under a variety of environmental protection laws , including fines of up to $ 1,100 under the Clean Water Act for each barrel of oil spilled . Based on the maximum amount of oil possibly spilled to date , that would translate to a potential civil fine for simple discharge alone of $ 2.8 billion . If BP were found to have committed gross negligence or willful misconduct , the civil fine could be up to $ 4,300 per barrel , or up to $ 11.1 billion . `` It 's going to blow the record books up , '' said Eric Schaeffer , who led the Environmental Protection Agency 's enforcement office from 1997 to 2002 . A larger spill also could lead to increased environmental hazards , with shrimp , crabs and fish such as marlin and swordfish especially hard hit . `` Certainly if there are greater volumes of oil than were originally estimated , that does n't bode well , '' said Jim Franks , a fisheries biologist at the University of Southern Mississippi Gulf Coast Research Laboratory . `` Do we expect twice the impact ? I do n't know how to judge that , but that much more oil could not be good at all for fish and wildlife resources . I would anticipate far-reaching impacts . '' Days after the spill began , government officials told the public that the ruptured well a mile below the Gulf was leaking 42,000 gallons a day . Then , officials said it was actually five times bigger . That estimate did n't last long either . The new estimates are based on spillcam video as well as such things as satellite , sonar and pressure readings . The lead scientist in the effort said the most credible range at the moment is between 840,000 gallons and 1.68 million gallons a day . Another part of the equation is how much more oil started to leak last week after the riser pipe was cut , a step that BP and government officials said could increase the flow by 20 percent . The pipe cut was necessary to install a cap over the well ; the cap has captured an estimated 4 million gallons so far . If the higher-end estimates prove accurate , the leak amounts to an Exxon Valdez every five days or so . At that rate , in just over three weeks from now it will eclipse the worst oil spill in peacetime history , the 1979 Ixtoc disaster in Mexico , which took 10 months to belch out 140 million gallons of oil into the Gulf . And there 's more bad news . The oil gushing from the Gulf contains large amounts of natural gas . Samantha Joye , a professor of marine sciences at the University of Georgia , said that can contribute significantly to oxygen levels plummeting in the water as microbes eat the methane clouds . In addition to the potential for billions in fines , BP is responsible for paying all cleanup costs and up to $ 75 million for economic damages . But it could face far heavier expenses if gross negligence is found or if it is determined that there was a violation of a federal safety , construction or operating regulation , Schaeffer said . `` You bet the trial lawyers are sharpening their swords around that language , '' he said . And that 's not including the tens of billions of dollars in shareholder wealth that has already evaporated with the plunge of BP 's stock since the disaster . New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg became a lonely defender of BP , declaring the world should not rush to point fingers at the British oil giant . The billionaire tycoon often sides with CEOs and businesses entangled in public relations disasters . `` The guy that runs BP did n't exactly go down there and blow up the well , '' Bloomberg said on his weekly radio show . `` And what 's more , if we want them to fix it and they 're the only ones with the expertise , I think I might wait to assign blame . '' That the BP oil spill may be twice as bad as earlier estimates was hard news to hear but no surprise to Christian Delos Reyes , a 39-year-old oyster dredger . `` Crabs start real small . You know they 're all going to die . It 'll kill all the oysters . In my opinion , I do n't think it 'll ever be all right , '' Reyes said . `` I think it 's destroyed .

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated . GRETA VAN SUSTEREN , FOX NEWS HOST : Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin goes `` On the Record . '' She 's been clobbering President Obama for his handling of the oil spill , especially for not meeting with BP 's CEO , Tony Hayward . Well , the big meeting between President Obama and Hayward is happening next week . Maybe President Obama reads Governor Palin 's Facebook page ? Governor Palin joins us . Good evening , Governor . Nice to see you . SARAH PALIN , FORMER GOVERNOR\\/FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR : Hey , thanks so much , Greta . Thanks for having me . VAN SUSTEREN : All right , Governor , you have said about the spill , this 53-day-old spill in Gulf of Mexico , that the president should call you . Were you being flip and coy and having some fun with him , or do you have some ideas that you could give him to help him handle this spill ? PALIN : No , I have some ideas , and I think a lot of other Americans have some ideas , especially those who have some experience working with these oil companies and knowing that there is such a need to verify the information that oil execs would be giving a public official because the oil executive 's perception of reality , really , is different than a public official 's would be . In the case of this spill , to see now that we 're on day 54 and the Obama administration is just now deciding that they will meet with BP is a pretty atrocious thing to have to realize because , Greta , what this has resulted in is an industry player like BP has been put in the position , this player with astronomical liability exposure , gets to define the facts of the spill , instead of from day one , working together , CEO to CEO level , the president and Hayward and board members of BP working together to define what the facts are in this situation . VAN SUSTEREN : OK , walk me through this . Suppose that you were in the position as President Obama is , and you 've invited the CEO and other executives of BP . They walk into the room . Do you ask the questions ? Do you issue the orders ? Do they ask the questions ? What are you going to do ? PALIN : Well , you know , even before walking in the room with BP , some orders need to be issued . For one , there needs to be a waving of the Jones Act so that we could have had many , many days ago , weeks ago , some help with skimmers from elsewhere , besides just U.S. flagships , come over and help in this tragedy . And that order needs to be given to Admiral Allen right now . It 's amazing to me and to so many others that though President Bush had been able to waive Jones Act provisions for Katrina , President Obama has n't thought to do that yet ? And yet surely , that has been suggested by those experts around him . But to know , too , that it took nine days before anybody in the administration -- finally , it was Napolitano who decided that this was going to be of national significance and a disaster would need to be declared . It took nine days , instead of just from day one or day two realizing that this was going to be a disaster for gulf residents and for the livelihoods affecting so many people -- nine days , and that was a setback for DOD assistance that could have been provided . VAN SUSTEREN : All right , as governor of the state that 's so known for on-shore drilling , tell me , educate me . I know what happens when you have huge leaks under water at these enormous depths . What 's the worst-case scenario for a leak or spill on shore ? Because I 'm trying to decide , you know -- you know , which is -- which is worse , not that you want to pick between the , you know , hanging or the electric chair , but which -- can you contain a leak on shore ? PALIN : Absolutely , you can . And that 's why it 's frustrating to know that the extreme environmentalists have won out , if you will , on disallowing so much of the safe on-shore drilling that is time-tested , the technology that would allow safer drilling there . They 've kind of shooed away the opportunity into deep , deep water out in the ocean , where it 's been unprecedented , the technology that 's been needed in order to remedy a tragedy , a spill like we 're seeing today . Alaska has spill contingency plans that make a lot of sense . And we found out now in this case of the gulf spill that the contingency plan that BP had been able to get approved by MMS and by the feds was boilerplate language taken out of the Alaska contingency plan , and that 's baffling to most of us who realize how different the gulf deep water conditions are from the on-shore and shallow water drilling up there in Alaska . And this is evidenced by , Greta , when you read that -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- contingency plan that was approved that , obviously , nobody really had read . They 're talking about marine mammals that are not indigenous to the gulf , but walruses and sea otters , other things that -- again , it 's evidence that language was taken from an Alaskan plan and applied to something that , at the end of the day , we realize is really irrelevant to the gulf conditions , the deep water conditions in the gulf . VAN SUSTEREN : Governor , I 'm one of those animal extremists , as you saw . I mean , it 's , like , you know , that 's the first thing I think of . And of course , now we see what 's happened to the bird life and other marine life in the Gulf of Mexico . But tell me , what has been the animal response to the pipeline there ? Because you know , that 's where -- that 's always going to be a hard sell with me unless you convince me that the animals are fine . I know we need energy , but I 'm a bleeding heart for the animals . PALIN : Yes , and that 's why when you travel up to Prudhoe Bay , you 're going to see a thriving caribou herd and other wildlife that has a thriving population because , for instance , the pipeline -- the trans-Alaska oil pipeline that has been built safely and above ground , so that there are walkways for the animals to crawl under . You 're going to see no adverse impact on wildlife population . In fact , a lot of the caribou herd has been able to increase dramatically since these 30 years have gone by with pipeline construction . Alaska is very , very cognizant of the fact that the wildlife needs to be protected . So all that we do with on-shore drilling is to make sure that wildlife and the safety of our workers is so incorporated into the plan for development . This is a tragedy , again , as we 're seeing in the gulf , where they did not have the plans to deal with a blow-out under water in such deep depths that now one of the ramifications so negative is the wildlife that will be killed . VAN SUSTEREN : All right , switch topics to South Carolina . You endorsed Nikki Haley for governor . She almost squeaked by . She 's got a runoff on June 22nd . Should her opponent withdraw now so there wo n't be the runoff , or not ? I know you endorse her , but what do you think ? Should he have his fair shot at this runoff ? PALIN : Well , he should have a fair shot . You know , I 'm such a proponent of competition , even into a runoff after a primary where Nikki did win handily , and she 's going to win again . And a lot of people are going to look at this as wasting public resources paying for a runoff vote when Nikki 's going to thump him again . So kind of a waste of resources , but I 'm not going to be one to discourage that continued competition , giving him a fair shot . Fine with me if he decides to stay in it , even though , you know , it 's probably going to be a futile effort . VAN SUSTEREN : How about Mr. Greene , the opponent of Senator Jim DeMint ? What do you think about him ? He 's got some problems , apparently . He 's got some problems ! He 's got some answers to give , does n't he . But that 's the Democrat ticket 's problem . And you know , I think it 's kind of a shame , though , that the Democrats , so heavy-handed wanting to shoo somebody off their ticket when the guy won . He won fair and square , and he 's the name on the ticket and they 're going to have to live with it . VAN SUSTEREN : Carly Fiorina , state of California , another one of your picks . And I should add that you did n't have 100 percent . Not all your picks necessarily won . But certainly , Carly Fiorina 's numbers seemed to jump date coincident with your endorsement . You took heat for that endorsement . And is there anything you do n't agree with Carly Fiorina on ? PALIN : I do n't have regrets at all about endorsing Carly , and I sure do n't and do n't think anybody should give me credit for shifting momentum her way . She was on a roll anyway , and my name added to her ticket really is just a two-edged sword that she has to live with because she gets -- anybody is going to get attacked a little bit more , I believe , if my name is attached to their candidacy . So bless her heart , she 's got that challenge that she has to overcome because I endorsed her . But no , she 's great and she is what California needs . She is what this nation needs , somebody who understands how to live within their means , somebody who 's run a business and understands what it means to make payroll and live within a budget and have to produce in order to be rewarded monetarily . That 's something that 's so lacking in so many of our government officials ! We need Carly in there . VAN SUSTEREN : You know , as we look forward to 2012 -- I know people always say , Are you going to run or you 're not going to run ? Let me ask you , before I move on to the possibilities , have you made a decision not to run ? PALIN : I have not made that decision , no. . VAN SUSTEREN : OK . Now , Governor Pawlenty -- he has not said he 's made a decision to run or not , but when do you think that we should start hearing from the people at least on the Republican side ? We know who the nominee , at least I expect the nominee 's going to be President Obama . But when should we expect to hear from Republicans , you know , either in or out in the race ? PALIN : You know , ideally , Greta , I think it should n't be for about another year because there is so much to take care of in terms of in our own communities , in our own states , in helping the individual parties to elect people to make the right decisions to get our country back on the right track that for individuals to start pimping their own campaign so early , I think it 's futile . I think it wastes a lot of time . So much can happen in a day , a week , a month of politics in the American system that I think it 's kind of ridiculous to start talking about it this early . VAN SUSTEREN : And of course , we do the unthinkable in the media . We keep trying to ask everybody , so I think we 're sort of partially responsible for doing that to the candidates . Governor , stand by because we have more with you . PALIN : Well , yes . And you keep getting the same answers , too , from all of us , do n't you ! VAN SUSTEREN : I know . All right , Governor . Who could forget that infamous Newsweek cover of Governor Palin in running shorts ? Well , Newsweek is at it again . We 're going to show you the new cover of Newsweek , and Governor Palin will tell you what she thinks . VAN SUSTEREN : Well , who could forget that infamous Newsweek cover ? It shows Governor Sarah Palin in short shorts , running shorts . Well , check out Newsweek 's latest Palin cover . Things are a little different this time . It shows Governor Palin with a halo over her head . The headline , `` Saint Sarah . '' Now , the article 's about Governor Palin 's appeal to conservative Christian women . Governor Palin is back with us . Governor , what do you make of the new cover ? Now it 's Saint Sarah ? PALIN : Have n't seen it , but if the title and what I hear about the content is any indication of where Newsweek is going , it 's no wonder that Newsweek is doing so poorly . People are not reading that stuff . It 's not relevant . It 's not interesting stuff that they 're making up and writing . And that 's why they 're going down . VAN SUSTEREN : You know , it 's sort of interesting , Governor . I 'll take a bet with you . Maybe you wo n't take this bet with me . But the last segment , we discussed policy . I asked about energy policy since energy is so important to your home state of Alaska . My guess is this next question I 'm going to ask you , which is the buzz of the Internet , it 's in mainstream media -- I bet it gets more attention than our discussion about energy . So here it is . Did you have them or not ? Because that 's all over the Internet about you , and mainstream media . PALIN : Well , first , Greta , you know why we love you ? Because you 're not afraid to ask the questions . And I got to respect you for asking that question because I know that `` boobgate '' is all over the Internet right now because there are a lot of , I guess , bored , idle bloggers and reporters with nothing else to talk about . And I think some of those folks , too , they need to grab a shovel , go down to the gulf , volunteer to help , clean up and save a whale or something instead of reporting on such stupid things like that . No , I have not had implants . I ca n't believe , yes , that we 're even talking about this . I think a report like that is about as real and truthful as those reports that Todd and I are divorcing or that I bought a place in the Hamptons or that Trigg is not my own child . And we still put up with that kind of garbage , too , in even the mainstream media , Greta . VAN SUSTEREN : Well , the reason I -- I mean , I hope that puts an end to it and I hope we do n't , you know , be obsessed at it . But it is extraordinary how -- you know , the fact -- the truth is , is that -- you know , is that you show up on -- on -- with the short shorts on the Newsweek cover . That was not a picture you gave Newsweek . Newsweek actually went out and looked for that one . You 've got situations where Secretary of State Clinton gets clobbered . And the thing that -- besides the fact of what happens to you and to Secretary of State Clinton and other women who are successful in politics is that -- where are the feminists who are so appalled at -- when things are supposedly -- have you -- have you heard from them ? PALIN : No , Greta . And that is what 's fascinating to me about all of this , too , about this -- this kind of platform that I 've been blessed to be able to stand on and get a message out there to other Americans , and so much of the ignoring of that message and focus on superficial , really ridiculous aspects of who I am or maybe other women are . For other women who are in positions of some authority and some influence , for them to participate in what it is that , for instance , Newsweek does and some of these reporters talking about breast implants -- to see other women participate in this I think really certainly diminishes their cause for women 's rights and for equal treatment of women . It baffles me that they would want to participate in this . VAN SUSTEREN : Well , it 's a bit disappointing , since the whole idea of the women 's movement on both sides of the aisle was to make sure women had a level playing field , that they had the same opportunity as men . And if the women are part of the gossip and are promoting it -- and the buzz on this last round with you is enormous . I mean , if you Google your name , I mean , there are -- there are , you know , lots of , lots of articles about this . I mean , it really is distressing that the women are n't stepping up and saying , Look , you know , I agree with Governor Palin or I do n't agree with Governor Palin , but this is n't right , you know , that we 're -- that we do this to her or to any other women , to -- I used Secretary of State Clinton as another example . PALIN : Yes , I think it 's pretty ridiculous . And what it does , it ends up ultimately wasting time and wasting people 's energies . Here 's an example of how it kind of wastes some time . To be judged on or to be talked about on appearance , say chest size -- it makes me wear layers . It makes me have to waste time figuring out , What am I going to wear so that nobody will look in a area that I do n't need them to look at ? I want them to hear what it is that I 'm saying . It ends up wasting time and that 's just very , very unfortunate . VAN SUSTEREN : All right , let 's move on to Facebook . Did you know that president -- former President Bush is now on Facebook ? PALIN : I saw that and I heard that he did his inaugural address . VAN SUSTEREN : What -- I mean , it 's extraordinary when you think of where politics -- I mean , 10 years ago , even the concept of FaceBook -- I mean , it did n't even exist . I mean , it 's bizarre . Now -- now we -- now we , you know , have FaceBook from our politicians . PALIN : You know why it is ? We have got to -- those of us who are just common sense conservative , we have got to have that ability to speak with the American voter , with the public , minus the filter of the `` lamestream media '' that does not like our message . And in the case where we are presently , they want to protect President Obama 's big government agenda . So whatever it is that we say or do or want to translate via print or television , they filter it and they misconstrue things and they misreport . So hey , we 're going right to the people via Twitter , via Facebook , whatever we can to get the truth out there to the American public about what 's going on in this country . VAN SUSTEREN : There goes employment in the news business ! We 're going to lose our jobs if you guys keep doing that , going straight to the people . Governor , thank you .

Energy giant BP PLC announced this week it will donate its share of the proceeds generated by selling the oil captured from the well to fund efforts to protect and restore wildlife habitat along the Gulf Coast . The company has not released specifics on how the fund will work and said it does n't know how much money might be raised . But once the oil is brought to shore , it will creep into the world 's economic supply chain unnoticed by consumers . `` Oil is oil , '' said Julius Langlinais , professor emeritus of petroleum engineering at Louisiana State University . `` There 's no stamp or anything on it . It 's all the same molecules . '' Scientists have estimated that anywhere between about 40 million gallons -LRB- 151 million liters -RRB- to 109 million gallons -LRB- 413 million liters -RRB- of oil have gushed into the Gulf since a drilling rig exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers . Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the Obama administration 's point man for the oil spill , said that since the leak began , 4 million gallons -LRB- 15 million liters -RRB- of crude have been siphoned off the leaking well using tubes and caps . An additional 18 million gallons -LRB- 68 million liters -RRB- have been skimmed from the ocean surface , he said . The skimmed liquid is generally only 10 to 15 percent oil . Negotiations were still ongoing Friday to find a buyer for all that captured oil , BP spokesman Mark Proegler said . `` There 's nothing special about it , other than everyone 's looking at it , '' he said . It 's possible the oil wo n't even be sold to a refinery directly by BP or processed in the Gulf . Big oil companies have trading departments that commonly swap barrels of crude with other firms or sell them to traders who could route the oil across the globe , Langlinais said . Once that crude hits a refinery , the oil could end up in a wide array of fuels and products including gasoline , diesel , heating oil , asphalt and plastic -- including the bags used at grocery stores , the cases for cell phones and microwaves . It also can be used as raw feed for chemical companies . `` I think it 's an eye-opening experience for people who do n't give it much thought when they finally realize how much their lives depend on oil , '' Langlinais said . BP has said it plans to boost its ability to directly capture oil gushing from the well by early next week . A semi-submersible drilling rig would capture and burn up to 420,000 gallons -LRB- 1.59 million liters -RRB- of oil daily . Once on board , the oil and gas collected from the well will be sent down a boom and burned at sea . A drill ship already at the scene can process a maximum of 756,000 gallons -LRB- 2.86 million liters -RRB- of oil daily that 's sucked up through a containment cap sitting on the well head . Federal officials are still reviewing BP 's plan to build a new containment system designed to capture more oil and be more durable during hurricane season . Allen said the plan could be revised based on calculations of how much oil is spilling from the well . It 's unclear how much the captured oil will be worth once it 's sold . Oil was trading around $ 74 a barrel Friday , but BP officials said they expect to get a lower price than normal because the oil captured from the leak is laced with methanol . BP is injecting methanol as an antifreeze into the inside of the containment cap sitting over the gushing well to prevent the buildup of an ice-like slush that can clog the pipes . Under its operating agreement , BP gets 65 percent of the net revenue made by selling oil from the leak site . After deducting for royalty payments owed to the government , it will donate its share of the proceeds to the wildlife fund . Anadarko Petroleum Corp. , which is entitled to 25 percent of the oil revenue , is still discussing what to do with its share of the money when the oil is sold , Anadarko spokesman Matt Carmichael said . `` We 're committed to doing the right thing , '' he said . A subsidiary of Mitsui & Co. . Ltd. , which has a 10 percent stake , declined to comment . Meanwhile , the oil seemed to keep coming ashore unabated Saturday morning . Globs of tar lined the white sands of Orange Beach , Alabama -- some the size of small pancakes . Tony Tingle of Trussville , Alabama , said it was even worse the evening before . `` It was actually crude oil , not tar balls . All the cleaning crews flooded in . The skimming boats came in pretty quickly , helicopters were circling , and a bunch of boats came in . It smelled like a machine shop , '' Tingle said . During a flight over the Gulf of Mexico , aerial spotter Sean Brumley said he saw an oily sheen and brown patches of oil floating for miles -LRB- kilometers -RRB- off the coast . `` The Gulf looks like it has chicken pox , '' Brumley said .

But a day earlier , Obama blasted U.S. lawmakers and Tea Party activists for criticizing his response to the nation 's worst environmental disaster , suggesting they are being hypocrites . `` I think it 's fair to say , if six months ago , before this spill had happened , I had gone up to Congress and I had said we need to crack down a lot harder on oil companies and we need to spend more money on technology to respond in case of a catastrophic spill , there are folks up there , who will not be named , who would have said this is classic , big-government overregulation and wasteful spending , '' he told Politico in an interview . Obama also suggested the criticism coming from anti-big government protesters , such as Tea Party activists , was hypocritical . `` Some of the same folks who have been hollering and saying ` do something ' are the same folks who , just two or three months ago , were suggesting that government needs to stop doing so much , '' Obama said . `` Some of the same people who are saying the president needs to show leadership and solve this problem are some of the same folks , who just a few months ago , were saying this guy is trying to engineer a takeover of our society through the federal government that is going to restrict our freedoms . '' But Obama sang a much different tune to Cameron on Saturday when the two leaders held a `` warm and constructive '' telephone conversation for more than 30 minutes , Cameron 's Downing St. office said . Cameron 's office said the prime minister `` expressed his sadness at the ongoing human and environmental catastrophe , '' but stressed BP 's economic important to Britain , the U.S. and other countries . Then Obama told the prime minister `` that his unequivocal view was that BP was a multinational global company and that frustrations about the oil spill had nothing to do with national identity . The prime minister stressed the economic importance of BP to the U.K. , U.S. and other countries . The president made clear that he had no interest in undermining BP 's value . '' Cameron is under pressure to get Obama to tone down the criticism fearing it will hurt the millions of British retirees that hold BP stock . The company 's stock has lost 40 percent of its value since the April 20 oil rig fire . Rep. Darrell Issa , R-Calif . , fired back at Obama over his criticism of Congress , saying hypocrisy is no excuse for inaction `` in addressing the dysfunctional and corrupt nature of the Minerals and Management Service '' -- the agency that oversees offshore drilling . `` If President Obama had exercised some long overdue leadership and called on Congress to address the cozy relationship between MMS and the industry they regulate , I would have been the very first person to partner with him and give MMS the overhaul it desperately needs , '' Issa said in a written statement . `` After 10 inspector general reports , 10 GAO reports , a congressional investigation , the real question is , why did it take such a catastrophe for the president to call for action , '' he said . Obama has sharpened his attacks on BP in recent days as the company struggles to stop oil gushing from its ruptured deepsea well . Obama has said he would have fired BP 's top executive , if he were in charge , and has supported the idea that the oil company suspend its quarterly dividend . In a sign the company feels the pressure , BP said Saturday that its board would meet Monday to discuss deferring its second-quarter dividend and putting the money into escrow until the company 's liabilities from the spill are known . BP said no decision had yet been made . Obama also has reproached BP for spending money on a public relations campaign and occasionally refers to `` British Petroleum , '' although the company years ago began using only its initials and is a far-reaching international corporation with extensive holdings in the United States , including a Texas refinery and a share of the Alaska oil pipeline . This past week , the usually measured Obama said in a television interview , `` I do n't sit around just talking to experts because this is a college seminar ; we talk to these folks because they potentially have the best answers -- so I know whose ass to kick .

He returns to the region on Monday . AP2010 President Obama will address the nation Tuesday night to talk about the Gulf of Mexico oil spill as the White House prepares a plan to require oil giant BP to set up an escrow account to pay for lost income to local businesses as a result of the April 20 explosion . The 8 p.m. ET speech will take place from the White House shortly after the president returns from a two-day trip to the Gulf . The president is expected to address efforts to contain the spill , the timeline for capturing the oil , the long-term recovery and restoration of the Gulf region and regulatory reform efforts at the Mineral Management Service . `` This is an ongoing crisis , much like an epidemic , '' David Axelrod told NBC television 's '' Meet the Press . '' The 10-15 minute speech will provide more details about a BP escrow fund the president wants established for fishers and trawlers whose livelihoods have been shot as a result of the spill . The administration wants a third-party reclamation process rather than BP managing distribution of funds . The next day , the president will make clear in his meeting with BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg and others about his expectation of BP 's responsibility for caring for people affected by the spill . `` Our mission is to hold them accountable in every appropriate way , '' Axelrod said . The speech comes as the Obama administration faces criticism for a slow reaction time to the Gulf spill , including the approval for the construction of barriers and assistance to the states . At the same time , frustration is growing about the slow pace of the cleanup and BP 's inability to stop the flow while the estimates on the leak have grown exponentially . On Sunday , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid sent a letter signed by 54 Democratic senators to BP CEO Tony Hayward demanding his company create a $ 20 billion account to pay for economic damages and cleanup costs . Currently , lawmakers are debating how much to change the law that limits a company 's liability to $ 75 million . `` Establishment of this account would serve as an act of good faith and as a first step towards ensuring that there will be no delay in payments or attempt to evade responsibility for damages , '' the 54 senators wrote . `` Although creating this account at this level in no way limits BP 's liability , we believe it will do more to improve BP 's public image than the costly public relations campaign your company has launched , '' the senators wrote . BP 's board is to meet on Monday to discuss deferring its second-quarter dividend and putting the money into escrow until the company 's liabilities from the spill are known . The amount of money set aside will be part of White House discussions with BP executives on Wednesday , but Axelrod said it should be `` substantial .

The blast killed 11 workers . Since then , oil has been pouring into the Gulf from a blown-out undersea well . President Barack Obama will demand that BP create a special account with `` substantial '' reserves to pay oil claims and will take other steps aimed at aiding the region , his top political adviser said . Obama , set to visit the Gulf Coast on Monday and Tuesday , also plans an Oval Office address Tuesday night after his return to Washington . He meets at the White House with BP executives , including the oil company 's chairman , on Wednesday . BP 's board was to meet on Monday to discuss deferring its second-quarter dividend and putting the money into escrow until the company 's liabilities from the spill are known . `` We 're aware of the request , '' BP spokeswoman Sheila Williams said in London . Undersea sensors were deployed the ruptured well in an effort to better track the amount of oil gushing into the sea . New estimates say the blown-out well could have been spewing as much as 2 million gallons of crude a day before a cut-and-cap maneuver earlier this month started capturing some of the flow . BP spokesman Jon Pack said undersea robots were attempting to install the sensors within the containment cap that sits over the well . Once the sensors are in place , Adm. Thad Allen , the Obama administration 's point man on the oil spill , said they will start taking pressure readings to validate the flow rate estimates . The effort to drill two relief wells more than 3 miles below the surface to end the oil spill has exposed problems and questions the regulation and safety of the process . That includes the fact that BP took more than 12 days to begin the well because the government did not require the company to have a relief well plan in place ahead of time . BP says the relief well has been a success and ahead of schedule , though the gaps in the relief well process mirror other regulatory issues and oversights that have been exposed since the rig exploded . Beaches in Orange Beach , Ala. , where large amounts of crude and tar balls washed ashore on Saturday , were mostly clean after crews worked through the night and in the early morning clearing the oil . Clear plastic bags sat in piles , full of sand and tar balls , and some empty stretches of beach were still littered with grapefruit sized tar patties . Winds continued to blow two patchy , orange oil plumes from the spill toward the white sands of the western Florida Panhandle as skimmers worked to collect the crude before it came ashore . The Florida Department of Environmental Protection said one of the slicks is as close as 3 miles south of Pensacola Pass , an inlet next to a stretch of the Gulf Islands National Seashore and the tourist hotels of Pensacola Beach .

Subject : the BP oil spill . The problem is the president is a few weeks late and millions of gallons short . The president revealed his impotence and just how out of touch he is with this and another issue of profound importance to the public in an interview with Politico . In that interview , the president compared the BP oil spill to 9\\/11 . September 11 was about the murder of 3,000 Americans in a deliberate act by a group of Islamic fanatics . The BP affair was an accident which killed 11 and injured 17 others . One could argue that both 9\\/11 and the BP platform explosion and subsequent leak were preventable , but to compare a murderous act with an accident is absurd . The president hopes to make it appear he is doing something when all he is doing is talking , or talking about doing something , or doing something that wo n't stop the leak and repair the Gulf waters . He has threatened BP , as if the company wants to continue damaging its already soiled reputation . He wants the company to set aside a fund , to be administered by a third party , to guarantee payments to those with legitimate damage claims . That might be a good idea , but as long as he is wanting others to pay for damages , how about sending a bill to Iraq and Afghanistan for the damages those wars have caused to American lives and our treasury ? Just how political the BP issue has become is evident in a comment made by Rep. Jesse Jackson -LRB- D-Ill -RRB- . Jackson called on the president to `` level with the American people , '' turn the oil spill into a job-creation tool and `` stop the blame game . '' I agree on stopping the blame game , but the president seems incapable of doing that . At least he ca n't blame this one on the Bush administration , or might he ? The president has relied on his speaking ability to get him this far . On Tuesday night , he 'll need more than rhetoric and his TelePrompter .

The outline came after the Coast Guard on Friday demanded the company figure out ways to accelerate the process . The cap on the blown-out well is said to be capturing about 15,000 barrels a day -- but plenty more is still leaking into the Gulf of Mexico . Under the revised schedule , BP claims it can capture between 40,000 and 53,000 barrels a day by the end of this month . BP was n't expected to reach that capacity until mid-July under the earlier plan . The new estimate , detailed in a letter to the Coast Guard dated Sunday , also claims the energy giant will be able to capture as much as 80,000 barrels a day by mid-July . The Obama administration said BP was responding to its order from Friday , in which Coast Guard Rear Adm. James Watson told the company that `` every effort must be expended to speed up '' the rate of containment . `` After being directed by the administration to move more quickly , BP is now stepping up its efforts to contain the leaking oil , '' an administration official said Monday , adding that the new plan has enough backup in place to account for bad weather and `` unforeseen circumstances . '' `` This administration has continuously demanded strategies and responses from BP that fit the realities of this catastrophic event , for which BP is responsible . We will continue to hold BP accountable and bring every possible resource and innovation to bear , '' the official said . BP , in its letter , said it would mobilize a vessel from South America to store oil , in addition to two more lightering tankers -- used to transfer cargo between ships -- from Europe and other equipment . BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said in the letter that the company believes `` this plan is responsive to your order , '' but cautioned that the firm was outside its comfort zone . `` The risks of operating multiple facilities in close proximity must be carefully managed , '' he wrote . `` Several hundred people are working in a confined space with live hydrocarbons on up to 4 vessels . This is significantly beyond both BP and industry practice . `` We will continue to aggressively drive schedule to minimize pollution , but we must not allow this drive to compromise our number one priority , that being the health and safety of our people , '' he wrote . BP is facing increasing political and public pressure not only to speed up the rate of containment but to pledge more money to help those suffering economic losses from the spill . Obama is pressing the company to set up an escrow account to pay for lost income to local businesses , a plan he will describe during an address to the nation from the Oval Office on Tuesday . Leading up to his address , the president will tour Mississippi , Alabama and Florida to survey the damage . He is set to arrive in Biloxi , Miss. , shortly before noon on Monday . To this point , the president had only visited the Louisiana coast . Florida Republican Sen. George LeMieux said that when the president visits his state on Tuesday , he plans to press him on why the administration is not allowing in more oil skimmers to clean up the damage . Four hundred skimming boats are at work in the Gulf cleaning up the oil , but local officials have been pleading with the federal government to bring in more -- one problem may be that foreign ships are barred from working in U.S. coastal waters by a 1920s law known as the Jones Act . Officials say they are prepared to waive the act if necessary , but White House energy adviser Carol Browner told Fox News on Friday that so far no request from the Coast Guard has been made to do so . LeMieux told Fox News on Monday that U.S. skimmers are available as well and questioned why more boats are not being deployed . `` There 's thousands of skimmers in the United States and thousands of skimmers around the world , '' he said . `` Why are n't they headed to the Gulf of Mexico ?

Oil company executives , in an attempt to distance themselves from the crisis in the Gulf , put the blame on BP for the worst oil spill in U.S. history during a key congressional hearing Tuesday . House members used Tuesday 's hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee to chastise oil companies , accusing them of being no better prepared than BP to avert an environmental catastrophe . With top oil company executives waiting to testify , Rep. Henry Waxman , D-Calif . , asserted that their companies ' spill response plans amounted to `` paper exercises '' that mirrored BP 's failed plan . Their strategies to plug a spill deep beneath the sea are the same failed strategies that have stymied BP , Waxman said . The other companies `` are no better prepared to deal with a major oil spill than was BP , '' said Waxman , setting the tone for a tense hearing . But oil company executives were quick to distance themselves from BP . Chevron chief executive John Watson said Chevron 's deep-water drilling activities `` are safe and environmentally sound , '' but he said the company welcomes any new standards and `` we must learn from this accident . '' ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson told the committee that the Gulf spill would not have occurred if BP had properly designed its deep-water well . `` We do not proceed with operations if we can not do so safely , '' said Tillerson . Shell president Marvin Odum insisted , `` Safety and environmental protection shall and will be Shell 's top priorities . '' On Monday , Waxman 's committee released documents that showed BP made a series of money-saving shortcuts and blunders that dramatically increased the danger of a destructive spill from a well that an engineer ominously described as a `` nightmare '' just six days before the April blowout . Investigators found that BP was badly behind schedule on the project and losing hundreds of thousands of dollars with each passing day , and responded by cutting corners in the well design , cementing and drilling efforts and the installation of key safety devices . `` Time after time , it appears that BP made decisions that increased the risk of a blowout to save the company time or expense . If this is what happened , BP 's carelessness and complacency have inflicted a heavy toll on the Gulf , its inhabitants , and the workers on the rig , '' Waxman and Rep. Bart Stupak , a Democrat and chairman of the committee 's investigations panel , wrote in a letter . One lawmaker after another expressed frustration at BP 's inability to stop oil gushing from its stricken well as the chief executives representing ExxonMobil , Chevron , ConocoPhillips and Shell -- as well as BPAmerica -- sat shoulder to shoulder at the witness table . BP said Tuesday it was speeding up payments for large commercial claims . The company said in a statement that it has approved initial payments toward 90 percent of large commercial claims filed as a result of financial losses in the Deepwater Horizon explosion and spill . BP said it approved 337 payments totaling $ 16 million to businesses that have filed claims larger than $ 5,000 apiece . Initial payments began over the weekend and will be completed this week , the company said . The Obama administration has pressured BP to speed up payments of claims in the wake of the Gulf oil spill . Meanwhile , Republicans used the hearing to accuse the White House of `` exploiting '' the Gulf oil spill crisis in order to pass a Democratic-backed energy and climate bill that 's stalled in the Senate . `` The president is trying to exploit this disaster to pass his national energy tax , '' Rep. Steve Scalise , R-La . , told members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , as well as the nation 's top oil executives , who gathered Tuesday on Capitol Hill . `` Stop exploiting this disaster to pass this cap and trade tax , '' Scalise said . `` Cap and trade '' is a phrase used mostly by Republicans to refer to a climate measure the House approved last year . The legislation would `` cap '' the amount of pollutants firms could emit . But firms could pollute more by trading for `` credits '' with other polluters , and many Republicans have decried the policy as a `` national energy tax . '' President Obama is expected to ask Congress to approve climate legislation when he speaks to the nation in his first Oval Office address Tuesday night following a two-day trip to the Gulf of Mexico . `` To exploit this crisis to resurrect his climate change legislation is just wrong , '' added House Republican Conference Chairman Mike Pence , R-Ind . `` People expect the administration not to use this incident to advance their liberal agenda . '' A few Republicans joined Democrats to pass the climate bill in the House a year ago . But the legislation is stymied in the Senate . Many moderate Democrats fear the bill could hurt jobs in the energy sector and along in the Gulf Coast . The House hearing marked the first time that the chief executives of the major oil companies -- all leaders in deep-water drilling in the Gulf -- were called before Congress since the April 20 BP explosion on the Deepwater Horizon . The accident killed 11 workers and unleashed the nation 's worst oil spill . The government has estimated that as much as 2 million gallons -LRB- liters -RRB- of oil a day may be flowing into the Gulf . Waxman 's committee is expected to question BPAmerica chairman Lamar McKay on internal company e-mails and documents that the lawmaker said showed that BP made repeated decisions in the days and hours before the explosion that increased the risk of a major well blowout .

Stop exploiting this disaster to pass this cap-and-trade tax , '' Rep. Steve Scalise , R-La . The congressman was referring to the `` cap-and-trade '' legislation that Democrats have been trying to push through Congress since last year . After the House approved a version of the bill last June , the Senate has been sitting on the proposal while other issues like health care and financial regulation moved to the front of the legislative line . Now that the BP oil spill has focused national attention on the potential negative effects of offshore drilling , Republicans say Obama will use it to his political advantage . `` Never has a mission statement fit an administration as perfectly as Rahm Emanuel 's ` never allow a crisis to go to waste . ' Climate change policy is important , but first things first , '' said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , describing the energy bill as a tax on everyone that would `` do nothing '' to stop the leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico . `` Somehow he thinks he can use the tragedy in the Gulf as a reason to pass cap-and-trade , '' said Sen. James Inhofe , R-Okla . `` There is no relationship between the oil spill and cap-and-trade . '' The climate bill most likely to pass the Senate is one sponsored by Sens. Joe Lieberman , I-Conn . , and John Kerry , D-Mass . They said on Tuesday that their bill will save energy and create jobs . `` It will create 440,000 additional jobs annually through 2020 and 540,000 additional jobs through 2030 , '' Kerry said . Lieberman said one analysis shows the plan would save 2 million barrels of oil a day by 2030 -- in part by getting heavy trucks to run on natural gas . He said that inaction at this point would lead to sustained dependence on oil and `` risk repetition of what 's happening in the Gulf today . '' But critics are extremely skeptical about both claims . Previous assessments of cap-and-trade bills warned of job losses , and analysts say savings in oil are hard to come by : `` In automobiles , at least in the short run , next 10 years or so , it 's very difficult to switch from one energy source to another , '' said David Kreutzer , research fellow for energy economics and climate change with the Heritage Foundation . He said the climate legislation and its mandate to cut emissions would end up hurting the country 's coal industry `` dramatically . '' Fox News ' Jim Angle contributed to this report .

President Obama , in the first televised Oval Office message of his presidency , sought to quell rising anger over his response to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico by saying he will demand that BP 's chairman set aside whatever money is needed to compensate those who have been harmed by the company 's `` recklessness . '' `` We will make BP pay for the damage their company has caused , '' Obama said in an 18-minute speech . `` And we will do whatever 's necessary to help the Gulf Coast and its people recover from this tragedy . '' Obama announced that he had asked former Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus to develop a long-term Gulf Coast Restoration Plan -- to be funded by BP -- in concert with local states , communities , fishermen , conservationists and residents `` as soon as possible . '' Obama did not detail what this plan should include . `` Sadly , no matter how effective our response becomes , there will be more oil and more damage before this siege is done , '' Obama said . `` That 's why the second thing we 're focused on is the recovery and restoration of the Gulf Coast . '' Obama said the millions of gallons of crude oil that have gushed into Gulf waters from a broken well `` are more like an epidemic , one that we will be fighting for months and even years . '' The speech comes on the eve of Obama 's meeting with top BP executives at the White House on Wednesday . `` We share the president 's goal of shutting off the well as quickly as possible , cleaning up the oil and mitigating the impact on the people and environment of the Gulf Coast , '' a BP spokesperson said . `` We look forward to meeting with President Obama tomorrow for a constructive discussion about how best to achieve these mutual goals . '' But House Minority Leader John Boehner , R-Ohio , said Obama should n't `` exploit this crisis to impose a job-killing national energy tax on struggling families and small businesses . '' He also said any escrow fund established should be used to help Gulf Coast victims , `` not as a slush fund for trial lawyers or administration officials seeking to paper over their own misguided decisions . '' `` I sincerely hope that the Obama administration will not try to use a crisis made worse by its own failings to score political points on the backs of Americans living and working on the Gulf Coast , '' Boehner said in a written statement . `` This moment demands a call to action based on our shared interest in stopping this leak , cleaning up this mess , and finding out what went wrong . '' Much of Obama 's speech was devoted to a recitation of steps his administration has taken to clean the oil , help the distraught people of the Gulf and prevent another environmental crisis . `` We will fight this spill with everything we 've got for as long it takes , '' Obama said . Obama used the speech not only to lay out his administration 's plan to contain the oil spill but also to try and reverse the political toll it 's taken on his presidency . The president has taken a hit in the polls as oil continues to wash onto beaches and into critical wildlife habitat . And the crisis has taken up much of his time , forcing him to cancel a trip to Asia and Australia while threatening to stall his legislative agenda on such issues as financial overhaul , climate change and immigration reform . The speech set the stage for his showdown meeting Wednesday at the White House with top executives at British-based , BP , the company that leased the rig that exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers and causing the catastrophic spill . It 's part of an effort by Obama , who 's been seen by some as detached as the oil spill disaster initially unfolded , to convince a frightened Gulf Coast and a skeptical nation that he is in command . Democrats who were given an advance briefing by the White House on Obama 's speech praised the president 's remarks . `` It 's time to take this tragedy and turn it into an opportunity , '' Sen. Bill Neslon , D-Fla . , said in a written statement . `` I congratulate the president on saying we are now going to declare that this nation is getting on the road rapidly to breaking our dependence on oil .

The blast killed 11 workers . Since then , oil has been pouring into the Gulf from a blown-out undersea well . President Barack Obama wrested a $ 20 billion compensation guarantee and an apology to the nation from BP , announcing the company would set up a major claims fund for shrimpers , restaurateurs and others whose lives and livelihoods are being wrecked by the oil flooding into the Gulf of Mexico . Applause broke out during a community meeting in Orange Beach , Ala. , on the news . `` We asked for that two weeks ago and they laughed at us , '' Mayor Tony Kennon said . `` Thank you , President Obama , for taking a bunch of rednecks ' suggestion and making it happen . '' BP said it will suspend its dividend for the rest of this year and set up the $ 20 billion fund to assure victims of the Gulf oil spill that they will be compensated for their losses . The British oil giant also will cut spending and sell some assets to deal with the cleanup and compensation costs , which have already hit $ 1.75 billion . BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg announced the moves Wednesday after emerging from the White House , where he and other BP executives met for four hours with Obama . The `` small people '' of the Gulf Coast have a humongous message for oil giant BP : They 're tired of the company 's big-time executives making insensitive comments . Svanberg told reporters in Washington : `` I hear comments sometimes that large oil companies are greedy companies or do n't care , but that is not the case with BP . We care about the small people .

We do n't pray to them , '' Taffinder said . BP CEO Tony Hayward expects to tell Congress he is `` personally devastated '' by the Gulf drilling rig explosion and oil spill and understands the anger Americans feel toward him and his company . The explosion and sinking of the rig `` never should have happened -- and I am deeply sorry that they did , '' he said in testimony to be delivered to a House panel Thursday . `` My sadness has only grown as the disaster continues . '' A copy of Hayward 's testimony was obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press . BP began burning oil siphoned from the ruptured well as part of its plans to more than triple the amount of crude it can stop from reaching the sea , the company said . BP PLC said oil and gas siphoned from the well first reached a semi-submersible drilling rig on the ocean surface around 1 a.m. . Once that gas reaches the rig , it will be mixed with compressed air , shot down a specialized boom made by Schlumberger Ltd. and ignited at sea . It 's the first time this particular burner has been deployed in the Gulf of Mexico . Journalists covering the oil spill have been yelled at , kicked off public beaches and islands and threatened with arrest in the nearly three weeks since the government promised improved media access . Adm. Thad Allen issued a May 31 directive to BP and federal officials ensuring media access to sites along the coast . BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles followed up with a letter to news organizations , saying the company supports people 's rights to share their thoughts with reporters . But those efforts have done little to curtail the obstacles , harassment and intimidation tactics journalists are facing while covering the spill . Marine scientists studying the effects of the BP disaster are seeing some strange -- and troubling -- phenomena . Fish and other wildlife are fleeing the oil out in the Gulf and clustering in cleaner waters along the coast . But that is not the hopeful sign it might appear to be , researchers say . The animals ' presence close to shore means their usual habitat is badly polluted , and the crowding could result in mass die-offs as fish run out of oxygen . Also , the animals could easily get devoured by predators . After 50 years of watching wetlands created by the fertile Mississippi River turn into open water , Louisiana residents finally got what they 'd long awaited : A U.S. president saying he 'll fight to save what little is left along their eroding coast . Though details were vague , President Barack Obama 's pledge to restore the Gulf Coast 's degraded coast line has multibillion-dollar implications for the region 's culture and economy and could preserve wildlife endangered by the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . In an Oval Office address Tuesday night , Obama said he was committed to making sure southern Louisiana , which is hemorrhaging a football field of marshland every 38 minutes , and other coastlines are saved .

President Obama is drawing bipartisan criticism for using the BP oil spill to revive an energy regulation bill that 's been on the back burner since last year , with lawmakers saying the so-called `` cap-and-trade '' package does nothing to stop the leak or mitigate the damage . Obama , trying to take control of a crisis that has slowly eroded support for his administration , addressed the nation from the Oval Office Tuesday night to rally support for his efforts to tackle the spill . He pointed to the relief efforts already underway and said the government would hold BP responsible . But later in his 18-minute speech , he turned to focus on the need to `` seriously tackle our addiction to fossil fuels '' and tout Democrats ' climate legislation . `` We ca n't afford not to change how we produce and use energy , because the long-term costs to our economy , our national security and our environment are far greater , '' Obama said in the first Oval Office address of his presidency . While the president was taking the long view , lawmakers said that 's not the kind of response Gulf residents suffering immediate economic and environmental damage need . `` If my house is on fire , I do n't need the fire chief telling me I should not have built the house out of wood . I need somebody to put the fire out , '' Republican Alabama Gov. Bob Riley told Fox News on Wednesday . `` We have a crisis here . ...

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he agrees with Feinstein and that the energy policy proposed by Obama will not help Gulf residents in the near-term . `` What they 're doing here in effect is holding the Gulf hostage to a national energy tax , '' he told Fox News . The speech came 57 days after the April 20 explosion at the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that killed 11 workers and sparked the crisis , in which millions of gallons of oil already have spilled into the Gulf of Mexico . The speech also served as a prelude to Obama 's meeting Wednesday with BP executives at the White House . Obama plans to press executives to set up an escrow account to pay economic damages to Gulf residents . In his speech , Obama called on all Americans to contribute to `` a new future that will benefit all of us . '' He used similar language to kick-start action on his health care overhaul last year . `` As we recover from this recession , the transition to clean energy has the potential to grow our economy and create millions of good , middle-class jobs , but only if we accelerate that transition , '' Obama said . `` Only if we seize the moment . And only if we rally together and act as one nation -- workers and entrepreneurs ; scientists and citizens ; the public and private sectors . '' Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nev . , on Tuesday praised Obama 's comments on his energy agenda . `` I firmly believe that a diverse energy strategy will help our nation reduce pollution , create millions of clean energy jobs that can never be outsourced and lower our dependence on oil , '' Reid said in a written statement . He said he looks forward to passing a bipartisan energy bill this year and urged Republicans to work with Democrats on the issue . The climate bill most likely to pass the Senate is one sponsored by Sens. Joe Lieberman , I-Conn . , and John Kerry , D-Mass .

He lashed out at BP over the monumental oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . He vowed that he will make BP pay for all the long and short-term damage it caused . He argued that the battle against this now nearly two-month-old raging gusher of oil is tantamount to a war . And he asked the country to allow him and the Congress to regulate all businesses and private homes in the name of going green . For most Americans , it was the first time they saw him angry -- although a controlled anger from the no-drama-Obama , as his own campaign staff labeled him two years ago . But will the president 's feigned anger get the oil well plugged ? Will it get cash into the hands of those truly harmed ? Will it prevent future disasters ? Here are the facts : After the Exxon Valdez disaster off Alaska in 1989 had been cleaned up and nearly paid for by Exxon , the oil companies lobbied the Congress for liability limits -- maximum amounts that they could be held to pay for in the event of a disaster . A Republican Congress and President Clinton together made it the law that oil companies would be limited to pay $ 75 million for cleanups and the taxpayers -- that would be you -- would pay the rest . In return , the feds would be able to tell the oil companies where to drill . In the case of BP , it asked the state of Louisiana if it could drill in 500 feet of water and Louisiana said it could . The federal government vetoed that and told BP could only drill in 5,000 feet of water . Never mind that no oil company had ever cleaned up a broken well at that depth and never mind that the feds had never monitored a broken well at that depth and never mind that BP only needed to set aside $ 75 million in case something went wrong . The feds trumped BP 's engineers and the feds trumped the wishes of the folks who live along the Gulf Coast and the feds decided where this oil well would be drilled . The feds did nothing . Oil gushed out in an amount that is so great as to be immeasurable . The president eventually panicked because he believes that his federal government can right every wrong , regulate every activity and protect us from every catastrophe . Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal was ready to build barriers to protect his state 's coastline and the feds said no. . The president even invoked powers that allow him to supervise the cleanup using BP personnel and equipment . And the oil still gushes . Last week , the president stopped all oil drilling in the Gulf putting thousands out of work . Last night he demanded billions from BP so his team could decide who gets it and today a terrified BP gave him all the cash he asked for . So , the government that foolishly limited BP 's maximum liability , the government that claimed it knew where best to drill , the government that actually stopped locals from protecting their own shoreline -- that would be that same government that bankrupted Social Security , Medicare , Medicaid , the Post Office , Amtrak and virtually everything it has managed -- now wants to decide who gets BP 's cash . The last time this government had this much private cash to give away , during the GM and Chrysler bankruptcies , it disregarded well-settled law and gave it to the labor unions . To whom will it give this cash -- the innocent injured or its political friends ? The government can not protect us from every catastrophe , especially ones its rules have facilitated . How about this : That government is best which governs least . The people have a right to a government that obeys the laws of economics , the laws of physics and the Constitution . Let private enterprise do what it does best and keep politics out of the way . If the Constitution was written to keep the government off the people 's backs , it is time for the feds to get off .

Pictured , from left , are BP CEO Tony Hayward , BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg , BP General Counsel Rupert Bondy , BP Managing Director Robert Dudley , Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett , Labor Secretary Hilda Solis , Attorney General Eric Holder , and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano . -LRB- Official White House Photo by Pete Souza -RRB- This official White House photograph is being made available only for publication by news organizations and\\/or for personal use President Obama announced Wednesday that BP will set aside $ 20 billion for an escrow fund to compensate victims of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , as the oil firm 's chairman publicly apologized for the disaster and said the company will not pay out any more dividends this year . Obama and BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg each spoke to the press separately following the president 's first meeting with top BP executives since the April 20 rig explosion that triggered the massive leak . `` I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to the American people on behalf of all the employees in BP , '' Svanberg said , after announcing that the firm would halt dividend payments . He said BP will live up to all `` legitimate responsibilities '' and that the escrow account should send the message to Americans that `` we mean what we say . '' The president assured the public that the $ 20 billion amount does not represent a `` cap '' on damages that BP may be liable for , but noted that it was substantially larger than the $ 75 million amount the firm is liable for under federal law . Obama said the account offers `` substantial assurance '' that claims will be honored . `` BP 's liabilities for this spill are significant and they acknowledge that fact , '' Obama said . `` We will continue to hold BP and all other responsible parties accountable . And I 'm absolutely confident BP will be able to meet its obligations to the Gulf Coast and to the American people . '' Obama also said the company had agreed to set up a separate $ 100 million fund to compensate oil rig workers laid off as a result of his six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling . The deal with the White House arranges for the company responsible for the largest manmade environmental disaster in U.S. history to set aside the money in a fund to be administered by lawyer Kenneth Feinberg . Feinberg oversaw payments to families of victims of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks and is currently President Obama 's `` pay czar , '' setting salary limits for companies getting the most aid from a $ 700 billion government bailout fund . The announcement follows an Oval Office address to the nation Tuesday night in which the president said he was meeting with BP executives to inform them that they are to `` set aside whatever resources are required to compensate the workers and business owners who have been harmed as a result of his company 's recklessness . '' Obama said the fund will not be controlled by BP but by an `` independent , third party . '' The meeting with Svanberg , CEO Tony Hayward and other BP executives included several administration officials -- Homeland Secretary Secretary Janet Napolitano , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar , Energy Secretary Steven Chu , Commerce Secretary Gary Locke , Labor Secretary Hilda Solis , Attorney General Holder , Vice President Joe Biden , Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and senior adviser Valerie Jarrett , It was Obama 's first meeting with BP officials since the spill . While Hayward has served as the voice of the company , the White House has been emphasizing the role of the company 's chairman , Svanberg , instead . The BP decision to cancel dividend payments means investors will lose out on the $ 2.6 billion payment scheduled for June 21 and even more money over the rest of the year . For the president , the tough diplomacy with a few officials behind closed doors is a bookend to his attempt to reach millions at once . Using a delivery in which even the harshest words were uttered in subdued tones , Obama did not offer much in the way of new ideas or details in his speech to the nation Tuesday night . Instead , he mainly recapped the government 's efforts , insisted once again that BP will be held to account and tried to tap the resilience of a nation in promising that `` something better awaits . '' Republicans criticized him for using the speech to push energy legislation but also chided him on Wednesday for taking 58 days to hold a high-level meeting with BP executives . The Republican National Committee released a web video titled , `` What Took So Long ? '' drawing attention to all the fundraisers , golf outings and meetings with the celebrities the president has participated in since the April 20 explosion . The escrow account was something many lawmakers had called for . Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and 53 other Democratic senators had requested BP set up a $ 20 billion account , but in a letter issued Monday said that does not limit the firm from future expenses . After the administration reached a deal with BP for the escrow account , a senior treasury official told Fox News that Feinberg would start administering the account immediately , though he would continue to oversee bailed-out banks . The official said Feinberg would transition away from those duties over the summer . The Associated Press contributed to this report .

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated . Watch `` The O'Reilly Factor '' weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET ! BILL O'REILLY , HOST : Joining us from Wasilla , Alaska , former governor of that state , Sarah Palin . All right , did you have a big beef with the president tonight in any way , governor ? SARAH PALIN , FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR : I did . I kind of have a big beef with you too though , Bill , if you do n't acknowledge that President Obama is wrong on his call for a need for energy policy . Certainly we need that , but he is wrong not to acknowledge that we still need on a three-legged stool the conventional sources of energy to be drilled here . Otherwise , Bill , we are going to be dropped to our knees and bowing to the Saudis and Venezuela and places like Russia that will keep producing oil and petroleum products , and we will have to ask them to produce for us because we will still be dependent upon these sources of energy . In addition though , too , shifting more towards the renewables which , of course , we need . And the other leg of that stool is conservation . President Obama , it scares me , it saddens me that the CEO of our nation does not understand that inherent link between the conventional sources of energy that we 're dependent upon and our security , our prosperity , our freedom . O'REILLY : OK , what was the -- when you were the governor of the state , you dealt with oil companies all the time . What was the most difficult thing that you had to deal with when you were having meetings with them face to face ? PALIN : Believing that their perception of what the circumstances were in any situation that we dealt with them , whether it be a spill or lax infrastructure maintenance or the value of the resource that was being sold . In any of those issues , it was believing what they were telling me and my administration in terms of their perspective on what the facts were . Now , here 's where the problem lies with President Obama in waiting so long , you know , eight weeks before meeting with the CEO of BP and with the high-ranking officials that have been calling the shots . He has allowed this industry player to get to define the facts . So they are just in this position of having astronomical maximum liability exposure . He 's allowed them to define the facts of this spill . You can never be allowed to do that as a CEO and be on a level playing field , being equals there at the table when you allow one side of the table , in this case BP , in dealing with this spill to define the facts . O'REILLY : All right . But 49 percent , according to a poll today , we 'll have later , 49 percent of Americans still want BP to run the show . And only 45 percent want the government to run the show . So most Americans are n't down with the Obama administration calling the shots . Now , President Obama basically is , as Charles Krauthammer pointed out , a dreamer . I mean , he wants , I think , good for the nation as far as energy is concerned . You made a very valid point . We ca n't throw the oil people under the bus . If we do that , our economy is going to tank totally . And if we spend billions of dollars on pie in the sky stuff that does n't work , we 're going to go bankrupt . So what is your solution here , governor ? What would you do tonight ? Tell the nation tonight what you would have said your main point in that speech . PALIN : Stopping the gusher . That 's the No. 1 priority of the nation . O'REILLY : But nobody knows how to do it . PALIN : We need to make sure that all technology is being thrown at this problem . O'REILLY : Nobody knows how to do it . PALIN : Well , we have n't had the assurance that president -- we have n't had the assurance by the president that that has been his top priority . Instead , what his top priority is , Bill , is cap and tax . It is using this crisis , not letting it go to waste , but to use this crisis to increase the cost of energy . O'REILLY : All right , if that happens , there will be an outcry . PALIN : And that is going to stall any kind of economic recovery that we have . O'REILLY : Are you telling me that you do n't think the president 's top priority is stopping that leak ? Is that what you are telling me ? PALIN : What I 'm telling you is that is not what I am hearing and what the American public is hearing from the top official in our government . And that 's why those poll numbers show that , no , the public , we do n't know where to turn . If we ca n't trust BP to be able to fix this leak , we know we ca n't trust government because they 've had eight weeks of overseeing , of regulating and kind of coaching this whole process , this whole issue of stopping the leak . And they have n't succeeded in doing it . PALIN : We have to know -- we have to know that President Obama 's No. 1 priority is to stop the leak . O'REILLY : But I 'm assuming that it is . And I am assuming that it is . But , look , the reason I 'm pleased to have you on the program tonight is that there is not a governor in the United States who has more experience than you do dealing with the oil companies . You 've already said you ca n't believe them , that their word does n't mean much when you are debating issues as far as the oil company 's interest and the interest of the people . You ca n't believe them . Now , the oil company BP says we do n't know how to stop the leak . We 're going to try X. We 're going to dig another well . We 're going to do this . We do n't know . We do n't know . Obama obviously does n't know how to stop the leak . Do you know how to stop it ? PALIN : Well , then what the federal government should have done was accept the assistance of foreign countries , of entrepreneurial Americans who have had solutions ... PALIN : They ca n't even get a phone call returned , Bill . They are known in the Norwegian . They are known for -- for dikes and for cleaning up water and for dealing with spills . They offered to help and , yet , no , they too , with a proverbial ca n't even get a phone call back . That is what the Norwegians are telling us , and the Dutch are telling us . And then the entrepreneurial Americans , the company in Maine that has the boom and the absorbents , those companies that are waiting for the Obama administration eight weeks later for the regulators to come in and say , OK , we 'll purchase from you now . We 'll do all that we can . That 's where some of the frustration is . Now , we saw the same thing though with Katrina , did n't we ? So , I 'm not going to point fingers and make this a partisan issue at all , point fingers at different administrations . But it is that inherent problem that we have with government , not necessarily being prepared , because our priorities in government are wrong . National security , safety of the people , needs to be the top priority . That 's where we need to be funding instead of funding these other things on the periphery that really just get in the way of the private sector 's progress , their ability to produce and to thrive and to prosper , Instead , our priorities in the national government have been screwed up . Now , as governor of Alaska , what I did in dealing with the oil companies , and I 'll bet you , 75 percent of my time was being taken up by energy issues here in this state . I had to set up our Petroleum Systems Integrity Office so that we could be there on the front lines making sure what the oil companies were telling us was legit , when they were dealing with their corroded pipes that we found out and other lax maintenance issues . PALIN : It took us putting that as the highest priority to protect our resources , to protect our environment , including not just the physical environment but the human environment here . O'REILLY : All right . Well , that 's a good point . There was n't anybody from the management service or whatever -- Mineral Management Service out on the pipeline checking it out . That 's for sure . Hey , Governor , always a pleasure . Thanks for coming on . O'REILLY : Go ahead , real quick . We ca n't -- we ca n't afford though to -- we ca n't afford to demonize these energy producers to such an extent though that they go under . We do need to work with them though , but we need to verify everything it is and hold them accountable for all that they have done in this situation . O'REILLY : All right , governor .

Svanberg told reporters afterward that BP cares about ` the small people , ' a remark that drew an icy reception in the Gulf Coast . White House VENICE , La. -- The `` small people '' of the Gulf Coast have a humongous message for oil giant BP : They 're tired of the company 's big-time executives making insensitive comments . On Wednesday , BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg told reporters in Washington : `` I hear comments sometimes that large oil companies are greedy companies or do n't care , but that is not the case with BP . We care about the small people . '' He later said he was very sorry for speaking `` clumsily . '' Orange Beach , Ala. , Mayor Tony Kennon laughed when he heard Svanberg 's remark . `` They can call me small , miniature , they can call me anything they want . Just write the check and send it to us , '' he said . But Justin Taffinder of New Orleans was not amused . `` We 're not small people . We 're human beings . They 're no greater than us . We do n't bow down to them . We do n't pray to them , '' Taffinder said . Svanberg is Swedish , and his comments -- in English -- may have been an unintentional slight . He uttered the remark to reporters following a joint press conference with President Barack Obama -- who had spoke of the small business owners , the fishermen and the shrimpers affected by the spill . `` What I was trying to say -- that BP understands how deeply this affects the lives of people who live along the Gulf and depend on it for their livelihood -- will best be conveyed not by any words but by the work we do to put things right for the families and businesses who 've been hurt , '' Svanberg said in a statement . But coastal residents already were angry over the oil spill disaster and at BP CEO Tony Hayward 's earlier comments that he `` wants his life back . '' Lyn Ridge , 47 , ferried reporters to see oil clean up operations Wednesday in a bay at Plaquemines Parish . He just shook his head when told about the `` small people '' comment . Ridge describes himself as `` commercial contractor that ca n't find work and driving boat trying to make a living . '' To make matters worse , Ridge figures his house on the water in Myrtle Grove has lost half it 's value due to the oil spill . `` They can say he did n't mean it that way , but that 's how they think of us , '' Ridge said . `` They ca n't keep their foot out of their mouth , '' he added referring to Hayward 's comments . In Alabama , Terry Hanners , who owns a small construction company in Gulf Shores , said the chairman 's remark revealed something about BP 's frame of mind . `` These BP people I 've met are good folks . I 've got a good rapport with them , '' said Hanners , 74 . `` But BP does not care about us . They are so far above us . We are the nickel-and-dime folks of this world . '' Kennon said he is relieved that BP agreed to put $ 20 billion in an escrow fund , and joked , `` They better be lucky I called off the invasion of 10,000 rednecks with their rifles headed toward England anyway .

Joe Barton , R-Texas listens to opening statements from members of Congress , on Capitol Hill in Washington , Thursday , June 17 , 2010 , prior to BP CEO Tony Hayward testifying before an Energy and Environment subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations hearing on the role of BP in the Deepwater Horizon Explosion and Oil Spill . -LRB- AP -RRB- Republicans have strongly rebuked one of their own , Texas Rep. Joe Barton , for accusing the White House of engaging in what he called a `` $ 20 billion shakedown '' of BP , with one lawmaker calling on Barton to resign his leadership position on a powerful committee . Barton apologized for his comment under pressure from the House Republican leaders who threatened to strip him of his post as the top Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee . House Minority Leader John Boehner , R-Ohio , and House Minority Whip Eric Cantor , R-Va . , `` are in agreement that he was within a centimeter of losing his position , '' a senior GOP aide told Fox News . `` He could apologize immediately or lose his position . '' Barton had complained at a hearing earlier Thursday that the Obama administration was forcing BP to set up a $ 20 billion `` slush fund '' for oil spill victims . Barton said he was ashamed of the White House 's actions -- and he apologized to BP . The comments got no backing from his fellow Republicans . `` Congressman Barton 's statements this morning were wrong , '' Boehner , Cantor and Rep. Mike Pence , R-Ind . , said in a written statement . `` BP itself has acknowledged that responsibility for the economic damages lies with them and has offered an initial pledge of $ 20 billion dollars for that purpose . '' Rep. Jeff Miller , R-Fla . , said he was `` shocked '' by Barton 's `` reprehensible comments that the government should apologize for the ` shakedown ' of BP . '' `` I condemn Mr. Barton 's statement , '' Miller said in a written statement . `` Mr. Barton 's remarks are out of touch with this tragedy and I feel his comments call into question his judgment and ability to serve in a leadership position on the Energy and Commerce Committee . He should step down as ranking member of the committee . '' The unusual intraparty rebuke came after Barton issued an apology of sorts about his apology to BP -- then retracted that apology . `` I apologize for using the term ` shakedown ' ... and I retract my apology to BP , '' he said , adding that his remarks had been `` misconstrued . '' `` I regret the impact that my statement this morning implied that BP should not pay for the consequences of their decisions and actions in this incident , '' he said . On Wednesday , President Obama announced that BP had agreed to set up a $ 20 billion relief fund that will be led by the administration 's `` pay czar , '' Kenneth Feinberg , who oversaw the $ 7 billion government fund for families of victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks . The use of the BP escrow fund is intended to avoid a repeat of the painful aftermath of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil disaster in Alaska , when the fight over money dragged out in courts for roughly two decades . Democrats quickly pounced on Barton 's initial apology to BP . Vice President Biden called those remarks `` outrageous '' and the White House issued a statement calling on members of both parties to `` repudiate his comments . '' `` What is shameful is that Joe Barton seems to have more concern for big corporations that caused this disaster than the fishermen , small business owners and communities whose lives have been devastated by the destruction , '' the White House said in a written statement . `` Congressman Barton may think that a fund to compensate these Americans is a ` tragedy , ' but most Americans know that the real tragedy is what the men and women of the Gulf Coast are going through right now . '' When pressed at the hearing by a Democratic lawmaker on whether he thought the fund was a shakedown , Hayward said he did n't think it was a `` slush fund . '' Biden called Barton 's comments `` incredibly insensitive '' and `` out of touch . '' The fund is intended `` to protect people who are drowning , '' Biden said at the daily White House briefing Thursday . `` What is wrong with that ? How is that a shakedown ? I do n't know . I find it pretty astounding . '' Campaign for Fair Elections , a nonpartisan campaign reform advocacy group , blasted Barton for his comments , noting that he has received $ 27,000 from BP in campaign contributions since 1989 and $ 1.4 million from the oil & gas industry . `` It 's amazing that Rep. Barton would stand up for a multinational corporation that has wrecked the livelihoods of so many people along the Gulf Coast , '' said David Donnelly , campaign manager for the group . `` Comments like this make all Americans question whether Congress represents them or the special interests funding their campaign . '' Donnelly called on Barton to contribute BP 's campaign donations to the Gulf recovery effort . Rep. Ed Markey , D-Mass . , defended the $ 20 billion fund during Thursday 's hearing , saying the fund `` is not a shakedown . `` Rather , it was the government of the United States working to protect the most vulnerable citizens that we have in our country -- right now , the residents of the Gulf , '' he said . `` It 's BP 's spill , but it 's America 's ocean and it 's American citizens who are the ones being harmed .

'' He told a Senate committee on small business that he 's been working for more than a decade in hopes of having the cleanup machines on hand for immediate use in spills . `` Clearly , there is a market out there , '' said Costner , who has invested more than $ 24 million to develop the portable devices . BP has contracted with Costner and Ocean Therapy Solutions to use 32 centrifuge machines that are designed to separate oil from water . Costner said all major oil companies should keep the device nearby , like a fire extinguisher , ready whenever accidents occur . The centrifuges can fit on fishing boats or docks and clean 200 gallons of water per minute -- 210,000 gallons per day , Costner said . The actor appeared at the hearing of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship to talk about the challenges small businesses face in getting the government and BP to evaluate their ideas to clean up the Gulf oil spill . Navigating the system is like `` playing a video game that no one can master , '' Costner said . And many government agencies and foreign and U.S. oil companies were unresponsive even after seeing the oil-water separator years ago . Costner said the device had been sitting at a Nevada facility for 10 years until BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles recently called him . `` He was excited , '' Costner said . `` He told me that the machine worked . He told me that it was working against the dispersants , that it was handling the variations of oil mixtures and thickness present in the Gulf .

In fact , it could be a powerful new tool for the White House 's political machine , and is the latest manifestation of the Obama administration 's willingness to work outside the law . It also lays bare Big Oil 's willingness to get cozy with the left . There is no legal basis for the Obama administration to induce BP to pay $ 20 billion into a kitty to be controlled by one of its political appointees . While this may play well in populist circles , create the appearance of action , and was apparently easy to foist onto BP 's hapless management , it weakens the rule of law by essentially circumventing the law . There is already a well-established legal process for remedying the economic cost of someone else 's negligence . Every day , thousands of Americans sue other individuals or companies , either by themselves or via class actions that combine their efforts . The design and rules of these legal processes are laid out in laws crafted by Congress and state legislatures . BP 's $ 20 billion was extracted outside of this legal framework for reasons that have not been explained . There is a high risk that this fund will be doled out based on political , not legal criteria . Rather than judges and juries making decisions , an economic commissar will . This fits the emerging pattern of lawlessness in Mr. Obama 's Washington . Before this , Exhibit A was the health care bill . The procedure by which it was passed , and its more novel provisions -LRB- e.g. , compulsory insurance -RRB- , were conjured with general disregard of the Constitution and legal and legislative norms . More recently , Mr. Obama 's technology guru at the White House unethically used the power of his office to browbeat private businesses into offering him discounts . And the man who will administer the new $ 20 billion fund , Kenneth Feinberg , is the government 's so-called `` Pay Czar , '' and has used questionable government power to dictate compensation levels for financial industry employees . Lost in this mess is any reference to limits on government set forth in the Constitution or law . For its part , BP has done a great disservice to its shareholders . Despite its charitable pay-in to a Democratically-controlled kitty , the company can still be sued separately by anyone with a grievance . Congress can theoretically change this so that compensation is managed through the fund . But BP CEO Tony Hayward probably should have sought that before signing over his shareholders ' money . At present , the $ 20 billion has won BP no legal protection and amounts only to history 's most expensive P.R. move . As time goes by , Mr. Hayward comes increasingly to resemble the character James Taggart in the Ayn Rand novel `` Atlas Shrugged . '' Both men came to run mighty businesses created by more talented managers . Both were beguiled by cunning creatures of government who sought to bring wealth and wealth-creators under the heel of the state . James Taggart sought the love of the aptly named lobbyist-turned-economic-dictator `` Wesley Mouch . '' Hayward and his contemporaries throughout Big Oil crave a similar acceptance from those who plot their destruction , and on their way to that end , the erosion of the rule of law . Indeed , it is a canard of the left that Big Oil is a bulwark of capitalism and private property rights that hinders the march of progressivism . BP has sought cozy relations with liberal environmental groups . It has donated $ 10 million to the Nature Conservancy and $ 2 million to Conservation International . It has a partnership related to wind power with groups like the Sierra Club , the Natural Resources Defense Council , and the Union of Concerned Scientists . Other Big Oil giants play a similar game . In 2008-09 , Chevron peppered Washington , D.C. subway stations with sanctimonious ads showing people vowing to lead green lifestyles and use less of Chevron 's own product . Last year , Chevron 's CEO agreed in a debate with the Sierra Club 's executive director that there ought to be a new energy tax . Currently , Chevron 's website on corporate social responsibility has a link to the left wing Human Rights Campaign , whose notable contribution to the 2004 presidential race was printing stickers declaring `` George W. Bush : ` You 're Fired . '' ' All of this brings to mind Winston Churchill 's definition of an appeaser as `` one who feeds the crocodile hoping it will eat him last . '' So it is with those currently running Big Oil . Unfortunately , they are not only victimizing their shareholders , but everyone else in the radical environmentalists ' cross hairs , including Americans who do things like drive cars and heat their homes in winter . Two solutions are wanting . First , voters could use elections this November to elect a conservative Congress that starts insisting Mr. Obama respect the rule of law and the limits of constitutional government . Second , shareholders of oil companies could insist on a management able to focus more on long-term shareholder value -- and political strategies smarter than attempting to appease enemies committed to their demise . Otherwise , shareholders might suddenly find that those who are supposed to represent their interests have instead given $ 20 billion away to liberal politicians for nothing in return .

AP Hayward 's testimony came after members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee 's oversight and investigations subcommittee took turns in a long-awaited public flogging intended to capture the outrage of the nation . The panel is investigating the explosion that killed 11 workers and unleashed a flood of oil that has yet to be stemmed . As Hayward began his testimony , a woman identified as Diane Wilson , who appeared to have oil smeared on her face and clothes , shouted from the back of the room : `` You need to be charged with a crime . '' She was grabbed by Capitol police and taken from the room . Moments later , Hayward began his remarks , saying that the Gulf oil spill `` never should have happened '' and that he regretted the impact the spill has had on the environment and the people of the Gulf Coast . Before Hayward 's testimony , lawmakers accused him of being oblivious to the risks of the company 's deep-water operations . Some of the sharpest criticism came from Rep. Bart Stupak , D-Mich . `` We are not small people . But we wish to get our lives back , '' he told Hayward . `` I 'm sure you 'll get your life back , and with a golden parachute to England . '' It was a reference to Hayward 's much-criticized earlier remark that some day he hoped to get `` my life back '' and to comments on the White House driveway on Wednesday by BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg that `` we care about the small people '' of the Gulf Coast . Hayward sipped a beverage and jotted notes as one lawmaker after another scorched him . Early on , attention shifted away from Hayward as lawmakers traded barbs over the agreement President Obama announced on Wednesday with BP for the establishment of a $ 20 billion relief fund . Rep. Joe Barton , R-Texas , accused the White House of a `` $ 20 billion shakedown '' of BP by requiring the company to establish the huge fund to compensate those hurt by the oil spill . `` I 'm ashamed of what happened in the White House '' on Wednesday , Barton said . But Rep. Ed Markey , D-Mass . , fired back that the fund is `` not a shakedown . '' `` Rather , it was the government of the United States working to protect the most vulnerable citizens that we have in our country -- right now , the residents of the Gulf , '' he said . `` It 's BP 's spill , but it 's America 's ocean and it 's American citizens who are the ones being harmed . '' Hayward expects to tell Congress he is `` personally devastated '' by the Gulf drilling rig explosion and oil spill and understands the anger Americans feel toward him and his company . The explosion and sinking of the BP-operated Deepwater Horizon rig `` never should have happened -- and I am deeply sorry that they did , '' he said in testimony to be delivered to a House panel Thursday . `` My sadness has only grown as the disaster continues . '' ' `` To be sure , neither I nor the company is perfect , '' Hayward said . `` But we are unwavering in our commitment to fulfill all our responsibilities . '' He said the British-based company has spent nearly $ 1.5 billion since the April 20 explosion , and wo n't stop until the job is done . Hayward also called the explosion `` a complex accident , caused by an unprecedented combination of failures . '' A group of protesters milled in the hallway outside the hearing room , including Diane Wilson , 61 , a fourth-generation fisher from Seadrift , Texas , near the Gulf Coast . Wilson , appearing with a black-stained hand , said she wanted to send a message : `` Hayward should go to jail . '' She was joined by Ann Wright , 63 , of Honolulu , Hawaii , who wore a BP hardhat , overalls and sunglasses adorned with dollar signs . `` BP does n't really care about this , '' she said , pulling out an oil-stained rubber ducky . Thursday was Hayward 's inaugural appearance since the largest oil spill in U.S. history . Hayward has said he 's got thick enough skin to handle the verbal assaults . `` I 'm so far unscathed , '' he told analysts in a recent conference call , referring to the general criticism he 's received . `` No one has actually physically harmed me . They 've thrown some words at me . But I 'm a Brit , so sticks and stones can hurt your bones but words never break them , or whatever the expression is . '' The BP CEO follows a long list of corporate faces used as congressional punching bags . Just this year , executives from Goldman Sachs spent nine hours trying to fend off accusations from senators that they bilked investors , and Toyota President Akio Toyoda personally and repeatedly apologized for deadly defects in his company 's cars , only to have angry lawmakers forcefully respond that was hardly sufficient . The Associated Press contributed to this report . "}, {"uid": "816", "dct": "2010-06-17", "dates": [null, null], "text": "`` Chairman Stupak , Ranking Member Burgess , members of the Subcommittee . I am Tony Hayward , Chief Executive of BP plc. . The explosion and fire aboard the Deepwater Horizon and the resulting oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico never should have happened ? and I am deeply sorry that they did . None of us yet knows why it happened . But whatever the cause , we at BP will do what we can to make certain that an incident like this does not happen again . Since April 20 , I have spent a great deal of my time in the Gulf Coast region and in the incident command center in Houston , and let there be no mistake ? I understand how serious this situation is . This is a tragedy : people lost their lives ; others were injured ; and the Gulf Coast environment and communities are suffering . This is unacceptable , I understand that , and let me be very clear : I fully grasp the terrible reality of the situation . When I learned that eleven men had lost their lives in the explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon , I was personally devastated . Three weeks ago , I attended a memorial service for those men , and it was a shattering moment . I want to offer my sincere condolences to their friends and families -- I can only imagine their sorrow . My sadness has only grown as the disaster continues . I want to speak directly to the people who live and work in the Gulf region : I know that this incident has profoundly impacted lives and caused turmoil , and I deeply regret that . Indeed , this is personal for us at BP . Many of our 23,000 U.S. employees live and work in the Gulf Coast region . For decades , the people of the Gulf Coast states have extended their hospitality to us and to the companies like Arco and Amoco that are now part of BP . We have always strived to be a good neighbor . We have worked to hire employees and contractors , and to buy many of our supplies , locally . The data described throughout this testimony is accurate to the best of my knowledge as of 7am , June 16 , 2010 , when this testimony was prepared . The information that we have continues to develop as our response to this incident continues . I want to acknowledge the questions that you and the public are rightly asking . How could this happen ? How damaging is the spill to the environment ? Why is it taking so long to stop the flow of oil and gas into the Gulf ? And questions are being asked about energy policy more broadly : Can we as a society explore for oil and gas in safer and more reliable ways ? What is the appropriate regulatory framework for the industry ? We do n't yet have answers to all these important questions . But I hear the concerns , fears , frustrations -- and anger -- being voiced across the country . I understand it , and I know that these sentiments will continue until the leak is stopped , and until we prove through our actions that we will do the right thing . Our actions will mean more than words , and we know that , in the end , we will be judged by the quality of our response . Until this happens , no words will be satisfying . Nonetheless , I am here today because I have a responsibility to the American people to do my best to explain what BP has done , is doing , and will do in the future to respond to this terrible incident . And while we ca n't undo these tragic events , I give you my word that we will do the right thing . We will not rest until the well is under control , and we will meet all our obligations to clean up the spill and address its environmental and economic impacts . From the moment I learned of the explosion and fire , I committed the global resources of BP to the response efforts . To be sure , neither I nor the company is perfect . But we are unwavering in our commitment to fulfill all our responsibilities . We are a strong company , and nothing is being spared . We are going to do everything in our power to address fully the economic and environmental consequences of this spill and to ensure that we use the lessons learned from this incident to make energy exploration and production safer and more reliable for everyone . We have been committed to responding to these tragic events and coordinating with the federal government from the beginning . On April 21 , the Administration began holding meetings and regular calls with me and other members of BP 's leadership to discuss BP 's response effort , as well as federal oversight and support . Even before the Deepwater Horizon sank on the morning of April 22 , a Unified Command structure was established , as provided by federal regulations . Currently led by the National Incident Commander , Admiral Thad Allen , the Unified Command provides a structure for BP 's work with the Coast Guard , the Minerals Management Service and Transocean , among others . We are grateful for the leadership of President Obama , members of his cabinet , the state governors and local officials . As the scope of the unfolding disaster became more apparent , we reached out to additional scientists and engineers from our partners and competitors in the energy industry , as well as engineering firms , academia , government and the military . Among the resources that have been made available : Drilling and technical experts who are helping determine solutions to stopping the spill and mitigating its impact , including specialists in the areas of subsea wells , environmental science and emergency response ; Technical advice on blowout preventers , dispersant application , well construction and containment options ; Additional facilities to serve as staging areas for equipment and responders , more remotely operated vehicles -LRB- ROVs -RRB- for deep underwater work , barges , support vessels and additional aircraft , as well as training and working space for the Unified Command . Working under the umbrella of the Unified Command , BP 's team of operational and technical experts is coordinating with many federal , state , and local governmental entities and private sector organizations . These include the Departments of Interior , Homeland Security , Energy , and Defense , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- NOAA -RRB- , US Fish & Wildlife Service -LRB- USFW -RRB- , National Marine Fisheries Service -LRB- NMFS -RRB- , EPA , OSHA , Gulf Coast state environmental and wildlife agencies , the Marine Spill Response Corporation -LRB- MSRC -RRB- -LRB- an oil spill response organization -RRB- , as well as numerous state , city , parish and county agencies . Some of the best minds and the deepest expertise are being brought to bear . With the possible exception of the space program in the 1960s , it is difficult to imagine the gathering of a larger , more technically proficient team in one place in peacetime . And including BP , industry and government resources , more than 27,000 personnel are now engaged in the response in various activities such as booming , skimming , surveying , clean-up operations , wildlife protection and rehabilitation and claims support . In addition , we are helping to train and organize the more than 19,000 citizen volunteers who have come forward to offer their services . The outpouring of support from government , industry , businesses and private citizens has truly been both humbling and inspiring . Our efforts in response to this incident are focused on two critical goals : Successfully stopping the flow of oil ; and Minimizing the environmental and economic impacts from the oil spill . These are without a doubt complex and challenging tasks . While we have had to overcome hurdles , we are doing everything we can to respond as quickly and effectively as we can . From the beginning , we have been committed to a transparent response . We know the public wants as much information as possible about this unprecedented event , and we continue to do our best to provide it so the public can understand the incident and its impacts . Subsea efforts to secure the well Our first priority is to stop the flow of oil and secure the well . We are currently drilling two relief wells , which we believe represents the ultimate solution to stopping the flow of oil and gas from the well . The first relief well is currently at a depth of 15,226 feet , and the second relief well is currently at 9,778 feet . Separately , the goal has been to minimize or stop the flow of oil and gas before the relief wells are completed . From the beginning , we have implemented a multifaceted strategy , featuring a range of technological approaches . Our efforts to stop the well from the seabed included a number of interventions to the failed BOP , and the ` top kill ' procedure . We understand the public 's frustration that these approaches did not stop the flow of oil . We , too , were disappointed . Although we were not able to stop the well at the seabed , our efforts to contain the oil and gas have been more successful . While our first attempt with a Containment Dome was not successful due to gas hydrate formation , we learned lessons that have underpinned subsequent successes . Specifically , we first deployed a Riser Insertion Tube Tool that overcame these gas hydrate problems and captured more than 2,000 barrels per day for ten days . On June 3 , we replaced this with the Lower Marine Riser Package Cap , which had increased our collection to about 15,000 barrels per day . On Wednesday morning , we were in the early stages of increasing oil and gas collection through our next containment step , the Q4000 Direct Connect . It utilizes much of the subsea ` top kill ' equipment and takes oil directly from the failed BOP to the Q4000 on the surface . We expect to optimize collection over the next few days to levels well above what was previously accomplished . It is important to keep in mind that these techniques have never before been attempted 5,000 feet under water . On the seabed , we have made unprecedented use of ROVs for a variety of tasks , including working on the BOP , positioning riser cutting devices and slings , connecting hoses , positioning containment devices and providing extensive surveying and monitoring . We can not guarantee the outcome of these operations , but we are working around the clock with the best experts from government and industry . We continue to do more to increase our operational flexibility and collection capability . This includes securing vessels with greater processing and storage capacity , adding shuttle tankers for transporting oil , procuring spares of critical equipment , installing permanent riser systems , and replacing the containment cap with a more secure system . We will not rest with our containment efforts until the well is permanently killed . I know it feels like this all takes a long time but we are compressing operations that normally take months into days . In addition to these containment operations , and with the approval of the Unified Command and in conjunction with the EPA , we continue injecting dispersant subsea using ROVs . Dispersant acts by separating the oil into small droplets that can break down more easily through natural processes before they reach the surface . Use of dispersant subsea reduces the amount of oil traveling to the surface , which , in turn , reduces the amount of spray dispersant required at the surface . In addition , dispersant use at the source requires approximately one quarter of the amount of dispersant that would be necessary for use on the surface . Sonar testing and aerial photographs show encouraging results . There has been a lot of discussion about the use of dispersants . On June 4 , a federal panel of experts studying this issue recommended continued use of dispersants after analyzing potential risks and benefits for the environment . The dispersant we are using -- Corexit -- is on the National Contingency Plan Product Schedule , which is maintained by the EPA . We will continue to work closely with the EPA to try to identify alternative dispersants and to monitor the situation closely . We will only use dispersants in ways approved by the Unified Command , supported by the EPA and other relevant agencies . BP is a `` responsible party '' under the Oil Pollution Act . This means that federal law requires BP , as one of the working interest owners of Mississippi Canyon 252 , to pay to clean up the spill and to compensate for the economic and environmental impacts of the spill . Let me be clear : BP has accepted this responsibility and will fulfill this obligation . We have spent nearly $ 1.5 billion so far , and we will not stop until the job is done . It is important to understand that this `` responsible party '' designation is distinct from an assessment of legal liability for the actions that led to the spill . Investigations into the causes of the incident are ongoing , and issues of liability will be sorted out separately when the facts are clear and all the evidence is available . The focus now is on ensuring that cleanup , and compensation for those harmed by the spill , are carried out as quickly as possible . Our cleanup efforts are focused on two fronts : in the open water and at the shoreline . On the open water , more than 4,200 response vessels are in use , including skimmers , storage barges , tugs , and other vessels . The Hoss barge , the world 's largest skimming vessel , has been onsite since April 25 . In addition , there are 49 deepwater skimming vessels , which includes ten 210-foot MSRC Oil Responder Class Vessels , which each have the capacity to collect , separate , and store 4,000 barrels of oily water mix . To date , over 400,000 barrels of oily water mix have been recovered . As part of our response efforts , over 2,000 `` Vessels of Opportunity , '' independent vessel owners throughout the Gulf Coast are using their boats in a variety of oil recovery activities , including towing and deploying booms , supporting skimming and burn operations , finding and recovering tar balls and transporting general supplies and personnel . Also on the open water , with the Coast Guard 's approval , we are attacking the spill area with EPA-approved biodegradable dispersants , which are being applied from both planes and boats . Actions to protect the shoreline Near the shoreline , we are implementing oil spill response contingency plans to protect sensitive areas . According to the Coast Guard , the result is the most massive shoreline protection effort ever mounted . To support rapid response , we have made available a total of $ 175 million to Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , and Florida , as well as $ 70 million to assist these states in tourism promotion efforts . To date , we have deployed over 2.5 million feet of containment boom and over 3.0 million feet of sorbent boom in an effort to contain the spill and protect the coastal shoreline . The Department of Defense is helping to airlift boom to wherever it is currently needed across the Gulf coast . Highly mobile , shallow draft skimmers are also staged along the coast ready to attack the oil where it approaches the shoreline . Wildlife clean-up stations have been mobilized , and pre-impact baseline assessment and beach clean-up has been completed in many locations , Shoreline cleanup assessment teams -LRB- SCAT -RRB- are being deployed to affected areas to assess the type and quantity of oiling , so the most effective cleaning strategies can be rapidly applied Our largest single project commitment to date is to fund the $ 360 million cost of six berms in the Louisiana barrier islands project . On June 7 , we announced that we will make an immediate payment of $ 60 million to the state of Louisiana to allow the state to begin work on the project immediately . BP will make five additional $ 60 million payments when the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority of Louisiana certifies that the project has satisfied 20 % , 40 % , 60 % , 80 % and then 100 % completion milestones . The entire $ 360 million will be funded by the completion of the project . In addition , BP is committing up to $ 500 million to an open research program studying the impact of the Deepwater Horizon incident , and the associated response , on the marine and shoreline environment of the Gulf of Mexico . The program will investigate the impacts of the oil , dispersed oil , and dispersant on the ecosystems of the Gulf of Mexico and coastal States . Communication , community outreach , & engaging volunteers We are also working hard to keep the public and government officials around the country informed of what is happening . We are regularly briefing federal , state , and local officials , and we are holding town hall sessions to keep affected communities informed . BP is also supporting volunteer efforts related to shoreline clean-up . We have partnered with existing volunteer organizations in each of the states to ensure efficient registration and deployment of volunteers to the areas where they can help most . Untrained volunteers are not being used for any work involving contact or handling of oil , tar balls , or other hydrocarbon materials . This work is being carried out by trained personnel . In some cases , volunteers who receive more intensive training on the safe handling of hazardous materials and vessel operation for laying boom can become contract employees -LRB- Qualified Community Responders -RRB- . There are twenty-five BP community-outreach sites engaging , training , and preparing volunteers in Alabama , Florida , Louisiana and Mississippi . A phone line has also been established for potential volunteers to register their interest in assisting the response effort . We recognize that beyond the environmental impacts there are also economic impacts on many of the people who rely on the Gulf for their livelihood . BP will pay all necessary cleanup costs and all legitimate claims for other losses and damages caused by the spill . The BP claims process is integral to our commitment to do the right thing . To date , BP has already paid out over $ 90 million on the more than 56,000 claims that have been submitted . While the initial focus has been on individuals , we are now moving funds on an expedited basis to business owners with nearly $ 16 million to be paid out this week to businesses alone . To ensure the process is as fair and transparent as possible , an independent mediator will be appointed to provide an independent judgment in cases in which BP and a claimant are in disagreement . The mediator will be fully independent of BP , and claimants who disagree with the mediator 's judgment will retain all rights under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 either to seek reimbursement from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund or to file a claim in court . Thirty-two walk-in claims offices are open in Alabama , Florida , Louisiana and Mississippi . Our call center is operating 24 hours a day , seven days a week . We also have in place an on-line claims filing system . Nearly 700 people are assigned to handle the claims , including almost 600 experienced claims adjusters working in the impacted communities . Claim forms can be filled out in English , Spanish or Vietnamese , and Spanish and Vietnamese translators are available in many offices . We are striving to be efficient and fair and we look for guidance to the established laws , regulations and other information provided by the US Coast Guard , which oversees the process . We will continue adding people , offices and resources as necessary . The question we all want answered is `` What caused this tragic accident ? '' A full answer to this and other questions must await the outcome of multiple investigations now underway , including a joint investigation by the Departments of Homeland Security and Interior -LRB- Marine Board -RRB- and an internal investigation by BP itself . Our internal investigation was launched on April 21 , 2010 and is being conducted by BP 's Head of Group Safety and Operations . The investigation team 's work thus far suggests that this accident was brought about by the apparent failure of a number of processes , systems and equipment . While the team 's work is not done , it appears that there were multiple control mechanisms -- procedures and equipment -- in place that should have prevented this accident or reduced the impact of the spill . The investigation is focused on the following seven mechanisms : 1 . The cement that seals the reservoir from the well ; 2 . The casing system , which seals the well bore ; 3 . The pressure tests to confirm the well is sealed ; 4 . The execution of procedures to detect and control hydrocarbons in the well , including the use of the blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- and the maintenance of that BOP ; 5 . The BOP Emergency Disconnect System , which can be activated by pushing a button at multiple locations on the rig ; 6 . The automatic closure of the BOP after its connection is lost with the rig ; and ; 7 . Features in the BOP to allow ROVs to close the BOP and thereby seal the well at the seabed after a blowout . I understand people want a simple answer about why this happened and who is to blame . The truth , however , is that this is a complex accident , caused by an unprecedented combination of failures . A number of companies are involved , including BP , and it is simply too early to understand the cause . There is still extensive work to do . There are events that occurred on April 20 that were not foreseen by me or BP , but which we need to address in the future as lessons learned from this terrible tragedy . With ongoing investigations into the incident and continuing efforts to secure the well , we are in the early stages of trying to learn from this incident . But , as I see it , there are already lessons to be learned , and I wanted to share two of them with you today . Lesson 1 : Based on the events of April 20 and thereafter , we need to be better prepared for a subsea disaster . It is clear that our industry needs to significantly improve our ability to quickly address deep-sea accidents of this type and magnitude . The industry has made significant strides in preparedness measures before , and we will do so again . Following the Exxon Valdez oil spill , the industry recognized the need to enhance its capacity to address oil spills . The result was the MSRC , an independent , nonprofit company which maintains a significant inventory of vessels , equipment and trained personnel , complemented by a large contractor work force . The work of MSRC and other contractors has been central to the surface spill response efforts in the Gulf . But based on the events of April 20 and thereafter , it is clear that this is not enough . We now need to develop a similar capability for dealing with large undersea spills . We have no doubt that others in the industry will join us in efforts to develop this capability . Lesson 2 : Based on what happened on April 20 , we now know we need better safety technology . We in the industry have long relied on the blowout preventer as the principal piece of safety equipment . Yet , on this occasion it apparently failed , with disastrous consequences . We must use this incident as a case study to avoid a similar failure in the future . Since the April 20 explosion and fire , BP has been carefully evaluating the subsea blow-out preventers used in all our drilling operations worldwide , including the testing and maintenance procedures of the drilling contractors using the devices . We will participate in industry-wide efforts to improve the safety and reliability of subsea blowout preventers and deep water drilling practices . And we will work closely with other interested parties as we do so . We understand the seriousness of the situation . We know the world is watching us . No one will forget the 11 men who lost their lives in the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon . We hear and understand the concerns , frustrations , and fears that have been and will continue to be voiced . I understand that only actions and results , and not mere words , ultimately can give you the confidence you seek . We will be , and deserve to be , judged by our response . I give my pledge as leader of BP that we will not rest until we stop this well , mitigate the environmental impact of the spill and address economic claims in a responsible manner . No resource available to this company will be spared . We and the entire industry will learn from this terrible event and emerge from it stronger , smarter and safer .

AP NEW ORLEANS -- BP 's chairman said Friday that CEO Tony Hayward is on his way out as the company 's point man on the Gulf oil spill crisis , a day after Hayward enraged members of Congress by offering few answers about how the environmental disaster happened . Other BP officials , however , said the switch had been previously announced and will not take place for some time . BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg told Britain 's Sky News television on Friday that Hayward `` is now handing over the operations , the daily operations to -LRB- BP Managing Director -RRB- Bob Dudley . '' BP had said this month that Dudley would take over the long-term response to the spill once the leak was stopped , but millions of gallons continue to spew and that milestone remains months away . Svanberg 's statement sowed confusion , with other BP officials saying Hayward remains in charge . `` Until the acute part of this crisis is over , until the leak is capped , Tony Hayward is still very much in charge in the response of this crisis , '' BP spokesman Robert Wine said . Wine said Hayward `` will at some point hand over the management of the aftermath , '' and that Dudley is putting together a team that will `` make sure that the long-term impacts are met with as well as the legal , political repercussions from this crisis . '' There is no date for the handover , Wine said , because `` clearly the well is still leaking . '' The chairman 's comments overshadowed some positive news in the cleanup effort . Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen announced earlier Friday that a newly expanded containment system is capturing or incinerating more than 1 million gallons of oil daily , the first time it has approached its peak capacity . And the system will soon grow . By late June , the oil giant hopes it can keep nearly 90 percent of the flow from hitting the ocean . But the massive leak , set off by an oil rig explosion that killed 11 workers nearly two months ago , will not be stopped completely until at least August . BP has been hammered for its response , in part because of comments by Hayward that Gulf Coast residents horrified by the spill consider insensitive . Hayward shocked residents in slick-hit Louisiana by saying , `` I would like my life back . '' The Briton was quoted by the Times of London suggesting that Americans were particularly likely to file bogus claims -- a statement that gained significance Friday when a House committee said BP has paid less than 12 percent of claims submitted . President Barack Obama has suggested he would fire Hayward if he could . On Thursday , Hayward told lawmakers on a U.S. House investigations panel that he was out of the loop on decisions surrounding the blown well . Both Democrats and Republicans were infuriated when he asserted , `` I 'm not stonewalling . '' `` It is clear that Tony has made remarks that have upset people , '' said Svanberg , who made a misstep of his own this week when he said BP cares `` about the small people . '' But he added that Hayward `` is also a man who has probably been on 100 hours of TV time and maybe 500 . '' Dudley , an American-born oil man with more than 30 years in the industry , has been BP 's managing director since 2009 . His responsibilities include broad oversight of the company 's activities in the Americas and Asia , and earlier this month he was named head of the company 's disaster management unit . The company said in a June 4 news release that Dudley would manage the long-term day-to-day operations of the oil spill response `` once the spill was over , '' and that he would report to Hayward . BP said then that the shift was being planned because it wants Hayward to focus on running the company and Dudley to focus on managing `` the reputational impact , the financial obligations and restore trust and confidence of BP in America . '' Svanberg told Sky News that no matter who is heading BP 's oil spill response , `` as long as we do n't close the well and take care of this , there will be criticisms about many things . '' Many Gulf Coast residents and business owners who have been economically devastated by the spill are still waiting for compensation from BP . The House Judiciary Committee said data it has collected shows that BP has paid $ 71 million out of an estimated $ 600 million in outstanding claims as of Tuesday . It based the figure on data it collected from BP 's daily reports to the Coast Guard on claims and on discussions with BP . The committee said not one of the 717 claims for bodily injury , or the 175 claims for diminished home property value , have been paid . `` I remain concerned that BP is stiffing too many victims and shortchanging others , '' said the committee 's chairman , Michigan Democrat John Conyers . BP spokesman Scott Dean said in an e-mail that the company had paid out $ 95 million as of Friday , and it had written about 30,000 checks to settle about half the 63,000 claims it has received . The chief of the Independent Claims Facility -- the newly created office charged with distributing $ 20 billion in compensation from BP -- said a plan to handle the remaining damage claims will be in place in 30 to 45 days . Kenneth Feinberg said he hopes to have a program going forward that would provide payment within 30 to 60 days of someone submitting a new claim . Those pledges do n't mean much to Jerry Forte , who filed a business claim with BP more than a month ago and has n't seen a dime . His seafood processing business on the docks in Pass Christian , Miss. , used to bring in more than $ 1 million a year but now is practically shuttered . `` I 'm 99 percent down . They took all the shrimp boats . I do n't have anybody shrimping , '' Forte said Friday . `` My bank accounts are all going down to nothing because we 're spending it all on bills , just waiting on BP . '' The slow claims process is just one of many criticisms lawmakers and the public have had with BP 's response to the spill -- and many of the toughest complaints have been directed at Hayward . Rep. Bart Stupak , D-Mich . , said the CEO 's `` evasive and obstructive '' responses during Thursday 's congressional testimony further damaged BP 's reputation . `` Whether this change in Gulf leadership for BP will be productive remains to be seen , '' Stupak said in a statement . `` I expect that Mr. Dudley will take a much more cooperative and open approach to answering our questions and responding to the needs of the Gulf region . If not , his tenure will likely be as short lived as Mr. Hayward 's . '' Also Friday , an oil company that owns a quarter of BP 's blown-out oil well , blasted BP for `` reckless decisions and actions '' that led to the well 's explosion . Chairman and CEO Jim Hackett 's statement came after some elected officials said Anadarko should help pay for the massive cleanup and spill-related claims . Company spokesman John Christiansen said the comments were in response to `` a week 's worth of testimony '' and other information and data compiled on the disaster . The recent oil containment efforts are a rare bit of good news for BP and suggest that its engineers are getting better at trapping oil after a two-month string of failures with equipment that clogged , proved ineffective or was simply abandoned . `` This is a significant improvement moving forward , '' said Adm. Allen , the top federal official in charge of the spill . But there 's still much that can go wrong , from strained hoses breaking to ships colliding in the crowded seas over the leak . A bolt of lightning hit a drill ship this week , starting a fire and halting oil collection for hours . Stopping the leak will require a pair of relief wells that are not expected to be ready until August , although drilling has gone faster than expected . `` Certainly stopping it is the first step and the important thing anyone can do , '' said Ed Overton , a professor of environmental studies at Louisiana State University . `` Mother Nature can handle a lot of insult . It 's just when you pile it and pile it and pile it . '' Even if the new containment systems are a success , it could take months for those living along the Gulf Coast to notice any improvement . Experts say oil could be washing up for another six months , and it may take years for wildlife populations harmed by the spill to rebound to levels seen before the leak . To collect oil , BP now has a containment cap sitting over a well bore that is siphoning oil and gas to a drill ship on the ocean surface . Separate lines are pulling oil and gas from beneath a stack of pipes above the seafloor to a drilling rig where the flow is burned . Engineers have been working since Wednesday to bring that system to full speed . The ability to contain oil should grow as BP and the federal government move toward getting oil-trapping equipment in place that could better withstand Gulf hurricanes . In addition , BP wants to take off the existing cap in July and replace it with one of three possible designs that would offer a tighter seal and siphon oil to two ships waiting above . Cutting back on the flow would give cleanup crews some breathing room . For example , the Coast Guard has put an emphasis on skimming the heavy oil as close to the damaged well as possible , before it breaks into thousands of smaller , unpredictable slicks that meander with the weather and can elude or outpace skimmers as they are pushed to shore . But if the oil flow was substantially reduced , about 15 offshore skimmers could start chasing ribbons of oil -- sometimes as long as 60 miles -- that spread away from the leak site , said Coast Guard Rear Adm. James Watson , who coordinates day-to-day oil spill operations . Watson was n't ready to make any plans just yet . `` I 've tempered my optimism over time with this spill , '' he said .

AP Anadarko Petroleum Corp. , which owns a quarter of BP PLC 's blown-out oil well in the Gulf of Mexico , late Friday blasted BP `` reckless decisions and actions '' that led to the well 's explosion . In recent years , oil giant BP PLC used a well design that has been called `` risky '' by Congressional investigators in more than one out of three of its deepwater wells in the Gulf of Mexico , significantly more often than most peers , a Wall Street Journal analysis of federal data shows . `` The mounting evidence clearly demonstrates that this tragedy was preventable and the direct result of BP 's reckless decisions and actions , '' said Hackett in the statement . `` We recognize that ultimately we have obligations under federal law related to the oil spill , but will look to BP to continue to pay all legitimate claims as they have repeatedly stated that they will do . '' The design was used on the well that exploded in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20 , killing 11 workers and causing America 's worst offshore oil spill . The only other major well design , which is more expensive , includes more safeguards against a natural-gas blowout of the kind that destroyed the Deepwater Horizon . A Wall Street Journal analysis of records provided by the U.S. Minerals Management Service shows that BP used the less costly design -- called `` long string '' -- on 35 percent of its deepwater wells since July 2003 , the earliest date the well-design data were available . Anadarko used it on 42 percent of its deepwater Gulf wells , though it says it does n't do so in wells of the type drilled by BP . BP chief executive officer Tony Hayward said in a statement that the company strongly disagreed with the allegations `` These allegations will neither distract the company 's focus on stopping the leak nor alter our commitment to restore the Gulf coast , '' Hayward said . `` Other parties besides BP may be responsible for costs and liabilities arising from the oil spill , and we expect those parties to live up to their obligations . '' Both companies used the design much more often , on average , than other major Gulf drillers . Out of 218 deepwater wells in the Gulf drilled since July 2003 , 26 percent used the long-string design . It derives its name from its use of a single , long `` string '' of pipe from the sea floor to the bottom of the well . Other big drillers use long-string design less frequently than BP , according to the Journal 's data analysis . Royal Dutch Shell PLC used long string designs on 8 percent of its wells and Chevron Corp. on 15 percent . Australian firm BHP Billiton PLC used long string on 4 percent of its wells .

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated . SEAN HANNITY , HOST : Today on Capitol Hill BP stood for `` bully pulpit '' as the giant CEO Tony Hayward gave his first testimony on the disaster in the Gulf . And Democrats were not about to let this moment in the spotlight slip away without doing a little bit of grand standing . CONGRESSMAN HENRY WAXMAN , D-CALIF . : It 's clear to me that you do n't want to answer our questions . I 'm just amazed at this testimony , Mr. Hayward . You 're not taking responsibility . You 're kicking the can down the road . CONGRESSWOMAN JAN SCHAKOWSKY , D-ILL . : Simple fact remains that if BP had thought more about the residents , as these widows said and the workers -- as these widows said , rather than the already exorbitant profits of its shareholders , we would not be here today . CONGRESSMAN BART STUPAK , D-MICH . : In your opening statement you said as long as you are CEO of BP -- CEO of BP -- these things would occur . Do you expect to be CEO of BP much longer ? HANNITY : All right , when Hayward was actually afforded the opportunity to speak he sent this message to you , the American people . TONY HAYWARD , BP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER : I 've been to the Gulf Coast . I 've met with fishermen , business owners and families . I understand what they 're going through . And I promised them , as I 'm promising you , that we will make this right . HANNITY : Now Hayward 's testimony comes one day removed from BP 's announcement that the company would set aside $ 20 billion in a compensation fund . As he noted in his remarks today , it was a move that BP had planned to make all along . But in order to score cheap political points , the White House yesterday attempted to spin all of this as if the fund was the administration 's idea . Now some members of Congress have spoken out again the administration 's bullying of a private corporation and so has U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron . He reportedly voiced his concerns during a phone call with the anointed one , President Obama , saying , quote , `` I 'm not out to wreck BP . '' It 's clear the president and the radical environmentalists in his administration do n't feel the same way . And joining me now with more is the former speaker of the House , Fox News contributor , co-producer of the documentary , `` Nine Days That Changed the World , '' former speaker , Newt Gingrich . NEWT GINGRICH , FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE : Good to be with you . HANNITY : All right . First of all , what do you make of the -- it really is frustrating to me because none of this grandstanding is going to help plug the damn hole . And none of this is going to clean up the Gulf , save jobs , save tourism , fishing . So I found this whole exercise today frankly obnoxious and I think it has to be related to the campaign 138 days from now . GINGRICH : Well , I -- look , there 's so many different things wrong right now that it 's a little hard to put them all on one TV show . GINGRICH : By what -- yes , I mean -- well , just to start with this compensation fund . Is this an effort by BP to avoid potentially lawsuits of much more money ? How did they arrive at $ 20 billion ? Was Obama the person who picked $ 20 billion ? How would he know ? Should it have been $ 10 billion or $ 40 billion ? Is the president really going to appoint a political crony to run this compensation fund ? I mean , has America degenerated into a Venezuelan-style country where the leader gets to pick somebody to hand out $ 20 billion and we think that 's not going to be corrupt ? All of this is outside the law . We have bank -- we have laws for suits that the Congress could create and the president could sign ; a bill that have some kind of compensation process . But to have it handled by press release ? This is the kind of stuff that 's going to convince every major business in the world to avoid the United States , to invest outside the United States because our political class seems to have lost any sense of balance and any sense of the rule of law . HANNITY : If we want stay just technically for a second on the law and stay away from the politics for a minute , we already have a law . It 's the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 . And it very specifically says that -- that the company responsible will be responsible and will have liability for all removal costs . And then they have a cap of 75 million unless there 's some type of negligence proven . So BP did not have to do this . And there 's questions about whether or not in the end they 're going to be able to fund all this or go bankrupt . GINGRICH : Well , but first of all I think you have to assume that BP is going to be proven negligent . This was a terrible mistake . And it 's clearly BP 's fault . HANNITY : Well , but the words in the law are gross negligence and willful misconduct . But every step of the way our federal government had to approve everything that BP was doing . GINGRICH : OK , yes , but Sean , you know , I spent three years at Tulane in New Orleans . My younger daughter Jackie Kushner was born in New Orleans . GINGRICH : Would you like to go to -- would you like to go to a jury trial in Louisiana right now as BP and have the U.S. attorney -- have the U.S. attorney charge you with gross negligence ? Would you like to bet on your odds of getting off ? They 're going to -- they 're going to lose this . HANNITY : They probably would . But we 've got to be fair and objective here . And the fair objective is , is that the government approved the lease . The government has an inspection process which we 've since realized they 've ignored . The government approved every action that they took out there in the Gulf . Gross negligence would also -- or malfeasance would also -- that burden would be on the government , too , would it not ? The government would have to prove it . But look , I believe both bureaucracies have been incompetent . I believe the BP bureaucracy was incompetent . GINGRICH : And has been every -- and has been every single day since the disaster . I believe the United States government is incompetent and has been every single day since the disaster . If you listen to Governor Jindal , he -- or you listen to James Carville , a Democrat -- they 're vivid in their description of how bad the government has been . I think the president is desperately playing PR games but he 's killing jobs while he does it . He killed jobs the other day , by putting in a freeze that was totally unnecessary on current activity in the Gulf . They had 30,000 wells in the Gulf . They 've had one problem in the last -- since World War II out of 30,000 wells . The president is going to kill the industry in Louisiana if he 's not careful . You have -- in fact it turned out today in the lead editorial in the Wall Street Journal that the experts the White House claimed favored their position have unanimously repudiated it and said that it 's false , they did n't do it , and in fact , they think this makes it more dangerous because it sends all of the people out of the Gulf who know what they 're doing . HANNITY : Look , and for my mind , there 's plenty of time for finger - pointing . There 's plenty of time for blaming . There 's going to be plenty of time for lawsuits . But we 're not -- even to this stage , 60 days into this , we are not taking the action that is necessary to help solve the problem . If you look at the front cover of Drudge , it links to a story `` Against Governor Jindal 's wishes , crude sucking barges were stopped by our Coast Guard . '' We still have not put a lift on the Jones Act and we still have 13 countries that we have now learned from three days in after the explosion that offered help , that we have n't accepted their help and assistance for this . That seems to me -- our priorities seem all screwed up here . And that 's what 's frustrating . GINGRICH : I think -- I think the Obama administration handling of phase II . Phase I is a disaster which is BP 's fault . Phase II is the cleanup . I think the Obama administration has handled this worse and more incompetently than any major crisis I can remember in recent American history . Everything you just said is true . I have a number of friends in Louisiana who 've been keeping me briefed . And their level of anger at this administration is almost unspeakable . Because they see things like , the Corps of Engineers blocking the Coast Guard . It turns out that building berms to block the oil was in the Coast Guard 's original plan . And yet the Corps of Engineers has blocked another branch of the federal government . The point you just made , many foreign countries offered to loan us technical skills . It was n't taken advantage of . The point I just made : You look at the president 's commission , there is no deep drilling expert on the entire commission . GINGRICH : And the president has this -- he has an affectation or an affection for academic professors who write books , but he does n't understand about the real world and real effectiveness . HANNITY : Do you agree with me that I think the biggest problem we have here is that the environmental movement that pushed us offshore because we could n't drill in ANWR or in shallower waters -- the environmental movement that would n't allow us to burn which was pre-approved , that would n't allow chemical disbursements , we could n't put aside our political differences to allow the Dutch skimmers that would have taken out 20,000 tons of sludge a day , probably from the first week moving forward . Do you think that they 're controlling everything here ? Do you think there 's another hidden agenda here that the president is so beholden to them that he does n't -- GINGRICH : I think he 's -- I think this is just pure incompetence . GINGRICH : I do n't think it 's an agenda . I think it 's incompetence . Well , this is -- this is incompetence that we will pay for for decades . All right , we 'll take a break . I have a lot of questions for you when we get back . HANNITY : And we continue now with former Speaker of the HouseNewt Gingrich . Mr. Speaker , there is -- we have the show on Capitol Hill today . And Joe Barton , congressman , said you know what ? This is a shakedown . We have a lot of other congressmen , you know , debating whether or not the White House is exceeding their constitutional authority by demanding that BP put all this money in escrow when in fact we have a law in place . Does that question mean anything to you ? GINGRICH : Well , sure it does . I think the reports I 've seen so far , that the president 's claiming that he was responsible for this . BP is claiming they were going to do it anyway . But let 's say the president was responsible . By what right does a politician decide that $ 20 billion is the right number ? Why was n't it 30 or 40 ? HANNITY : Well , that 's a down payment . HANNITY : They left open the door . It 's going to be a heck of a lot more . GINGRICH : I think it will be a lot more . But I just think the idea that if the president is directly engaged in extorting money from a company , this is like General Motors and Chrysler where the administration basically stole money from the creditors who own stock and who had bonds to give that money to their union allies . And what it 's going to -- what it says to the world is , be very careful about investing in the United States because the political class may take the money away from you if the trial lawyers do n't get it first . I think that kills more jobs . Makes it harder to recover . HANNITY : Look , we 're 138 days out of an election . I think this is going to be a huge political liability for the president and all those people that have supported him all along the way since he 's been elected in 2008 . If you had to go back to day one in all of this , and I 'm not saying 20\\/20 hindsight , what would you have done ? If you were in charge and if you were put in charge tomorrow , what would you do ? Because obviously it 'd be a little bit different . GINGRICH : Look , look . Those are two totally different situations . What the president should have done at the end of the first week was assign people to reach out across the planet to find every technical expert available on two topics . One is , what do you do about capping the well and stopping the oil flow ? And the other is , what do you do about cleanups ? Now the first thing you 'll discover is most of the experts are in the private sector , which of course if you are a left-wing Democrat it 's very hard to imagine . So you 've actually have to reach out to all the people who actually do this work for a living because they 're the only people with real experience . The second thing I would do is you 'd call as many experts as you could to a meeting in Washington . You 'd have Shell executives who 17 years ago used super tankers to clean up the Middle East . You would have the Dutch facilities , you 'd have the Norwegian and Swedish facilities , you have the Japanese facilities . You get them all in a room and you say , `` We need a plan to throw everything we can to cleaning up the oil so it does n't reach the shore . '' And you go to overkill . You do more than you need do to stop the oil from coming back into the United States and hitting the shore . The next you do is you order the Corps of Engineers to get out of the way . When you realize the Corps of Engineers took longer to do an environmental assessment of buildings some islands , barrier islands , than it took the oil to reach shore . I mean if your environmental assessment takes longer than it takes to damage the environment , that 's a bureaucracy that 's stupid beyond belief . GINGRICH : And it 's a good argument for fundamentally overhauling the Corps of Engineers . So there were a number of action items that could have been done from day one . And you would have integrated , frankly , Governor Jindal in the decision-process . And the president should have been having a video conference every morning with the Gulf Coast governors to get -- and eyes on assessment by the people elected by the local community . HANNITY : What would you do now ? I mean at this point , this late in the game , oil coming onshore , the hole has still not been plugged , where -- would you start there then at this moment ? GINGRICH : You 've got to now , I think , good move in parallel on three fronts . You 've got to do whatever it takes to plug the hole and you 've got to do them in parallel . You ca n't do one thing and then wait a week and do another thing and then wait a week and do another thing . You say , `` Tell me every possible device we could use . Get all of them here simultaneously . '' Even though that means you 're wasting some money get them here at once and let 's go at it head-on as fast as we can the way we fought World War II , which is to throw everything at a problem until you drown it . The second you got to do , call the countries that have given you ideas and opportunities and say yes , let 's stop the oil still coming out from getting to the beaches . And most of the oil , remember , is still offshore and you could be cleaning it up . HANNITY : All right , Mr. Speaker , appreciate you being with us . I ca n't believe the president still does n't seem to get . -- Watch `` Hannity '' weeknights at 9 p.m. ET ! Content and Programming Copyright 2010 Fox News Network , Inc. .

"}, {"uid": "697", "dct": "2010-06-18", "dates": [null, null], "text": "NEW ORLEANS -- NEW ORLEANS -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Vast amounts of natural gas contained in crude escaping from the blown Gulf of Mexico oil well could pose a serious threat to marine life by creating `` dead zones '' where oxygen is so depleted that nothing lives . The danger presented by the methane has been largely overlooked , with early efforts to monitor the oil spill focusing on the more toxic components of oil . But scientists are increasingly worried about the gas that can suffocate sea creatures in high concentrations . At least 4.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas -- and possibly almost twice that amount -- have leaked since April 20 . That 's based on estimates from the U.S. Geological Survey 's `` flow team '' that 2,900 cubic feet of natural gas are escaping for every barrel of oil . `` This is the most vigorous methane eruption in modern human history , '' said John Kessler , a Texas A&M University oceanographer . Scientists , including those working with the flow team , estimate that methane makes up between 40 percent and 70 percent of what is spilling into the Gulf . Small microbes that live in the sea have been feeding on the oil and natural gas in the water and are consuming larger quantities of oxygen , which they need to digest food . As they draw more oxygen from the water , it creates two problems . When oxygen levels drop low enough , the breakdown of oil grinds to a halt ; and as it is depleted in the water , most life ca n't be sustained . Methane is a colorless , odorless and flammable substance that is a major component in the natural gas used to heat people 's homes . Petroleum engineers typically burn off excess gas attached to crude before the oil is shipped off to the refinery . That 's exactly what BP is doing with gas it started capturing from the leak 15 days ago . A BP spokesman said the company was burning about 30 million cubic feet of natural gas daily on a ship at the surface , adding up to about 450 million cubic feet since the containment effort started . But that figure does not account for gas that eluded containment efforts and wound up in the water , leaving behind huge amounts of methane . Scientists are still trying to determine how it could damage the Gulf and its creatures . The high-pressure seafloor leak is spewing like a fire hose , causing oil and gas to dissolve into tiny droplets that are less likely to rise to the surface . Adding to the effect , more than a million gallons of chemical dispersants have been pumped into the gusher by BP -- a bid to stop oil from reaching the coast that comes at the expense of the Gulf 's deeper waters . The National Science Foundation funded research on methane in the Gulf amid concerns about the depths of the oil plume and questions what role natural gas was playing in keeping the oil below the surface , said David Garrison , a program director in the federal agency who specializes in biological oceanography . `` This has the potential to harm the ecosystem in ways that we do n't know , '' Garrison said . `` It 's a complex problem . '' In early June , a research team led by Samantha Joye of the Institute of Undersea Research and Technology at the University of Georgia investigated a 15-mile-long plume drifting southwest from the leak site . They said they found methane concentrations up to 10,000 times higher than normal , and oxygen levels depleted by 40 percent or more . The scientists found that some parts of the plume had oxygen concentrations just shy of the level that tips ocean waters into the category of `` dead zone '' -- a region uninhabitable to fish , crabs , shrimp and other marine creatures . Kessler has encountered similar findings . Since he began his on-site research on Saturday , he said he has already found oxygen depletions of between 2 percent and 30 percent in waters 1,000 feet deep . Shallow waters are normally more susceptible to oxygen depletion . Because it is being found in such deep waters , both Kessler and Joye do not know what is causing the depletion and what the impact could be in the long - or short-term . In an e-mail , Joye called her findings `` the most bizarre looking oxygen profiles I have ever seen anywhere . '' Representatives of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration acknowledged that so much methane in the water could draw down oxygen levels and slow the breakdown of oil in the Gulf , but cautioned that research was still under way to understand the ramifications . `` We have n't seen any long-term changes or trends at this point , '' said Robert Haddad , chief of the agency 's assessment and restoration division . Haddad said early efforts to monitor the spill had focused largely on the more toxic components of oil . However , as new data comes in , he said NOAA and other federal agencies will get a more accurate read on methane concentrations and the effects . `` The question is what 's going on in the deeper , colder parts of the ocean , '' he said . `` Are the -LRB- methane -RRB- concentrations going to overcome the amount of available oxygen ? We want to make sure we 're not overloading the system . '' BP spokesman Mark Proegler disputed Joye 's suggestion that the Gulf 's deep waters contain large amounts of methane , noting that water samples taken by BP and federal agencies have shown minimal underwater oil outside the spill 's vicinity . `` The gas that escapes , what we do n't flare , goes up to the surface and is gone , '' he said .

The company pledged to set aside $ 20 billion to help spill victims , and the containment system at the site of the crippled well was capturing or burning increasing amounts of oil . Instead , the company faced renewed anger Saturday after reports that chief executive Tony Hayward had jetted back to England to attend an exclusive yachting competition . Hayward took Saturday off to see his 52-foot yacht `` Bob '' compete in a race around the Isle of Wight off southern England . It was a good day for sailing -- breezy and about 68 degrees -- but anger simmered on the steamy Gulf Coast , where crude oil is still gushing from a blown-out well . `` Man , that ai n't right . None of us can even go out fishing , and he 's at the yacht races , '' said Bobby Pitre , 33 , who runs a tattoo shop in Larose , La. `` I wish we could get a day off from the oil , too . '' BP spokespeople rushed to defend Hayward , who has drawn biting criticism as the public face of BP PLC 's halting efforts to stop the spill . Company spokesman Robert Wine said the break is the first for Hayward since the Deepwater Horizon rig that BP was leasing exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers and setting off the undersea gusher . `` He 's spending a few hours with his family at a weekend . I 'm sure that everyone would understand that , '' Wine said . He noted Hayward is a well known as a fan of the J.P. Morgan Asset Management Round the Island Race , one of the world 's largest , which attracts more than 1,700 boats and 16,000 sailors as famous yachtsmen compete with wealthy amateurs in a 50-nautical mile course . `` Bob '' finished fourth in its group . It was not clear whether Hayward took part in the race or attended as a spectator . The boat , made 10 years ago by the Annapolis , Md.-based boatbuilder Farr Yacht Design , lists for nearly $ 700,000 . Hayward had already angered many in the U.S. when he was quoted in the Times of London as suggesting that Americans were particularly likely to file bogus claims for compensation from the spill . He later shocked Louisiana residents by telling them that no one wanted to resolve the crisis as badly as he did because `` I 'd like my life back . '' Ronnie Kennier , a 49-year-old oysterman from Empire , La. , said Hayward 's day among the sailboats showed once again just how out of touch BP executives are with the suffering along the Gulf . `` He wanted to get his life back , '' Kennier said . `` I guess he got it . '' Meanwhile , President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden enjoyed a round of golf Saturday near Washington , something they 've done on other weekends since the spill and a fact not lost on users of social networking sites . Twitter feeds compared Obama and Biden 's golfing to Hayward 's yachting , lumping them together as diversions of privileged people who should be paying more attention to the spill . `` Our government , the executives at BP , it looks like they decide to worry about it later , '' said Capt. Dwayne Price , a charter fisherman in Grand Isle , La. . White House officials have struggled to counter criticism of Obama 's handling of the disaster . An Associated Press-GfK poll released Tuesday showed 52 percent now disapprove of Obama 's handling of the spill , up significantly from last month . About 50 miles off Louisiana 's coast , a newly expanded containment system is capturing or incinerating more than 1 million gallons of oil daily , the first time it has approached its peak capacity , according to the Coast Guard . BP hopes that by late June it will keep nearly 90 percent of the flow from the broken pipe from hitting the ocean . More than 120 million gallons have leaked already , according to the most pessimistic federal daily flow rate estimates . Oil has been washing up from Louisiana to Florida , killing birds and fish , coating marshes and wetlands and covering pristine beaches with tar balls and oily debris . A pair of relief wells considered the best chance at a permanent fix wo n't be completed until August . BP has put many idled commercial fishermen to work on the cleanup . Sai Stiffler spent Saturday repairing his shrimp boat at Delta Marina in Empire , La. , on a hot and muggy day . He signed up for BP 's `` vessel of opportunity '' program but has n't been hired , and he was not pleased that Obama was playing golf and BP 's CEO was at a yacht race while his life is on hold .

'' BP spokespeople rushed to defend Hayward , who has drawn withering criticism as the public face of BP 's halting efforts to stop the worst oil spill in U.S. history . Spokeswoman Sheila Williams said Hayward took a break from overseeing BP efforts to stem the undersea gusher in Gulf of Mexico so he could watch his boat `` Bob '' participate in the J.P. Morgan Asset Management Round the Island Race . The 52-foot yacht is made by the Annapolis , Maryland-based boat builder Farr Yacht Design . The annual one-day race is one of the world 's largest , attracting more than 1,700 boats and 16,000 sailors as world-renown yachtsmen compete with wealthy amateurs in the 50-nautical mile course around the island . Robert Wine , a BP spokesman at the company 's Houston headquarters , said it was the first break that Hayward has had since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers and setting off the undersea oil gusher . `` He 's spending a few hours with his family at a weekend . I 'm sure that everyone would understand that , '' Wine said Saturday . `` He will be back to deal with the response . It does n't detract from that at all . '' Wine described the race as `` one of the biggest sailing events in the world and he 's well known to have a keen interest in it . '' He said Hayward will be returning to the United States , though it 's unclear when . Hayward 's boat finished fourth in its class . Still , hobnobbing with millionaires and their yachts is likely to be a hard sell in the Gulf , which is struggling to deal with up to 120 million gallons of oil that have escaped from the blown-out well . Oil has been washing up along the Gulf Coast from Louisiana to Florida , killing birds and fish , coating delicate marshes and wetlands and covering pristine beaches with tar balls . Hayward already angered many in the U.S. when he was quoted in the Times of London as suggesting that Americans were particularly likely to file bogus claims . He later shocked residents in Louisiana by telling them that no one wanted to resolve the crisis as badly as he did because `` I 'd like my life back . '' A pair of relief wells that wo n't be done until August is the best bet to stop the massive spill . By late June , the oil giant hopes it can keep nearly 90 percent of the flow from the broken pipe from hitting the ocean . Just minutes after reports about Hayward emerged Saturday , the issue became a hot topic on social networking sites , with people on Twitter passing along the news and reacting to it every few seconds . Some comments called the move `` mindboggling '' while others noted he had gotten his life back -- while Gulf residents had not . British environmental groups immediately slammed Hayward 's outing . Charlie Kronick of Greenpeace said Hayward was `` rubbing salt into the wounds '' of Gulf residents whose livelihoods have been wrecked by the disaster . `` Clearly it is incredibly insulting for him to be sailing in the Isle of Wight , '' he said . Hugh Walding of Friends of the Earth said Hayward 's choice of venue was sure to arouse anger . `` I 'm sure that this will be seen as yet another public relations disaster , '' Walding said . On Thursday , Hayward told lawmakers on a U.S. House investigations panel that he was out of the loop on decisions surrounding the blown well . Both Democrats and Republicans were infuriated when he asserted , `` I 'm not stonewalling . '' The next day , BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg seemed to suggest that Hayward was being withdrawn from the front line of the oil spill response , although his comments were later qualified . `` It is clear that Tony has made remarks that have upset people , '' Svanberg told Sky News television , adding that Hayward was `` now handing over '' daily operations to BP Managing Director Bob Dudley . Williams said Svanberg was misunderstood and that only a transition to Dudley , an American with 30 years in the oil business , had begun . The Associated Press contributed to this report .

AP A coalition of environmental groups and scientists is calling on President Obama to fire Interior Secretary Ken Salazar for his `` failed policies '' that it says led to the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion in April that killed 11 workers and set off the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that BP and the government is struggling to contain . The conservation group , WildEarth Guardians , has mobilized 100 other environmental groups and scientists to sign a letter to the president , saying Salazar , `` like his predecessors in the George W. Bush administration , has failed to place science above politics and prioritize federal environmental protections above accommodations for ecologically harmful industries . '' The letter noted that some of the groups opposed Salazar 's nomination last year because of his `` flawed record on natural resource issues . '' `` The intervening 16 months , unfortunately , have confirmed that Mr. Salazar will not fulfill your administration 's promises to safeguard the environment in this country or globally , '' the letter reads . `` Rather , Mr. Salazar has either embraced or failed to reform many of the destructive policies of the previous administration . '' The Interior Department responded with a statement that did n't address the letter or its call for Salazar to step down . `` The secretary is devoting 100 percent of his time to the fight to protect the Gulf Coast from BP 's oil spill and will not rest until the leak is stopped , the affected communities are made whole , and the Gulf Coast is restored , '' Interior spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff said in a written statement . The White House did not respond to a request for comment . Salazar has faced sharp criticism over the government 's failures in overseeing offshore oil drilling and he has acknowledged his department had been lax in holding industry accountable . Salazar has vowed to reform the Minerals Management Service , which has drawn fire for allowing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico without requiring oil companies to provide necessary permits from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , or the NOAA . Salazar has proposed eliminating the MMS and replacing it with two bureaus and a revenue collections office . But that has n't satisfied his critics , who argue that Salazar has failed to live up to his pledge to return transparency and ethics within all branches at the department when he took control . The coalition notes that Salazar approved plans for drilling in the Artic sea by Shell Oil late last year despite warnings from the NOAA that further research regarding oil spill risk was needed . `` In his approval of off-shore drilling , whether in the Gulf , Artic or elsewhere , Ken Salazar has demonstrated a wide gap between his words and actions , '' the letter read . `` That is why the American public can not be expected to believe the promise he made to Congress on May 18 , 2010 that he will ` clean up ' MMS , '' the letter continued . `` This is a promise he made to the American public almost a year and a half ago and utterly failed to fulfill .

I have authorized the mobilization of up to 17,500 National Guard troops in the four states that are -- that are most affected . We have a standing offer . If there 's anything people think we can do , we absolutely will do it , '' Gates said . The spill is causing 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil to contaminate the Gulf of Mexico each day . Over 62 days , that 's anywhere from 2.1 million to 3.72 million gallons . But one scientist said it would take the spill more than 700 million years for the amount of oil in the Gulf to equal the amount of water -- about 650 quadrillion gallons . `` This is not the death of the Gulf of Mexico , '' George Crozier , director of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab , told the Mobile -LRB- Ala. -RRB- Press-Register . `` If you went Gulf-wide with this and stirred it up in the Gulf of Mexico , I 'm not sure we could find it . '' BP has also paid out $ 104 million to Gulf residents harmed as a result of the spill . It has also established a $ 20 billion fund , which Rep. Joe Barton , R-Texas , likened to a White House `` shakedown '' before retracting his comment in the face of outrage among his congressional caucus and others . Democrats have already put Barton 's apology to BP into advertising for its midterm elections this fall . The Associated Press contributed to this report .

Joe Barton asks a question at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , on Capitol Hill . Reuters Rep. Joe Barton 's apology to BP Chief Tony Hayward for what he called a White House `` shakedown '' for demanding a $ 20 billion fund for damage claims has turned into a political football that Democrats are hoping to exploit . Republicans were deeply embarrassed by Barton 's apology to BP during a House hearing Thursday , demanding that the ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee retract his mea culpa or lose his seniority . Barton returned to the committee room and did just that . But like the spill in the Gulf of Mexico , the lid was blown , and Republicans have been in damage control ever since . `` I could n't disagree with Joe Barton more . B.P. does n't need an apology . They need to apologize to us , and they certainly need to cover all the costs of the cleanup and the economic damages as well . And they 're going -- they 're going to , '' said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky . Immediately after Barton 's remarks , the Democratic National Committee created a television ad showing Barton making his apology while the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ran ads on Facebook . White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel kept up the assault on Sunday . `` You can say it 's a political gift for us , and it is , '' Emanuel told ABC 's `` This Week . '' `` That 's not a political gaffe . Those were prepared remarks . That is a philosophy . That is an approach to what they see . They see the aggrieved party here is BP , not the fishermen . '' Emanuel went further , linking Barton to any number of Republican candidates who think that `` government is the problem . '' `` This is not just one person . Rand Paul , running for Senate in Kentucky , what did he say ? He said the way BP was being treated was un-American , '' Emanuel said . `` Other members of the Republican leadership have come to the defense of BP and attacked the administration for forcing them to set up an escrow account and fund it to the level of $ 20 billion . '' Emanuel acknowledged that the Minerals Management Service , an agency within the Department of Interior , was lax in regulating the oil giant . Nonetheless , he said , `` I think what Joe Barton did is remind the American people , in case they forgot , this is how the Republicans would govern . '' Republicans , however , were not ready to lie down and take the onslaught . McConnell said Obama is one of the largest recipients of BP donations . He accused the administration of exploiting the spill to pass energy legislation . McConnell added that the Democratic philosophy is that government is too big to fail . `` The president has been advocating expansion of government across the board in virtually every area . If you 're going to advocate expansion of the government , then you look not so good when the government you 're already in charge of does n't function very well , '' he said . `` You know , the president himself is in charge of developing a contingency plan to deal with oil spills . What happened to it ? We know there are skimmers around the world that could be sent here . The administration has a role to play in this and they have n't done a very good job so far , '' McConnell added . Sen. Lisa Murkowski , R-Alaska , also called Barton 's comment `` absolutely wrong , '' but warned against the administration `` running with this as the issue . '' `` Let 's not forget , we had 11 people die , and we have an environmental disaster unfolding and an economic disaster unfolding . Let 's not be distracted by saying , you know , Joe Barton made this gaffe or this inappropriate comment . Let 's focus on what we need to do , which is getting relief to the Gulf , making sure that they have every asset possible , and making sure we have a claims compensation system that works for them , '' she said on CNN . With the glare of the spotlight on Barton 's words , Ken Feinberg , the man in charge of administering the $ 20 billion escrow fund for local businesses affected by the spill , suggested that the apology lacks merit to begin with . `` I do n't think it 's a shakedown ... But I do n't think it helps to politicize this program . These people in the Gulf are in desperate straits , '' Feinberg said , noting that to its credit , BP was cooperating in paying out claims , having distributed $ 100 million so far . Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour , a Republican , added that the $ 20 billion is being set aside in $ 5 billion increments , which protects BP from having to give up so much working capital it ca n't carry out its pledge to clean up the Gulf . `` It 's good for BP . BP -- that was to their advantage to get taken out of the claims business . The $ 20 billion , once it was done where BP could continue to operate as a going concern and pay their bills that they owe Louisiana , Mississippi , and Florida and Alabama , that also was a good deal for BP , '' said Barbour , who appeared with Feinberg on NBC 's '' Meet the Press . '' Barbour said that while he does n't think Barton 's apology was `` accurate , '' he does think the administration is going to try to redirect attention toward `` anything but this oil spill . '' `` They want to change the subject . And I can understand that , '' he said . Barbour added that he 's not afraid of being accused of being too close to the oil company now known for the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history . `` You 're looking at a guy that has already told you 15 times today BP is responsible to pay every penny of this . We expect them to pay every penny of this . We 're going to demand they pay every penny of this .

It is clear that , from the beginning , BP has not been straightforward with the government or the American people about the true size of this spill , '' Markey said in a statement released with the document . `` BP needs to tell us what it will do if the wellbore is compromised and 100,000 barrels per day of oil spills into the ocean .

But at the same time , the oil sure did n't bother some beachgoers in Alabama . `` I was in the water two hours yesterday , '' said Robert Theil , a French visitor to Orange Beach , as his sister acted as translator . `` I 'm not worried . It would take a lot before it could hurt you . '' Health officials say there seems to be little reason to worry at this point . But some note that health effects months or years from now remain a question mark , particularly for the workers who are in the thick of it , cleaning up oil from the BP spill in the Gulf . Public health officials and scientists will take up the topic at a two-day meeting beginning Tuesday in New Orleans , organized by the Institute of Medicine at the request of the Department of Health and Human Services . The group will also talk about how best to watch for any potential problems . HHS has already set aside $ 10 million to study cleanup workers and Gulf residents over time . In the meantime , some questions and answers : Q : Has anyone gotten sick from the oil spilled in the Gulf ? A : Yes , there have been reports of illnesses , but relatively few among people not involved in the spill cleanup . Most of the reported illnesses were related to odors or fumes . Almost all were mild and temporary , and many were in early May , within the first few weeks of the April 20 explosion . The reports are based on a doctor 's assessment , not on lab testing . All but 35 of the 109 spill-related illnesses in Louisiana have been workers . Alabama has 29 reports of illnesses that might be related to the spill , and Florida and Mississippi have had none . Q : So , what about the air ? It safe to breathe ? A : For those along the coast , for the most part , yes . The Environmental Protection Agency has been monitoring the air since shortly after the spill ; readings posted Friday show mostly good air quality . Some earlier results have found low levels of pollutants that can cause temporary problems like headaches , nausea or irritation of the eyes , nose and throat . The pollutants have periodically pushed an industrial smell onshore in some place -- one beachgoer compared it to a machine shop . But an oily odor does not necessarily mean it 's harmful , said LuAnn White , director of Tulane University 's Center for Applied Environmental Public Health . Officials continue to test . `` We are still concerned , '' said John Howard , director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health . And out on the water , tests have detected vapors from benzene , one of the chemicals in the oil that scientists say can cause cancer . The good news is that benzene can evaporate or burn off quickly , so the concentrations are much lower toward land . Q : What about all those tar balls and splotches of oil on some beaches ? A : It 's best to avoid them . Oil on bare skin should be washed off as soon as possible , health officials say . Soap and water , baby oil or petroleum jelly are the best way to remove it . Longer contact can cause skin to redden , swell and burn . The problem can get worse if the skin is exposed to the sun . White compared it to spilling motor oil on your hands . `` Are you going to get sick ? But do you want to do it ? I do n't think so , '' she said . But another expert cautioned that some chemicals in the oil and dispersants used in the cleanup can be easily absorbed through the skin . `` People are n't paying close attention like they should , '' said Robert Herrick , an industrial hygiene expert at the Harvard School of Public Health . Q : Can I swim in it ? A : Better not . You could get oil on your skin , and there 's the added possibility of accidentally swallowing whatever 's in the water . Louisiana beaches have been closed in Grande Isle and Fourchon , but because of cleanup efforts , not for health reasons . Alabama late last week lifted swimming advisories for beaches in Mobile County , but they remain in place for Baldwin County , near Florida . Q : Are people along the Gulf coast worried they 'll get sick ? A : Some are . There apparently have n't been any surveys asking Gulf residents if they 're concerned about their health . But calls to poison control centers have been lower than expected , and officials in some Gulf states say they 've heard more angst over the impacts on the environment and local business than about health . `` I look at it this way : It 's from the Earth . If you drank it in your drinking water every day it would hurt you . But spend a week in the water on vacation and it 's not going to , '' said Elaine Fox , who visited Orange Beach , Ala. , with a group from Family Church in West Monroe , La. . She spent time photographing her pregnant daughter-in-law Christi Fox , 25 , who lounged in the surf draped in a white cloth covering a white bikini . A few tar balls stuck to her bathing suit as she walked back to their condominium . Q : How about the seafood ? Is it safe to eat ? A : The president thinks so . Barack Obama ate Gulf seafood during his last visit to Mississippi . He declared that seafood from the region is safe , and also announced stepped-up inspections . Parts of the Gulf with oil have been closed for fishing . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Food and Drug Administration are sampling fish from the Gulf and are to begin checking fish that come in to docks . However , inspectors have yet to make an appearance at docksides , and some restaurants have been putting up signs saying they do not sell Gulf seafood . Some critics say testing needs to improve . Q : Will there be long-term health effects ? A : They do n't know . Some health officials say they do n't think long-term illnesses are likely . But they 've never seen pollution of this scale , and there are just too many unknowns to say for sure . `` It 's theoretically possible , but at this point of time not something people are predicting will happen , '' said Dr. Thomas Miller , an assistant state health officer with Alabama 's health department . Some chemicals in the oil are associated with a cancer risk . But it can take decades for an environmental trigger to result in cancer . And when cancers do occur , it 's difficult to sort out the real cause -- for example , whether oil fumes inhaled over two months played a greater role than cigarette smoke inhaled in bars over the course of a lifetime .

A little mathematical context to the spill size can put the environmental catastrophe in perspective . Viewing it through some lenses , it is n't that huge . The Mississippi River pours as much water into the Gulf of Mexico in 38 seconds as the BP oil leak has done in two months . On a more human scale , the spill seems more daunting . Take the average-sized living room . The amount of oil spilled would fill 9,200 of them . Since the BP oil rig exploded on April 20 , about 126.3 million gallons of oil has gushed into the Gulf . That calculation is based on the higher end of the government 's range of barrels leaked per day and the oil company BP 's calculations for the amount of oil siphoned off as of Monday morning . Using the more optimistic end of calculations , the total spill figure is just shy of 68 million gallons . For this by-the-numbers exercise , The Associated Press is using the higher figure . For every gallon of oil that BP 's well has gushed into the Gulf of Mexico , there is more than 5 billion gallons of water already in it . And the mighty Mississippi adds another billion gallons every five minutes or so , according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency . So BP chief executive officer Tony Hayward was factually correct last month when he said the spill was `` relatively tiny '' compared to what he mischaracterized as a `` very big ocean . '' But another big number that Hayward provided on Thursday also offers some troubling news . He said the reservoir of oil under the sea that is the source for the leak is believed to hold about 2.1 billion gallons of oil . That leaves about 2 billion gallons left to spew . So there are about 16 gallons of oil underneath the sea floor yet to gush for every gallon that has already fouled the Gulf . If the problem were never fixed , that would mean another two years of oil spilling based on the current flow rate . More not-so-dreadful context : The amount of oil spilled so far could only fill the cavernous New Orleans Superdome about one-seventh of the way up . On the other hand , it could fill 15 Washington Monuments and two-thirds of the way up a 16th . If the oil were poured on a football field -- complete with endzones -- it would measure nearly 100 yards high . If you put the oil in gallon milk jugs and lined them up , they would stretch about 11,000 miles . That 's a roundtrip from the Gulf to London , BP 's headquarters , and a side trip from New Orleans to Washington for Hayward to testify . BP has spent more than $ 54.8 million lobbying federal officials in Washington since 2000 ; that 's about 43 cents for every gallon of oil it has spilled . Since 2000 , the oil and gas industry -- along with their employees -- has contributed $ 154.2 million to candidates for federal office . That 's $ 1.22 for each gallon of oil spilled . Of that money , 78 percent went to Republicans and the rest to Democrats . Take the 126.3 million gallons of oil spilled in the Gulf and convert it to gasoline , which is what Americans mostly use it for . That produces 58.6 million gallons of gas -- the amount American drivers burn every three hours and 43 minutes . It 's enough to fill up the gas tanks in nearly 3.7 million cars -- more than those in Louisiana and Mississippi combined . At $ 2.75 a gallon for gas -- the national average -- that 's more than $ 161 million worth spilled into the Gulf . Associated Press Writer Sharon Theimer in Washington contributed to this report .

BP spokeswoman Sheila Williams confirmed to Fox News on Monday that Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg has decided to sideline Hayward . `` The transition of day-to-day handling by BP Managing Director Robert Dudley of the oil spill cleanup has started , '' Williams said . On Friday , Svanberg told Fox News sister network Sky News in the United Kingdom that Hayward would remain in charge of the oil spill response until the leak is stopped -- which could be August or later -- but Dudley will take over in the Gulf of Mexico . Svanberg said comments by Hayward have had a detrimental effect on the company as it seeks to control the fallout from the April 20 explosion that caused a massive gusher that 's now in its 63rd day . `` It is clear Tony has made remarks that have upset people , '' he told Sky News . Hayward has repeatedly put his foot in his mouth since the Deepwater Horizon spill began , most notably for saying shortly after the explosion that killed 11 people that he 'd like his life back Hayward caused an additional uproar over the weekend by participating in a yachting race around England 's Isle of Wight . Hayward entered his 52-foot yacht named `` Bob '' into The JP Morgan-sponsored race . It finished fourth in its class . Williams had little to say about the sailing race or the appearance it created . `` It was a rare private time for Mr. Hayward to share with his son and that is all we are going to say about this , '' she said . But Hayward 's announcement that he had canceled a scheduled appearance at a London oil conference on Tuesday to focus on the Gulf suggested fallout from the yacht race had not ended . BP spokesman Jon Pack said Monday that Hayward 's `` very heavy schedule of commitments to the Gulf of Mexico '' had led him to cancel his appearance at the World National Oil Companies Congress . Hayward had been due to give the keynote speech about the global responsibilities of international oil companies . BP is trying to shake off a series of PR blunders that have made the oil giant appear out of touch with the human victims of the oil spill -- primarily Gulf Coast fishers , trawlers and tourism operators . BP last week agreed to create a $ 20 billion escrow account to pay for claims from thousands of workers whose businesses are collapsing as a result of the spill . Dudley told Bloomberg News on Monday that BP is reviewing assets for potential sale to cover the expected costs . Williams would not comment about any decisions made Sunday by the BP board of directors about whether to sell assets to bolster cash flow . BP 's troubles continue to grow after Anadarko , the co-owner of BP 's rig , said the oil firm 's actions before the accident at the Deepwater Horizon site were `` reckless . '' On top of that , BBC is airing a documentary Monday night featuring allegations by one Deepwater Horizon rig worker who said he spotted a leak in the blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- two weeks prior to the explosion . Tyrone Benton , a robot operator , said one of the robot 's cameras spotted a leak on a control pod of the BOP , which is an emergency shutoff valve fixed to the wellhead on the seafloor . Benton told BBC that supervisors shut down the one BOP and turned on another so that work would n't stop . `` They have a control room where they could turn off that pod and turn on the other one , so that they do n't have to stop production , '' Benton said . `` We are aware of the allegation , '' Williams said of Benton 's claims , adding that the details that led to the explosions and fire are still under investigation and BP has not spoken with every witness yet . `` The -LRB- blowout preventer -RRB- was part of the Deepwater Horizon equipment which was owned and operated by Transocean . Transocean was responsible for both the operation and maintenance of the BOP on the drilling rig , '' she added . Fox News ' Greg Palkot and The Associated Press contributed to this report .

A Defense official told Fox News that governors are afraid that activating more troops would be politically harmful , charging taxpayers a high cost for duties that wo n't keep troops busy . The skill sets these troops have do n't match the needs , the official said , and the governors are n't about to pay soldiers to stand on the beaches waiting for oil to wash up . Gates told `` Fox News Sunday '' that there is n't more the Pentagon could be doing to help stop the spill or to prevent millions of gallons of oil from washing up on the Gulf Coast . `` We have offered whatever capabilities we have , '' Gates said . `` We do n't have the kinds of equipment or particular expertise . '' Gates said there is a standing offer for the authorization of up to 17,500 National Guard troops in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida , the four states that are most affected by the BP spill . `` If there 's anything people think we can do , we absolutely will do it , '' he said . Gates authorized the troops under Title 32 status , which means all costs would be reimbursed by the federal government , which in turn is charging BP . Of the 6,000 troops it is authorized to deploy , Louisiana has activated about 1,100 for aviation support , sandbagging and hazmat training for those who might come in contact with the oil . Alabama has activated 450 of the 3,000 troops authorized . Troops in that state are helping local business owners and others file claims against BP . Mississippi has activated 50 of its 6,000 authorized troops , and Florida has activated 30 of its 2,500 to conduct aviation support . Spokesmen for the four states ' governors rejected the notion that politics is a factor in how many troops they activate . `` It 's a question of is there a function for the National Guard to perform on the Gulf Coast , '' said Dan Turner , a spokesman for Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour . `` We 're not going to send 6,000 National Guardsmen to stand on the beach just for show . But when there 's a function for them , I do n't think the governor would have any hesitation to call . '' Turner said that with volunteers handling the bulk of the cleanup , including scooping up tar balls , there 's nothing more the National Guard can do . `` But what we 're seeing here is not the really sad and awful situation that you 're seeing in south Louisiana , '' he said . `` Thus far , we 've been extremely fortunate that we have had as little contact as we have . '' Kyle Plotkin , a spokesman for Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal , noted that the state mobilized 600 troops , then increased that number to 1,100 as the Coast Guard and BP approved more projects and missions . `` As additional missions are approved , the National Guard determines if more Guardsmen are needed to conduct the projects , '' he said . `` Ultimately , we 're less concerned with who completes the project and more concerned about actually completing the mission so we can keep this oil off our coast . '' Sterling Ivey , a spokesman for Florida Gov. Charlie Crist , said the state will call up an additional 70 troops this week to pick up tar balls . `` We do n't have the need for more troops right now because -LRB- the spill 's -RRB- impact on Florida 's shore is not as great in other states , '' he said . `` If we see more oil washing ashore ... we 'll certainly bring them in . But right now , we do n't have the need for 2,500 troops walking up and down Florida 's beaches . '' Jennifer Ardis , a spokeswoman for Alabama Gov. Bob Riley , said the state will call up more troops if they are needed . `` We 're just trying to be efficient with what we 're doing , '' she said . `` If we should need more , we will call more .

NEW ORLEANS -- Out-of-work Gulf Coast shrimper Todd Pellegal spent his first $ 2,500 check from BP quickly , paying off bills and buying groceries for his family . He never even considered putting some of it away for taxes . Now he 's among the people up and down the Gulf Coast reeling from the oil spill disaster who are surprised -- and frustrated -- to find out the Internal Revenue Service may take a chunk of the payments BP PLC is providing to help them stay afloat . Many were already angry about how long the oil giant took to cut the checks . So when they got the money -- generally about a few thousand dollars each so far -- they spent it fast . `` If they 're going to pay you a lump sum , like for a year , then bam , take the taxes out of the check , '' said Pellegal , of Boothville , La. `` But a little bit at a time , they should n't . '' Accountants have been trying to nail down the implications for thousands of taxpayers after President Barack Obama said BP would create a $ 20 billion disaster fund and provide another $ 100 million for oil workers who lose their jobs because of the six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico . Oil has been gushing into the sea since the rig Deepwater Horizon exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers and triggering the worst oil spill in U.S. history . Tax experts said generally all income is taxable under federal law unless specific exemptions are approved by Congress or the Treasury Department -- and neither has acted yet on oil spill damage claims . The IRS would not comment on whether exemptions would be made , citing a policy of not answering questions on specific tax issues . Adding to the confusion , Kenneth Feinberg , who was chosen by President Barack Obama and BP to oversee the Independent Claims Facility , said Friday it has n't been determined if the payouts will be considered taxable income . Some tax experts said they expected federal action soon to clarify the situation for Gulf Coast residents and business owners . `` With the experience we 've had with tornadoes and hurricanes , they know they need to address this , '' said John Ams , executive vice president of the Alexandria , Va.-based National Society of Accountants . It 's not the first time the region has dealt with whether disaster money should be taxed . In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , Louisiana and Mississippi residents received federal money to rebuild their homes after many claimed a casualty loss for the damage on the 2005 tax returns . The IRS initially required people who received the money and took the deduction to add the value of the deduction to their 2007 returns as taxable income . That decision angered many residents , including some who were pushed into a higher tax bracket as a result . After residents and local leaders protested , Congress in 2008 voted to negate the IRS decision . Without any such decision yet from federal authorities , tax experts are advising people getting BP payments to do a bit of advance planning and set aside some money . `` They should do a projection of their taxable income and determine if there is going to be a tax liability and have enough to cover that , '' said Crystal Faulkner , a partner in the Cincinnati-based accounting firm of Cooney Faulkner & Stevens LLC . That does n't sit well with Cherie Edwards , who is now only working one day a week at her job booking charter fishing trips at Zeke 's Landing in Orange Beach , Ala. . The lost hours due to the oil spill are costing her about $ 270 week . She said she got her claim number from BP on Thursday and plans to file an application in the coming day . So far , she said , no one has mentioned to her about a potential tax liability . Associated Press writers Jay Reeves in Alabama and Shelia Byrd in Mississippi contributed to this report .

AP Photo\\/Dave Martin As much as 1 million times the normal level of methane gas has been found in some regions near the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , enough to potentially deplete oxygen and create a dead zone , U.S. scientists said on Tuesday . Texas A&M University oceanography professor John Kessler , just back from a 10-day research expedition near the BP Plc oil spill in the gulf , says methane gas levels in some areas are `` astonishingly high . '' Kessler 's crew took measurements of both surface and deep water within a 5-mile radius of BP 's broken wellhead . `` There is an incredible amount of methane in there , '' Kessler told reporters in a telephone briefing . In some areas , the crew of 12 scientists found concentrations that were 100,000 times higher than normal . `` We saw them approach a million times above background concentrations '' in some areas , Kessler said . The scientists were looking for signs that the methane gas had depleted levels of oxygen dissolved in the water needed to sustain marine life . `` At some locations , we saw depletions of up to 30 percent of oxygen based on its natural concentration in the waters . At other places , we saw no depletion of oxygen in the waters . We need to determine why that is , '' he told the briefing . Methane occurs naturally in sea water , but high concentrations can encourage the growth of microbes that gobble up oxygen needed by marine life . Kessler said oxygen depletions have not reached a critical level yet , but the oil is still spilling into the Gulf , now at a rate of as much as 60,000 barrels a day , according to U.S. government estimates . `` What is it going to look like two months down the road , six months down the road , two years down the road ? '' Methane , a natural gas , dissolves in seawater and some scientists think measuring methane could give a more accurate picture of the extent of the oil spill . Kessler said his team has taken those measurements , and is hoping to have an estimate soon . `` Give us about a week and we should have some preliminary numbers on that , '' he said .

As the Obama administration pursues a new moratorium on offshore drilling in reaction to the BP oil spill , a video circulating on YouTube shows it was n't too long ago that a future administration official looked to BP to `` save the world . '' Energy Secretary Steven Chu , who was working at UC Berkeley at the time , says in the 2007 video , `` There 's been a lot of excitement that 's been growing over the last several years and now with partnering with BP we will have the resources to actually carry out some of the things we want to do in order to help save the world . '' Skip forward to June 2010 . Following the largest oil spill in U.S. history , President Obama implemented a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling , claiming that a presidential commission needs time to study offshore safety operations after the April 22 explosion at BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico . The administration , however , hit a roadblock Tuesday when New Orleans federal judge Martin Feldman struck down the six-month ban on drilling , arguing that the rationale for the moratorium does n't factor in the safety records of other drilling locations in the Gulf . Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told a Senate subcommittee Wednesday that the moratorium needs to stay in place until it 's known whether the deepwater drilling can be done safely . He pledged to issue a new moratorium in the next few days that will eliminate any doubt that it 's needed and appropriate . The Justice Department announced Wednesday evening that it will appeal the ruling , saying that a second deepwater blowout could overwhelm the efforts to respond to the BP disaster , which left 11 workers dead and unleashed millions of gallons of crude into the Gulf . Two disaster response workers were killed Wednesday during clean-up efforts . In cementing its case for a moratorium , the White House has said BP and other oil companies can no longer be trusted in assuring the safety of offshore drilling . Chu , a Nobel-prize winning physicist , worked as director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley before being picked by Obama to serve as energy secretary . BP pledged a reported $ 500 million in February 2007 to help establish the Energy Biosciences Institute , an innovative biofuel program that Chu launched while working at UC Berkeley . Touted as the world 's largest public and private consortium that researches all aspects of bioenergy , the institute 's partners include BP , the University of California , Berkeley , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . The institute focuses in particular on alternative transportation fuels . In the 2007 video that re-emerged this week , is seen telling UC Berkeley chancellor Robert J. Birgeneau , `` We 're going to save the world in part by doing something about the energy problem . And this impacts national security , this impacts economic prosperity , and , and most important for me , this impacts stewardship of the environment . '' Chu 's office told FoxNews.com Wednesday that the energy chief helped convince BP to fund the innovative biofuel program , aimed at developing technologies to produce fuel from biomass instead of oil . `` As anyone can tell from watching the video , Dr. Chu was talking in 2007 about the potential of the Energy Biosciences Institute to achieve breakthroughs that may play an important role in reducing our dependence on oil and in solving our global energy and climate challenges , '' Chu 's press secretary Stephanie Mueller said in an e-mail Wednesday . `` He has , of course , not been involved with that program since joining the -LRB- Interior -RRB- department , '' added Mueller . BP 's multimillion-dollar partnership with the institute shows the oil giant went to great lengths in its efforts to become `` greener , '' an irony in the oil disaster saga that is now reaching into its fourth month . The institute to date has launched 68 programs in five research areas : feedstock development , biomass depolymerization , biofuels production , enhanced hydrocarbon recovery and the socio-economic impacts of cellulosic biofuels development . More than 300 researchers are working to develop affordable and renewable sources of energy . And the program has produced a 320-acre energy farm that works as a `` living laboratory '' for developing promising biofuel feedstocks and studying greenhouse gas emissions .

There are concerns that some workers could suffer lung , kidney and liver damage from exposure to the volatile organic compounds found in the oil . As of Wednesday , 407 oil exposure complaints had been reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers . In Louisiana , more than 100 oil spill-related illnesses were reported , 74 of them from workers hired by BP . `` We 've seen a total of 11 patients that have come through our ER since May 26 , and most of them stayed for about two to three days , '' Taslin Alfonzo , spokeswoman for West Jefferson Medical Center in Marrero , La. , told FoxNews.com . `` They all complained of similar symptoms , which were nausea , dizziness , severe headaches , skin irritation and shortness of breath , which is an indication -- our doctors believe -- there was some kind of chemical exposure or chemical irritant that caused them to come in . '' But exposure to toxic chemicals is n't the only thing causing workers to seek medical attention . With the heat index in the Gulf hovering around 110 degrees during the steamy summer months , one of the main short-term health concerns is heat exhaustion . `` You really are talking about a triangle of heat , chemical exposure , and then the behavior changes that you see as a result , '' Linda McCauley , dean of Emory University 's School of Nursing in Atlanta , said at an Institute of Medicine hearing in New Orleans this week . Behavioral changes are just another layer of the health issues that could lie ahead for the workers cleaning up the Gulf . With many fishermen out of work in an area still reeling from the lingering economic and emotional damage left by Hurricane Katrina five years ago , the mental health of both the workers and the residents affected by this environmental catastrophe could be fragile . `` Individuals who have been directly affected by it , their livelihoods , their very way of life from generations , being told to terminate it at this point in time , and not being able to determine which steps they need to take , '' Victor Sims , a clinical social worker and counselor at West Jefferson Behavior Medicine Center , told FoxNews.com . It 's that type of situation that generates stress and anxiety , and then begins to exacerbate itself in changes in sleeping habits , changes in eating habits and other disorders based on their attempts to try and deal with this issue , he added . On Wednesday , the United States Coast Guard reported the deaths of two oil spill workers in unrelated incidents . One of the men , a 55-year-old boat captain , took his own life , the Gulf Shores Police Department said in a news release . William Allen Kruse , of Foley , Ala. , was found above the wheelhouse of his boat at the Fort Morgan Marina in Gulf Shores , Ala. , with a single gunshot wound to the head that appeared to be self-inflicted . Medical screening for oil spill workers BP is taking precautions to ensure workers meet the physical health requirements to work under such extreme conditions . In a partnership with West Jefferson Industrial Medicine , LLC , and West Jefferson Medical Center , the British oil giant has set up a medical screening clinic in Lafitte , La. , where potential workers are examined and trained before being hired to work on the cleanup . `` People are having physical exams , which includes an examination , screening for previous medical history for conditions like diabetes , cardiac disease , '' said Dr. Brian M. Bourgeois , owner of West Jefferson Industrial Medicine , LLC . `` They 're also being screened for problems that may make working in the heat and humidity for long hours difficult , like vision problems and physical ability to do manual labor-type work . '' Another concern is the workers ' ability to work in an environment where they do n't necessarily have medical attention readily available , out in the open water , Bourgeois added . For their part , community hospitals like West Jefferson have set up medical tents on the beaches of Grand Isle , La. , where workers , first responders and volunteers are often seen between shifts . `` Initially we wanted to set it up for the oil spill workers , but BP is handling that now , and so we 're mainly dealing with the first responders and anything that the community needs down there , '' Alfonzo said . With $ 10 million set aside for tracking and surveillance of oil spill-related illnesses in states along the Gulf Coast , officials at the Department of Health and Human Services admit that little is known about the health impacts of oil spills on humans . In the last 50 years , at least 400 spills have occurred around the world , yet only seven of them have been studied to date . Perhaps that 's why health officials on both the federal and local levels are now clamoring to implement health surveillance systems in Louisiana , Alabama , Mississippi and Florida . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- , the National Institutes of Health -LRB- NIH -RRB- and the Environmental Protection Agency -LRB- EPA -RRB- have been working with affected coastal communities to track cases of acute illnesses and trends in oil exposure-related hospital visits , medication sales and increases in certain diseases . `` What it 's going to do more likely than not , is maybe magnify preexisting conditions rather than being a causative agent for a new condition , '' Bourgeois said . In an effort to closely monitor potentially serious long-term effects of those with the most exposure to the toxic chemicals -- the workers -- the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health -LRB- NIOSH -RRB- launched its own system . Of the nearly 35,000 BP oil spill response workers currently involved in the cleanup effort , 14,664 workers have volunteered to be part of the long-term tracking system .

Bob Papp listens during a briefing in New Orleans The government agency leading the effort to clean up the nation 's largest oil spill is preparing for two impending challenges to their mission along the Gulf Coast : hurricanes and budget cuts . Over two days , the newly-minted chief of the U.S. Coast Guard got an update on the efforts with a two-hour fly-over of the affected areas and a briefing at what some describe as the `` brain '' of the oil spill response . `` We 're making a dent in it , '' Adm. Bob Papp said on Wednesday as he and a Fox News crew flew in a helicopter over the BP oil rig that 's gushing up to 60,000 barrels of oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico . `` I see some improvement . The surface definitely has improved , but we 're not out of the woods yet . '' The day before , during his third trip to the region , Papp was briefed by representatives from BP , the military and other federal agencies about the coming hurricane season and plans to keep the clean-up effort intact even during strong storms . `` We 've got a lot of very expensive , valuable equipment out there taking care of this challenge , '' Papp said from inside the Unified Area Command center in New Orleans , La , where hundreds of what he called `` dedicated patriots '' from across the country process and analyze the information coming in from Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . `` If we have a hurricane come through -- while we may have enough equipment out there right now to deal with what we 're facing -- what 's going to happen if some of that equipment is destroyed , damaged , or pushed off station ? '' Even though Papp only took the reins of the Coast Guard in late May , when Adm. Thad Allen retired as commandant but stayed on as `` Incident Commander , '' Papp said has had extensive experience with hurricanes from his time as Commander of the Coast Guard Atlantic Area , during which more than 30 named storms and hurricanes hit his region . `` So I know the devastation that -LRB- such storms -RRB- can bring on , '' he said . `` What we 've done now is we 've identified the additional resources we 're going to need in order to come in here in a worst case scenario , having a hurricane on top of this . ... I 'm feeling very confident now that we 're going to be prepared to take on these extra challenges . '' In particular , the Coast Guard has ordered about 20 more large , off-shore skimming boats , the types of vessels have been `` collecting the bulk of the oil out there , '' according to Papp . In addition , the Coast Guard is putting pressure on boom manufacturers to `` get more boom down here '' for the hurricane season , Papp said . `` When a storm comes through , all that boom that 's out there could be in Arkansas by the time a hurricane -LRB- hits -RRB- , '' he said . Much of the extra resources , including the off-shore skimming boats , are expected to arrive in the Gulf Coast within two weeks , according to Papp , who described his job as `` just commandant of the Coast Guard , '' providing `` resources into this operation to make sure that we 've got Coast Guard people , ships , aircraft and other resources down here to help Admiral Allen carry out -LRB- his -RRB- job '' as incident commander . Asked about suggestions that hurricanes could actually benefit the clean-up effort , Papp dismissed the notion . `` Nobody wins in an oil spill , nobody wins in a hurricane , '' he said . `` While -LRB- a hurricane -RRB- might disperse oil , I do n't think anybody wants a hurricane to hit this region if we do n't have to . ... I 'd rather just be attacking oil and not have to worry about hurricanes . '' While the Coast Guard is struggling with oil , it 's also struggling to keep its other missions fulfilled . `` We do n't have a lot of bench strength , and all the resources that we 've brought down here are coming out of other coast guard missions , '' Papp said of his agency , which has only 42,000 uniformed personnel and 11 formal missions , including search-and-rescue operations and law enforcement . `` We have finite resources , so when I bring a couple dozen aircraft down here from other locations , a dozen or more ships from other locations , some of those other missions are going to get short-changed a little bit . '' Complicating things even further , the Coast Guard is facing a significant budget cut in the next year . The Obama administration 's 2011 budget proposal for the Coast Guard is just over $ 10 billion , down more than $ 75 million from the year before , according to Coast Guard numbers . The Coast Guard needed about a $ 100 million increase just to keep operations constant from the year before , and that estimate was reached before the oil spill ever happened , according to one source familiar with the Coast Guard budget . Asked whether the White House might propose more money for the Coast Guard after its efforts in the Gulf Coast , Papp said he could n't answer . `` I ca n't presume what the administration or the Congress might do , '' he said . `` All I know is : I know how much money I get , and we 'll put it to the best use for the taxpayer . ... If we have something else come up , whether it is an East Coast hurricane , migrants coming to the country -LRB- illegally via sea -RRB- or a fishery situation in the gulf of Alaska , we 'll reassess and assign resources as we need to . '' For now , Papp suggested , the trade-off is worthwhile , with skimming , burning and other efforts `` making a difference '' and creating `` smaller footprints '' of oil . `` This is very , very important to our country , '' he told the crew of a Coast Guard vessel in Pensacola , Fla , on Wednesday , just before they left to help clean-up oil . `` This is very , very important to the people of this region . '' But , a day before , Papp told Fox News that clean-up efforts can only do so much . `` It 's a mistake to think that the oil is not going to reach the beaches , '' he said . `` We would not be truthful if we said we 're going to keep all the oil off the beaches . Inevitably , there will be some oil on the beaches . So what we have to do is collect as much of that oil out as far as we can . '' Briefing at Unified Area Command Center in New Orleans , La. .

The blast killed 11 workers . Since then , oil has been pouring into the Gulf from a blown-out undersea well . BP said its effort to drill a relief well through 2 ? miles of rock to stop the Gulf spill is on target for completion by mid-August . The relief well is considered the best hope of halting the crude that has been gushing since April 20 in the biggest offshore oil spill in U.S. history . The crew that has been drilling it since early May ran a test to confirm it is on the right path , using a tool that detects the magnetic field around the casing of the original , blown-out well . Despite the encouraging news about the relief well , BP stock tumbled 6 percent in New York to a 14-year low on news that the oil giant has now spent $ 2.35 billion dealing with the disaster . BP has lost more than $ 100 billion in market value since its deep-water drilling platform blew up , and its stock is worth less than half the $ 60 or so it was selling for on the day of the explosion . The first tropical depression of the Atlantic season formed in the Caribbean , raising concerns about what might happen to efforts to contain the oil if bad weather forces BP to abandon them . It 's still too early to tell exactly where the storm might go and how it might affect oil on and below the surface of the Gulf . But BP would have to secure or move its equipment there if a storm blows in . A financial disclosure report shows the Louisiana judge who struck down the Obama administration 's six-month ban on deep-water drilling in the Gulf has sold many of his energy investments . U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman still owns eight energy-related investments , including stock in Exxon Mobil Corp. . Among the assets he sold was stock in Transocean , which owned the rig that exploded . The Justice Department asked a federal appeals court Friday to delay Feldman 's ruling `` to preserve the status quo '' during the government 's appeal . Labor Secretary Hilda Solis slammed BP -- along with Massey Energy , owner of the West Virginia coal mine where 29 workers died in an explosion in April -- saying they need better safety measures . `` We are not saying go out of business , '' she said . `` Do your job better . Make an investment in your employees . We want you to make a profit , but not at the expense of killing your employees . '' Vice President Joe Biden will head to the Gulf on Tuesday to visit a command center in New Orleans and the oil-fouled Florida Panhandle . The IRS said payments for lost wages from BP 's $ 20 billion victims compensation fund are taxable just like regular income . Payments for physical injuries or property loss are generally tax-free . Vicki Guillot has served her last seafood po-boy . The local bounty of fresh shrimp and oysters that once kept things bustling in the only restaurant in the rural Louisiana town of Gheens can no longer be harvested from the Gulf of Mexico because of the massive oil spill that has fouled the water . All her distributors can offer her now is imported shrimp at twice the price she was paying 10 weeks ago .

'' But recently , the professor emeritus reached another milestone : He appeared on David Letterman 's `` Late Show '' to talk in plain language about oil . Overton is one of scores of scientists who have toiled for years in obscurity and now find themselves in the middle of a media frenzy , trying to explain the Gulf oil spill to the public .

AP June 23 , 2010 : This image from video provided by BP shows oil gushing from the broken wellhead at the site of the Deepwater Horizon oil well in the Gulf of Mexico . AP NEW ORLEANS -- More dirty evidence of the massive oil spill washed ashore along the Gulf Coast for residents who do n't need anymore reminders of their frustration over failed efforts to stop the crude gushing from a blown-out undersea well . In Florida , officials on Thursday closed a quarter-mile stretch of Pensacola Beach not far from the Alabama line when thick pools of oil washed up , the first time a beach in the state has been shut because of the spill . A large patch of oil oozed into Mississippi Sound , the fertile waters between the barrier islands and mainland of a state that has mostly been spared . The news came as a cap collecting oil from the well was back in place after a deep-sea robot bumped it and engineers concerned about escaping gas removed it for about 10 hours Wednesday . Even before that latest setback , the government 's worst-case estimates suggested the cap and other equipment were capturing less than half of the oil leaking from the seafloor . And in recent days , the `` spillcam '' video continued to show gas and oil billowing from the well . BP 's pronouncements that it would soon be able to collect more spewing oil have `` absolutely no credibility , '' Jefferson Parish Councilman John Young said . The latest problem shows `` they really are not up to the task and we have more bad news than we have good news . '' BP officials said they sympathized and planned to do more . `` For BP , our intent is to restore the Gulf the way it was before it happened , '' BP PLC managing director Bob Dudley , who has taken over the company 's spill operations , said in Washington . -- The federal judge who struck down the Obama administration 's six-month ban on deep-water drilling in the Gulf refused to stay his ruling while the government appeals . -- Environmental groups asked the court to release additional information about U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman 's holdings in oil-related stocks . -- Dudley said BP had asked James Lee Witt , director of the Federal Emergency Management Administration during the Clinton administration , to review its response to the oil spill and recommend improvements . At nearly every important juncture since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers , the government 's and BP 's estimates on the size of the spill , its effect on wildlife and the time frame for containing it have spectacularly missed the mark . On June 8 , BP chief operating office Doug Suttles said the spill should be reduced to a `` relative trickle '' in less than a week . BP later said it would take more time for the spill to reach a trickle . President Barack Obama told the nation last week that as much as 90 percent would soon be captured , saying the company had informed him that was how much of the oil could be kept out of the water within weeks . `` It just does n't look like that 's in the cards , '' said Ed Overton , a retired professor of environmental science at Louisiana State University . `` We 're not even close to that , and the word today is that they were capturing less than the day before . I was hoping the president knew something that the rest of us did n't know . I mean , he was talking to the big shots . '' BP said Thursday it was gradually ramping back up to capture about 700,000 gallons a day with the cap , and burning off an additional 438,000 a day using an incinerator ship . Worst-case government estimates are that about 2.5 million gallons are leaking from the well , though no one really knows for sure . By mid - to late July , the company hopes to have the capacity to capture up to 3.3 million gallons a day , if that much is flowing , BP spokesman John Curry said . It can not all be done immediately , Curry said , because the logistics of positioning four giant ships capable of collecting oil and connecting them to the seafloor are complicated . `` There 's a limit to the number of ships in the world that do these type of things , '' he said . None of those efforts is expected to stop the leak entirely . The soonest that would happen is late August , which is when BP says relief wells being drilled through thousands of feet of rock beneath the seabed will reach the gusher . August seems a long way off to many . Along Pensacola Beach , lifeguard Collin Cobia wore a red handkerchief over his nose and mouth to block the oil smell . `` It 's enough to knock you down , '' he said . Others were n't happy about the situation but declined to second-guess the BP engineers . `` I have no clue at all about the correct way to stop it , '' said Rocky Ditcharo , a seafood dock owner in Louisiana 's Plaquemines Parish . '' ` Powerless ' -- that 's a good word for it .

Experts say the massive Gulf spill has exposed a failure by the industry and the federal government to commit adequate resources to oil cleanup and response technology . `` Why they did n't start working on it after the -LRB- Ixtoc 1 -RRB- Mexican spill in 1979 is beyond me , '' said Gerald Graham , president of Worldocean Consulting , an oil spill prevention and response planning firm in British Columbia . `` Now they 're trying to catch up . '' Only a fraction of the estimated 69 million to 131.5 million gallons of oil that have spewed into the Gulf have been recovered . About 10 million gallons of oil have been burned off , and 25 million gallons of oil-water mix have been mopped up . The mainstays of the two-month-long cleanup effort are oil booms , mechanical skimmers and oil dispersants -- the same tools used to fight the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska . Improvements to these methods have been incremental and few new ones have been developed , critics say , because oil companies have no financial incentive . `` The technology rapidly advanced for drilling , because there was money to be made , '' said Tim Robertson , general manager of Nuka Research & Planning , which specializes in oil spill response planning , and who worked on Seldovia , Alaska 's response during the Exxon spill . `` There was nothing similar that applies to oil spill recovery . '' Five companies -- Shell Oil , ExxonMobil , ConocoPhillips , Chevron Corp. , BP America -- together spent about $ 33.8 billion to explore for new oil and gas in the past three years , according to answers the companies provided this month to a House Energy & Commerce subcommittee . But their spending on research for safety , accident prevention and spill response is `` paltry '' by comparison , said Rep. Edward Markey -LRB- D-Mass -RRB- , who chairs the subcommittee and introduced a bill Friday that would redirect $ 50 million per year in oil and gas royalty payments for research into new spill response technology . In answers to Congress , most of the companies said they could not segregate costs for the safety - and spill-related research . For example , ConocoPhillips said it spent $ 1.3 million over three years on research on safer drilling technologies , but did not specify how much it spends on accident prevention and spill-related research . ExxonMobil said it spends $ 50 million a year on oil spill response , drilling and deepwater development research activities . The company says it has maintained an internal spill research program for 40 years . BP said the company spent $ 29 million over three years on safer drilling operations research . But spokesman Robert Wine said BP does not research oil spill cleanup technology . Instead , he said BP supports oil spill response organizations , such as the nonprofit Marine Spill Response Corp. . MSRC 's overall spending was $ 88 million in 2008 , the most recent year for which its IRS filing was available . But it has no budget for research , MSRC spokeswoman Judith Roos told USA Today . Roos did not respond to calls and e-mails from The Associated Press . The oil and gas industry now is taking steps to explore new technology . And BP has pledged $ 500 million for research efforts . For its part , the federal government has spent relatively little to advance cleanup technology for spills . Congress appropriated only about one-sixth of the $ 30 million in research grants to universities authorized under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 after the Exxon Valdez , according to the Coastal Response Research Center . The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement -- which was known as the Minerals Management Service until this month -- collects $ 13 billion a year in oil drilling royalties . But the agency has been spending between $ 6 million to $ 7 million a year since 1995 on oil spill research . And the Coast Guard 's annual oil spill research budget has steadily dropped from about $ 5.6 million in 1993 to about $ 500,000 for each of the past four years . U.S. Rep. Brian Baird -LRB- D-Wash . -RRB- , who recently held hearings on oil spill cleanup technologies , said there has n't been much federal spending for cleanup because the political pressure is to drill for more oil . `` Our priorities have been about how to extract more oil in greater volumes and for greater profits , and there have n't been corresponding priorities on how to do so safely and how to prepare if there is an accident , '' he said in an interview . BP also has scrambled to try different cleanup techniques since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers and creating one of the U.S. 's worst environmental disaster . The company recently ordered 32 centrifuge devices made by a company co-founded by Hollywood actor Kevin Costner , who had invested about $ 24 million in the project . The company says the largest of the devices can process about 210,000 gallons a day , separating gunk from water . Deployed on barges , the centrifuges are intended to help skimmers work more efficiently by letting them unload the oil and water mix and cleaning it at sea instead of returning to port each time the tank is full . Advances in drilling technology have enabled a boom in exploration and drilling in deep waters , where lower temperatures and higher pressures require sophisticated equipment . `` We 've pushed the envelope more and more on offshore drilling in deep waters , '' said Nancy Kinner , co-director of the Coastal Response Research Center , a partnership between the University of New Hampshire and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . Yet , she said , not much is known about how to collect oil from deep sea spills or how chemical dispersants used to break up oil behave at such depths . Oil spill experts say that despite some improvements in containment booms and skimmers , they 're still limited in what they can do . Booms generally work best in calm weather and waves , and need lots of maintenance . In Barataria Bay , absorbent boom placed around numerous marshy islands did n't stop oil slicks from reaching wetlands . Some sections of boom were torn apart or doubled over . The stems of marsh grasses and other vegetation near the edge were stained dark brown with oil . `` In many case , all we have is that very basic technology and of course we use it , '' said Dennis Takahashi Kelso , vice president of the Ocean Conservancy and former Alaska Commissioner of Environmental Conservation during the Exxon Valdez spill .

But it appears the economic damage to the rest of the nation will be limited . Analysts say the spill will reduce economic growth by only about one-half of 1 percentage point this quarter , and even less during the second half of the year . Even for an economy as large as the United States ' -- $ 14.6 trillion -- a $ 73 billion cut is barely a nick . -- Spending on tourism is moving elsewhere . Beachgoers who might have headed for Pensacola , Fla. , for example , are looking toward Atlantic coast sites such as Myrtle Beach , S.C. Gulf hotel rooms going unused by tourists are being booked by cleanup crews . -- Damage to Gulf fishermen may last , but , as with tourism , the Gulf 's commercial fishing makes up only a tiny fraction of the U.S. economy . And most fish eaten in the United States is imported , says Michael Feroli , an economist at JPMorgan Chase . -- The Gulf energy industry , which makes up about 10 percent of the regional economy , is not vital to the nation 's . The six-month ban on deepwater drilling that a judge blocked Tuesday would only deduct about 0.03 percent from the U.S. economy . -- If deepwater drilling becomes too much of a financial burden and oil companies move their rigs abroad , coastal communities would be hurt in Louisiana and Texas would be hurt . But the national impact would be slight because of how small a portion of U.S. oil consumption the Gulf supplies , says Ed Friedman , economist at Moody 's Analytics -- less than 10 percent . The local communities will suffer damage to their economies and environments for years , even if the spill is capped later this summer . Wells Fargo economist Mark Vitner estimates that up to 250,000 Gulf jobs in fishing , tourism and energy will be lost in the second half of the year . The new jobs in cleanup wo n't make up for what 's been lost , and will probably pay less , Vitner and others say . Consumers in the region will spend less as a result . That will lower the U.S. economy 's growth rate in the July-to-September quarter by a slight 0.2 percentage point , Vitner said . He envisions little or no effect on growth in the fourth quarter of the year , assuming the leak is plugged by then . Some cleanup jobs are paying $ 15 to $ 18 an hour . By contrast , the thousands of rig workers idled by the deepwater drilling moratorium earn up to $ 1,800 a week -- roughly $ 45 an hour , trade groups estimate . That amounts to a collective loss of tens of millions of dollars in pay . Fishermen earn less -- on average about $ 13 an hour , the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says . But the destruction of fishing industry jobs is still taking a heavy toll . Take Rocky Ditcharo , a dock owner in Plaquemines Parish , La. , whose family has been in the shrimping business for four generations . Shrimpers sidelined by the spill are n't using his dock . Neither are boats involved in containing the spill by laying booms . Ditcharo , 44 , survived Katrina and other hurricanes . But he fears this may be the end of his business . `` I 'm in dire straits , '' he says . BP has committed to a $ 20 billion fund for oil-spill victims . In addition , it will pay $ 100 million into another fund to help oil workers sidelined by the moratorium on deepwater drilling . And President Barack Obama has pledged additional resources to the coastal states , though he has n't provided details . Yet despite the promises by BP and the government to restore the region , economists say they fear some affected people and businesses will still be awaiting help years from now .

Not that a new name makes it any easier for the Obama administration to convince a skeptical Congress that the agency will be any better at policing offshore drilling . The new name , the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement -- or BOE for short -- is designed to emphasize regulatory and enforcement responsibilities of the troubled agency , which is part of the Interior Department . The change comes in the wake of the disastrous BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . MMS had been panned for its lax oversight of offshore drilling . A recent report by the department 's inspector general said that its drilling regulators have been so close to the industry that they 've accepted gifts from oil and gas companies and even negotiated to go work for the companies . Michael R. Bromwich , the new head of the MMS -- er , BOE -- assured Congress that the change is much more than cosmetic . `` I think it 's substantive , '' Bromwich said . `` Regulation and enforcement have been added to the title of the agency because those elements , I think , by consensus have been lacking in the approach of the agency . '' One marketing expert told The Associated Press that the Obama administration has made a mistake by changing the name at a time when the agency is still the focus of negative attention . The danger , said Kelly O'Keefe , managing director of the Virginia Commonwealth University Brandcenter , is that the new name gets tarnished with the old baggage . `` If you 're trying to dodge a negative situation , it is a very bad idea to do that in the middle of that negative situation , '' O'Keefe said . `` Because what happens is the bad news is n't over -- it certainly is n't for MMS or BP . '' `` It 's really hard to pull a fake-out , to say , ` Hey , we 're something different now , ' '' O'Keefe added . `` We tend to see through that . '' Or , as `` The Daily Show '' host Jon Stewart deadpanned last week , `` Are we really that stupid ? '' `` This is n't just a name change or branding exercise , '' said Interior spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff . The new name , she said , reflects Interior Secretary Ken Salazar 's mission for the agency as it undergoes reorganization . Salazar plans to break up the agency into three separate entities to eliminate conflicts of interest . Government agencies have been changing their names since the beginning of the republic . In 1789 , just a few months into its existence , the Department of Foreign Affairs became the State Department . According to the State Department website , that switch was made because the agency took over several new domestic responsibilities , such as custody of the Great Seal of the United States . For most of its existence , the Army was known as the Department of War . In 1947 , it was converted to the Department of the Army and grouped with the Navy and newly created Air Force under a new National Military Establishment , headed by the new secretary of defense . Congress changed the National Military Establishment into the Department of Defense two years later , with significantly more authority for the defense secretary . In its 1947 report on the legislation unifying the military services , the Senate Committee on Armed Services said it had been guided by `` the basic objectives of our government -LRB- 1 -RRB- to maintain the peace and -LRB- 2 -RRB- to remove the causes of war . In support of those objectives it is essential that there be established a structure fully capable of safeguarding our national security promptly and effectively . '' Harvey Sapolsky , retired director of security studies and professor emeritus of public policy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology , said ridding the term `` war '' back then was not about making the department sound less bellicose . `` We might see differences in ` war ' and ` defense , ' but I do n't think they did , '' he said . Instead , the change was motivated by efficiency , coordination and creating an Air Force . Three decades after the Department of War was no more , the government excised `` welfare '' from another department 's name . In 1980 , the new Department of Education was born , while the old Health , Education and Welfare Department became the Health and Human Services Department . `` Welfare '' was nowhere to be found in the title of either department -- 16 years before President Bill Clinton signed legislation to fulfill a campaign promise to `` end welfare as we know it . '' Sometimes the rebranding can mean adding a key word . Last week , President Barack Obama signed an executive order renaming the President 's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports . The new name , the President 's Council on Fitness , Sports and Nutrition , was made to emphasize healthy eating habits , dovetailing with first lady Michelle Obama 's campaign against childhood obesity . The council has a jazzed-up website , with photos , videos and the words `` You 're it . That was n't even its first name change . When President Dwight D. Eisenhower created the council in 1956 , he called it the President 's Council on Youth Fitness . When it comes to MMS , Stewart questioned the need for a new name . `` Why do n't we just rename the water in the Gulf ` H20 Black ' ?

AFP\\/Getty Images June 28 : Tropical Storm Alex is seen churning in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico . NOAA , via AP NEW ORLEANS -- The tropical storm plowing across the Gulf of Mexico could send oil skimmers back to port and make containment booms useless , even from far away . But the rough weather also might give nature a hand in breaking down crude from the massive oil spill . Waves churned up by Tropical Storm Alex could help break up the patches of oil scattered across the sea , and the higher-than-normal winds that radiate far from the storm could help the crude evaporate faster . Forecasters said Monday they did n't expect the center of Alex to pass near the site of BP 's busted well . `` The oil is n't in one solid sheet . It 's all broken up into patches anyway . It will actually work to break those patches down , '' said Piers Chapman , chairman of the oceanography department at Texas A&M University . Alex could send high winds and rough seas -- perhaps as high as 12 feet -- rippling across the Gulf . Skimming vessels operating far from the storm 's center may be idled because they ca n't operate in such swells . Floating oil-containment booms could be rendered useless by waves slopping over them and may have to be pulled out of the water . Pulling boats and crews off the water could cost precious time , said Nancy Kinner , co-director of the Coastal Response Research Center at the University of New Hampshire . Equipment has to be stripped down , packed and protected from the force of the storm , and then has to be reassembled and deployed again , she said . But Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the federal government 's point man for the spill response , said the storm was n't expected to affect two relief wells being drilled , considered the best hope of plugging the leak . Even 12-foot waves are n't enough to stop the tanker that is sucking up large quantities of oil through the cap on the well , or a second vessel that is burning off hundreds of thousands of gallons at the surface , Allen said . Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal also said Monday that the weather could push the oil farther into the ecologically delicate Barataria Bay , home to a diverse group of wildlife . Other officials echoed that worry . Rough seas already have forced barges to leave their posts as a barrier against the oil near the bay . `` We 've already lost over 68 days of decent weather and this is going to be an active hurricane season , '' Jefferson Parish Council Chairman John Young said Monday . `` They 're going to start coming yet there continues to be a lack of a sense of urgency . '' For now , Alex is on track to stay well away from the spill before making landfall with hurricane-force winds near the U.S.-Mexico border , possibly by Thursday . `` We are watching very , very closely , '' said Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man on the crisis . `` As it stands right now , absent the intervention of a hurricane , we 're still looking at mid-August '' for completing the relief well . Earlier Monday , a BP executive said the well would be done by early August . All of the uncertainty of what Alex and other storms could do to BP 's containment effort gave new urgency to the company 's efforts to make its operations at the well as hurricane-resistant as possible . The company said it hopes to install a new oil-capturing system by next week that would allow BP to disconnect the equipment faster if a hurricane threatens and hook it back up quickly after the storm passes . Right now , BP would need five days to pull out if there is a hurricane . The new system being developed , which uses a flexible hose , would cut that to two days . The containment system now in place is capturing nearly 1 million gallons per day from the well , which is spewing as much as 2.5 million gallons a day , according to the government 's worst-case estimate . In other developments , BP said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that the catastrophe has cost it $ 2.65 billion so far . The oil giant has also said it would set up a $ 20 billion fund to compensate people and businesses for their losses . BP has lost more than $ 100 billion in market value since the deep-water drilling platform it was operating blew up April 20 , killing 11 workers .

NOAA Alex may have cooled off , but hurricane season is just starting to heat up in the Gulf of Mexico . And absurdly warm oceans combined with still air mean storms will continue . Could Bonnie , Colin , Danielle and the rest of the forthcoming storms spell disaster for BP 's oil spill ? Three major forecasts from the National Hurricane Center -LRB- NHC -RRB- , Accuweather and Colorado State have all called for dramatic hurricane seasons this year . Those predictions are n't particularly meaningful , oddly enough -- and that comes straight from the forecasters themselves . `` The seasonal forecasts are of interest to a lot of people , but they 're not terribly accurate , '' admitted James Franklin , branch chief of the NHC 's Hurricane Specialists Unit . And not particularly meaningful , he says . `` Even if we did do a real good job hitting it year after year , it does n't give you a good indication of where storms are going to go . '' Still , the guidance is useful . And if the first Atlantic hurricane of the season is just a taste of the season to come , we 're in for a bumpy -- and lengthy -- season . So what causes hurricanes , and why is this season so dangerous ? `` The basic idea of a hurricane is one of a heat engine , '' Franklin told FoxNews.com . It converts the energy of the ocean into gale force winds . And this year , the ocean has far more energy than usual . When waters are above about 80 degrees , conditions are ripe for hurricanes , and they can get much hotter in the tropics . `` Waters in the tropical Atlantic between Africa and the Lesser Antilles are just about as warm as we 've ever seen them , '' he said . In a recent update to their annual forecast , Colorado State 's Philip J. Klotzbach and William M. Gray describe them as `` running at near-record warm levels . '' For a hurricane to be created , some pre-existing disturbance near Africa , a low-pressure system for example , forms the spark from which the hurricane will ignite . That tropical weakness moves out into the balmy waters of the Atlantic and gasses up . The second big factor is wind . Strong winds in the upper air disperse tropical waves , disrupting hurricane formation and scattering pent-up heat . The NHC is predicting much more favorable wind patterns this year than last year -- La Nina or neutral conditions , as opposed to the El Nino conditions of strong winds from last year . `` In order to make a hurricane go , the heat coming from the ocean and released in a rising motion in the atmosphere has to be concentrated in one place . If winds in the atmosphere are blowing in different directions , that disperses heat . '' So having uniform winds is important -- and a rare event . Dry air also means water vapor ca n't condense , clouds do n't gather , rain does n't fall and hurricanes do n't form . A third factor is the cyclical nature of the weather . Hurricane activity tends to run in long , 20 - to 30-year cycles . Since 1995 , we 've been in a cycle of increased activity . Alex did n't move over the Gulf oil spill directly , so scientists and meteorologists were unable to directly observe the effects of the weather on the oil . But Franklin thinks we 'll see winds dispersing the oil -- something BP has actively tried to do itself . In that sense , hurricane season may be a blessing for the oil crisis . `` If the storm tracks to the west of the oil , there is the potential that the counter-clockwise circulation of the hurricane could drive some of the oil further toward the U.S. Gulf Coast . Alternatively , a storm tracking to the east of the oil could push the oil further offshore . But , little is understood about the interaction of tropical cyclones and oil , '' the scientists write . Fortunately , there 's no evidence to suggest storms will suck the crude into the clouds , creating a foul rain of oil on coasts . But weather forecasters do n't know enough at present to really predict what will happen . And Franklin is optimistic that BP technicians will cap the well and clean the oil before what-ifs turn into learning situations . `` Hopefully we wo n't learn anything about it .

And in another blow to the oil giant , animal welfare groups Wednesday sued BP for burning alive endangered sea turtles as part of its efforts to get rid of the leaking oil . The `` not enough money '' warning from prominent U.S. lawyer Kenneth Feinberg came as Hurricane Alex disrupted clean-up operations in the Gulf of Mexico and pushed oil deeper into fragile coastal wetlands and once-pristine beaches . About 423 miles -LRB- 681 kilometers -RRB- of American shorelines have now been oiled -- nearly double the amount sullied just two days earlier -- as oil continues to gush into the sea at an alarming rate 10 weeks into the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history . Feinberg , tapped by President Barack Obama to administer the $ 20 billion claims fund , insisted BP will `` pay every eligible claim , '' but cautioned that many perceived damages may not qualify . `` I use that famous example of a restaurant in Boston that says , ' I ca n't get shrimp from Louisiana , and my menu suffers and my business is off , ' '' Feinberg told the House of Representatives Committee on Small Business . `` Well , no law is going to recognize that claim . '' Feinberg said he was still sorting out how to deal with indirect claims like hotels that lose bookings because tourists think the beaches are covered in oil , or people who see their property values decline but live several blocks away from an oiled beach . `` There 's no question that the property value has diminished as a result of the spill . That does n't mean that every property is entitled to compensation , '' he said , adding : `` There 's not enough money in the world to pay everybody who 'd like to have money . '' Feinberg , who headed a compensation fund for victims of the September 11 attacks , assured lawmakers the fund would be `` totally independent '' and said BP had agreed to top up the escrow account as needed to meet proper claims . The British energy giant has already disbursed more than $ 130 million in emergency payments to fishermen and others affected by the slick . Feinberg said lump sum payments would be offered to claimants once the true extent of the damage is assessed . `` It sure would help if the oil would stop , '' he told the committee . Meanwhile the Animal Welfare Institute -LRB- AWI -RRB- and other groups sued BP over the turtles ' deaths and asked a federal court to stop the company 's `` controlled burns . '' `` It is horrifying that these innocent creatures whose habitat has already been devastated by the oil spill are now being burned alive , '' AWI President Cathy Liss told the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana . The lawsuit filed by AWI , Center for Biological Diversity , Turtle Island Restoration Network and Animal Legal Defense Fund said BP was violating the Endangered Species Act and other laws with their `` controlled burns '' in the Gulf of Mexico . They asked the court for a temporary restraining order to stop all burning activities `` until ... mechanisms are implemented that will prevent any additional sea turtles from being burned alive . '' Also on Wednesday , Obama ordered the development of a long-term plan to `` restore the unique beauty and bounty '' of the Gulf Coast . The Long-Term Gulf Restoration Support Plan aims to `` ensure economic recovery , community planning , science-based restoration of the ecosystem and environment , public health and safety efforts , and support of individuals and businesses who suffered losses due to the spill , '' a White House memo said . An estimated 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil a day have been gushing out of the ruptured well since the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig sank on April 22 some 50 miles off the coast of Louisiana . Efforts to permanently plug the leak by drilling relief wells continued despite the rough seas which had forced a halt to skimming operations off the coasts of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . Two containment ships continued to capture the oil at a rate of about 25,000 barrels per day despite seven-foot -LRB- two-meter -RRB- swells . But the rough seas delayed the deployment of a third ship aimed at doubling the containment capacity . And officials warned that drilling and containment will be suspended for about 14 days if the spill zone is threatened by a more direct storm hit . That could delay the completion of the wells until at least September and would dump an additional 490,000 to 840,000 barrels of extra oil into the Gulf . Senior government officials were set to meet with Obama Thursday to discuss whether a new containment system should be installed in the interim . That system would further raise capacity , but would require the current cap to be removed and involve careful manipulation some 5,000 feet -LRB- 1,500 meters -RRB- below the surface .

Coast Guard via AP June 30 : Oily waves come ashore in Orange Beach , Ala. . AP NEW ORLEANS -- BP 's massive oil spill became the largest ever in the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday based on the highest of the federal government 's estimates , an ominous record that underscores the oil giant 's dire need to halt the gusher . The oil that 's spewed for two and a half months from a blown-out well a mile under the sea hit the 140.6 million gallon mark , eclipsing the record-setting , 140-million-gallon Ixtoc I spill off Mexico 's coast from 1979 to 1980 . Even by the lower end of the government 's estimates , at least 71.7 million gallons are in the Gulf . The growing total is crucial to track , in part because London-based BP PLC is likely to be fined per gallon spilled , said Larry McKinney , director of Texas A&M University at Corpus Christi 's Gulf of Mexico research institute . `` It 's an important number to know because it has an impact on restoration and recovery , '' McKinney said . The oil calculation is based on the higher end of the government 's range of barrels leaked per day , minus the amount BP says it has collected from the blown-out well using two containment systems . BP collected a smaller amount of oil than usual on Wednesday , about 969,000 gallons . Measuring the spill helps scientists figure out where the missing oil is , hidden below the water surface with some even stuck to the seafloor . Oil not at the surface damages different parts of the ecosystem . `` It 's a mind-boggling number any way you cut it , '' said Ed Overton , a Louisiana State University environmental studies professor who consults for the federal government on oil spills . `` It 'll be well beyond Ixtoc by the time it 's finished . '' And passing Ixtoc just before the July Fourth weekend , a time of normally booming tourism , is bitter timing , he said . The BP spill , which began after the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion killed 11 workers April 20 , is also the largest spill ever recorded offshore during peacetime . But it 's not the biggest in history . That happened when Iraqi forces opened valves at a terminal and dumped as much as 336 million gallons of oil in 1991 during the Persian Gulf war , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . Initial estimates put that spill at about 460 million gallons , but government estimates later found it to be smaller . As the Gulf gusher continued spewing , the remnants of Hurricane Alex whipped oil-filled waves onto the Gulf Coast 's once-white beaches . The government has pinned its latest cleanup hopes on a huge new piece of equipment : the world 's largest oil-skimming vessel , which arrived Wednesday . Officials hope the ship can scoop up to 21 million gallons of oil-fouled water a day . Dubbed the `` A Whale , '' the Taiwanese-flagged former tanker spans the length of 31\\/2 football fields and is 10 stories high . It just emerged from an extensive retrofitting to prepare it specifically for the Gulf . `` It is absolutely gigantic . It 's unbelievable , '' said Overton , who saw the ship last week in Norfolk , Va. . The vessel looks like a typical tanker , but it takes in contaminated water through 12 vents on either side of the bow . The oil is then supposed to be separated from the water and transferred to another vessel . The water is channeled back into the sea . But the ship 's never been tested , and many questions remain about how it will operate . For instance , the seawater retains trace amounts of oil , even after getting filtered , so the Environmental Protection Agency will have to sign off on allowing the treated water back into the Gulf . `` This is a no-brainer , '' Overton said . `` You 're bringing in really dirty , oily water and you 're putting back much cleaner water . '' The Coast Guard will have the final say in whether the vessel can operate in the Gulf . The owner , shipping firm TMT Group , will have to come to separate terms with BP , which is paying for the cleanup . `` I do n't know whether it 's going to work or not , but it certainly needs to be given the opportunity , '' Overton said . Meanwhile along parts of the Gulf , red flags snapped in strong gusts , warning people to stay out of the water , and long stretches of beach were stained brown from tar balls and crude oil that had been pushed as far as 60 yards from the water . Hurricane Alex churned up rough seas as it plowed across the Gulf , dealing a tough setback to cleanup operations . It made landfall along a relatively unpopulated stretch of coast in Mexico 's northern Tamaulipas state late Wednesday , spawning tornadoes in nearby Texas and forcing evacuations in both countries . Alex weakened to a tropical storm Thursday morning as it moved across Mexico . Although skimming operations and the laying of oil-corralling booms were halted across the Gulf , vessels that collect and burn oil and gas at the site of the explosion were still operating . Efforts to drill relief wells that experts hope will stop the leak also continued unabated . In Florida , lumps of tar the size of dinner plates filled a large swath of beach east of Pensacola after rough waves tossed the mess onto shore . Streaks of the rust-red oil could be seen in the waves off Pensacola Beach as cleanup crews worked in the rough weather to prepare the beach for the holiday weekend . In Grand Isle , La. , heavy bands of rain pounded down , keeping cleanup crews off the water and tossing carefully laid boom around . However , oil had stayed out of the passes . `` All this wave action is breaking up the oil very quickly , '' Coast Guard Cmdr. Randal S. Ogrydziak said . `` Mother Nature is doing what she does best , putting things back in order . '' Natural microbes in the water were also working on the spill . The result was a white substance that looked like mayonnaise , that washed up on some spots along the Grand Isle beach . `` People will be fishing here again , '' Ogrydziak said . `` It may take a while , but people may be surprised that it 's not taking as long as they thought . Look at the -LRB- Ixtoc -RRB- oil spill in Mexico . It was massive and now people are back to using those waters .

Only about 10 kilotons of nuclear explosion capacity and the problem is solved . '' A nuclear fix to the leaking well has been touted online and in the occasional newspaper op-ed for weeks now . Washington has repeatedly dismissed the idea and BP execs say they are not considering an explosion -- nuclear or otherwise . But as a series of efforts to plug the 60,000 barrels of oil a day gushing from the sea floor have failed , talk of an extreme solution refuses to die . For some , blasting the problem seems the most logical answer in the world . Mikhailov has had a distinguished career in the nuclear field , helping to close a Soviet Union program that used nuclear explosions to seal gas leaks . Ordinarily he 's an opponent of nuclear blasts , but he says an underwater explosion in the Gulf of Mexico would not be harmful and could cost no more than $ 10 million . That compares with the $ 2.35 billion BP has paid out in cleanup and compensation costs so far . `` This option is worth the money , '' he says . And it 's not just Soviet boffins . Milo Nordyke , one of the masterminds behind U.S research into peaceful nuclear energy in the 1960s and '70s says a nuclear explosion is a logical last-resort solution for BP and the government . Matthew Simmons , a former energy adviser to U.S. President George W. Bush and the founder of energy investment-banking firm Simmons & Company International , is another calling for the nuclear option . Even former U.S. President Bill Clinton has voiced support for the idea of an explosion to stem the flow of oil , albeit one using conventional materials rather than nukes . `` Unless we send the Navy down deep to blow up the well and cover the leak with piles and piles and piles of rock and debris , which may become necessary ... unless we are going to do that , we are dependent on the technical expertise of these people from BP , '' Clinton told the Fortune\\/Time\\/CNN Global Forum in South Africa on June 29 . Clinton was picking up on an idea mooted by Christopher Brownfield in June . Brownfield is a one-time nuclear submarine officer , a veteran of the Iraq war -LRB- he volunteered in 2006 -RRB- and now a nuclear policy researcher at Columbia University . He is also one of a number of scientists whose theories rely not on nuclear bombs -- he did toy with that thought for a while -- but on conventional explosives that would implode the well and , if not completely plug it with crushed rock , at least bring the flow of oil under control . `` It 's kind of like stepping on a garden hose to kink it , '' Brownfield says . `` You may not cut off the flow entirely but it would greatly reduce the flow . '' Using nuclear blasts for peaceful ends was a key plank of Cold War policy in both the United States and the Soviet Union . In the middle of last century , both countries were motivated by a desire to soften the image of the era 's weapon of choice . Washington had big plans to use peaceful nuclear explosions to build an additional Panama Canal , carve a path for an inter-state highway through mountains in the Mojave Desert and connect underwater aquifers in Arizona . But the experimental plans were dropped as authorities learned more about the ecological dangers of surface explosions . The Soviet program , known as Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy , was launched in 1958 . The project saw 124 nuclear explosions for such tasks as digging canals and reservoirs , creating underground storage caverns for natural gas and toxic waste , exploiting oil and gas deposits and sealing gas leaks . It was finally mothballed by Mikhail Gorbachev in 1989 . The Soviets first used a nuclear blast to seal a gas leak in 1966 . Urtabulak , one of its prized gas-fields in Uzbekistan , had caught fire and raged for three years . Desperate to save the cherished reserves , Yefim Slavsky , then Minister of Light Industry , ordered nuclear engineers to use the most powerful weapon in their arsenal . `` The Minister said , ` Do it . Explode it , ' '' recalls Albert Vasilyev , a young engineer and a rising star in the project who now teaches at the Lenin Technical Institute in Moscow . Vasilyev remembers the technology behind the program with obvious pride . `` The explosion takes place deep underground , '' he says . `` We pinch the pipe , break it and the pipe collapses . '' According to Vasilyev , the blast at Urtabulak sealed the well shut leaving only an empty crater . In all , the Soviets detonated five nuclear devices to seal off runaway gas wells -- succeeding three or four times , depending on who you talk to . `` It worked quite well for them , '' says Nordyke , who authored a detailed account of Soviet explosions in a 2000 paper . `` There is no reason to think it would n't be fine -LRB- for the United States -RRB- . '' But not everything went smoothly . Vasilyev admits the program `` had two misfires '' . The final blast in 1979 was conducted near the Ukrainian city of Kharkov . `` The closest houses were just about 400 meters away , '' Vasilyev recalls . `` So this was ordered to be the weakest of the explosions . Even the buildings and the street lamps survived . '' Unfortunately , the low capacity of the device failed to seal the well and the gas resurfaced . Alexander Koldobsky , a fellow nuclear physicist from the Moscow Engineering and Physics Institute , insists the peaceful nuclear explosions were safe . The people who worked on the program `` were brilliant professionals '' , he says . `` They had a culture of safety , which did not accept the word ` maybe ' , but only accepted the words ` obligation ' and ` instruction . ' Any derivation from these in nuclear technologies is a crime . '' Still , he concedes , `` there were different scenarios of what happened after an explosion . '' At his first blast in a Turkmen gas field in 1972 , `` the stench was unbearable , '' he says . `` And the wind was blowing toward a nearby town . '' He closes his narrow lips into a smile as if refusing to say more . Koldobsky shrugs off any suggestion of fear or emotion when the bomb exploded . `` I felt nothing . I was just doing my job .

Kalty Vazquez of Miami held a bucket in one hand and with the other he spread a green-sandy substance called GreenTech over his plot . Vazquez then raked through the tar and GreenTech and scooped the raked sand with a strainer , leaving mostly clean sand behind . He later demonstrated how GreenTech worked in water , helping to form larger tar balls that are easier to pick up . Watching closely , clipboard in hand and dressed in full rain gear , evaluator Daniel Kuncicky had lots of complicated questions about how the polymer-based product worked . Nearby , another group blanketed the sand with a cotton-fiber roll . The idea was for the oil and tar to adhere to the cotton when it was rolled up . But the group said it worked best when heavy machinery rolled over the cotton and pressed it into the sand . Lacking the machinery , they stomped on the cotton with their feet . Only a small part of the mess was removed when the cotton came up . Bill Vasden Jr. grows his oil spill cleanup solution on 1,500 acres in Tampa . The biodiesel and feed starch farmer believes kenaf , a kind of grass , is the answer to soaking up oil as it washes on shore . Vasden displayed kenaf booms on the beach . Auto mechanics have long used the material to clean oil from their floors , he said . `` It 's a fibrous grass , it 's renewable and we can burn it for energy , '' he said . `` We have 1,500 acres of it already . '' Among those who came to check out the ideas was Buck Lee , chairman of the Santa Rosa Island Authority , which oversees Pensacola Beach . `` Whoever invents the magic dust is going to be a millionaire , '' Lee said , as he handled phone call after phone call from people concerned about the oil-covered beach . Jeff Powell demonstrated a tar-ball rake . Powell 's Pensacola-based company , Ellis Trap and Cage Manufacturing , has long sold crab and bait-fish traps and sand flea rakes . The oil spill has hit his company hard , so Powell said he came up with another idea -- a rake that traps tar balls and filters out the sand . In about 30 minutes he raked his plot of sand and left a clean section . Peat moss is Canadian John Green 's answer . He demonstrated Sphagsorb , a microbe-enhanced peat moss . The product has worked in Canadian oil spills . Ten pounds of the Sphagsorb collects about 40 pounds of oil and tar , he said , as he spread the stuff over his plot . He glommed up a large wad of tar with his gloved hand to show how it caused the tar to stick together and made it easier to remove . Other ideas included spraying microbes onto the sand with containers that looked like bug sprayers , and mesh matting that could be removed from the sand after the tar washes on shore . After an hour , the small section of beach in front of the public walkway where the inventors demonstrated their ideas looked much cleaner than when they started . But evaluators were mum about whether they would choose any of the ideas or how quickly the public might see them in action .

AP NEW ORLEANS -- Oil from the ruptured well in the Gulf of Mexico is seeping into Lake Pontchartrain north of New Orleans , threatening another environmental disaster for the huge body of water that was rescued from pollution in 1990s . The lake rebounded to once again become a bountiful fishing ground and a popular spot for boating and swimming . `` Even the people involved in the restoration did n't believe it could be restored . It was completely written off . It was thought to be an impossible task , '' said John Lopez , a scientist with the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation , which led the restoration effort . `` It has been a dramatic turnabout . '' It is threatened again after a weekend when tar balls and an oil sheen pushed by strong winds from faraway Hurricane Alex slipped past lines of barges that were supposed to block the passes connecting the Gulf of Mexico to the lake . `` Our universe is getting very small , '' said Pete Gerica , president of the Lake Pontchartrain Fishermen 's Association . The oil could be the second setback in five years . Hurricane Katrina knocked out seafood docks and lakeside restaurants in 2005 . The lake 's water quality also took a hit when the Army Corps of Engineers drained the city 's contaminated floodwaters into the lake . `` So far , this stuff has been offshore for the majority of the population in the southeastern portion of Louisiana , '' Anne Rheams , executive director of the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation , said of the oil spill . `` This is bringing it closer to home . '' State authorities closed the lake 's eastern reaches to fishing on Monday , though most of it remained open . Barges were lined up at bayous and passes to stop the oil from coming in , and cleanup crews Tuesday used nets to collect tar balls from marinas and docks . They also planned to lay 9,000 feet of special permeable booms , but the lake was too choppy for skimmer vessels to operate . About 1,700 pounds of oily waste has been collected , said Suzanne Parsons Stymiest , a spokeswoman for St. Tammany Parish . The amount of oil infiltrating 600-square-mile Lake Pontchartrain -LRB- pronounced PAHN-chuh-trayn -RRB- appears small so far . And tests on seafood have not turned up any oil contamination , said Brian Lezina , a state biologist . But the pollution is distressing to the many people in Louisiana who have a deep attachment to the lake . `` You wo n't hear songs about a lot of the marshes in south Louisiana , but you will hear songs about Lake Pontchartrain , '' Lezina said . Out in the Gulf , meanwhile , stormy weather kept skimmers from working offshore Tuesday for yet another day and delayed the hookup of a big new ship intended to suck more crude from the gushing blown-out well a mile underwater . Also , the arrival of a Navy blimp intended to hover above the relief effort was delayed until Friday . Tar balls from the spill also washed up on Texas beaches over the holiday weekend , meaning the disaster now touches all five Gulf Coast states , spanning more than 500 miles of coastline . Lake Pontchartrain , named for the French count of Pontchartrain during the reign of Louis XIV , is on the northern edge of the city . It is connected to the Gulf of Mexico by two main passes : the Rigolets , a winding passage of about 10 miles , and the Chef Menteur , around nine miles long . For centuries , it has been a playground , a source of seafood and a backdoor route to New Orleans for invading British troops and hurricane storm surge . Until the 1970s , its shores were a top destination for city folks who took streetcars and buses to the lake to swim and to dine at restaurants that cooked up the lake 's crabs and other seafood . They played in penny arcades and rode the Zephyr roller coaster at the Pontchartrain Beach amusement park . But pollution shut down the swimming and chased away marine life , and the amusement park closed in the early 1980s . Slowly , the lake revived . In recent years , sightings of dolphins and manatees have delighted locals , and commercial and recreational fishing is thriving . Anthony Montalbano Jr. , the chef and owner of II Tony 's , an Italian seafood restaurant next to the lake , said it has been a struggle to stay open . Katrina swamped his restaurant at Bucktown , a lakeside community in New Orleans that has the feel of a bayou town .

More than 3,000 of the singer 's fans have gathered in Key West through Sunday , Nov. 3 . There are now almost 160 Parrot Head chapters in the U.S. , Australia and Canada with more than 18,000 total members . -LRB- AP Photo\\/Florida Keys News Bureau , Roberto Rodriguez -RRB- AP2002 Singer Jimmy Buffett is just another mad Gulf Coast native when it comes to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill , but with an exception : He 's got millions of fans and a way to help lift spirits over the seemingly endless crisis . Buffett and his Coral Reefer Band will play Sunday on the beach in Gulf Shores , Ala. , which has been sporadically hit by oil for weeks . The show already has been postponed once because of Hurricane Alex , and Buffet is hoping bad weather lurking in the Gulf does n't create problems this weekend . Known for laid-back tunes like `` Margaritaville '' and `` Cheeseburger in Paradise , '' Buffett told The Associated Press in an interview Tuesday that it 's perfectly normal for people to be mad when they see oil washing up on beaches and marshes . `` If you 're born and raised on the Gulf Coast and it 's kind of in you , and you do n't feel anger and rage initially over what 's going on down there , I think you 're a hypocrite , '' he said in a telephone interview from New York . `` That 's the way I felt . Now , what you do with that is a big question . '' Buffett said a beachfront concert seemed like the right thing to do after talking to people on the coast . `` People were going , ` What are you going to do about things ? ' I mean , hell , I ca n't stick my finger in that hole . Everybody wishes they could , '' said Buffett . `` But there 's a huge amount of frustration and probably it will boil over in summertime anger , and I know what I 've done for years is entertain . What I 'm best at is two hours of escapism for people that have to go back and either live jobs that they do n't like or whatever , '' he said . `` It 's that Mardi Gras mentality . '' Born in Mississippi and raised in Alabama , Buffett has lived all over the Gulf Coast . He said memories of the region are laced through his music . `` I have pretty much surrounded myself with Gulf Coast influences for a long time , and ... if you listen to those songs , I think it 's pretty much in there , '' said Buffett , 63 . Buffett , a supporter of President Barack Obama , said the roots of the spill lie with the administration of former President George Bush , which was often criticized for being too cozy with the petroleum industry . `` To me it was more about eight years of bad policy before -LRB- Obama -RRB- got there that let this happen . It was Dracula running the blood bank in terms of oil and leases , '' he said . `` I think that has more to do with it than how the president reacted to it . '' The beach concert on Sunday will also feature Jesse Winchester and Allen Toussaint , who also were in the original lineup . Country singers Kenny Chesney and Zac Brown had to drop out because of prior commitments . Buffett said he is still making phone calls trying to add additional acts for Sunday , but he 's not sure of the final roster .

Michael Paulsen , Houston Chronicle via AP The latest hopes to clean oil near the spewing well in the Gulf of Mexico rests on this massive new skimmer dubbed ' A Whale . ' Residents along the Texas coast are holding out hope that the tar balls washing up on their shores are not a sign of what 's to come . A bucket 's worth of tar balls was discovered over the weekend along the shores of Gavelston , Texas -- more than two months after oil gushing from a blown-out well on the ocean floor first reached Louisiana . Authorities , however , said Tuesday that they do not know whether the tar balls found in Texas were dropped from a contaminated ship passing through the waters . Galveston Mayor Joe Jaworski said he believed the tar balls were a fluke , rather than a sign of what 's to come . `` This is good news , '' he said . `` The water looks good . We 're cautiously optimistic this is an anomaly . '' The crude from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill is still moving , but the fleet of skimmers tapped to clean the worst-hit areas of the Gulf of Mexico is not . A string of small storms has made the water too choppy for the boats to operate for more than a week off Florida , Alabama and Mississippi . The number of tar balls discovered in Texas is tiny compared with what has coated beaches so far in other Gulf states . Still , it still provoked the quick dispatch of cleaning crews and a vow that BP will pay for the trouble . `` Any Texas shores impacted by the Deepwater spill will be cleaned up quickly and BP will be picking up the tab , '' Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said in a news release . The oil 's arrival in Texas was predicted Friday by an analysis from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , which gave a 40 percent chance of crude reaching the area . `` It was just a matter of time that some of the oil would find its way to Texas , '' said Hans Graber , a marine physicist at the University of Miami and co-director of the Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing . About 5 gallons of tar balls were found Saturday on the Bolivar Peninsula , northeast of Galveston , said Capt. Marcus Woodring , the Coast Guard commander for the Houston\\/Galveston sector . Two gallons were found Sunday on the peninsula and Galveston Island , though tests have not yet confirmed the oil 's origin . Woodring said the consistency of the tar balls indicates they could have been spread to Texas water by ships that have worked out in the spill . But there 's no way to confirm how they got there . Hurricane Alex , which blew through the Gulf last week and made landfall along the border between Texas and Mexico , may have played a small role in bringing the oil ashore in Texas by increasing the westerly current near land , Graber said . But it was more likely due to normal coastal currents and local weather patterns . NOAA scientists are looking at local weather , Hurricane Alex and Gulf vessels as possible sources for the tar balls , agency spokeswoman Monica Allen said Monday . The distance between the western reach of the tar balls in Texas and the most eastern reports of oil in Florida is about 550 miles . Oil was first spotted on land near the mouth of the Mississippi River on April 29 . The spill is reaching deeper into Louisiana . Strings of oil were seen Monday in the Rigolets , one of two waterways that connect the Gulf with Lake Pontchartrain , the large lake north of New Orleans . `` So far it 's scattered stuff showing up , mostly tar balls , '' said Louisiana Office of Fisheries Assistant Secretary Randy Pausina . `` It will pull out with the tide , and then show back up . '' New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said assets would be deployed to protect the Lake Pontchartrain basin . Pausina said he expected the oil to clear the passes and move directly into the lake , taking a backdoor route to New Orleans . The news of the spill 's reach comes at a time that most of the offshore skimming operations in the Gulf have been halted by choppy seas and high winds . A tropical system that had been lingering off Louisiana flared up Monday afternoon , bringing heavy rain and winds . Last week , the faraway Hurricane Alex idled the skimming fleet off Alabama , Florida and Mississippi with choppy seas and stiff winds . Now they 're idled by the smaller storms that could last well into this week . Officials have plans for the worst-case scenario : a hurricane barreling up the Gulf toward the spill site . But the less-dramatic weather conditions have been met with a more makeshift response . Skimming across the Gulf has scooped up about 23.5 million gallons of oil-fouled water so far , but officials say it 's impossible to know how much crude could have been sucked up in good weather because of the fluctuating number of boats and other variables . Jerry Biggs , a commercial fisherman in Pass Christian , Miss. , who has had to shut down because of the spill , is now hiring out his 13 boats and 40-man crew to BP for cleanup . He said skimming is severely hampered by the weather . `` This is n't going away . This is n't a sneeze or a hiccup . This is diarrhea for a long time , '' he said . `` My lifestyle is screwed . The thing that I love the most I 'm not going to be able to do anymore . '' The British company has now seen its costs from the spill reach $ 3.12 billion , a figure that does n't include a $ 20 billion fund for damages the company created last month . The storms have not affected drilling work on a relief well that BP says is the best chance for finally plugging the leak . The company expects drilling to be finished by mid-August .

They 're stuck in limbo , '' Tuan Nguyen , deputy director of the Mary Queen of Vietnam Community Development Corp. in eastern New Orleans , said in a recent interview . Nguyen said he has encountered hundreds of workers , mostly deckhands , who lack the documentation BP needs from claimants seeking a piece of the $ 20 billion of the oil giant 's aid fund . `` It 's a very cash-involved industry , '' said Nguyen , whose organization formed after Hurricane Katrina to help the Vietnamese community recover from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 . `` Some of the boat captains or boat owners , they sell fish on the side of the road or directly to families . They do n't have records of that . '' Stuart Smith , an attorney handling oil-spill lawsuits , said seeking aid can be intimidating , and some cash workers fear that they 'll face penalties or prosecution for not paying taxes if they come forward . `` Proving that you worked in that capacity is going to be an issue for a lot of these people because they 're not sophisticated businessmen , '' Smith said . That fear may be why it 's hard to find a laborer willing to talk about the problem . Along Bayou Hopedale , east of New Orleans , a group of men sorting crabs at a ramshackle waterside building declined to answer questions recently . Less than a mile away , Christian Delos Reyes , who until the spill made a living dredging oysters , was helping prepare a boat for cleanup work . He had documented his income and started the BP claims process , he said . But he lamented the fate of others . `` A lot of them do n't pay taxes , '' he said . BP requests tax returns for 2007 through 2009 , but will work with individuals who want to provide other documentation , including wage loss statements , deposit slips , boat registrations , copies of current fishing licenses and other financial statements , the company said in a written response to questions about the process . `` BP will make every effort to keep claimant information confidential but will meet all of its legal obligations , '' the company statement said , adding it will report claims it pays to the IRS . Ken Feinberg , appointed by the White House and BP to administer the aid fund , did n't hold out a lot of hope for people who take cash to avoid taxes . Feinberg administered a similar fund for victims of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . `` I must say under the 9\\/11 fund , which was all public money , we were not sympathetic to paying claims based on cash-only , no tax returns , '' Feinberg said in an interview . `` You go down that road and you 're really opening up this fund to diversion to people who ca n't justify the claims , '' he said . Still , he added , President Barack Obama wants money to get to the people who are entitled to it . `` Maybe there 's some compromise we can reach , '' he said . IRS spokesman Eric Smith in Washington said the agency could not comment on the issues faced by workers who lack documentation . Meanwhile , the seafood industry has organized a charitable corporation to raise money for those who might fall through the cracks of the claims process . The group does n't need the documentation required by BP or government agencies . `` We do n't even have an application process , '' said Kevin Voisin , the group 's head and an executive with Motivatit Seafood in Houma , La. . Using a database of seafood-related companies in the Gulf region , volunteers are contacting managers and asking which workers need help , either because they have applied for aid that has n't arrived yet , lacked the documentation for an application or feared reprisal . `` We do n't need W2s . We do n't need 1040s , '' Voisin said . `` We know the places that are shutting down . We know the communities . '' Associated Press Writer Alan Sayre in New Orleans contributed to this report .

AP NEW ORLEANS -- The exasperation with BP felt by residents of the Gulf states is spreading to shareholders -- and some are taking the oil giant to court . Since the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig disaster on April 20 , BP shares have lost about $ 85 billion in value . The toll for institutional investors who hold 79 percent of the company -- including public and private pension plans -- is around $ 67 billion . BP 's suspension of its quarterly dividend has only exacerbated the damage . At least five individual investor suits have been filed , BP employees are suing over the slide in value of company stock in their 401 -LRB- k -RRB- plans and the New York state comptroller intends to sue over losses to his state 's public employee pension fund . Unlike the across-the-board Wall Street meltdown of 2008 that swept away hundreds of billions of dollars , the damage to U.S. pension plans caused by one plunging stock is minimized by the diversification of their investments . The BP individual retirement savings plan has a sizable investment in BP shares , but it 's reasonable compared with the Enron plans that got wiped out in that company 's collapse . Even so , the plans are n't happy about the red number BP has dropped on their financial statements . Last month , New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli pledged to sue BP , alleging the company misled investors about its safety procedures and its ability to respond to an oil spill and therefore inflated the stock 's price in violation of securities laws . DiNapoli 's office plans to file a motion to join four individual shareholder suits filed in Louisiana and California to form a class action , under which all shareholders , including other pension plans , could join . The $ 133 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund , which DiNapoli serves as trustee , held 19 million BP shares at the time of the disaster . The fund has since trimmed its holdings to 14.6 million shares . During that time , BP suspended its dividend , which is attractive to pension plans because of the investment income it provides . The fund has n't released an exact loss from the sale , citing the pending court action . BP has refused to comment . Feeding the frustration , for both shareholders and Gulf Coast residents , has been BP 's inability to cap its undersea well 40 miles off of Louisiana . Oil has now been gushing for 79 days . BP is drilling two relief wells that are expected to shut off the leak by mid-August . Analyst Pavel Molchanon , who follows BP for Raymond James Financial Inc. , said if that happens , BP would likely reinstate a dividend in 2011 , but Molchanon says U.S. investors should expect less than the 80 cents per share they were getting each quarter before the spill . As for BP workers , a suit filed in Illinois federal court seeks class action status on behalf of all employees with company retirement accounts . Its complaints echo those raised by DiNapoli . As of Jan. 1 , BP stock made up nearly 30 percent of BP employee accounts , or about $ 2.45 billion worth of retirement savings , said Mike Alfred , CEO of BrightScope , a San Diego-based firm that rates about 50,000 401 -LRB- k -RRB- plans . The legal argument likely will center on whether BP workers were allowed to take excessive risk by having too much money in company stock , Alfred said . In perhaps the most high-profile case of this type , Enron Corp. employees received stock that became worth hundreds of millions of dollars -- only to see it become worthless as the company fell apart in 2001 amid scandal . `` The amount of the BP stock in those plans is not exceptional , '' Alfred said . `` There are many more plans that have more company stock . '' Steven Davidoff , a professor at the Ohio State University law school , says history shows that once a class action is granted and large numbers of plaintiffs join in , companies try to settle to avoid the possibility of unmanageable damage awards . Davidoff said the potential settlement value for BP shareholders likely will be less than in cases where a company has `` a record of malfeasance at high management . '' `` This is not so much a fraud case as a nondisclosure case , '' Davidoff said . The plans that have n't sued are still big enough to get management 's attention . `` We do intend to engage BP in a corporate governance discussion at the appropriate time because the shareowner losses are severe given the catastrophic failures related to the oil spill , '' says Patricia Macht , a spokesperson for the California Public Employees Retirement System . Calpers , with $ 205 billion in assets , said it has n't altered its basic five-year `` buy-and-hold '' strategy -- although the value of its BP holdings fell from about $ 585.7 million on April 20 to $ 289.2 million on June 30 . It 's still just a paper loss -- and Calpers retains its shareholder voting power . That power could be used at annual shareholder meetings to vote against upper management and board directors . But BP 's next annual meeting does n't occur until April . Many observers say a shake-up is possible before then , likely involving CEO Tony Hayward . BP did not return a request for comment on any potential conversation with Calpers . Other pension funds , including the $ 96.7 billion Teacher Retirement System of Texas , the $ 47 billion Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement System and the $ 8 billion Louisiana State Employees Retirement System say their BP holdings represent only a tiny fraction of their total investments . None would say what their next action might be . Alabama 's four state pension dumped their BP stock . The executive director of the Retirement Systems of Alabama , David Bonner , said 6.25 million shares were sold in June . The funds lost just over $ 4 million overall on the transactions . But since the funds accumulated $ 25.9 million in dividends over 15 years , `` We 're $ 21 million ahead , '' Bonner said . BP 's traditional employee pension fund has n't lost a dime on BP shares : The fund 's rules forbid it to either buy company stock or make company loans . According to the fund 's 2008 audit , the latest year for which figures are available , its top holding was in rival Royal Dutch Shell with 3.1 percent of its assets invested .

At the same time , BP is readying a series of backup plans in case its current operations go awry . These include connecting the rogue well to existing pipelines in two nearby underwater gas and oil fields , according to company and administration officials . Much of the additional planning has been pushed by the U.S. government , which has urged BP to develop what one official called the `` backup to the backup plan . '' Both BP and the federal government are concentrating on their next steps , particularly because of uncertainty caused by the imminent hurricane season and the protracted political and financial damage caused by the endless spill . Both BP and the Coast Guard continue to state publicly they 're aiming to have a fix in place in early to mid-August . BP has discussed its backup plans only with administration officials , who in turn have briefed President Barack Obama . The July 27 target date is the day the company is expected to report second-quarter earnings and will speak to investors . BP also wants to show progress by July 20 , the day U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron is scheduled to visit the White House . `` In a perfect world with no interruptions , it 's possible to be ready to stop the well between July 20 and July 27 , '' said the head of BP 's Gulf Coast restoration unit , managing director Bob Dudley , in an interview . He added that this `` perfect case '' is threatened by the hurricane season and is `` unlikely .

NEW ORLEANS -- Robotic submarines working a mile underwater removed a leaking cap from the gushing Gulf oil well Saturday , starting a painful trade-off : Millions more gallons of crude will flow freely into the sea for at least two days until a new seal can be mounted to capture all of it . There 's no guarantee for such a delicate operation deep below the water 's surface , officials said , and the permanent fix of plugging the well from the bottom remains slated for mid-August . `` It 's not just going to be , you put the cap on , it 's done . It 's not like putting a cap on a tube of toothpaste , '' Coast Guard spokesman Capt. James McPherson said . Robotic submarines removed the cap that had been placed on top of the leak in early June to collect the oil and send it to surface ships for collection or burning . BP aims to have the new , tighter cap in place as early as Monday and said that , as of Saturday night , the work was going according to plan . If tests show it can withstand the pressure of the oil and is working , the Gulf region could get its most significant piece of good news since the April 20 explosion on the BP-leased Deepwater Horizon rig , which killed 11 workers . `` Over the next four to seven days , depending on how things go , we should get that sealing cap on . That 's our plan , '' said Kent Wells , a BP senior vice president , of the round-the-clock operation . It would be only a temporary solution to the catastrophe that the federal government estimates has poured between 87 million and 172 million gallons of oil into the Gulf as of Saturday . Hope for permanently plugging the leak lies with two relief wells , the first of which should be finished by mid-August . With the cap removed Saturday at 12:37 p.m. CDT , oil flowed freely into the water , collected only by the Q4000 surface vessel , with a capacity of about 378,000 gallons . That vessel should be joined Sunday by the Helix Producer , which has more than double the Q4000 's capacity . But the lag could be long enough for as much as 5 million gallons to gush into already fouled waters . Officials said a fleet of large skimmers was scraping oil from the surface above the well site . The process begun Saturday has two major phases : removing equipment currently on top of the leak and installing new gear designed to fully contain the flow of oil . BP began trying Saturday afternoon to remove the bolted top flange that only partially completed the seal with the old cap . Video images showed robotic arms working to unscrew its bolts . Wells said that could last into Monday depending on whether the flange can be pulled off from above , as BP hopes . If not , a specially designed tool will be used to pry apart the top and bottom flanges . Once the top flange is removed , BP has to bind together two sections of drill pipe that are in the gushing well head . Then a 12-foot-long piece of equipment called a flange transition spool will be lowered and bolted over it . The second piece of pipe inside the well head came as something of a surprise , and raises the possibility that one of the sections of pipe became jammed in the Deepwater Horizon 's blowout preventer , though which the well pipes run . The failure of the blowout preventer , a massive piece of equipment designed to stop the unchecked flow of oil , is partly to blame for the size of the spill . `` That will be an important question to ask when we pull the blowout preventer up to the surface and we 'll figure out where that pipe ultimately landed , '' Wells said . After the flange transition spool is bolted in place , the new cap -- called a capping stack or `` Top Hat 10 '' -- can be lowered . The equipment , weighing some 150,000 pounds , is designed to fully seal the leak and provide connections for new vessels on the surface to collect oil . The cap has valves that can restrict the flow of oil and shut it in , if it can withstand the enormous pressure . That will be one of the key items for officials to monitor , said Paul Bommer , a professor of petroleum engineering at the University of Texas at Austin . `` If the new cap does work and they shut the well in , it is possible that part of the well could rupture if the pressure inside builds to an unacceptable value , '' Bommer wrote in an e-mail Saturday . Ultimately , BP wants to have four vessels collecting oil within two or three weeks of the new cap 's installation . If the new cap does n't work , BP is ready to place a backup similar the old one on top of the leak . The government estimates 1.5 million to 2.5 million gallons of oil a day are spewing from the well , and the previous cap collected about 1 million gallons of that . With the new cap and the new containment vessel , the system will be capable of capturing 2.5 million to 3.4 million gallons -- essentially all the leaking oil , officials said . The plan , which was accelerated to take advantage of a window of good weather lasting seven to 10 days , did n't inspire confidence in the residents of the oil-slicked coast . `` This is probably the sixth or seventh method they 've tried , so , no , I 'm not optimistic , '' said Deano Bonano , director of emergency preparedness for Jefferson Parish . On Saturday he was inspecting beaches at Grand Isle lined with protective boom and bustling with heavy equipment used to scoop up and clean stained sand . `` Even if they turn it off today , we 'll still be here at least another six weeks , on watch for the oil , '' he said .

BP BP is in exclusive talks to sell up to $ 12 billion -LRB- # 8 billion -RRB- of assets to Apache Corporation , an American rival , including a big stake in Alaska 's Prudhoe Bay , the largest oil field in North America , it was reported Sunday . Apache approached BP with the plan a few weeks ago . Negotiations are under way over the structure of the agreement and what other assets could be included . The British oil giant has been trying to sell assets as part of a huge fundraising campaign to meet the costs of its disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . This weekend the company is trying to install a tighter seal over the leaking well , which has been pouring oil since a blowout in April . A relief well that may close it off could be complete before the end of the month . Good news from the gulf could tempt rivals to examine a bid for BP while its share price is still depressed . Oil industry sources said that Exxon , the world 's largest oil company , has been given a green light by the American government to `` take a look '' . `` They have been told there is no problem in principle , '' the source said . A spokesman for Exxon declined to comment , and the sources said it was far from certain that Exxon would make a move . A merger would create a group with a stock-market value of $ 400 billion . If the Apache talks are successful , the deal could at a stroke meet BP 's targets for raising cash from asset disposals . It said it wanted to raise $ 10 billion from disposals , and billions more from bond issues and bank loans . It is unclear what other assets would be included in an any transaction . The cash will help to reassure investors that the cost of the clean-up will not overwhelm the company . Goldman Sachs , the American investment bank , thinks BP could ultimately be forced to pay $ 70 billion in clean-up and compensation costs . The Apache talks are just one of three separate sales processes BP has launched . The second involves its $ 9 billion stake in Pan American Energy , an Argentinian oil producer . CNOOC , the Chinese oil group , and Bridas , a rival Argentinian firm , are considering buying part or all of BP 's 60 percent holding . The third leg is the auction of several asset packages , including its businesses in Venezuela and Colombia , together worth about $ 1 billion , and in Vietnam , which could fetch a similar amount . Apache , worth $ 29 billion , is one of America 's largest independent oil groups . It has a history of doing similar smaller deals with BP . In 2003 it paid $ 1.3 billion for the giant Forties field in the North Sea . Three years later it struck a deal for 18 BP fields in the Gulf of Mexico .

A technological disaster , then a presidential commission examining what went wrong . And ultimately a discovery that while technology marches on , concern for safety lags . Technology is n't as foolproof as it seemed . An offshore oil rig explodes , creating the biggest offshore oil spill in U.S. history . The common thread -- which the new presidential oil spill commission will be looking for -- often is technological arrogance and hubris . It 's the belief by those in charge that they 're the experts , that they know what they 're doing is safe . Add to that the human weaknesses of avoidance , greed and sloppiness , say academics who study disasters . Even before the oil spill commission holds its first meeting Monday in New Orleans , panel co-chairman William Reilly could n't help but point out something he 's already noticed . The technology to clean up after an oil spill `` is primitive , '' Reilly said . `` It 's wholly disproportionate to the tremendous technological advances that have allowed deepwater drilling to go forward . It just has n't kept pace . '' Then he added that government regulation also has n't kept pace . And something else has n't kept up either , Reilly said : how the oil industry assesses and works with the risk of catastrophic damage from spills . Cutting-edge technology often works flawlessly . At first , everyone worries about risk . Then people get lulled into complacency by success and they forget that they are operating on the edge , say experts who study disasters . Corners get cut , problems ignored . Technological disasters , like the BP oil spill , follow a well-worn `` trail of tears , '' said Bob Bea , a University of California Berkeley engineering professor who has studied 630 disasters of all types . Bea is also an expert on offshore drilling and is consulting with the presidential commission . Bea categorizes disasters into four groups . One such group is when an organization simply ignores warning signs through overconfidence and incompetence . He thinks the BP spill falls into that category . Bea pointed to congressional testimony that BP ignored problems with a dead battery , leaky cement job and loose hydraulic fittings . It 's that type of root cause -- not the equipment failure alone -- that the oil spill commission will focus on , including looking at the corporate and regulatory `` culture '' that led to bad decisions , Reilly said . Disasters do n't happen because of `` an evil empire , '' Bea said . `` It 's hubris , arrogance and indolence . '' And disasters will keep on happening . In the future , watch out for problems with the U.S. power grid , Sacramento levee failures , flood protection problems along coastal cities and even some of the newest high-tech airplanes , said Rutgers University professor Lee Clarke , author of the book `` Worst Cases . '' `` There 's nothing safe out there , '' said Yale University professor Charles Perrow , author of the book `` Normal Accidents . '' '' We like to pretend there is and argue afterward , ` That 's why we took the risks because it had n't failed before . ' '' Technological improvements have gradually led to more daring offshore drilling attempts . `` It kind of creeps up on you , '' Energy Secretary Steven Chu said in an interview with The Associated Press . Then suddenly you realize that now only robots can do what people used to do because the drilling is so deep , he said . Clarke put it this way : `` We 've been doing this every day , every year , week in , week out , so next week when we go to 5,000 feet , it will be like last week when we went to 300 feet , '' Clarke said . `` It 's just the arrogant presumption that you have got the thing under control , whatever the thing is . In this case , it 's drilling beyond your depth . '' Paul Fischbeck , a professor of decision sciences at Carnegie Mellon University , said the existence of a blowout preventer -- a final backup system which in this case did n't work -- often encourages people to take extra risks . But the oil industry was so confident in its safety that it used to brag when compared to another high-tech gold standard : NASA . `` They looked more successful than NASA , '' said Rice University oil industry scholar Amy Myers Jaffe . `` They had less mechanical failures . '' The oil rig explosion `` reminds me an awful lot of the NASA accidents , '' said Stanford physics professor Douglas Osheroff , who was on the commission that examined the causes of the space shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003 . `` Obviously none of these systems are fail-safe , '' Osheroff said . `` People do n't spend enough time thinking about what could go wrong . '' And because people are so sure of themselves , when they see something go wrong that they ca n't fix , they accept it , Osheroff said . The Columbia accident investigation board called it `` normalization of deviance . '' Pieces of foam insulation had broken off the shuttle external fuel tank six previous times before that problem proved fatal with Columbia when a piece of foam knocked a deadly hole in a shuttle wing . Hot gas had singed `` O '' rings in space shuttle boosters well before the problem led Challenger to explode at launch in 1986 . Yale 's Perrow pointed to NASA 's shuttles and another BP disaster -- the 2005 Texas City refinery explosion that killed 15 people -- as cases of simply ignoring `` heavy warnings '' from experts . When the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazards Investigation Board looked into the 2005 refinery fire it noted that BP had the same problems with `` safety culture '' that NASA had before Columbia . `` The Texas City disaster was caused by organizational and safety deficiencies at all levels of the BP Corporation , '' the board 's final report said . `` Warning signs of a possible disaster were present for several years , but company officials did not intervene effectively to prevent it . '' There have been times when warnings of disaster are heeded . The Y2K computer bug is noteworthy for prevention , Clarke said . Many people scoffed and criticized the government for making such a big deal of something that turned out to be a fizzle . But that 's because of all the effort to prevent the disaster , Clarke said . Unfortunately , safety costs money , so it 's usually not a priority , Clarke said . Most of the time `` you ca n't get anybody to listen , '' he said . `` We 're very reactive about disasters in the United States . '' People do n't think about them until afterward , he said , and then they say : `` You should have seen that coming . '' "}, {"uid": "1848", "dct": "2010-07-12", "dates": [null, null], "text": "WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration issued a new moratorium Monday on deep-water offshore drilling that is no longer based on water depth and stresses new evidence of safety problems , hoping the revised ban will pass muster with the courts after the initial one was rejected . `` More than 80 days into the BP oil spill , a pause on deep-water drilling is essential and appropriate to protect communities , coasts , and wildlife from the risks that deep-water drilling currently pose , '' Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said in announcing the new moratorium . `` I am basing my decision on evidence that grows every day of the industry 's inability in the deep-water to contain a catastrophic blowout , respond to an oil spill , and to operate safely . '' The new moratorium was panned by industry groups and supported by environmentalists . Last week , a federal appeals court rejected the government 's effort to restore its initial offshore deep-water drilling moratorium , which was issued after the catastrophic Gulf oil spill in April . The moratorium was blocked first last month by U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman . The Justice Department said Monday that it will file a motion with the U.S. District Court seeking a dismissal of that case , because the old moratorium is no longer operative , making the challenge moot . The department also will ask the appeals court to set aside Feldman 's order of last month . The Interior Department said that like the original ban , this one applied to most deep-water drilling activities . The department also said the suspensions in the new moratorium `` are the product of a new decision by the secretary and new evidence regarding safety concerns , blowout containment shortcomings within the industry , and spill response capabilities that are strained by the BP oil spill . '' The new moratorium also establishes a process to gather and analyze new information on safety and response issues , which could allow for identifying conditions to resume certain deep-water drilling activities . Unlike the last moratorium , which applied to waters of more than 500 feet -LRB- 150 meters -RRB- , the new one applies to any deep-water floating facility with blowout preventers . The National Ocean Industries Association , an industry trade group for offshore production , said that while the new moratorium does not apply to anchored facilities using surface blowout preventers , `` such facilities are generally used in shallow water , which makes the new suspension glaringly similar , if not even more restrictive than the original moratorium . It is not immediately clear how many facilities will be impacted . '' In a Question & Answer document , the Interior Department said any count represents a snapshot in time . The document said that at the time of the BP spill , there were 36 floating drilling rigs that would have been affected by the new ban . It was unclear whether the new moratorium would be more or less restrictive than the original one . The offshore industry also complained that while the new moratorium opens the door to lifting the restrictions if industry provides assurance for adequate containment and response , `` The problem for industry is that it is unclear what exactly it will take to convince the administration that such capability exists . In a memo to Michael Bromwich , the new head of the department 's agency that oversees offshore drilling , Salazar said that the moratorium will give industry time to come up with more effective blowout containment strategies and capabilities for deep-water operations . `` I can not conclude at this time that deep-water drilling can move forward in a safe and environmentally sound manner , '' he wrote . Salazar also said that one factor in having the moratorium go through Nov. 30 is that hurricane season runs through that date . `` During this time of year , as we have already seen this year , the ability to contain and respond to a spill is often compromised by weather conditions , '' Salazar wrote . Other industry groups and pro-drilling lawmakers also criticized the new moratorium . `` It is unnecessary and shortsighted to shut down a major part of the nation 's energy lifeline while working to enhance offshore safety , '' said Jack Gerard , president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute . `` The new moratorium threatens enormous harm to the nation and to the Gulf region . '' Sen. Mary Landrieu , a Democrat representing Louisiana in the Senate , said in testimony to the presidential oil spill panel that she was `` alarmed '' at the Interior Department 's statement that its decision is supported `` by an extensive record of existing and new information indicating that allowing new deep-water drilling to commence would pose a threat of serious , irreparable , or immediate harm or damage to the marine , coastal and human environment . '' Landrieu said that statement `` contradicts testimony given by drilling experts and ignores the history of oil and gas operations in the Gulf . '' Lawyers for the companies that sued to block the moratorium did not immediately return calls for comment . Todd Hornbeck , CEO of Covington-based Hornbeck Offshore Services , one of the plaintiff companies , said he did not know how the new moratorium would affect deep-water drilling projects . `` I 've got to review it first , '' he said . Meanwhile , environmental groups expressed support . Catherine Wannamaker , a lawyer for several environmental groups that support the moratorium , said the new one does not appear to be any less restrictive than the first one . `` We continue to believe it 's a necessary safety precaution , '' she said . `` The first moratorium was a rational decision made by -LRB- Salazar -RRB- and should have withstood judicial scrutiny . The new moratorium makes -LRB- his -RRB- reasoning more explicit and is a step in the right direction . '' Jacqueline Savitz , senior campaign director for Oceana , an international ocean conservation group , said the administration had no other choice . `` We commend the president for putting more drilling on hold , '' she said .

Deep-sea robots swarmed around BP 's ruptured oil well Monday in a delicately choreographed effort to attach a tighter-fitting cap that could finally stop crude from gushing into the Gulf of Mexico nearly three months into the crisis . -LRB- AP Photo\\/BP PLC -RRB- NO SALES NEW ORLEANS -- BP robots attached a new , tighter-fitting cap on top of the gushing Gulf of Mexico oil leak Monday , raising hopes that the crude could be kept from polluting the water for the first time in nearly three months . Placing the cap on top of the leak was the climax of two days of delicate preparation work and a day of slowly lowering it into position a mile below the sea . The capping project -- akin to building an underwater Lego tower -- is just a temporary fix , but the oil giant 's best hope for containing the spill . The next unknown is whether the 18-foot-high , 150,000-pound metal stack of pipes and valves will work . BP plans to start tests Tuesday , gradually shutting the valves to see if the oil stops or if it starts leaking from another part of the well . Residents have been skeptical BP can deliver on its promise to control the spill , but the news was still welcome on the coast . Dwayne Touchet , a 44-year-old shrimper from Welsh , La. , said he was relieved to hear the cap was on and can only pray that it works . Touchet is working in the Vessels of Opportunity program , where BP employs local boat owners and fisherman out of work because of the spill . `` It 's not over , there 's still a lot of oil to clean up . We do n't know how it will affect it -LRB- the water -RRB- in the years to come , all we can do is trust in the Lord , '' he said . Around 6:30 p.m. CDT , live video streams trained on the wellhead showed the cap being slowly lowered into place , 11 hours after BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said the company was close to putting the seal in place . BP officials said the device was attached around 7 p.m. . The cap will be tested and monitored to see if it can withstand pressure from oil and gas starting Tuesday morning for six to 48 hours , according to National Incident Commander Thad Allen . On his Facebook page , Allen also shared news of the development . `` Getting there , '' Allen wrote in a status update shortly after the cap landed on the well . The cap will be tested by closing off three separate valves that fit together snugly like pairs of fists , choking off the oil and blocking it from entering the Gulf . BP does n't want the flow of oil to stop instantaneously , said Don Van Nieuwenhuise , director of Professional Geosciences Programs at the University of Houston . Shutting the oil off too quickly could cause another explosion , he said . `` Rather than like a train running into a brick wall , it 'll be more like putting the brakes on slowly , '' he said . `` That 's what they 're aiming for . You can keep the brakes on and everyone arrives alive , or you hit the wall and have big problems . '' Engineers will be watching pressure readings . High pressure is good , because it would mean the leak has been contained inside the wellhead machinery . But if readings are lower than expected , that could mean there is another leak elsewhere in the well . `` Another concern right now would be how much pressure the well can take , '' and whether intense pressure would further damage the well , said Eric Smith , associate director of the Tulane Energy Institute . Even if the cap works , the blown-out well will still be leaking . But the newer , tighter cap will enable BP to capture all the oil , or help funnel it up to ships on the surface if necessary . One of those ships , the Helix Producer , began operating Monday and should be up to its capacity of collecting roughly 1 million gallons of oil a day within a few days , Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said . A permanent fix will have to wait until one of two relief wells being drilled reaches the broken well , which will then be plugged up with drilling mud and cement . That may not happen until mid-August . Meanwhile , the Obama administration issued a revised moratorium on deep-water offshore drilling Monday to replace the one that was struck down by the courts as heavy-handed . The new ban , in effect until Nov. 30 , does not appear to deviate much from the original moratorium , as it still targets deep-water drilling operators while defining them in a different way . Work on the new capping operation began Saturday with the removal of a leaky cap that captured about 1 million of the 1.5 million to 2.5 million gallons of oil the government estimates is spilling from the well every day . Gulf residents closely watched the operation , knowing the damage already done to the biologically rich Gulf and the coast 's two leading industries , fishing and tourism . `` I think we 're going to see oil out in the Gulf of Mexico , roaming around , taking shots at us , for the next year , maybe two , '' said Billy Nungesser , president of Louisiana 's oil-stained Plaquemines Parish . `` If you told me today no more oil was coming ashore , we 've still got a massive cleanup ahead . '' BP `` ca n't do much , but they know how to drill wells , '' dock master Jimmy Beason said at a marina in Orange Beach , Ala. `` I think that by the end of the month it will be stopped , and this work with the cap is part of it . I see the light at the end of the tunnel . '' As of Monday , the 83rd day of the disaster , between 89 million and 176 million gallons of oil had poured into the Gulf , according to government estimates . The spill started April 20 when the Deepwater Horizon rig , leased by BP from Transocean Ltd , exploded and burned , killing 11 workers . It sank two days later .

It seems animals are the first casualties of the tragic accident . FORT JACKSON , La. -- The smallest victims are the biggest challenge for crews rescuing birds fouled with oil from the Gulf of Mexico spill . There 's no way to know how many chicks have been killed by the oil , or starved because their parents were rescued or died struggling in a slick . `` There are plenty of oiled babies out there , '' said Rebecca Dmytryk of the International Bird Rescue Research Center , one of the groups working to clean oiled animals . The lucky ones end up in a cleaning center at Fort Jackson , a pre-Civil War historic site on the Mississippi River delta south of New Orleans . Pelican chicks often come in cold because oil has matted down the fluffy down that 's meant to keep them warm . They must be warmed quickly just to survive long enough to be cleaned . And the youngest must be taught to eat . `` They only know their parents regurgitating food into their mouths . They do n't know how to pick stuff up , '' said Dmytryk , whose organization is working with Tri-State Bird Rescue , a company hired by BP to coordinate animal rescue and cleaning in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . That means tube feeding three times a day . Others , a bit older and accustomed to taking fish from a parent 's throat , must be hand-fed until they can eat fish from a bowl . Adults can be checked a few times a day , but babies needed two staffers ' full-time attention to be sure they are eating and are warm . Many adults and juvenile pelicans get coated with heavy oil diving for fish . That does n't happen with the chicks , though they may wade into oily puddles or get smeared by oil from their parents ' feathers . In general , rescuers do n't go into nesting colonies , said Mike Carloss , a Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries biologist . He said most rescued chicks were near shorelines or were on nests so low that oil washed onto them . Lightly oiled chicks will lose the oil when they shed their down feathers , he said . `` We 've seen a lot of those birds in those stages make it . A lot of them are fledging now . It gives you hope that is the right thing to do . '' Nearly 60 pelican chicks and more than 600 adults were brought to Fort Jackson in June after oil washed onto a rookery on Queen Bess and other nearby islands in coastal Louisiana . They 're among more than 1,000 oiled birds and more than 100 oiled sea turtles rescued since the BP-leased rig Deepwater Horizon exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers . About three-quarters of the birds and all but a handful of turtles have been cleaned in Louisiana . All but two of the sea turtles -- a 150-pound oiled loggerhead dubbed Big Mama and an 85-pound loggerhead that was sick but free of oil -- are juveniles , ranging from saucer - to dinner-plate size . Doses of fluids , antibiotics and a mix of cod-liver oil and mayonnaise used to help break up the oil they 've swallowed are administered based on the animal 's weight . But the basic treatment is the same . `` The difference is it takes five people to lift Big Mama and her sister . It only takes one person to lift the little guys , '' said Michele Kelley , Louisiana 's sea turtle and marine mammal stranding coordinator . Baby turtles leave their sandy nests and head straight for the sea knowing everything a turtle needs to know . Chicks need far more care . Keeping them warm can be the biggest challenge , and tern chicks are among the hardest to keep alive because they 're so small , said IBRRC staffer Mark Russell . The birds lose body heat through their skin , and smaller animals have more skin in proportion to their size than larger creatures . Some of the tern chicks are smaller than a tennis ball . The chicks also tend to be dehydrated and malnourished . `` If they 're dehydrated , they do n't want to eat because they feel sick , '' Russell said . And they 're so small that it 's hard to keep a tube down their throats to give water and liquid food . In the week he 'd been in Louisiana , he knew of two or three tern chicks that died , Russell said Friday . Once a chick is eating on its own , staff have as little contact with it as possible . `` We do n't want to be raising what is commonly referred to as a pier rat , '' said Wendy Fox , director of Pelican Harbor Seabird Station , the Miami rehabilitation center where the pelican chicks were moved Saturday . The babies will be housed next to adult `` role models , '' and eventually with adults , Fox said . Their pens also have pools deep enough to dive for fish . Pelicans take five to six months to reach independence . At Fort Jackson , one of the youngsters perched alongside a pool and flapped its wings energetically . `` See that ? '' `` He 's almost ready to learn to fly !

Frank Lautenberg , who is requesting an investigation into the oil company 's success in securing a drilling contract in Libya . Abdel Basset al-Megrahi , a Libyan intelligence agent convicted in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 , won early release from prison last year after a doctor testified that he was near death and it would be compassionate to let him die a free man . But there are suggestions that Megrahi , who was given just weeks to live but is still alive and kicking , may have been the linchpin in BP 's efforts to secure drilling rights in the Gulf of Sidra . `` The prospect that oil contracts between BP and the government of Libya may have affected the release , as well as new questions about the veracity of medical reports detailing Mr. Megrahi 's health at the time , are disturbing developments that demand the attention of Congress , Lautenberg , D-N.J. , wrote to Sens. John Kerry , D-Mass . , and Richard Lugar , R-Ind . , the co-chairmen of the Foreign Relations Committee . The explosion of the plane over Lockerbie , Scotland , killed 270 people , including 189 Americans . The same doctor who called for his release now says Megrahi could live for years . The U.K.-based BP , which is responsible for the oil spill that has been gushing into the Gulf of Mexico for 85 , admitted that in 2007 it raised concern that a `` prisoner transfer agreement with the Libyan government might hurt '' the oil deal , according to Lautenberg . Megrahi originally had not been part of the prisoner transfer , but former British Secretary of State for Justice Jack Straw later cited `` overwhelming interests for the United Kingdom '' in including Megrahi . BP could earn as much as $ 20 billion from the deal with Libya , set to begin next month . `` It is shocking to even contemplate that BP is profiting from the release of a terrorist with the blood of 189 Americans on his hands , '' Lautenberg wrote . `` The families of the victims of Pan Am flight 103 deserve to know whether justice took a back seat to commercial interests in this case .

This is a rush transcript from `` Glenn Beck , '' July 12 , 2010 . This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated . GLENN BECK , HOST : I wrote this book -- took me almost two years to write it . It 's a New York Times number one bestseller . Thank you for that . If you do n't have it , it 's available everywhere -- `` The Overton Window . '' But I want to read something to you that relates to what you are going to talk about . This comes from Edward Bernays . He 's the author of `` Propaganda . '' He 's the guy that Goebbels learned propaganda from , worked for the Wilson administration . He says , `` The conscious and intelligent manipulation of organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in a democratic society . Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country . '' Now , I have taken things like that and made them into fiction to show you what could happen . Let 's go into facts now . We have been showing you radicals and radical agendas . The president makes decisions in minutes and hours on some things and yet takes forever on others that seem to be an emergency to most Americans . Yet , the media witnesses it and stays silent . Media is now being silenced and no one is even reporting on the silence . Why is the media being kept from covering the BP oil spill ? Here are a few things . First , a pilot wanted to take a photographer from the Times-Picayune of New Orleans to snap photographs of the oil slicks blackening the water . Response from a BP contractor who answered the phone last month of the command center was swift and absolute . That 's the contractor . I think I understand that . What about the government ? The New York Times reported that the owner of the seaplane that was set to go out with a photographer - he said , `` We were questioned extensively , who was on the aircraft , who did they work for . The minute we mention the media , the answer was , ` Not allowed . ' '' The Times article continued , `` Last week , Sen. Bill Nelson , a Democrat from Florida , tried to bring a small group of journalists with him on a trip that was taking -- he was taking them through the gulf on a coast guard vessel . Mr. Nelson 's office said the coast guard agreed to accommodate reporters and camera operators . But at about 10:00 p.m. in the evening before the trip , someone from the Department of Homeland Securities Legislative Affairs Office called the senator 's office to tell him that no journalist would be allowed . '' America , the founders knew that the republic could not stand without checks and balances , without three equal branches -- the judicial , the legislative and the executive branch . But you also needed a free press . We have the most radicalized president this nation has ever seen . And the media is not telling you that they are being forced to sit on the sidelines in the biggest national disaster in this country 's 234-year history . And now , with Attorney General Eric Holder -- he 's announced his investigation of the gulf oil spill -- may not just include BP . Watch : ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER : There are a variety of entities and a variety of people who are the subjects of that investigation . And for people to conclude that BP is the focus of this investigation might not be correct . BECK : Who wants to bet that means Halliburton ? BP -- OK , who is the focus of this ? I do n't know . Halliburton -- I bet every dollar on it . Transocean , the owner of the rig that BP leased ? But is it possible that there is even a wider net cast ? Maybe Exxon - Mobil , Chevron -- all U.S. oil companies . We know that this president does n't like oil . We know that Barack Obama had already reached the conclusion even before obtaining all available information as with the police in Cambridge who acted stupidly . When he was asked if he had spoken with the CEO of B.P. , here is what he said . PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : I have not spoken to him directly and here is the reason , because my experience is when you talk to a guy like a B.P. CEO , he is going to say all the right things to me . I 'm not interested in words . I 'm interested in action . BECK : What does that mean ? He will sit down and talk to Ahmadinejad , but what does a guy like him mean ? Obama had his mind made up before he even met the man . And I 'm not sticking up for B.P. . Now , Holder is investigating and who knows who he is investigating in the gulf ? We do n't know . We do n't know what is even going on there . America , I fear the radical revolutionaries have our country by the throat and they are in charge . We showed you the Black Panther who says he wants to kill white cracker babies . We showed you the Weather Underground who said the same thing . These people have ties to the White House in a myriad of ways . Eric Holder is opening the floodgates giving them permission to do what they want to do . He 'll look the other way , except on things that they think need fundamental transformation . I am worried about the people who have already threatened violence . And I do n't think it 's unjustified , because I 'm going to show you another story that no one in the media seems to really care about from Houston , Texas . It was an exploding box of candy at a woman 's home this weekend , a story you wo n't believe you have n't heard . BECK : All right , America . Tonight , we have been talking to you about radical revolutionaries , the people who say and have done in the past crazy things -- violent things . Then I told you about what is happening in the gulf coast . Let me take you to Houston , Texas , in a story that I do n't think you probably have heard . It may be unrelated , but I wonder who will find at the other end of a pipe bomb disguised as a box of chocolates . It was left on the doorstep of a home in a quiet street in Houston , Texas when it was found by a 60-year-old woman . She is actually 62 . She is the homeowner . When she opened up the box of chocolate , it exploded and nails and tacks and shrapnel blew into her face . Imagine your grandmother having nails driven into her face . These nails and shrapnel blew so high they were found on the roof of their home . Officials say the bomb looks to be put together by professionals because of the wiring . Now , is there anything to this story ? Initial reports mention that it was n't known whether the woman was the intended target or the home was . They 're sending a house chocolates ? And the name on the chocolate -- it was misspelled , but it was the woman 's name on the package . Fortunately for her , injuries are not life-threatening but the woman appears to be -- are ready for this , see if this makes it relevant -- the wife of president of the Adams Resources Exploration Corporation . That is an oil company . Her husband is an oil company executive , a company that is actively engaged in the exploration and development of domestic oil and gas properties primarily along the gulf coast of Texas and Louisiana . Gosh , why does n't this story find its way into the media ? I 'm just trying to -- I 'm just trying to figure this out . Radicals are being wound up , new ones . And those from the 1960s Nancy Pelosi cries about are the tea parties . But no one mentions these radicals . And now , actual violence on an oil executive 's wife . Police say it looks professional . The Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms Unit is now looking into it . If we can just get the Department of Justice to be investigating , well , then I know we will get to the bottom of it . What do you say -- just for the heck of it , what do you say we stay on top of it as well ? We could use your help . If you are in the gulf coast region , some weird stuff is going on .

AP July 12 : The new containment cap is lowered over the broken wellhead at the site of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . BP , via AP NEW ORLEANS -- BP 's work to cap its Gulf of Mexico gusher was in limbo Wednesday after the federal government raised concerns the operation could put damaging pressure on the busted well and make the leak worse . White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said the government did n't want potentially dangerous pressure tests on a new , tighter cap that has been placed on the well to go ahead until BP answers questions about possible risks . Gibbs said he did not consider the delay to be `` some giant setback , '' describing it as `` a series of steps ... that are being taken in order to ensure that what we 're doing is being done out of an abundance of caution to do no harm . '' A top BP executive said there was no guarantee the company will get approval to go ahead with closing the cap , which is meant to be a temporary fix until the well is plugged from underground . Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles told The Associated Press in an interview that BP is trying to resolve the government 's concerns . `` I do n't know whether we will get that approval or not , '' Suttles said . `` I hope we do . '' At the same time , BP on its own temporarily halted the drilling of two relief wells that are designed to plug the gusher permanently with cement and mud . That work was halted for up to 48 hours as a precaution because it 's not yet clear what effect the testing of the new cap could have on it , the company said . The delays were a stunning setback after the oil giant finally seemed to be on track following nearly three months of failed attempts to stop the spill , which has sullied beaches from Florida to Texas and decimated the multibillion dollar fishing industry . BP had zipped through weekend preparations and gotten the 75-ton cap in place Monday atop the well . The plan was to stop the oil and pump excess to ships , raising hopes the gusher could be checked . BP was getting ready to test pressure on the well by closing valves in the cap when the government intervened late Tuesday . Word of the delay broke as video showed BP 's undersea robots busily swarming around the seafloor site . Suttles said the government wants to verify that the casing , or the piping in the well , is intact and that the oil would stay contained if BP shuts the well in . Suttles said the next step would depend on the outcome of a meeting of BP and government officials early Wednesday afternoon . Gibbs said Energy Secretary Steven Chu , U.S. Geological Survey chief Marcia McNutt and other government scientists have asked a series of questions to ensure that the integrity of the blowout preventer and the well itself are preserved . `` We want to conduct structural testing in order to make sure that the well is safe and secure , '' Gibbs told reporters at the White House . Oil continued to spew nearly unimpeded into the water , with no clear timeline on when it would stop . BP shares were down more than 2 percent in afternoon trading in London after recouping some of their oil spill losses earlier this week , when the cap project seemed to be moving ahead . The cap would be a stopgap until a permanent fix that requires plugging the broken well underground with cement and heavy drilling mud , a more stable seal than capping the well from the top . The timeline for the relief well and a backup one has always been hazy , with company and federal officials giving estimates ranging from the end of July to the middle of August before it can be completed . Suttles urged Gulf residents is to be patient . `` We 're going to get this thing stopped as fast as we can , '' he said . `` If it is not in the next couple of days with the test , we 'll do it with the relief wells . '' On the Alabama coast , Joyce Nelson said every bit of news from the spill site increases her stress and sparks a new round of telephone calls between friends and relatives in Bayou La Batre , where the seafood industry is virtually shut down because of the spill . The slowdown at the rig site just made things worse . `` Everybody 's calling everybody . It 's hectic , '' said Nelson . `` Everybody is worried about them blowing the whole thing out . If that happens , there 's nothing they can do but let it drain out . '' Roger N. Anderson , a marine geologist at Columbia University , said he believes BP and government scientists are just being very cautious and he 's not worried . Freezing work on the relief well may mean scientists are worried that clamping down the cap will push new pressure all the way down to the depths of the broken well , he said . `` So I would n't panic , is the answer . They 're going to be very , very deliberate about this , '' Anderson said . Assuming BP gets the green light to do the cap testing after the extra analysis is finished , engineers need to shut off lines already funneling some oil to ships to see how the cap handles the pressure of the crude coming up from the ground . Finally , they would shut the openings in the 75-ton metal stack of pipes and valves gradually , one at a time , while watching pressure gauges to see if the cap would hold or if any new leaks erupted . The operation could last anywhere from six to 48 hours , once it gets started . As of Wednesday , the 85th day of the disaster , between 92 million and 182 million gallons of oil had spewed into the Gulf since the Deepwater Horizon rig leased by BP exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers .

AP July 12 : The new containment cap is lowered over the broken wellhead at the site of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . BP , via AP In the meantime , oil continued spewing into the Gulf . The oil giant had been scheduled to start slowly shutting off valves Tuesday on the cap , aiming to stop the flow of oil for the first time in three months . BP was initially ahead of schedule on its latest effort to plug the leak . The cap was designed to be a temporary fix until the well is plugged underground . A series of methodical , preliminary steps were completed before progress stalled . Engineers spent hours on a seismic survey , creating a map of the rock under the sea floor to spot potential dangers , like gas pockets . It also provides a baseline to compare with later surveys during and after the test to see if the pressure on the well is causing underground problems . An unstable area around the wellbore could create bigger problems if the leak continued elsewhere in the well after the cap valves were shut , experts said . `` It 's an incredibly big concern , '' said Don Van Nieuwenhuise , director of Professional Geoscience Programs at the University of Houston . `` They need to get a scan of where things are , that way when they do pressure testing , they know to look out for ruptures or changes . '' It was unclear whether there was something in the results of the mapping that prompted officials to delay . Earlier , BP Vice President Kent Wells said he had n't heard what the results were , but he felt `` comfortable that they were good . '' National Incident Commander Thad Allen met with the federal energy secretary and the head of the U.S. Geological Survey as well as BP officials and other scientists after the mapping was done . `` As a result of these discussions , we decided that the process may benefit from additional analysis , '' Allen said in a statement . He did n't specify what type of analysis would be done , but said work would continue until Wednesday . Assuming BP gets the green light to do the cap testing after the extra analysis is finished , engineers need to shut off lines already funneling some oil to ships to see how the cap handles the pressure of the crude coming up from the ground . Finally , they would shut the openings in the 75-ton metal stack of pipes and valves gradually , one at a time , while watching pressure gauges to see if the cap would hold or if any new leaks erupted . The operation could last anywhere from six to 48 hours , once it gets started . Scientists will be looking for high pressure readings of 8,000 to 9,000 pounds per square inch . Anything lower than 6,000 might indicate previously unidentified leaks in the well . The oil giant was optimistic about the latest effort after other attempts failed , and White House officials earlier expressed optimism Tuesday . But BP has said all along they were working carefully so as to not jeopardize the effort to stop the biggest offshore oil spill in U.S. history and one of the nation 's worst environmental disasters . If the cap works , it will enable BP to stop the oil from gushing into the sea , either by holding all the oil inside the well machinery like a stopper or , if the pressure is too great , channeling some though pipes to as many as four collection ships . Earlier , Allen stressed there were no guarantees on the latest measure and urged patience from Gulf residents . Along the Gulf Coast , where the spill has heavily damaged the region 's vital tourism and fishing industries , people anxiously awaited the outcome of the painstakingly slow work . `` I do n't know what 's taking them so long . I just hope they take care of it , '' said Lanette Eder , a vacationing school nutritionist from Hoschton , Ga. , who was walking on the white sand at Pensacola Beach , Fla. `` I ca n't say that I 'm optimistic -- It 's been , what , 84 days now ? -- but I 'm hopeful , '' said Nancy LaNasa , 56 , who runs a yoga center in Pensacola . The cap is just a stopgap measure . To end the leak for good , the well needs to be plugged at the source . BP is drilling two relief wells through the seafloor to reach the broken well , possibly by late July , and jam it permanently with heavy drilling mud and cement . After that , the Gulf Coast faces a long cleanup . The leak began after the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling platform exploded on April 20 , killing 11 workers . As of Tuesday , the 84th day of the disaster , between 90.4 and 178.6 million gallons of oil had spewed into the Gulf .

The blast killed 11 workers . Since then , oil has been pouring into the Gulf from a blown-out undersea well , though BP said it finally choked off the flow Thursday afternoon . BP finally choked off the flow of oil into the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday , 85 days and up to 184 million gallons after the crisis unfolded . Then began a tense 48 hours of watching to see whether the capped-off well would hold or blow a new leak . The big , billowing brown cloud of crude at the bottom of the sea disappeared from the underwater video feed for the first time since the disaster began in April , as BP closed the last of three openings in the 75-ton cap lowered onto the well earlier this week . The company stopped far short of declaring victory over the biggest offshore oil spill in U.S. history and one of the nation 's worst environmental disasters , a catastrophe that has killed wildlife and threatened the livelihoods of fishermen , restaurateurs , and oil industry workers from Texas to Florida . The news elicited joy mixed with skepticism from wary Gulf Coast residents following months of false starts , setbacks and failed attempts . Alabama Gov. Bob Riley 's face lit up when he heard the oil flow had stopped . `` That 's great . I think a lot of prayers were answered today , '' he said . President Barack Obama called it a positive sign , but cautioned : `` We 're still in the testing phase . '' Stephon LaFrance , an oysterman in Louisiana 's oil-stained Plaquemines Parish who has been out of work for weeks , called it a lie . `` I do n't believe they stopped that leak . BP 's trying to make their self look good , '' he said . Then a waiting period began . Engineers will monitor pressure gauges and watch for signs of leaks elsewhere in the well . The biggest risk : Pressure from the oil gushing out of the ground could fracture the well and make the leak even worse . High pressure is good because it shows there 's only a single leak . Lower pressure could mean more leaks farther down in the well . BP expects to keep the oil trapped in the cap for 48 hours before it decides if the approach is working . The stoppage came 85 days , 16 hours and 25 minutes after the first report of the Deepwater Horizon explosion . Somewhere between 94 million and 184 million gallons have spilled into the Gulf , according to government estimates . BP said the oil stopped flowing into the water at 2:25 p.m. CDT after engineers gradually dialed down the amount of crude escaping through the last of three valves in the cap . The $ 20 billion that BP has set aside to pay for losses caused by the spill will start making payments in early August . Ken Feinberg , who is in charge of paying individuals and businesses for lost income , told government officials in Louisiana on Thursday that he expected a seamless transition from BP management to his . BP has 35 offices in the Gulf Coast area accepting claims . BP 's use of chemicals to disperse the oil has come under renewed scrutiny . The company has used at least 1.8 million gallons of dispersants on the Gulf 's surface and 5,000 feet deep at the source of the leak . Earthjustice has filed a federal lawsuit in Florida to force the Environmental Protection Agency to turn over safety studies on the chemicals . BP says the chemicals have kept much of the spill from reaching the Gulf coast . Biologists say oil has smeared at least 300 to 400 pelicans and hundreds of terns in the largest seabird nesting area along the Louisiana coast , a sharp escalation in wildlife harmed by BP 's Gulf of Mexico oil spill . The finding underscores that official tallies of birds affected by the spill could be significantly underestimating the scope of damage . The government counts only oiled birds collected for rehabilitation or found dead . Oiled birds in the many nesting areas that dot the Gulf coast typically are left in place and not counted in official tallies . A government investigation of the deadly explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig is to resume next week . The Coast Guard and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement have scheduled five more days of hearings , from July 19-23 , in a New Orleans suburb . A panel of officials from each agency heard six days of testimony in May from rig workers , company executives , government regulators and others . A witness list for next week 's hearings was n't immediately released . A House panel approved legislation Thursday to overhaul the government agency responsible for regulating offshore drilling . The bill would divide the agency into three parts : one for leasing and permitting ; another for inspections and investigations ; and a third to collect revenue . The first group of sea turtles that are part of a sweeping effort to save threatened and endangered hatchlings from death in the oily Gulf of Mexico have been released into the Atlantic Ocean . Fifty-six endangered Kemp 's ridley turtles were released on a beach at Florida 's Canaveral National Seashore this week , the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said Thursday .

BP , via Reuters NEW ORLEANS -- BP engineers were back to the slow work of trying to choke the Gulf of Mexico oil gusher with an untested cap after replacing a leaky pipe Thursday , the latest delay in the uncertain fix . Kent Wells , a BP PLC vice president , said at a news briefing in Houston that the overnight leak in a pipe on the side of the towering , 75-ton capping stack was fixed by replacing the assembly , called a `` choke line . '' The work sent the oil giant back to restarting preparations for testing whether the cap can stop the oil without blowing a new leak in the well . If it works , the cap will be a temporary fix until BP can drill into the gusher to plug it for good from underground , where the seal will hold better . `` Bear with us , '' Wells said . The leak was discovered after two of the three valves on the cap that can open or shut the device had been closed , bringing BP and government scientists , who are also watching , tantalizingly close to starting a 48-hour test of how the well and cap withstand the pressure . Wells had warned that the process of getting ready and then choking the oil a mile below the sea , at a depth only submarine robots can reach , consisted of many precise , individual steps . `` Any one of these steps can take longer than anticipated , '' Wells said Wednesday , before the leak disrupted work . Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the Obama administration 's point man on the disaster , said at a briefing it 's not clear yet whether the cap , which was mounted on the well Monday , will ultimately be used to shut in the oil or to channel it through pipes to collection ships overhead . `` I have a high degree of confidence we can substantially decrease the oil coming into the environment , '' Allen said . The cap remains a temporary fix , he said , until one of two relief wells BP is drilling can reach the gusher underground and plug it permanently with heavy drilling mud and cement . `` Make no mistake , the number one goal is to kill the well ... to stop it at the source , '' he said . The test will involve closing off all three openings in the cap to the Gulf , in theory stopping the oil leaking into the Gulf . BP will be monitoring pressure under the cap . High pressure is good , because it shows there 's only a single leak . Low pressure , below 6,000 pounds per square inch or so , could mean more leaks farther down in the well . BP expects to keep the oil trapped in the cap for 48 hours before it decides if the approach is working . With the leaking pipe replaced , BP had to start from a few steps back to resume preparations for the test . Preparations included letting more oil pour out of the cap temporarily and turning off a pipe that had been sending some of the oil to a collection ship , so that the full force of all the erupting crude would go into the cap . Engineers also had to recheck equipment and move undersea robots that perform the work back into position . Wells was hesitant to give a firm timeframe for when the test could start , but expected it to be Thursday . `` We 're going to keep moving forward with this , '' Wells said . Allen said a committee of scientists and engineers will monitor the results and assess every six hours , and end the test after 48 hours to evaluate the findings . `` I was gung-ho for this test and I remain gung-ho for this test , '' he said Wednesday . If the cap works , it will enable BP to stop the oil from gushing into the sea , either by holding all the oil inside the well machinery like a stopper or , if the pressure is too great , channeling some through lines to as many as four collection ships . Allen said the testing will also help prepare for the hoped-for permanent fix by the relief wells . The mapping of the sea floor that was done to prepare for the cap test and the pressure readings will also help them determine how much mud and cement will be needed to seal off the well underground . Drill work was stopped on one relief well because it was not clear what effect the testing of the cap could have on it . Work on the other relief well had already been stopped according to plan . The government estimates 1.5 million to 2.5 million gallons are leaking every day . As of Thursday , the 86th day of the disaster , between 93.5 million and 184.3 million gallons of oil had spewed into the Gulf since the Deepwater Horizon rig leased by BP exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers .

Based on a recent study by the University of Hawaii , March 2011 will go out more like a sea monster -- thanks to the BP oil spill . As BP abruptly halts efforts to cap the open Gulf Coast rig and drill a relief well , spring 2011 bodes badly . According to a simulation conducted by the scientists at the University of Hawaii at Manoa , oil from the Deepwater Horizon leak could reach Georgia , the Carolinas , and even Europe by day 360 of the spill . July 15 marks day 87 . The study , titled `` The long-term fate of the oil spill in the Atlantic , '' uses a high-resolution ocean flow simulator called Ocean General Circulation Model for the Earth Simulator -LRB- OFES -RRB- . Researchers based their analysis on the fate of 8 million buoyant particles -- which are representative of the oil spilled . `` The paths of the particles were calculated in eight typical years over 360 days from the beginning of the spill ... From these eight typical years , five were selected to create an animation for which the calculated extent of the spill best matches current observational estimates , '' said Fabian Schloesser , graduate assistant in the Department of Oceanography . In addition , researchers used the following assumptions : Within 150 days of the April 20 spill -LRB- that is , by September -RRB- , BP will have stopped the oil flow ; an estimated 50,000 barrels of oil from the Deepwater Horizon rig will leak each day for those 150 days ; northeasterly winds in October and November will push the oil east along the U.S. coastline ; and 20 % of the oil must pass through a narrow channel of the Florida Current , which will filter the oil via a bottleneck . The purpose of the study is to `` help guide research and mitigation efforts , '' according to a press release from the school . Axel Timmermann , professor of Oceanography , and Oliver Elison Timm also worked on the simulation . Both are from the SOEST International Pacific Research Center , which is sponsored by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology -LRB- JAMSTEC -RRB- , NASA and NOAA . Wednesday morning , BP halted testing of a new temporary well cap following a federal call to re-evaluate the testing procedure . On Monday , BP installed the 75-ton cap to slow the flow of oil in the Gulf of Mexico until a permanent fix with cement and mud could take place . On Tuesday , BP began to close the cap 's three valves to analyze the effect on internal pressure and check for leaks surrounding the rig .

It remains unclear how long it will take to repair the leak , which forced the suspension of tests , which began Wednesday afternoon -- already a day later than originally scheduled . The initial delay occurred as federal officials sought additional assurances from BP that the high pressure tests 5 thousand feet below the surface would not risk more damage to the well . The tests involve slowly closing three valves on the cap and measuring the oil pressure that builds up over a 48 hour period . The results will help BP and federal officials determine whether the cap is capable of temporarily shutting off the flow of oil , or if additional leaks exist inside the well . This information will play a crucial role in the final strategy for stopping the leak . As a precaution , BP has temporarily suspended drilling two relief wells during pressure testing of the cap . Company officials expect to finish the first relief well by the end of July and begin pumping heavy drilling mud through it to permanently plug the leak -- a process they hope to complete in August . Results from the cap tests will give BP and the government a better idea of whether the leaking well is strong enough to withstand the pressure of the drilling mud , without suffering additional breaches . The results will also play a role in what course of action BP takes once it resumes drilling of the relief wells -- whether the cap is used to temporarily stop the flow of oil out of the well or whether it 's used to funnel oil into lines leading to ships on the surface . The initial 24 hour delay angered some coastal residents , who feared the extra time for analysis would simply allow more oil to spill from the well and wash up on their shores . `` What the hell is so much more important than this ? '' said Mona Santiny , a lifelong resident of Grand Isle , Louisiana . `` We do n't want any answers . We want a solution . '' Federal authorities said the delay was out of an abundance of caution . `` I understand and everybody understands this has been a substantial impact on our environment , on the Gulf Coast , the people , the culture , '' said National Incident Commander Thad Allen . `` We all understand the difficult times we 're going through . And what we did n't want to do was compound that problem by making an irreversible mistake . '' FOX News covers the action from all the angles .

AP NEW ORLEANS -- The waiting game continued Saturday morning as engineers kept vigil over the massive cap holding back oil from BP 's busted Gulf well , their eyes glued to monitors in a faraway control room that displayed pressure readings , temperature gauges and underwater images . Their round-the-clock work deciphering a puzzle of data from undersea robots and instruments at the wellhead is helping BP and the government determine whether the cap is holding tight as the end of a critical 48-hour testing window approaches . Signs so far have been promising but inconclusive . Saturday afternoon will mark two full days since BP stopped the oil from leaking into the Gulf and entered into the pressure-testing phase . At that point engineers could offer more definitive evidence that the cap is working , or call for more testing . At any time before then , they could also reopen the cap and allow some oil to spill into the sea again . Scientists are watching for leaks either in the well itself or the sea floor . Kent Wells , a BP PLC vice president , said on an evening conference call that engineers had found no indication that the well has started leaking underground . `` No news is good news , I guess that 's how I 'd say it , '' Wells said . One mysterious development was that the pressure readings were not rising as high as expected , said retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man on the crisis . Allen said two possible reasons were being debated by scientists : The reservoir that is the source of the oil could be running lower three months into the spill . Or there could be an undiscovered leak somewhere down in the well . Allen ordered further study but remained confident . `` This is generally good news , '' he said . But he cautioned , `` We need to be careful not to do any harm or create a situation that can not be reversed . '' Inside BP 's command center hundreds of miles away in Houston , engineers , scientists and technicians have been carefully monitoring reams of data around the clock , BP 's chief operating officer , Doug Suttles , told The Associated Press Friday . Other engineers watched on monitors aboard ships at sea . `` You 've got a very , very focused group of people because this is very important , '' Suttles said . Asked if people are nervous , knowing the whole world is watching and government officials are sitting with them to monitor their work , Suttles replied : `` I would n't say they are nervous . I would use the word focused . '' Throughout the day , no one was declaring victory -- or failure . President Barack Obama cautioned the public `` not to get too far ahead of ourselves , '' warning of the danger of new leaks `` that could be even more catastrophic . '' Even if the cap passes the test , more uncertainties lie ahead : Where will the oil already spilled go ? How long will it take to clean up the coast ? What will happen to the region 's fishermen ? And will life on the Gulf Coast ever be the same again ? On Thursday , BP closed the vents on the new , tight-fitting cap and finally stopped crude from spewing into the Gulf of Mexico for the first time since the April 20 oil-rig explosion that killed 11 workers and unleashed the spill 5,000 feet down . With the cap working like a giant cork to keep the oil inside the well , scientists kept watch in case the buildup of pressure underground caused new leaks in the well pipe and in the surrounding bedrock that could make the disaster even worse . Pressure readings after 24 hours were about 6,700 pounds per square inch and rising slowly , Allen said , below the 7,500 psi that would clearly show the well was not leaking . He said pressure continued to rise between 2 and 10 psi per hour . A low pressure reading , or a falling one , could mean the oil is escaping . But Allen said a seismic probe of the surrounding sea floor found no sign of a leak in the ground . Benton F. Baugh , president of Radoil Inc. in Houston and a National Academy of Engineering member who specializes in underwater oil operations , warned that the pressure readings could mean that an underground blowout could occur . He said the oil coming up the well may be leaking out underground and entering a geological pocket that might not be able to hold it . But Roger N. Anderson , a professor of marine geology and geophysics at Columbia University , said the oil pressure might be rising slowly not because of a leak , but because of some kind of blockage in the well . `` If it 's rising slowly , that means the pipe 's integrity 's still there . It 's just getting around obstacles , '' he said . He added that `` any increase in pressure is good , not bad . '' The cap is designed to prevent oil from spilling into the Gulf , either by keeping it bottled up in the well , or by capturing it and piping it to ships on the surface . It is not yet clear which way the cap will be used if it passes the pressure test . Either way , the cap is a temporary measure until a relief well can be completed and mud and cement can be pumped into the broken well deep underground to seal it more securely than the cap . The first of the two relief wells being drilled could be done by late July or August . In a positive sign , work on the relief wells resumed Friday . The project had been suspended earlier this week for fear that the capping of the well could interfere with it . There was no end in sight to the cleanup in the water and on shore . Somewhere between 94 million and 184 million gallons have spilled into the Gulf , according to government estimates . In Orange Beach , Ala. , long strands of white absorbent boom strung along the shore were stained chocolate brown after a fresh wave of BB-size tar balls washed up . Charter boat captains who ca n't fish because of the spill patrolled the shore , looking for oil slicks . Fishing guides spent their time ferrying Coast Guard personnel . A flotilla of fishing boats operating as skimmers plied the waters across the Gulf . Large sections of the Gulf Coast have been closed to fishing and shellfish harvesting . Many fishermen have been hired out by BP to do cleanup work . Cade Thomas , a 38-year-old fishing guide from Pine , La. , said the whole mentality of the place is different . `` It 's all changed dramatically . The fishing stories are n't there , '' he said . `` There 's no stories to tell except where we went to today and how much oil we saw . '' In Grand Isle , La. , most of the summer rental cottages are vacant , tables at the single high-end seafood restaurant are empty , and souvenir shops are barely doing enough business to pay the bills . A hand-painted sign along the main road rechristens the tourist town `` Grand Oil . '' Folks are grateful the gusher has been stopped , but many say it is too late to save this summer . Thousands of tourists have gone elsewhere . Scientists can not say for certain what the long-term environmental effect will be . But long after the well is finally plugged , oil could still be washing up in marshes and on beaches as tar balls or patties . There is also fear that months from now , those tar balls could move west to Corpus Christi , Texas , or travel up and around Florida to Miami or North Carolina 's Outer Banks . Capping the well was a milestone in the long catastrophe , but people should n't let their guards down , said Billy Nungesser , the president of Plaquemines Parish , one of the hardest hit areas along the Gulf .

NEW ORLEANS -- BP and the Obama administration offered significantly differing views Sunday on whether the capped Gulf of Mexico oil well will have to be reopened , a contradiction that may be an effort by the oil giant to avoid blame if crude starts spewing again . Pilloried for nearly three months as it tried repeatedly to stop the leak , BP PLC capped the nearly mile -LRB- kilometer -RRB- - deep well Thursday and wants to keep it that way . The government 's plan , however , is to eventually pipe oil to the surface , which would ease pressure on the fragile well but would require up to three more days of oil spilling into the Gulf . `` No one associated with this whole activity ... wants to see any more oil flow into the Gulf of Mexico , '' Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer , said Sunday . `` Right now we do n't have a target to return the well to flow . '' An administration official familiar with the spill oversight , however , told The Associated Press that a seep and possible methane were found near the busted oil well . The official spoke on condition of anonymity Sunday because an announcement about the next steps had not been made yet . The concern all along -- since pressure readings on the cap were n't as high as expected -- was a leak elsewhere in the wellbore , meaning the cap may have to be reopened to prevent the environmental disaster from becoming even worse and harder to fix . The official , who would not clarify what is seeping near the well , also said BP is not complying with the government 's demand for more monitoring . When asked about the official 's comments , BP spokesman Mark Salt would only say that `` we continue to work very closely with all government scientists on this . '' Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the Obama administration 's spill response chief , insisted Sunday that `` nothing has changed '' since Saturday , when he said oil would eventually be piped to surface ships . The government is overseeing BP 's work to stop the leak , which ultimately is to be plugged using a relief well . Allen decided to extend testing of the cap that had been scheduled to end Sunday , the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said . That means the oil will stay in the well for now as scientists continue run tests and monitor pressure readings . The official did n't say how long that would take . Officials at the Department of Homeland Security referred questions to a statement issued by Allen ; neither he nor BP officials could explain the apparent contradiction in plans . Suttles ' comments carved out an important piece of turf for BP : If Allen sticks with the containment plan and oil again pours forth into the Gulf , even briefly , it will be the government 's doing , not BP 's . The company very much wants to avoid a repeat of the live underwater video that showed millions of gallons of oil spewing from the blown well for weeks . `` I can see why they 're pushing for keeping the cap on and shut in until the relief well is in place , '' said Daniel Keeney , president of a Dallas-based public relations firm . The government wants to eliminate any chance of making matters worse , while BP is loath to lose the momentum it gained the moment it finally halted the leak , Keeney said . `` They want to project being on the same team , but they have different end results that benefit each , '' he said . Oil would have to be released under Allen 's plan , which would ease concerns that the capped reservoir might force its way out through another route . Those concerns stem from pressure readings in the cap that have been lower than expected . Scientists still are n't sure whether the pressure readings mean a leak elsewhere in the well bore , possibly deep down in bedrock , which could make the seabed unstable . Oil would be have to be released into the water to relieve pressure and allow crews to hook up the ships , BP and Allen have said . So far , there have been no signs of a leak . `` We 're not seeing any problems at this point with the shut-in , '' Suttles said at a Sunday morning briefing . Allen said later Sunday that scientists and engineers would continue to evaluate and monitor the cap through acoustic , sonar and seismic readings . They 're looking to determine whether low pressure readings mean that more oil than expected poured into the Gulf of Mexico since the BP-leased Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 , killing 11 people and touching off one of America 's worst environment crises . `` While we are pleased that no oil is currently being released into the Gulf of Mexico and want to take all appropriate action to keep it that way , it is important that all decisions are driven by the science , '' Allen said in a news release . `` Ultimately , we must ensure no irreversible damage is done which could cause uncontrolled leakage from numerous points on the sea floor . '' Both Allen and BP have said they do n't know how long the trial run will continue . It was set to end Sunday afternoon , but the deadline -- an extension from the original Saturday cutoff -- came and went with no word on what 's next . After little activity Sunday , robots near the well cap came to life around the time of the cutoff . It was n't clear what they were doing , but bubbles started swirling around as their robotic arms poked at the mechanical cap . To plug the busted well , BP is drilling two relief wells , one of them as a backup . The company said work on the first one was far enough along that officials expect to reach the broken well 's casing , or pipes , deep underground by late this month . The subsequent job of jamming the well with mud and cement could take days or a few weeks . It will take months , or possibly years for the Gulf to recover , though cleanup efforts continued and improvements in the water could be seen in the days since the oil stopped flowing . Somewhere between 94 million and 184 million gallons -LRB- 356 million and 697 million liters -RRB- have spilled into the Gulf , according to government estimates . The spill has prevented many commercial fishermen from their jobs , though some are at work with the cleanup . Some boat captains were surprised and angry to learn that the money they make from cleanup work will be deducted from the funds they would otherwise receive from a $ 20 billion compensation fund set up by BP . The fund 's administrator , Kenneth Feinberg , told The Associated Press on Sunday that if BP pays fishermen wages to help skim oil and perform other cleanup work , those wages will be subtracted from the amount they get from the fund . Longtime charter boat captain Mike Salley said he did n't realize BP planned to deduct those earnings , and he doubted many other captains knew , either . `` I 'll keep running my boat , '' he said Sunday on a dock in Orange Beach , Alabama , before heading back into the Gulf to resupply other boats with boom to corral the oil . `` What else can I do ?

BP has been named in at least three lawsuits brought under the federal law known as RICO , which stands for Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations . Transocean , which leased the ill-fated Deepwater Horizon drilling rig to BP , has been named in two lawsuits filed in Louisiana and Florida . The lawsuits accuse both companies of committing wire and mail fraud over a number of years by filing false documents with the U.S. government , and by misleading investors through other documents and falsehoods . They also claim both companies are guilty of bribery because they are part of an overall oil and gas industry effort to `` infiltrate '' federal regulators by providing favors such as alcohol and drugs , sex , golf and ski trips , concert and sports tickets , and more . `` The pattern of racketeering activity engaged in by defendants involves a scheme to fraudulently create a pretense of safety to the public while , at every turn , seeking to avoid the costs associated with actually conducting their operations in a safe manner , '' claims a lawsuit filed by Louisiana attorney Daniel Becnel and others on behalf of a restaurant seeking to represent a huge class of businesses suffering economic loss from the oil spill . RICO , passed by Congress in 1970 , contains both a civil and criminal component , but both of them rely on proof of longterm violations of at least two specific crimes from a lengthy list . The attraction of the civil portion , which are being used in the current lawsuits , is that any damages would be tripled . In the past , civil RICO cases have often been followed by criminal prosecutions . The Justice Department has not ruled out using RICO in its ongoing criminal investigation of the Deepwater Horizon explosion , which killed 11 rig workers and triggered a massive oil spill that has affected five Gulf Coast states . Criminal convictions can lead to prison sentences of 20 years on each racketeering count , plus hefty fines and forfeiture of ill-gotten gains . `` We are investigating any possible violations of the law , '' said Justice Department spokeswoman Hannah August . BP declined comment on the RICO allegations . Transocean did not respond to a request for comment . Florida attorney Peter Prieto , a former federal prosecutor , said it might be a stretch for the Justice Department to bring a criminal RICO case when there might be easier-to-prove offenses . `` If it 's a simpler crime , that 's what they are going to do . Prosecutors are going to use RICO when it is truly applicable or when it involves organized crime , '' said Prieto , who is not involved in the oil spill cases . `` It is kind of a hammer , but if the facts fit RICO , you can use RICO . '' Even as use of RICO in criminal cases has waned somewhat , it 's become increasingly popular on the civil side . This year alone , RICO lawsuits have been filed against the Roman Catholic Church over priest abuses ; Toyota over its sudden acceleration problems ; a group of title insurers over alleged overcharges ; and online cigarette vendors over lost tax revenue . In March , pharmaceutical giant Pfizer was ordered by a Boston jury to pay $ 142 million in damages for wrongly marketing the epilepsy drug Neurontin as treatment for migraines and bipolar disorder . The difficulty in the BP and Transocean cases , some experts say , is finding evidence tying the companies ' actions to damages caused by the spill . On the criminal side , a prosecutor would have to have ironclad proof of criminal intent , not just negligence or stupidity . `` The problem is just connecting the dots , '' said Thomas Walker , an Idaho attorney who has tried about 20 civil RICO cases and maintains a blog on RICO . `` The fraudulent communications , if they were fraudulent , went from BP to the government . The damage was not caused by the letter , it was caused by the oil spill . '' The RICO lawsuits are among more than 200 filed against BP , Transocean and other companies seeking damages for economic losses , environmental damage and shareholder losses . A federal judicial panel will meet July 29 in Boise , Idaho , to consider whether to consolidate some or all of them for pretrial purposes . Potential damages from those lawsuits would come on top of the $ 20 billion BP has pledged to set aside to pay claims and other spill cleanup costs . Most of the criminal allegations in the RICO lawsuits are taken from testimony and documents produced by congressional investigations of the spill , documents filed with financial regulators and investors , and even investigative news articles by The Associated Press and other news outlets . For example , the Louisiana complaint charges that : -- According to an AP story , an independent firm hired by BP in 2009 found the company was violating its own policies by failing to have key engineering documents aboard the deepwater drilling rig Alantis . The study was never disclosed to regulators . -- BP filed documents showing it had a solid response plan for a catastrophic oil spill , when in fact it `` lacked any meaningful ability '' to resond . -- BP repeatedly failed to disclose to the U.S. Interior Department a range of safety concerns about the Deepwater Horizon , including use of a risky well cementing technique and problems with pockets of flammable natural gas . -- Transocean assured investors and regulators that it had an excellent safety record , when in fact it was responsible for an increasing number of accidents on deepwater drilling rigs . -- Both companies are part of an oil industry effort to prevent the Minerals Management Service -- now renamed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management -- from imposing tough rules , in part through industry events where government officials were given cocaine , marijuana and alcohol , had sex with company executives and received gifts ranging from exotic travel to concert tickets .

The government said Monday that oil was seeping into the Gulf after days of warning that the experimental cap on the oil well could cause more leaks . But it declared the development insignificant and forged ahead with BP 's plan for finally sealing the hole in the ocean floor . Engineers have been checking -- using underwater cameras and monitoring pressure and seismic readings -- to see whether the well would hold or spring a new leak , perhaps one that could rupture the sea floor and make the disaster even worse . Small amounts of oil and gas started coming from the cap late Sunday , but `` we do not believe it is consequential at this time , '' retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said . Also , seepage from the sea floor was detected over the weekend less than two miles away , but Allen said it probably has nothing to do with the well . Oil and gas are known to ooze naturally from fissures in the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico . At briefing in Washington , Allen said BP could keep the cap closed at least another 24 hours as long as the company remained on alert for leaks . Since the cap was put in place Thursday , beachgoers have reported less oil fouling the shore . Bob Broadway , 41 , of Huntsville , Ala. , said his vacation spot in Orange Beach , Ala. , has improved from a month ago . Then , he said , the oil was thick `` like chocolate '' and the beach smelled like `` an old mechanic 's garage . '' `` The beach looks better now than before , '' he said Monday . BP and the government had been at odds over the company 's desire to simply leave the cap in place and employ it like a giant cork until a relief well being drilled deep underground can be used to plug the well permanently . Allen initially said his preference was to pipe oil through the cap to tankers on the surface to reduce the slight chance that the buildup of pressure inside the well would cause a new blowout . That plan would require releasing millions more gallons of oil into the ocean for a few days during the transition -- a spectacle BP wants to avoid . On Monday , Allen said unless larger problems develop , he 's not inclined to open the cap . Also on the table : Pumping drilling mud through the top of the cap and into the wellbore to stop up the oil flow . The idea is similar to the failed top kill plan that could n't overcome the pressure of the geyser pushing up . BP said it could work now because there 's less oil to fight against , but it was n't clear how such a method would affect the cap 's stability . Allen said the relief well was still the plan for a permanent fix . BP and the government are still trying to understand why pressure readings from the well are lower than expected . Allen offered two possible explanations : The reservoir the oil is gushing from is dwindling , or there is an undiscovered leak somewhere down in the well . Work on a permanent plug is moving steadily , with crews drilling into the side of the ruptured well from deep underground . By next week , they could start blasting in mud and cement to block off the well for good . Killing the well deep underground works more reliably than bottling it up with a cap . Somewhere between 94 million and 184 million gallons have gushed into the Gulf over the past three months in one of America 's worst environmental crises . BP PLC said the cost of dealing with the spill has now reached nearly $ 4 billion . The company said it has paid $ 207 million to settle claims for damages .

AFP In an effort to defuse what will likely be the biggest point of contention in their Tuesday White House meeting , British Prime Minister David Cameron is expected to tell President Obama that the release of convicted Pan Am Flight 103 bomber Abdel Baset al-Megrahi was `` wrong . '' In their first White House meeting , the two leaders are also expected to discuss Afghanistan , BP 's handling of the oil spill in the Gulf and its alleged role in the release of al-Megrahi . In an interview with BBC news , Cameron , who was elected prime minister in May , said he `` deeply regrets '' the pain the decision caused , but asserted that the release of al-Megrahi in August of last year was the decision of the Scottish government alone . `` All I know is , as leader of the opposition , I could not have been more clear that I thought the decision to release al-Megrahi was completely and utterly wrong , '' be told the BBC . Al-Megrahi was convicted in 2001 and sentenced to life in prison for his role in the December 1988 bombing that killed 259 people on board and 11 people on the ground in Lockerbie , Scotland . Al-Megrahi , who suffered from prostate cancer , was released in August 2009 by Scottish officials on `` compassionate grounds '' after he was given only 3 three-months to live . Al-Megrahi received a hero 's welcome when he returned to his native Libya -- where he is still living -- almost one year later . Just as British-owned BP sealed the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico , the company came under fire again , but this time for allegations that BP , which has lucrative oil contracts in Libya , lobbied the British government in 2007 to proceed with a UK-Libya prisoner transfer agreement . BP has acknowledged it warned the Labor government of a possible `` negative impact on UK commercial interests , '' but denies there were any discussions with either the UK or Scottish government about al-Megrahi . British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Saturday there was no evidence BP had any connection with al-Megrahi 's release , but there is little doubt Prime Minister Cameron , who travels to Capitol Hill for meetings with House and Senate leadership Tuesday , will be peppered with BP questions . Just last week New York Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer called on the company to suspend oil drilling plans in Libya until the company 's role in the release of al-Megrahi is investigated . `` The bottom line is simple : If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck , then it just might be a corrupt deal between BP , the British government and Libya , '' said Schumer , who lost numerous constituents in the December 21 , 1988 , bombing , `` Back in 2007 , BP and the Libyan government struck a $ 900 million oil deal that the prime minister , Tony Blair , helped coordinate , '' said Schumer in a news conference with reporters . `` But the deal ran into roadblocks , and BP admits that it pushed the British government to expedite a prisoner exchange agreement with Libya to smooth the way for an oil deal . We then know that the British government agreed to release al - Megrahi based on a fraudulent doctor 's prognosis that he only had three months to live . All of a sudden , once Megrahi is released , all the roadblocks to that oil deal are removed and , lo and behold , the oil deal is finally approved . If anyone thinks this is a coincidence , I have them a bridge to sell them in Brooklyn , '' the senior senator from New York charged . In his interview with BBC , Cameron said on the topic , `` I have no idea what BP did . I am not responsible for BP . '' But BP and the oil spill the in the gulf have strained relations between the U.S. and U.K. since the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion on April 20th . And as British prime minister , Cameron has had to lead the defense of the British-owned company amid harsh criticism from the American government and its citizens affected by the spill . June was an especially tough month for relations . As tens of thousands of barrels of oil continued to spill into the Gulf , President Obama , who early on in the environmental disaster referred to the company as `` British Petroleum , '' said he would have fired BP CEO Tony Hayward . The president also embraced the idea that the oil company suspend its quarterly dividend and criticized BP for spending money on a PR campaign . The angry words from Washington produced a backlash in the U.K. , where millions of British retirees depend on BP , the world 's third-largest oil company , for their pensions . And Cameron had promised to press Obama during their one-on-one first meeting during the G8\\/G20 in Toronto , for a dollar amount so BP would have an idea of the final costs related to the oil spill . No such request was made , at least publicly . Relations between the two countries seem to have simmered since Hayward was pulled from handling the oil spill 's day-to-day operations and President Obama sat down with BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg . The administration 's meeting with BP executives in June led to the company 's announcement of a $ 20 billion escrow fund over 4 years , to pay claims to Gulf Coast residents and business owners affected by the spill . Following the four hour meeting with senior administration officials , the chairman also announced the suspension of dividend payments to shareholders and the creation of a $ 100 million fund to assist out of work oil workers following the government 's six month moratorium on deepwater drilling . Tuesday 's Oval Office meeting will be the second time the two world leaders are meeting , and the first time in the U.S. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said of all topics to be discussed , Afghanistan topped the U.S. 's list of priorities . There are now approximately 10,000 British troops in Afghanistan as part of the NATO led effort and the British have seen an increase in causalities as of late . The U.K. hopes to have withdrawn all its forces by 2015 . Asked if Obama would try to dissuade Cameron from naming a target date , Gibbs said , `` it is hard to look that far into the future . Obviously , the president has committed to July of 2011 as a date of our transition and begin to , based on -- judging that based on the conditions on the ground to begin removing some of the troops that -- that the president added as a part of our increased resources there over the past couple years . '' Following their Oval Office sit down , Obama and Cameron will participate in an East Room joint press conference . The events speak to the often described `` special relationship '' between the U.S. and U.K. , but its a welcome Prime Minister Cameron 's predecessor did not receive . President Obama welcomed British Prime Minister Gordon Brown to the White House just six weeks after being sworn in himself , but the meeting between the president and the prime minister of one of the U.S. 's biggest allies was lackluster . Many Brits considered it a snub that Brown was only received for an Oval Office sit down meeting -- no joint press conference in the East Room or Rose Garden as his predecessor Tony Blair frequently participated in during his tenure with former President George W. Bush . Of course , Blair 's relationship with Bush was questioned back at home with many charging Bush treated Blair as a `` lap dog . '' According to Heather Conley of Center for Strategic and International Studies , a think tank in Washington , in forging his relationship with this U.S. president , Cameron needs to strike a balance between the perceived `` subordinate , ` poodle ' relationship '' he had with Bush , and Gordon Brown 's `` dour , technocratic approach . '' `` It remains to be seen if the two leaders will develop that ` special ' chemistry that has been historically evident between American and British leaders but appears to be somewhat elusive between President Obama and other world leaders , '' said Conley . Conley added that Cameron should be given credit , after only two months on the job , for making some `` gutsy political calls '' like publicly apologizing for British actions related to the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre in Northern Ireland ; announcing a significant reduction in government spending as well as increasing taxes to reduce the U.K. 's budget deficit ; announcing that British forces will leave Afghanistan no later than 2015 ; and last , but certainly not least , politically navigating the fallout over the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . As part of his schedule while in the states , according to the British embassy , the prime minister will have breakfast with Vice President Joe Biden , travel to Capitol Hill for meetings with House and Senate leaderships , as well as have a sit down with Arizona Republican Senator John McCain . Also on Tuesday , Cameron will have his first sit-down interview with a U.S. television outlet since becoming prime minister -- with ABC 's Diane Sawyer . On Wednesday , the Prime Minister will travel to Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier before proceeding to the Pentagon for military briefings on Afghanistan . He will then travel to New York for meetings with U.S. business leaders , and with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon . He also will have dinner with the Mayor of New York , Michael Bloomberg .

BP has suddenly stopped awarding contracts for oil skimmers and protective boom to combat the spill in the Gulf , leaving hundreds of contractors out of work , an industry source told Fox News . DRC Group , which has more than 480 vessels in the Gulf laying boom and skimming crude in shallow waters , let go about 50 percent of its workers this week after BP changed course , the source said . The Alabama-based emergency contractors have been employing more than 750 fishermen , oystermen and oil response technicians since the spill began and have laid 100 miles of boom to prevent oil from reaching the vulnerable shoreline . But after 85 days of crisis work , BP finally capped its broken well last week , and appears to have changed its calculus in contracting work to manage the effects of the spill , the source said . There is still an enormous amount of oil in the water to be skimmed or contained with boom , but the source suggested they are backing off on those efforts . Many fishermen who have been employed in oil cleanup projects had been otherwise driven out of work by the oil spill . BP never signed contracts more than five days out because it did n't want to be left with outstanding liabilities if the situation at sea changed abruptly , the source said .

AP July 16 , 2010 : Workboats operate near the Transocean Development Drilling Rig II at the site of the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico . The wellhead has been capped and BP is continuing to test the integrity of the well before resuming production . AP ON THE GULF OF MEXICO -- Key ships stationed over BP 's crippled well in the Gulf of Mexico were ordered to evacuate Thursday ahead of Tropical Storm Bonnie , and engineers have grown so confident in the leaky cap fixed to the well head that they will leave it closed while they are gone . Tropical Storm Bonnie , which blossomed over the Bahamas and was to enter the Gulf of Mexico by the weekend , could delay by another 12 days the push to plug the broken well for good using mud and cement , retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen and BP officials conceded . Even if it 's not a direct hit , the rough weather will push back efforts to kill the well by at least a week . `` While this is not a hurricane , it 's a storm that will have probably some significant impacts , we 're taking appropriate cautions , '' Allen said in Mobile , Ala. . Allen issued the order Thursday night to begin moving dozens of vessels from the spill site , including the rig that 's drilling the relief tunnel engineers will use to permanently throttle the free-flowing crude near the bottom of the well . Some vessels could stay on site , he said . `` While these actions may delay the effort to kill the well for several days , the safety of the individuals at the well site is our highest concern , '' he said in a statement . A week of steady measurements through cameras and other devices convinced Allen they do n't need to open vents to relieve pressure on the cap , which engineers had worried might contribute to leaks underground and an even bigger blowout . The cap was attached a week ago , and only minor leaks have been detected . Allen said earlier in the day that evacuating the vessels could leave the well head unmonitored for up to a few days . He said he ordered BP to make sure that the ships carrying the robotic submarines watching the well are the last to leave and the first to return . It was unclear Thursday night whether some of the vessels would go back to port or head further south in the Gulf out of the path of the storm and await orders once the storm passes . The Coast Guard cutter Decisive , the hurricane guard for the vessels at the spill site , was awaiting instructions . In an evacuation , the Decisive is the last vessel to leave the area . Bonnie caused flooding in Puerto Rico , the Dominican Republic and Haiti before reaching tropical storm strength later Thursday , and Allen said crews expected sustained wind above 39 mph at the spill site by early Saturday . Seas already were choppy in the Gulf , with waves up to five feet rocking boats as crews prepared to leave , and more of the smaller boats involved in the coastal cleanup were called into port , Coast Guard Rear Adm. Paul Zukunft said . Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said he expects local leaders in coastal parishes to call for evacuation of low-lying areas as early as Friday morning . At the spill site , the water no longer looks thick with gooey tar . But the oil is still there beneath the surface , staining the hull of cutters motoring around in it . One large vessel -- the Helix Q4000 -- is burning off oil collected from the water , and bright orange flames flared at the side of the ship . Scientists say even a severe storm should n't affect the well cap , nearly a mile beneath the ocean surface 40 miles from the Louisiana coast . `` Assuming all lines are disconnected from the surface , there should be no effect on the well head by a passing surface storm , '' said Paul Bommer , professor of petroleum engineering at University of Texas at Austin . Charles Harwell , a BP contractor monitoring the cap , was also confident . `` That cap was specially made , it 's on tight , we 've been looking at the progress and it 's all good , '' he said after his ship returned to Port Fourchon , La. . Before the cap was attached and closed a week ago , the broken well spewed 94 million to 184 million gallons into the Gulf after the BP-leased Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers . Work on plugging the well came to a standstill Wednesday , just days before authorities had hoped to complete the relief shaft . Allen said Thursday he has told BP to go ahead preparing for a second measure called a static kill that would pump mud and cement into the well from the top , a move he said would increase the relief well 's chances for success . BP will have to get final approval from Allen before starting the procedure . Vice President Joe Biden visited cleanup workers in southern Alabama , and said he was cheered the cap could remain on .

Refresh page for updates . Last complete story appears below : MIAMI -- A tropical depression racing toward the Gulf of Mexico Thursday increased pressure on BP and the U.S. government to decide whether to evacuate dozens of ships at the site of the ruptured oil well . The National Hurricane Center in Miami said a cluster of thunderstorms in the Bahamas formed into a tropical depression Thursday morning . It could reach the spill site within two and a half days , said Lexion Avila , a senior hurricane specialist . She said they were awaiting an evacuation order for key vessels . Work on plugging the well is at a standstill just days before the expected completion of a relief tunnel to permanently throttle the free-flowing crude . Worse yet , the government 's spill chief said foul weather could require reopening the cap that has contained the oil for nearly a week , allowing oil to gush into the sea again for days while engineers wait out the storm . `` This is necessarily going to be a judgment call , '' said retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , who was waiting to see how the storm developed before deciding whether to order any of the ships to leave . BP spokesman Scott Dean said Thursday morning that no decisions had been made yet . Crews had planned to spend Wednesday and Thursday reinforcing with cement the last few feet of the relief tunnel that will be used to pump mud into the gusher and kill it once and for all . But BP put the task on hold and instead placed a temporary plug called a storm packer deep inside the tunnel , in case it has to be abandoned until the storm passes . `` What we did n't want to do is be in the middle of an operation and potentially put the relief well at some risk , '' BP vice president Kent Wells said . If the work crews are evacuated , it could be two weeks before they can resume the effort to kill the well . That would upset BP 's timetable , which called for finishing the relief tunnel by the end of July and plugging the blown-out well by early August . Scientists have been scrutinizing underwater video and pressure data for days , trying to determine if the capped well is holding tight or in danger of rupturing and causing an even bigger disaster . If the storm prevents BP from monitoring the well , the cap may simply be reopened , allowing oil to spill into the water , Allen said . BP and government scientists were meeting to discuss whether the cap could be monitored from shore . As the storm drew closer , boat captains hired by BP for skimming duty were sent home and told they would n't be going back out for five or six days , said Tom Ard , president of the Orange Beach Fishing Association in Alabama . In Florida , crews removed booms intended to protect waterways in the Panhandle from oil . High winds and storm surge could carry the booms into sensitive wetlands . Also , Shell Oil began evacuating empman for Transocean , the owner of the rig leased by BP , confirmed the existence of the reports to The Associated Press . `` As part of Transocean 's unwavering commitment to safety and rigorous maintenance discipline on all our rigs , we proactively commissioned the safety survey and the rig assessment review , '' Transocean spokesman Lou Colasuonno said in an e-mail early Thursday . `` A fair reading of those detailed third-party reviews indicates clearly that while certain areas could be enhanced , overall rig maintenance met or exceeded regulatory and industry standards and the Deepwater Horizon 's safety management was strong and a culture of safety was robust on board the rig .

The museum complex holds a complete set of the invertebrate species that live in the Gulf of Mexico . -LRB- AP -RRB- SUITLAND , Md. -- Scientists studying the massive BP oil spill are turning to a vast collection of preserved animals at the Smithsonian to see what kind of changes the oil spill may wreak among life forms in the Gulf of Mexico . The museum and research complex in Washington holds the most complete set of invertebrate species from the Gulf , offering scientists studying the spill 's effects a look at life before the gusher began . A researcher pulling a creature from the Gulf can use the Smithsonian 's collection to compare its size , body chemistry and other characteristics to a specimen collected before the catastrophe . Smithsonian scientists began putting their collection to use just days after the oil spill , creating a digital map showing where each specimen was collected in the Gulf . Information from the collection could help settle conflicts about how much damage the spill caused , said Jonathan Coddington , head of research and collections at the National Museum of Natural History . `` Shrimpers are going to say , ` We 're just not seeing any big shrimp any longer . ' Then we 'll go back to these collections and say the average size of shrimp prior to the spill was this , '' Coddington said , surrounded by thousands of jars containing worms and other Gulf creatures preserved in alcohol in a suburban Maryland warehouse . `` It will come out which ever way it comes out . Facts help everybody . '' Requests for loans of specimens and other information about the Gulf creatures have spiked since the April 20 explosion on a drilling rig leased by BP PLC unleashed the spill , said collections manager Cheryl Bright . It has also increased the urgency of efforts to catalog tens of thousands of specimens from the Gulf . The collection includes more than 333,000 cataloged containers of invertebrates collected in the Gulf by the U.S. Minerals Management Service over the past 30 years . Another 39,000 jars are partially inventoried , though as many as 120,000 more have n't been inventoried at all . The MMS , which recently changed its name to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement , is considering transferring hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Smithsonian to help speed up the process , Coddington said . Last month , Coddington described the backlog to a House panel and told them it would cost $ 9 million to finish the inventory of all Gulf specimens . He said in an interview the government has a responsibility to pay for the work . `` It 's not a silver bullet for understanding the impact of the oil spill . But it 's a chunk of one , '' he said . The MMS conducted environmental surveys of the waters for years , specifically to help predict the impact of future gas and oil explorations . They began turning over the extensive collection to the Smithsonian for cataloging and safekeeping in 1979 . Biodiversity scientist Tom Shirley at Texas A&M 's Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies said the Smithsonian serves as a repository for the world 's ecosystems because its collection is so large . As research funding and projects ramp up , he said , many samples will be pulled from the Gulf that will be unfamiliar species . `` The big question will always be what 's the species of those animals , '' he said . `` Some things are obvious : You can identify them from books and publications . Other things you ca n't . The Smithsonian will come into play . '' Shirley said one of his former students , Peter Etnoyer , is on a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration cruise in the Gulf to study deep sea corals after the oil spill . Etnoyer 's research draws extensively on on the Smithsonian 's coral collection . Still , scientists ca n't rely on the Smithsonian alone for a picture of the Gulf before the spill , said Monty Graham of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab in Alabama . Marine centers in the region also have vast data on variations in plankton and other sea life from the days and years before the spill , for example . `` I think everybody needs to be asked what they have to contribute to painting this picture , '' Graham said . `` It 's a huge blank canvas .

Coast Guard via AP NEW YORK -- Oil companies are trying to assure Washington it 's prepared for the next big spill . ExxonMobil , Chevron Corp. , Conoco Phillips and Shell Oil said Wednesday they 've agreed to pool $ 1 billion to form a new company that would respond to offshore oil spills at up to 10,000 feet underwater . The system would deploy equipment that could arrive at a spill within days and be fully operational within weeks , the companies said . Members of Congress investigating the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig have criticized the oil industry for being ill-prepared for a major oil spill , and regulators want the industry to develop a thorough spill containment plan . Meanwhile , the White House has imposed a moratorium on deepwater drilling , and oil company share prices have plunged . Stricter regulations are also likely on the way for offshore drillers . Michael Bromwich , director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , the federal agency that oversees offshore drilling , said the announcement was encouraging . `` Ultimately we are exploring the changes and reforms that need to be made in deepwater safety standards , spill response and containment , '' Bromwich said in a statement . `` But steps like these move in the right direction . '' BP , whose blown-out well has leaked as much as 180 million gallons of oil into the Gulf , was informed of the venture but it has n't joined , a spokesperson for Exxon said . BP did n't answer calls to comment about the new response system . The British oil giant struggled for nearly three months to plug the well . It tried dropping a metal containment box over the gusher and shooting garbage down the drill hole to block the oil from seeping out . After three months , a second containment cap now seems to be working after a smaller cap only captured some of the oil . All these attempts were introduced with the caution that they 'd never been tried a mile underwater , where BP 's well was gushing oil . Exxon and the other companies on Wednesday promised their equipment will be tested beforehand . The new system draws on lessons learned from BP 's efforts and uses some similar equipment . The companies say the equipment should n't break down under extreme pressures and depths . The response system will include an array of underwater equipment designed to create a permanent connection and seal over a busted well . It will separate oil from gas and bring it to the surface where the gas can be burned off and the oil can be stored on tankers . The companies say the system could capture up to 100,000 barrels -- 4.2 million gallons -- of oil in depths of up to 10,000 feet , twice as deep as the waters BP was operating in . The four were not involved in the Gulf oil spill , but each rely on offshore drilling to generate significant revenue . Shell and Chevron have prominent drilling operations in the Gulf . The system 's similarities to what BP has used concerns U.S. Rep. Edward Markey , D-Mass . , one of the harshest critics of the industry 's disaster planning . While the new system could be deployed rapidly , `` the oil companies must do better than BP 's current apparatus with a fresh coat of paint , '' he said . He said the announcement of the containment system could be a positive step , `` but it can not be the industry 's last , '' adding that what 's needed are technologies `` that will prevent fatal blowouts in the first place . '' Rex Tillerson , chairman and chief executive officer of ExxonMobil , who has been critical of BP 's handling of the well prior to the explosion , echoed that sentiment in a statement announcing the new system . `` If we all do our jobs properly , this system will never be used , '' he said . `` The extensive experience of industry shows that when the focus remains on safe operations and risk management , tragic incidents like the one we are witnessing in the Gulf of Mexico today should not occur , '' Tillerson said . After numerous hearings on the safety of offshore drilling , the House passed legislation Wednesday that more than doubles the federal money for research in new cleanup methods and technologies . Lawmakers passed a second bill that promotes research on devices like blowout preventers that can prevent accidents . All deepwater exploration has come to a halt in the Gulf following the April 20 rig explosion . The Obama administration has banned deepwater drilling until more research can be done on whether its safe for the environment . The industry has warned of an exodus of rigs out of the Gulf , but so far that has n't happened . Only two rigs , both owned by Diamond Offshore , have been moved to foreign waters . `` It 's not so simple moving a rig . It takes a lot of time and money , '' Argus Research analyst Phil Weiss said . At the same time , once a rig does move from the Gulf it is n't likely to make a quick return , he said . According to their joint statement , the four companies will create a nonprofit organization called the Marine Well Containment Company to operate and maintain the response system . ExxonMobil will lead the effort and other companies will be invited to participate . ExxonMobil spokeswoman Karen Matusic said oil executives have been meeting over the past weeks to devise ways to handle another spill . About 40 engineers from the four companies have been working in Houston on this solution . Exxon and its engineers have worked with BP on its spill response , but the British company was n't invited to join the new venture . But the system would benefit if BP joined , Matusic said . `` Certainly BP can lend their expertise on what they 're discovering now as they 're containing the spill , '' she said . `` We certainly want to bring them in .

Put in place by contractor Environmental Protection Systems , the fencing is being used as a containment to protect Mississippi marsh areas and shorelines from the oil spill in the Gulf . Workers along the Mississippi Gulf Coast are securing oil spill protection systems ahead of the expected arrival of Tropical Storm Bonnie . -LRB- AP Photo\\/The Sun Herald , James Edward Bates -RRB- TV OUT ; ONLINE OUT ; MANDATORY CREDIT : MISSISSIPPI PRESS OUT BP says the relief well rig and other vessels are returning to the blown-out oil well site after Tropical Depression Bonnie begins to break apart , and with winds near 30 mph the storm could soon weaken to an area of low pressure . Forecasters with the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Saturday that it was less likely that Bonnie would strengthen as the storm heads toward the site of the oil spill in the Gulf . `` The Development Driller 3 -LRB- DD3 -RRB- is on its way back , '' BP spokesman Bryan Ferguson said . `` It 's the one that 's drilling the first relief well , and it 's the most critical one and it is turned around and is headed back right now . '' The rig was disconnected from the spill site ahead of Tropical Storm Bonnie , which later weakened to a tropical depression . `` The assessment was made that the storm intensity has decreased , '' Ferguson said . `` So the decision was made overnight to return the DD3 . '' In anticipation of the storm , ships working at the oil spill site moved to safer waters and coastal workers packed up oil removal operations . The storm now seems a less likely threat to cleanup , but is expected to bring periods of heavy rainfall , strong winds , and dangerous surf to the Gulf states . Bonnie could reach the northern Gulf Coast tonight or early tomorrow after passing over the oil spill midday Saturday . The center of Bonnie came ashore Friday near Cutler Bay , about 20 miles south of Miami . It moved into the eastern Gulf and was about 215 miles east-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River at 8 a.m. EDT Saturday . Though officials along the coast expressed frustration at the sudden halt to cleanup and containment , several said they saw no choice , given the looming arrival of bad weather . The mechanical cap that has mostly contained the oil for eight days was left closed , and there was no worry the storm could cause any problems with the plug because it 's nearly a mile below the ocean 's surface . `` Preservation of life and preservation of equipment are our highest priorities , '' said Allen , the federal government 's spill chief who ordered the evacuation of most ships 40 miles from the Louisiana coast With many of the protective barriers that had been shielding Louisiana 's coastal marshes locked away in warehouses , oil began to seep into fragile ecosystems that had been relatively unscathed ; the black blotches were visible in the waters off St. Bernard Parish , just east of New Orleans 's French Quarter , The Wall Street Journal reported . `` We ca n't do anything about it , '' said parish spokeswoman Jennifer Belsom about current skimming operations . But she expects them to resume Monday . Workers on land readied for a possible storm surge that could push oil into the sensitive marsh areas along the coast . On the tiny resort island of Grand Isle off the southeast Louisiana coast , workers packed up the oil removal operation , tearing down tents , tying down clean boom and loading oil-soaked boom into large containers so it wo n't pollute the area if the storm causes flooding . `` We 're planning for a 2-to-3-foot storm surge so anything that would be affected by that is being moved or stored , '' said Big Joe Kramer , 55 , who is working on his fourth large spill for Miller Environmental Services , Inc. . At the spill site , the water no longer looks thick with gooey tar . But the oil is still there beneath the surface , staining the hulls of boats motoring around in it . The evacuation could delay the relief well for as long as two weeks , pushing back the attempt to definitively shut down the leak by intercepting the well to late August , BP officials said . But an attempt to flood the well with drilling mud and cement could be tried shortly after the ships get back to the drilling site , Allen said . Before the cap was attached and closed a week ago , the broken well spewed 94 million gallons -LRB- 355 million liters -RRB- to 184 million gallons -LRB- 696 million liters -RRB- into the Gulf after the BP-leased Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers . The plug is so far beneath the ocean surface , scientists say even a severe storm should n't damage it . `` There 's almost no chance it 'll have any impact on the well head or the cap because it 's right around 5,000 feet -LRB- 1,500 meters -RRB- deep and even the largest waves wo n't get down that far , '' said Don Van Nieuwenhuise , director of professional geoscience programs at the University of Houston . The `` Great Snowstorm '' came to an end . This storm produced the heaviest snowfall over the largest area of any storm studied by weather historian David Ludlum . Accumulations exceeded 10 inches from the Ohio Valley across much of the Atlantic coast north of Georgia . Washington , DC reported 13 inches with 18 inches at Baltimore , Maryland , 18 to 36 inches near Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , 15 to 20 inches at new York city , and 20 to 30 inches over southern New England . The second severe arctic outbreak of the year hit the United States . A vast anticyclone from British Columbia to Louisiana , was centered over Kansas at 30.50 inches . The zero line went into Texas with the temperature at Amarillo falling from 55 degrees to 1 degree below zero and Oklahoma city dropping from 62 degrees to 10 degrees . A winter storm produced 61 inches of snow at Rye , Colorado , and wind gusts to 100 mph in Utah . The storm then spread heavy snow from the Texas Panhandle to Indiana . Tulia , Texas received 16 inches of snow , and up to 14 inches blanketed western Oklahoma . A powerful Pacific storm battered the coast of southern California . Winds gusting to 65 mph uprooted trees in the San Diego area , while Los Angeles recorded a barometric pressure reading of 29.25 inches of mercury -- the lowest in 100 years of official record keeping . Heavy snow fell across the Prince Williams Sound area and the Susitna Valley of southern Alaska . Valdez was buried under 64.9 inches of snow in less than two days , including a record 47.5 inches in 24 hours . Up to 44 inches of snow was reported in the Susitna Valley . The heavy snow sank a half dozen vessels in the harbor . Bitterly cold air prevailed across the great lakes and the northeastern U.S. Alpena , Michigan dipped to 28 degrees below zero to tie its record low for January . Rochester , New York plunged to 17 degrees below zero for a new record low temperature for January . Boston , Massachusetts mean temperature for the day was only 2 degrees -- the city 's coldest day in 26 years . Watertown , New York was the cold spot in the nation , with a morning low of 43 degrees below zero . Williston , North Dakota recorded 12.6 inches of snow in 24 hour for its greatest 24 hour snowfall on record . The temperature plunged to 50 degrees below zero at Big Black River , Maine for the state 's coldest temperature on record .

Used to be , they say , they could walk the streets of their beachside town alone , getting a little exercise after the hottest part of the day or setting out the trash after midnight . Now , a waitress wo n't let her 14-year-old daughter stroll to the store for a Coke , a souvenir shop owner is afraid to sit on her porch after dark and a bartender deadbolts her door , a newly purchased gun nearby . The vacationing families and sport fishermen who make this tourist town of 1,500 what it is are absent this summer , replaced by an army of workers brought in by BP to clean up the massive Gulf Coast oil spill . The outsiders walk in small groups along Route 1 at workday 's end and sometimes cut across lawns and under elevated houses to reach bars like Daddy 's Money , where women wrestle in oil . Some wear low-slung jeans , which prompted this warning note on one convenience store door : `` No pants on the ground allowed . '' What do such reactions mean ? A BP official says some culture clash is understandable , though he 's occasionally seen outright racial bias at work . But talk to some of the mostly white residents , and they do n't directly mention the skin color of the workers , most of whom are black . The workers , they say , just act different . And that makes some people uneasy , even though the vast majority of the workers pose no threat . Vicki McVey , a 44-year-old who pours beers at Artie 's Sports Bar , says she 's not taking any chances . `` Never had a gun . Never had a weapon . Now I got a weapon right next to my bed , '' says McVey , who stopped taking her grandson to the park when cleanup workers moved into a trailer nearby . `` You go to the park and they come and they touch you and want to talk to you and they harass you , '' she complains . Fears like McVey 's do n't surprise the men whose presence prompts them . Friday night , several black men in town for the cleanup sat in a grassy area near the island 's only grocery store , deciding what meat to buy to grill for dinner . They said they had n't been treated badly , though like most cleanup workers along the coast , they did n't want to give their names for fear of losing their jobs . `` This little town is just like any little town in the country , '' said one , who identified himself only as Daryl . `` A bunch of strangers are going to scare them . A bunch of black strangers are going to scare them even more . '' Another worker said he and his peers mostly just keep to themselves . `` People treat you OK , '' he said . `` But they have n't put any picnics on for us . '' People in town are talking about a recent stabbing , the first anyone can remember in ages -LRB- one published report said both victim and attacker were cleanup workers -RRB- . Locals suspect the workers when items go missing now , including golf carts that folks often use to get around . No one offers facts and figures to back up the stories . Neither the Jefferson Parish Sheriff 's Office nor Police Chief Euris DuBois , who 's upset over recent media reports about his town , would provide crime statistics or speak to The Associated Press . But the perception of a problem is undeniable . `` You used to be able to go and enjoy yourself , you know ? Have a few drinks with your friends , '' says 68-year-old Emma Chighizola , who used to sit outside and listen to the waves after a day of selling T-shirts and seashell tchotchkes at Blue Water Souvenirs . `` Now it 's kind of dangerous . There 's too many strangers . '' Parish Councilman Chris Roberts says he 's witnessed `` hostile environments ... no question . '' Tension is natural when a small town has a sudden influx of outsiders , Roberts says , and parish officials are monitoring it . But bringing in help is necessary , he said : `` There 's not -LRB- local -RRB- people lining up to go work in 105-degree heat to clean the beach . '' BP spokesman Jason French says some 1,800 workers from around the country report to Grand Isle at least once a day , including almost 300 who clean the town 's beaches . BP tried to hire locals , he says , but no more than three dozen submitted applications for jobs that pay as little as $ 12 an hour . Some tension in town is over cultural differences , he says , `` but I ca n't deny there has been some racism . '' While BP wo n't respond to complaints it considers motivated by bias , French says it does promptly address any legitimate behavioral problems . Workers , for example , were told to stop crossing lawns because they were trespassing . BP also dismissed some cleanup workers for unspecified misbehavior , though French ca n't say how many because they worked for subcontractors . The oil company has begun requiring those contractors to screen workers for drug and alcohol use as a condition of employment . `` As someone who 's been here for months , I get frustrated when workers are painted with a broad brush or the community is painted with a broad brush , '' French says . `` It 's not a community of racists any more than we have convicts working the beach . `` These are hardworking people working the beaches , '' he says , `` and there are people who are nervous because they 're seeing something they have n't seen before . '' All along the Louisiana coast , the flood of oil spill workers has temporarily altered towns . Quiet fishing villages in St. Bernard Parish have become small cities that bustle like military bases , with security checkpoints , a round-the-clock police presence and the never-ending rumble of trucks hauling food , trash and equipment on narrow country roads . And besides the influx of men and machines , there 's a deeper factor underlying locals ' mood . They talk of frustration over the loss of something simple -- the joy of a summer on the water . That disappeared when the Deepwater Horizon exploded April 20 , killing 11 oil rig workers and spilling millions of gallons of oil . `` You do n't hear no fishing stories , no beach stories , no talking about their kids and how they caught their first fish . None of that , '' says Buggie Vegas , owner of the Bridge Side Marina in Grand Isle . `` It 's just work , work , work . Every day , from a Saturday to a Monday to a Wednesday . We do n't know what day it is . It do n't matter what day it is . '' Vegas ' 30 rental units are full and his store still has some business , but it 's different : Instead of selling bait and tackle or T-shirts , he 's stocking green plastic hardhats , black rubber boots and tie-down straps . `` Everybody 's like robots , '' he says . `` They just trying to get hired on . '' Artie 's Sports Bar normally employs 16 bartenders who serve 2,000 people and pocket at least $ 250 in tips on a Saturday night . Now , it takes just six of them to wait on a crowd of 100 . Security guards who used to work only on weekends now monitor the door at Artie 's every night , checking patrons for weapons and watching closely for trouble . When she does n't like how things are going , McVey plays country music , hoping the crowd will move on . Shannon Ronquille , a 33-year-old waitress , says authorities patrol the beach on four-wheelers at night , protecting waterfront homes that owners are reluctant to rent to cleanup crews . It does n't help that business is off more than 60 percent at Barataria Seafood Grill , the island 's only fine dining establishment -- a place where , in normal times , dressed-up vacationers often wait an hour for seating . `` Now , '' Ronquille says , looking over the empty , white linen-covered tables , `` we have guys coming in with oil all over their boots . '' Two and a half hours away in Arabi , the tension manifests itself differently . There , a former school , renamed Camp Hope after Hurricane Katrina , has for five years been home to volunteers from across the country who came to rebuild storm-wrecked homes . But in June , the volunteers were told to move : BP was converting the building to a work camp . `` All the locals were more than happy to see AmeriCorps people here , that people were helping to rebuild , and it 's just a stark contrast to that , '' says 20-year-old AmeriCorps worker Kyla Philbrook , of Albany , N.Y. St. Bernard Parish has been spared the complaints that mar Grand Isle for several reasons : In Hopedale , Shell Beach and Delacroix , there 's no infrastructure to support thousands of workers . Many workers are bused in for the day . Law enforcement , citing lessons from Katrina , also set the tone early on : In May , Sheriff Jack Stephens declared the community `` wo n't tolerate a criminal invasion in the guise of people claiming they are arriving to help . '' A month later , he asked federal immigration officials to investigate claims illegal immigrants were working for BP . `` We 're not worried about people who want to earn an honest buck , '' he said at the time . Since then , deputies have made only a handful of arrests . Under a deal with BP , off-duty deputies provide paid security at worker encampments . And deputies `` engage '' every chance they get , whether at a traffic stop or a checkpoint , says Chief Deputy James Pohlmann , who notes that BP has strict rules for the Arabi camp . `` It 's like an extension of the job . There 's no alcohol , no weapons , '' he says . `` If you leave , you have to leave on a shuttle bus to a parking lot that 's offsite . '' Though workers are free to leave in their own vehicles , they are not free to walk around the neighborhood . If caught doing so , their ID is seized , `` and what that means is , you lost your job . '' In Hopedale , oysterboat captain Michael Anglin says the strategies are working . He 's even made some friends among the outsiders . `` There 's tension sometimes , but it 's just like any job , '' he says . `` It 's mostly been on where you park your car . In the wrong spot , somebody gets a little arrogant . And fishermen do n't put up with that . It 's our town , ya know . You just visiting . '' Traffic , in fact , is the biggest complaint among residents who watch weed-filled lots slashed and burned to make way for trailers . At the end of Hopedale Highway in Breton Sound Marina , BP runs a mess tent that feeds workers three meals a day . That means a steady stream of vehicles . `` I 'm scared to let my kids cross the highway , '' says 55-year-old former fisherman Kurt Guerra , his 9-year-old daughter Cassie playing on a swingset a few hundred feet from the pavement . The presence of so many strangers is unsettling , Guerra says , but with barely a place to buy a beer , problems are few .

AP BP appears to have had enough of its embattled CEO , and are sending him to the Russian front -- literally . The oil giant 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , will step down from BP 's top post in October and take a job with TNK-BP , the company 's joint venture in Russia , Sky News reported Monday . Hayward , who became the face of BP 's flailing efforts to contain the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and clean up millions in damages , will likely be replaced by BP managing director Robert Dudley . BP said earlier Monday that `` no final decision '' had been made about management changes , which reportedly include the departure of Hayward as chief executive in an effort to mend the company 's image after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . The oil company said its board would meet Monday evening , a day before it announces earnings for the second quarter . The BP board would have to approve a change in company leadership . `` BP notes the press speculation over the weekend regarding potential changes to management and the charge for the costs of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . BP confirms that no final decision has been made on these matters , '' the company said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange . The Obama administration has called on the company to meet its clean-up obligations , despite changes in management . `` BP can not , should not and will not leave the Gulf without meeting its responsibilities to plug the well , to clean up the damage that 's been caused and to compensate those that have been damaged . I think that is the most important lesson out of here , '' White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters . `` Regardless of who leads the company , those obligations and responsibilities must be met , '' he said . Hayward , 53 , had become a lightning rod for outrage in the United States about the spill , which started on April 20 with an explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon rig . Eleven workers died in the disaster . Hayward 's comment that he was eager to resolve the incident `` so that I can have my life back '' antagonized his critics in the United States . Dudley , currently heading the effort to clean up the Gulf Coast , figured prominently in speculation about Hayward 's likely successor . Dudley is currently BP 's managing director , and grew up partly in Hattiesburg , Mississippi . He spent 20 years at Amoco Corp. , which merged with BP in 1998 , and lost out to Hayward on the CEO 's slot three years ago . He took over from Hayward as the point man on the cleanup in June . Last week , BP said the cost of dealing with the spill had reached nearly $ 4 billion , but that it was too early to quantify the eventual total cost . Hayward joined BP in 1982 as a geologist , and currently makes 1.045 million pounds -LRB- US$ 1.6 million -RRB- a year as the company 's head , according to its annual report . In 2009 , he received a performance bonus of more than 2 million pounds plus other remuneration , bringing his total pay package to more than 4 million pounds . BP is in the process of selling assets to raise $ 10 billion toward a $ 20 billion fund that will finance the cleanup of the mess in the Gulf . BP announced last week that it had sold properties in the United States , Canada and Egypt to Apache Corp. for $ 7 billion . Under pressure from President Obama , BP also has announced that it will pay no more dividends to shareholders this year .

Reuters BP 's embattled boss Tony Hayward is set to be replaced amid `` leadership changes '' at the firm , Fox News confirmed on Sunday . Hayward , under heavy fire for his handling of the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster that followed the April explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig , is set to step down Monday . BP 's managing director Bob Dudley will step in as the new CEO , The Wall Street Journal reported . Earlier Sunday , BP spokesman Toby Odone seemed to downplay media speculation about Hayward 's departure , saying he `` remains BP 's chief executive , and he has the confidence of the board and senior management . `` BP 's board would have to approve a change in company leadership . An official announcement could come as early as Monday . BP is due to release its second quarter results on Tuesday , and the board of directors is scheduled to meet before the earnings announcement . It 's been more than three months since an offshore drilling rig operated by BP exploded off Louisiana on April 20 , killing 11 workers and setting off the spill . A temporary plug has stopped oil from gushing for more than a week now , but before that the busted well had spewed anywhere from 94 million gallons to 184 million gallons into the Gulf . Crews trying to plug the leaky well for good had to stop work late last week because of the threat from Tropical Storm Bonnie , but the effort was back on track as skies cleared Sunday . A drill rig is expected to reconnect at around midnight to the relief tunnel that will be used to pump in mud and cement to seal the well , and drilling could resume in the next few days . Since the explosion , Hayward has made several highly publicized gaffes . Among them : going to a yacht race while oil washed up on Gulf shores , and uttering the now-infamous : `` I want my life back '' line . Oppenheimer & Co. senior analyst Fadel Gheit said in an interview Sunday that it was too bad Hayward 's career was derailed by the spill , but `` unfortunately he became a sacrificial lamb in a politically charged world . '' Dudley would be well-suited to take over , Gheit said , describing him as even-tempered and a good delegator . It 's never an easy time to instill new leadership in a company , though , he noted . `` I 'm not sure if removing Tony Hayward is going to throw BP 's problems away , '' Gheit said . The company has already spent roughly $ 4 billion on its response to the crisis . The final tally could be in the tens of billions of dollars . News that the CEO will depart came as no surprise to people living along the Gulf . Patrick Shay , 43 , sat on a porch swing of his cottage in Grand Isle , Louisiana , on Sunday , his front yard filled with small , white crosses , each bearing the name of sealife or ways of life the oil spill has killed . `` He seems like a pretty self-absorbed person , so I 'm not surprised to hear he would walk away in the middle of all this , '' he said . `` If anything it will help . They need to get him out of the way and get this cleaned up . '' In New Orleans , Chris Hearn , a 23-year-old security guard , said what 's important is getting the oil stopped permanently . `` It does n't matter who 's in charge , '' he said . `` As long as they clean it up , I really could care less . They just need to get it cleaned up because it 's affecting all of us down here . '' Completion of the relief well that is the best chance to permanently stop the oil now looks possible by mid-August , but retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man for the spill , said he would n't hesitate to order another evacuation based on forecasts similar to the ones for Bonnie . `` We have no choice but to start well ahead of time if we think the storm track is going to bring gale force winds , which are 39 mph or above , anywhere close to well site , '' Allen said . Allen said officials will spend the next day determining how Bonnie , which did no real damage on shore , affected the area . Oil may have migrated north to Mississippi Sound , he said , and officials are checking to see if boom that was protecting sensitive marshlands was pushed ashore . Allen said he had not heard whether Hayward is being replaced . `` I 've got no knowledge of the inner workings of BP , '' he said . Dudley took over from Hayward as BP 's point man on the cleanup in June . Dudley grew up partly in Hattiesburg , Mississippi . He spent 20 years at Amoco Corp. , which merged with BP in 1998 , and lost out to Hayward on the CEO 's slot three years ago . Hayward , 53 , joined BP in 1982 as a geologist , and currently makes $ 1.6 million a year as the company 's head , according to their annual report . In 2009 , he received a performance bonus of more than $ 3 million plus other remuneration . The company can terminate the contracts of directors `` at any time with immediate effect on payment in lieu of notice equivalent to one year 's salary , '' the report says . Hayward has a pension pot of about $ 17.3 million , which would pay 584,000 pounds a year upon retirement . Hayward took over the top spot at BP in 2007 after a series of events including a fatal explosion at a Texas refinery and an oil spill off the Alaska coast , as well as accusations of misusing company resources , led to the ouster of John Browne . Upon replacing Browne , Hayward promised to focus `` like a laser '' on safety . In June , members of Congress repeatedly reminded Hayward how empty that promise sounded with 11 workers dead , BP seemingly unprepared to contain the spill and a Congressional investigation indicating that officials put cost-savings ahead of safety in the days and hours before the rig explosion . BP has n't completed its own investigation into the cause .

One veteran complex litigation attorney estimated that unless there is a quick settlement that satisfies all sides , it will be 2015 before any trials begin and at least 2028 before appeals and other legal issues are fully resolved . The attorney , Lela Hollabaugh of Nashville , Tenn. , pointed out that it took 20 years to complete all claims from the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil disaster in Alaska . `` When you 're looking at an incident like this , which has so many different parties in different states , you just simply ca n't get through the litigation quickly , '' Hollabaugh said . `` It just takes a long time to move through the process . '' So far , at least 300 federal lawsuits have been filed in 12 states against BP and the other three main companies involved in the April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drill rig , which triggered the nation 's worst-ever offshore oil spill . Virtually every lawsuit names as defendants BP , rig owner Transocean Ltd. , well contractor Halliburton Co. and Cameron International , maker of the well 's failed blowout preventer . The plaintiffs make up the entire mosaic of the Gulf Coast : shrimpers and oystermen , charter boat captains , beach resort and condo owners , restaurants and bars , seafood suppliers , bait and tackle shops , even tourist attractions like Key West 's Ripley 's Believe It or Not museum . Most of the parties claim severe economic losses from the oil spill , ranging from the fish they can no longer catch to tourists who never arrived to rent rooms . There are also a few wrongful death and injury lawsuits filed , mainly in state courts , by workers who survived the Deepwater Horizon explosion and relatives of some of the 11 men who died . And some BP investors also have sued , claiming the company 's mistakes led to a sharp drop in its stock price . A federal judicial panel is meeting Thursday in Boise , Idaho , to consider whether to consolidate some or all of the lawsuits for pretrial decisions before a single judge , a development that most observers say is a foregone conclusion . BP and the other companies favor federal court in Houston -- near their major U.S. operations -- while a majority of plaintiffs ' attorneys have suggested New Orleans , closer to the broken well and to many of the hardest-hit victims . Courts in Florida , Mississippi and Alabama also are being suggested as venues . It 's difficult to estimate potential damages that BP could be forced to pay , or what shape a settlement might take . But legal experts say BP alone is looking at some $ 2 billion in costs just to defend itself , with the $ 20 billion fund set aside to pay oil spill claims and cleanup costs potentially not enough to foot the entire bill . `` There 's no way it 's going to be enough , '' said Victor Diaz , a Miami attorney experienced in similar large-scale cases such as those involving faulty Chinese drywall . `` We still do n't know what will happen later , what the second and third wave of damages might be . What happens if six months later , some fish species is wiped out ? '' One example of post-spill lawsuits : the owners of a Louisiana shrimp boat claim in a new lawsuit they are suffering health problems including headaches , nausea and shortness of breath after working for BP in the collecting and burning of oil in the Gulf . BP 's liability is already larger than the Exxon Valdez case , which ultimately led to a $ 500 million payout to affected fishermen and residents . Other large `` mass tort '' cases include drug maker Merck & Co. 's agreement in 2008 to a $ 4.85 billion settlement of some 50,000 cases stemming from its withdrawn painkiller Vioxx . Also , Pharmaceutical company Wyeth initially settled claims over its diet drug fen-phen for $ 3.75 billion in 1999 , but that soared to more than $ 21 billion by 2004 as more claims were filed . Asbestos , which has caused widespread lung disease and other ailments , is the longest-running mass lawsuit case in U.S. history , costing a variety of companies more than $ 70 billion and involving more than 730,000 claims since the 1970s , according to an analysis by the nonprofit Rand Corp. . And tobacco companies have been slapped with thousands of lawsuits over the dangers of cigarette smoking . They won most of them until the major companies agreed in 1998 to a 25-year , $ 206 billion settlement with 46 states who sued over the costs to their health programs . The BP case will differ in many ways from those involving drug companies , automakers and asbestos manufacturers , where people died or suffered illnesses directly caused by the product . In an oil spill , oystermen whose beds were choked off by oil might have relatively easy claims to prove , but what about a beachfront hotelier whose business fell off , or a property owner whose house may suddenly be worth much less ? `` People who have those indirect claims are going to have a difficult time under any situation , '' Hollabaugh said . `` Where does it end ? You could say the oil spill has harmed our whole country . '' Many of the lawsuits are proposed class actions , in which a plaintiff such as a commercial fisherman or a property owner seeks to represent everyone else in the same situation . One task for the judge appointed to preside over the consolidated cases is sorting out which of those overlap , and which should be deemed class actions . One wild card is the claims process created by BP and President Barack Obama 's administration . That process , administered by attorney Kenneth Feinberg , promises oil spill victims quicker access to money for what BP calls `` legitimate '' claims than the traditional legal process . Feinberg is touting the plan as a generous alternative to a lawsuit , telling one audience in Washington that although legal action remains an option , `` You 're crazy to do so . '' Feinberg made similar arguments in convincing most survivors and victims ' families to join the federal 9\\/11 compensation fund rather than sue airlines or other companies individually over the terror attacks . Some plaintiffs ' attorneys have raised questions about how the claims process can guarantee a fair result . But Howard Erichson , a law professor at Fordham University , said people also are taking their chances with the court system . `` Litigation is expensive , it 's time-consuming , it is unpredictable , '' Erichson said . `` The results often vary in unpredictable ways . Plaintiffs in mass tort litigation end up losing a lot of the money to legal fees and expenses . If the compensation fund is fair , I 'm all for it . '' Another unknown is whether BP and the other Deepwater Horizon companies will work together to defend themselves or sue each other . Much depends on the outcome of a Justice Department criminal investigation that could point the finger more heavily at one or the other ; Transocean is already asking a federal judge in Houston to limit its liability to $ 27 million under a century-old law meant to cut losses for shipping companies when vessels like the floating Deepwater Horizon rig are sunk . Somewhat forgotten in all the economic litigation are the rig victims and their families . Michelle Jones , the wife of lost rig worker Gordon Jones , wants to keep her lawsuit separate so it does not get lost in the shuffle . `` While the damages incurred by the fishermen and property owners is significant , the stakes in Jones ' case involves everyday living expenses and the education costs for her two children , '' Michelle Jones ' attorney wrote in a federal court filing . `` After losing her husband , and her sons losing their father , she may have to wait years .

Bobby Jindal looks over the berm system on the northern end of the Chandeleur Islands , La. , July 15 . -LRB- AP Photo -RRB- The BP oil spill may be choking the Gulf ecosystem , but for a few well-positioned coastal politicians it has breathed new life into their careers . Across the Gulf states , the spill has over the past 100 days given lawmakers the chance to step into the national spotlight and show a little leadership -- by wrestling with the Obama administration , sounding off against BP and pulling the battered Gulf region through yet another environmental and economic crisis . Though Gulf fisherman , rig workers and practically everyone tied to coastal tourism are facing an uncertain future , the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history , nevertheless , could bolster a handful of political fortunes , especially with voters having 97 days to decide on their candidates before the Nov. 2 election . But first , there may be no better example of a political comeback than Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal . A year ago , the governor was pilloried for delivering a lackluster GOP response to President Obama 's first address to Congress . The performance appeared to bench him as a potential 2012 presidential hopeful for the Republican Party . He was n't even a choice on the 2012 straw poll ballots at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference or the Conservative Political Action Conference this year -- though he said he was n't interested anyway . But Jindal sprung into action shortly after the deadly April 20 explosion that triggered the spill at the Deepwater Horizon rig . He criticized the federal government for being slow to respond and he fought the administration over its moratorium on offshore drilling . And he made a very public and visible effort to show he was on top of the disaster response -- touring the coast , putting out a restoration plan and holding frequent press conferences to talk about it . Images of Jindal giving his allegedly bumbling response to the presidential address were replaced by images of Jindal on a boat getting up close and personal with the oil damage . `` Probably the person who 's come out of this the best is Bobby Jindal , '' said Kirby Goidel , political science professor and director of the Public Policy Research Lab at Louisiana State University . `` This is all a chance to be redefined as someone who 's an advocate . '' A Rasmussen Reports poll released at the end of June showed Jindal 's state approval rating at 74 percent -- a 10-percentage-point jump from April . Goidel said Jindal has virtually assured re-election in the 2011 gubernatorial race . He said despite claims that Jindal has the job he wants , `` there 's no question '' the governor has ambitions for the White House . He said both Jindal and Florida Gov. Charlie Crist have shown oil spill leadership in a way that should help them with voters . Of the two , Crist faces the most immediate political challenge . The former Republican made the risky move of switching his affiliation to independent in his run for the U.S. Senate this fall . But the Real Clear Politics average of polls now has him leading Republican Marco Rubio by nearly 4 percentage points -- though a recent Rasmussen poll showed Rubio up by 2 points . Democrat Kendrick Meeks continues to trail in general election matchups . The impact of the spill on the U.S. Senate race in Louisiana is a little more fuzzy . On one hand , it 's allowed Sen. David Vitter to steer clear of questions about his connection to the D.C. Madam scandal and a longtime aide with a lengthy criminal history . He uses his interviews and public appearances to slam the Obama administration over its drilling moratorium and response effort . But the spill has also given Democratic challenger Rep. Charlie Melancon exposure statewide . `` The oil spill has given Charlie Melancon a chance to showcase his leadership skills , '' said Kevin Franck , spokesman for the Louisiana Democratic Party . `` The most stark contrast Louisianans have seen during the oil spill is Charlie Melancon has been able to actually deliver results and David Vitter has been relegated to complaining loudly . '' Franck pointed to Melancon 's efforts getting a mobile health unit for clean-up workers and pushing a bill to make small business loans more affordable for spill victims . He said the oil spill has been bad for Vitter 's image , accusing the senator of sticking up for BP by pushing measures that could limit the firm 's compensation liability for Gulf residents . Vitter pushed a bill that would tie BP 's liability to its profits -- the senator claimed that could be as high as $ 20 billion , though Franck said given BP 's losses it would be far less than what Gulf Coast residents need . Melancon also drew some attention in May when he got choked up at a subcommittee hearing about the Gulf oil spill damage on Capitol Hill . Though most recent polls have shown Vitter well ahead in general election match-ups , internal polling from the Melancon campaign shows the race a dead heat with Vitter leading by just 1 percentage point . The internal polling showed Melancon 's image generally improving among those surveyed in recent weeks . Vitter spokesman Luke Bolar , though , highlighted the senator 's efforts to fight the administration 's drilling moratorium and dismissed Melancon 's performance . `` The people of Louisiana know Senator Vitter has been a strong leader throughout this disaster and a desperate political opponent , Charlie Melancon who gave Obama an ` A ' for his job performance , is n't helping bring back the 150,000 jobs that Obama 's moratorium will cost Louisiana 's economy , '' he said in an e-mail . Goide said the internal poll seems like an outlier . He said it does n't yet appear Melancon has gained much traction from the spill . He said the fact that a Democratic president is in the White House ties Melancon 's hands , preventing him getting too tough on the administration and effectively ceding that role to Vitter . Goidel said Jindal 's challenge will be to sustain his restored image after the leak is plugged and after the spill is cleaned up . `` That 's what he 's got to think about , '' Goidel said . `` Your shelf life of being the hot thing in politics is not particularly long .

'' As one of the world 's largest companies , BP wields awesome power , which it uses to find and exploit reservoirs of crude oil thousands of feet below the ocean floor . Such power put BP in a position to risk not only the destruction of a rig and the deaths of workers , but also incalculable harm to the Gulf 's environment and local economies . Ethical reflection on BP 's actions leading up to the oil spill holds a lesson for other powerful firms involved in perilous enterprises . The Deepwater Horizon was a machine of immense size and complexity , with employees of various companies carrying out a host of often difficult and complicated tasks . And certainly the challenges of risk management would have been daunting when safe operation of the rig relied on so many variables relating to equipment , personnel , weather , deepwater conditions and subterranean geology . Precisely because the risks were so great and so numerous , BP 's prime responsibility of minimizing catastrophic risk would have required having an official , with the requisite skills and authority , in charge of safety on the rig . This supervisor , dedicated solely to safety oversight , would have coordinated the constant monitoring of risk factors and made sure that risks related to proposed deviations from standard practice were duly evaluated and authorized . This official would have assured that emergency response plans were current and that all workers were trained to implement them . Emergency equipment and procedures would have been regularly and rigorously tested , using established , data-based criteria . Top managers would have made sure that every rig had a strong safety culture , such that an overriding concern for safety would have been built in to management practices . Sadly , this seems not to have been the case . BP has declared that its `` absolute No. 1 priority '' is safety . But evidence to the contrary , at least on the Deepwater Horizon , appeared in a recent New York Times story about the now-famous `` blowout preventer . '' It turns out that there are hundreds of ways this `` ultimate fail-safe device '' can fail . Indeed , a study commissioned by Transocean , the Deepwater Horizon 's owner , concluded that , historically , blowout preventers on deepwater rigs had a failure rate of 45 % . Equally astonishing is that their key component , the `` blind shear ram , '' is vulnerable to catastrophic failure through the breakdown of just a single part . In a blowout , this apparatus -- whose powerful blades are pushed together by hydraulic fluid -- is designed to sever and seal the drill pipe . However , one of the ram 's shuttle valves is such that , if it sticks or leaks , the blades ca n't be activated . Incredibly , this valve has no backup . -LRB- There are indications that the calamitous failure of the Deepwater Horizon 's blind shear ram was due to leaks in one or more shuttle valves . -RRB- Moreover , a blind shear ram 's effectiveness is diminished by the extreme pressure and cold of deep water , the fact that modern drill pipe is twice as strong as older pipe , and the impossibility of slicing through the joint-sections that make up nearly 10 percent of a drill pipe . BP and the rest of the oil industry were well aware of the weaknesses of blowout preventers , particularly since the failure of blind shear rams had been implicated in several major oil spills . Drillers had begun to address the problems by installing two blind shear rams in their blowout preventers . In fact , on the day of the Gulf oil spill , every other BP rig under contract from Transocean was equipped with dual blind shear rams . The last thorough maintenance review of the Deepwater Horizon , in 2005 , revealed serious problems with the blowout preventer , including faulty controls and a badly leaking line connecting the rig to the blowout preventer . Despite such well-documented vulnerabilities , BP decided not to reconfigure the Deepwater Horizon 's blowout preventer with a second blind shear ram . In the days preceding the April 20 explosion , against the advice of contractors and over the protests of workers , BP skipped several crucial safety steps needed to make sure gas would n't escape from the well and ignite . Such actions cast doubt on any suggestion that a `` safety culture '' existed on the rig . Thus , it comes as no surprise that , as The Times also reported , no BP official had overall responsibility for safety on the Deepwater Horizon . This points to the main lesson of this case : In hazardous operations -- such as the search for energy sources in increasingly dangerous environments -- minimizing catastrophic risk demands strong , accountable safety supervisors and workable , realistic planning for emergencies . Otherwise , companies conducting such operations -- in oil exploration , coal mining , nuclear power generation , or any other high-risk business -- are following BP 's path to disaster . Dana M.

He 's not collecting starfish , sea horses and sting rays two-by-two , but by the hundreds , storing them at the Gulf Specimen Marine Laboratory . `` It 's been one continuous nightmare . It 's been one non-stop effort to figure out what to do next , '' says Jack Rudloe , who 's run this small aquarium south of Tallahassee , Florida since 1965 . When the BP Oil Spill happened , and the black and brown ribbons of crude approached the Florida Panhandle , Rudloe began envisioning the huge , wooden boat of biblical lore . `` Supposing the oil really came sloshing in here and the bays are all polluted and everything is dead and the animals that we had in the aquarium with this closed system might be the only things around for a heck of a long time and then itself , the whole aquarium , and the gulf specimen would become a Noah 's ark in and of itself , '' said Rudloe . At his Marine Laboratory in the tiny town of Panacea , on the coast of Florida 's Big Bend , Jack , his son Cyprus and a handful of others have embraced this idea with long days dragging nets in the Gulf , hauling up all kinds of marine life -- turtles , horse shoe crabs , sand dollars , sharks , snails , shrimp and more -- bringing them back to the aquarium and transplanting them in large , round tanks . Since the threat of oil and chemical dispersant looms just offshore , they 're now building even more tanks as well as an in-house system for oxygenating the salt water already on the property , so that they wo n't have to rely on pumping in fresh salt water from the Gulf . It 's been about a $ 100,000 investment so far , which BP has yet to pay . According to U.S. Fish and Wildlife , to date , about 3500 birds , turtles and mammals have died an oily death . But as for marine life , it 's impossible to count , as fish and smaller sea life sink to the bottom when they die . Scientists expect it will be 4 - 6 years or longer until we know the true impact of the oil spill on the Gulf of Mexico 's sub-surface environment . So in the meantime , Jack and his crew do what they can , realizing that saving and preserving every species , to grow and nurture and eventually release back into a post-oil Gulf , is much larger than them . `` Well , it would be a big order by the time you get the two cocapods , amphapods , 15 different species and everything else like that -- about 30 to 40,000 different species are found within this region -- it would be kind of hard to have an ark that would do that .

Gaylord Nelson was so moved after seeing the devastation of an oil spill off the California coast near Santa Barbara that he called for a national teach-in on the environment . The following year the resulting '' Earth Day '' kick-started the modern environmental movement and shaped the way Americans thought about their air , water and soil . Forty years later , the magnitude of the Gulf oil spill far exceeds Santa Barbara 's spill of up to 100,000 barrels , but there has n't been a comparable societal transformation . Last week , legislation imploded in the Senate to reduce greenhouse gases blamed for global warming , derailing environmentalists ' top goal , and no national consensus has emerged to move America off oil and other fossil fuels into clean energy . Even a new more modest Senate bill , aimed at boosting energy efficiency and preventing oil spills , faces an uncertain future . Nelson , a Wisconsin Democrat who had long championed the environment , laid out the idea of a teach-in during a speech in Seattle . He wrote the speech on napkins while flying there , recalls his daughter , Tia Nelson . The senator 's call inspired the first Earth Day , with millions participating across the country , including 2,000 college campuses and 10,000 elementary and high schools . Congress adjourned so lawmakers could give speeches . In 1970 , President Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency and signed the National Environmental Policy Act and the Clean Air Act into law . Worries about air pollution , the dangers of DDT and polluted rivers from industrial wastes played a part . But the Santa Barbara spill was the catalyst . It `` triggered a social movement and helped to create a new politics , the politics of ecology , '' mystery novelist Ross Macdonald once wrote . In contrast , President Barack Obama last month used an Oval Office speech to push for clean energy , but Republicans accused him of trying exploit the Gulf tragedy for political gain . The president took it from both sides , as some liberal commentators faulted him for failing to specifically back a cap on carbon dioxide emissions linked to global warming . The Gulf spill is estimated between 94 million and 184 million gallons , far worse than Santa Barbara 's total . But the 10-day spill from a well blowout six miles offshore covered miles of California 's sandy beaches with a thick , oily sludge . Pictures of dead seals , dolphins and thousands of birds captured the nation 's attention . `` Santa Barbara 's psychological effect was huge , and it really got into the American mind in ways that clean air and clean water and other things had a hard time doing because they were n't personified , '' says Oliver A. Houck , who teaches environmental law at Tulane University in New Orleans . `` So why has n't BP yet had the same transformative effect ? When Santa Barbara came along it was a big deal . When BP comes along , there are so many big deals that it has a hard time competing for attention . That said , I think it 's got an enormous national play . '' The Santa Barbara spill featured its own version of Tony Hayward , the former chief executive of BP who angered people early on with comments such as `` The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean , '' playing down the potential environmental impact . In February 1969 , Fred Hartley , the Canadian-born head of Union Oil Co. , which owned the Santa Barbara well , told a Senate hearing in Washington : `` I am always tremendously impressed at the publicity that the death of birds receives vs. the loss of people in our country in this day and age . '' Noting there had been no loss of human lives from the Santa Barbara well blowout , Hartley added , `` Relative to the number of deaths that have occurred in this fair city due to crime ... it does seem that we should give this thing a little perspective . '' Hartley rejected calls to halt offshore drilling in the Santa Barbara Channel , citing arguments similar to those employed by opponents of the Obama administration 's moratorium . Hartley said he told Ronald Reagan , California 's governor then , that it would be like `` making a decision to shut down the whole university educational system because there is a riot in San Francisco . '' Lois Capps , now a Democratic congresswoman representing Santa Barbara , was a young stay-at-home mother in 1969 who would often take her two children to the beaches there . `` It shaped my views along with everyone in the region , '' she says . `` It was such a devastating event . The spill was much closer to the shore , so we felt its impact sooner and more directly than this long , drawn-out affair we 're having in the Gulf . '' Capps says there has been a strong reaction in Congress to the BP Gulf spill , with dozens of hearings and several pieces of legislation making their way through the House and Senate . But it 's too early to draw conclusions about a societal shift , she says . `` It does n't happen overnight , '' Capps says . `` I think these things build like a tidal wave . '' Gaylord Nelson 's speech calling for a teach-in came eight months after the January 1969 spill , and the resulting Earth Day did n't take place until more than a year later -- April 1970 . And it was not until 1981 that Congress imposed a ban on offshore drilling along most of the nation 's coastal waters , an action widely attributed to the memories of the Santa Barbara spill a dozen years earlier . The moratorium endured for a quarter century , until Congress lifted it in 2008 . `` I think we 're going to see a really significant response to what happened in the Gulf played out over time , '' says Sarah Chasis , ocean initiative director for the Natural Resources Defense Council . `` I think it 's going to affect people 's consciousness , thinking , the way they approach issues for a long time . '' There are signs this is starting to happen . An Associated Press poll last month found that 72 percent of Americans rated the environment as extremely important or very important -- up from 64 percent in May and 59 percent in April . Actor Ted Danson , a board member for the international ocean conservation group Oceana , says the focus has until now been stopping the leak . `` I am hopeful . I think the time will come , '' Danson says . `` Oil is a very , very powerful lobby . And the basic feeling out in the world , and I think mostly created by people whose interests are in oil , is that alternative energy is a very sweet , kind , loving thought , but certainly its day has not come . We need oil . '' James `` Bud '' Bottoms , a Santa Barbara resident who co-founded `` Get Oil Out '' in 1969 , says the Gulf spill reminded him of those days . `` The same thing happened here , '' says Bottoms , now 82 . `` We stood there on our banks and saw our harbors and beaches black , about two or three inches of thick goo . We stood here and cried along our beach . We thought our lives were over here in Santa Barbara . '' Bottoms penned a children 's book in 1969 called `` Davey and the GOM , '' which was n't published until 2008 . `` GOM '' stands for `` Giant Oil Monster . '' It 's also the acronym the offshore drilling industry and government regulators use for something else : The Gulf of Mexico .

Democratic leaders hailed the bill as a comprehensive response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and said it would increase drilling safety and crack down on oil companies such as BP . Companies with significant workplace safety or environmental violations over the preceding seven years would be banned from new offshore drilling permits . Republicans and some-oil state Democrats opposed the measure , calling it a federal power grab that would raise energy prices and kill thousands of American jobs because of the new fees and liability provision . Rep. Nick Rahall , D-W . Va. , the bill 's main sponsor , said the legislation would be a tribute to the 11 oil rig workers who were killed when the BP well exploded in April by creating strong new safety standards for offshore drilling , ending the revolving door between government regulators and industry and holding BP and other oil companies accountable for accidents . `` While we may not know the exact cause of the incident , we clearly know what contributed to it . A culture of cozy relationships that had regulators interviewing for jobs on the same rigs they were supposed to be inspecting , '' said Rahall , who is chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee . The legislation , which passed 209-193 , has yet to be taken up in the Senate , where partisan disagreements will likely delay final consideration of a joint House-Senate bill until after the August congressional recess . The House bill includes a provision sponsored by Rep. Charlie Melancon , D-La . , that would modify a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling , so that some drilling permits could be approved on a rig-by-rig basis if the Interior Department determines a rig meets new safety requirements . The drilling moratorium imposed by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar would remain in effect , and Salazar would retain power over whether to approve a permit . The bill also would remove the current $ 75 million cap on economic damages to be paid by oil companies after major spills and increases to $ 300 million the financial responsibility offshore operators must demonstrate in most cases . And it would create new `` conservation '' fees on oil and natural gas extracted from land or water controlled by the federal government . Those provisions prompted sharp criticism from Republicans . `` In typical Democrat fashion , this bill overtaxes , over-regulates , and costs American jobs , '' said Rep. John Mica , R-Fla . Rep. Doc Hastings of Washington state , the top Republican on the House Natural Resources Committee , said removing the liability cap could devastate small and medium-sized drillers . Hastings called the new fees on oil and gas production a `` $ 22 billion energy tax '' that would cost jobs and raise energy prices . The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the $ 2 per barrel fee on oil and a similar fee on natural gas could bring in $ 22.5 billion over the next decade . Earlier Friday , the House approved a separate bill to extend whistleblower protections to oil and gas workers who report hazardous conditions or other problems . The whistleblower bill will be added to the oil spill legislation when it is sent to the Senate . `` A whistleblower may be the only thing standing between a safe workplace and a catastrophe , '' said Rep. George Miller , D-Calif . , the bill 's sponsor . `` No worker should ever have to choose between his life and his livelihood . '' Rep. Jay Inslee , D-Wash . , said the bill setting new drilling standards and removing the liability cap was the least Congress could do to respond to such a major catastrophe . Rahall said the legislation would end a `` trust-but-don ` t-verify '' attitude about safety where drilling plans were rubber stamped by federal regulators and industry often wrote its own rules . The bill would put into law actions already taken by the Obama administration to break Interior 's former Minerals Management Service into three parts , separating safety enforcement and regulation from economic activities such as issuing oil leases and collecting royalties . Since the BP spill the agency has been renamed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Enforcement and Regulation , and a new director , Michael Bromwich , has been appointed .

Thursday , July 29 , 2010 The oil is then soaked up with absorbent boom and disposed . -LRB- AP Photo\\/Matt Stamey , The Houma Courier -RRB- AP NEW ORLEANS -- On shore , BP , Halliburton and Transocean are engaging in a billion-dollar blame game over the blown-out oil well in the Gulf of Mexico . At sea , they 're depending on each other to finally plug up the environmental disaster . Workers say the companies ' adversarial relationship before Congress , in public statements and maybe one day in the courts is n't a distraction at the site of the April 20 rig explosion , where Transocean equipment rented by BP is drilling relief wells that Halliburton will pump cement through to permanently choke the oil well . `` Simply , we are all too professional to allow disagreements between BP and any other organization to affect our behaviors , '' Ryan Urik , a BP well safety adviser working on the Development Driller II , which is drilling a backup relief well , said in an e-mail last week . But at least one expert said government probes and potential for lawsuits ca n't help but chill communication between the companies . Urik 's rig was in a holding pattern Saturday , awaiting progress by its sister rig , the Development Driller III , which is drilling the primary relief well and ran into a minor snag while preparing for a procedure known as a static kill that will make it easier to stop the gusher for good . The DDIII is clearing out debris that fell in the bottom of the relief well when crews had to evacuate the site last week because of Tropical Storm Bonnie . Once the debris is cleared , engineers plan to start as early as Monday on the static kill , which involves pumping mud and possibly cement into the blown-out well through the temporary cap . If it works , it will take less time to complete another procedure known as a bottom kill , the last step to permanently sealing the well by pumping mud and then cement in from the bottom , which could happen by mid - to late August . Workers know all about the clashes among their respective employers , `` but the crews have done an excellent job of focusing on getting these relief wells finished safely , '' Dennis Barber , a Transocean senior toolpusher aboard the DDII , said last week in an e-mail from the rig . The roles of the three companies in the relief kill effort are much the same as they were on the Deepwater Horizon , the exploratory rig that blew up soon after a temporary cement cap was placed on its well , killing 11 workers . The conflicts began almost as soon as oil started flowing . `` Transocean 's blowout preventer failed to operate , '' BP executive Lamar McKay said in Senate testimony in May , referring to the massive safety device atop the well that was supposed to bottle up the oil in an emergency . Transocean CEO Steven Newman shifted blame in the same hearing , saying `` all offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , in this case BP . '' He also noted that Halliburton was responsible for encasing the well in cement , while Halliburton executive Tim Probert said his company 's work was completed 20 hours before the rig went up in flames . President Obama called the finger-pointing testimony a `` ridiculous spectacle . '' The Justice Department has opened civil and criminal investigations into the spill . Attorney General Eric Holder has indicated that BP is n't the only company that could be held liable . Kenneth Green , a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research think tank , said the investigations may have stifled communications between the government and companies -- and between the companies themselves . `` The problem is you 've chilled communications with the very people you need to solve the problem , '' he said . `` Once the Justice Department got involved , the lawyers were basically immediately in charge of the show . '' BP is trying to move forward from the disaster that sent anywhere from 94 million to 184 million gallons of oil spewing into the Gulf , announcing once the cap was finally in place that its vilified chief executive , Tony Hayward , will be leaving in October . He will be replaced by American Bob Dudley , who told reporters in Biloxi , Miss. , on Friday that it 's `` not too soon for a scaleback '' in the cleanup , and in areas where there is no oil , `` you probably do n't need to see people in hazmat suits on the beach . '' State waters closed by the spill have slowly reopened to fishing , most recently in Florida , where regulators on Saturday reopened a 23-mile area off of Escambia County to harvest saltwater fish . The area was closed June 14 and remains closed to the shrimp and crab harvesting pending additional testing . Oysters , clams and mussels were never included in the closure . In Alabama , the Department of Public Health lifted all swimming advisories for the Gulf of Mexico . Relatively little oil remains on the surface of the Gulf , leaving less for thousands of oil skimmers to do , though Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser on Saturday offered to prove to Dudley that there 's still plenty of oil off the coast of Louisiana . `` Let me take him water-skiing out here and see if he comes up black , '' Nungesser said as he took a small group of reporters on a boat tour of an inlet at St. Mary 's Point , about an hour south of New Orleans . Fresh globs of thick oil saturated the marshes and brownish tar balls were visible in the water . Even in areas where no oil was visible on the surface , workers were pulling up heavily stained boom that had been placed there in recent days . Hundreds of lawsuits already have been filed in the aftermath of the explosion and spill . Rig workers are suing their employers . Idled fishermen , coastal property owners and tourism-dependent businesses are suing the companies . Environmental lawyers are suing government regulators . So far , the companies have n't sued each other . Christopher Ruppel , an energy expert and managing director of capital markets for the Execution Noble investment banking group , said the companies are probably waiting to get a full tally for the cleanup costs and a better read on the government probes . Meanwhile , he added , the companies are acting like `` porcupines working together . '' Henry reported from Atlanta . Associated Press Writers Harry R.

The oil giant gave UC Berkeley a $ 500 million grant in 2007 to create the Energy Biosciences Institute , which works to develop new sources of plant-based fuel . The 10-year deal , believed to be the largest-ever corporate sponsorship of university research , has outraged many students and professors who worry the global oil company will exert too much influence over academic research and damage the university 's reputation . Now , as the spill devastates the Gulf Coast , some local activists and faculty members say it 's time to end the partnership . `` Our bottom line is the public good , and their bottom line is profit , '' said Ignacio Chapela , a UC Berkeley professor of environmental science . `` There comes a point where those positions are irreconcilable , and I think that point is now . '' On Friday , a group of activists staged an anti-BP demonstration next to the construction site where the university is building a new facility to house the research institute . They poured chocolate syrup on the sidewalk -- to represent the oil spill -- and held signs the read `` Berkeley Petroleum '' and `` Do you want BP Pollution in Berkeley ? '' `` Now that we can see what BP is responsible for in the Gulf , we demand that the contract between UC and BP be re-looked at , '' activist Stephanie Tang said , speaking to onlookers through a megaphone . But UC Berkeley officials say the institute has nothing to do with the Gulf spill , and the university has no plans to end its research partnership with BP . `` The horrible events in the Gulf should only strengthen our commitment to find alternatives to fossil fuels , '' said Graham Fleming , UC Berkeley 's vice chancellor of research . `` Why would anyone 's interest be served by stopping this research ? '' BP officials also say the company remains committed to funding the Berkeley-based research institute , as well as its other alternative energy research programs . `` The spill has n't changed our commitment to investing in biofuels and wind and solar development , '' said BP spokesman Tom Mueller . The BP-Berkeley partnership has stirred debate about corporate funding of academic research at a time when UC is grappling with deep cuts in state funding that have led to faculty furloughs , course cutbacks and steep tuition hikes . Critics say corporate money steers university resources toward certain types of research , and widens the financial disparity between faculty members in science and engineering and those in the humanities and social sciences . `` It creates an apartheid within the university between the haves and have-nots , '' said Miguel Altieri , a UC Berkeley entomology professor who is concerned about the environmental impact of biofuels . He recently wrote a newspaper article urging UC Berkeley officials to terminate the research partnership . UC Berkeley receives research grants from other corporations , mostly in the technology sector , but none are as big as the BP grant . Partnering with private industry helps university researchers get their ideas and discoveries out of the laboratory and into the real world , said UC 's Fleming . The Energy Biosciences Institute funds nearly 70 projects involving about 350 researchers at UC Berkeley and its two partner institutions -- Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . The academic researchers determine what research to pursue , their participation is completely voluntary and their home institutions own the patents on their discoveries , university officials said .

Bobby Jindal at a press conference held to address the reopening of commercial fishing areas along the Louisiana coast in Venice , La. . AP July 31 : Oil containment boom is laid out in Treasure Pass , in waters near Yscloskey , La. . AP Experts have said for some time that the oil spill in the Gulf is one of the greatest environmental disasters in history , and the government has grim new figures to confirm that fact . The Obama administration said Monday that scientists now estimate nearly 5 million barrels of oil have leaked into the Gulf since the April 20 explosion that sunk the BP-run Deepwater Horizon offshore rig . `` Not all of this oil and gas flowed into the ocean , '' the administration said in its latest report on the disaster , noting that about 800,000 barrels of oil were captured before the well was capped in mid-July . The latest figures still are enough to secure the BP spill 's status as the world 's worst accidental release of oil , topping Mexico 's 1979 spill at Ixtoc I , which leaked 3.3 million barrels of oil . BP still has yet to permanently plug the busted well . After insisting for months that a pair of costly relief wells were the only surefire way to kill the oil leak at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico , BP officials said Monday they may be able to do it just with lines running from a ship to the blown-out well a mile below . As crews planned testing to determine whether to proceed with a `` static kill '' to pump mud and perhaps cement down the throat of the well , BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells said if it 's successful the relief wells may not be needed , after all , to do the same weeks later from the bottom . The primary relief well , near completion , will still be finished and could be used simply to ensure the leak is plugged , Wells said . `` Even if we were to pump the cement from the top , we will still continue on with the relief well and confirm that the well is dead , '' he said . Either way , `` we want to end up with cement in the bottom of the hole . '' Government officials and company executives have long said the wells , which can cost about $ 100 million each , may be the only way to make certain the oil is contained to its vast undersea reservoir . The company began drilling the primary , 18,000-foot relief well May 2 , 12 days after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and killed 11 workers , and a second backup well May 16 . The first well is now only about 100 feet from the target , and Wells said it could reach it as early as Aug. 11 . `` Precisely what the relief wells will do remains to be seen given what we learn from the static kill , '' BP spokesman Daren Beaudo said . `` Ca n't predict it for certain . '' Retired Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man on the spill response , said Monday that the focus now is on making sure the static kill is successful . But he cautioned that federal officials do n't see it as `` the end all , be all until we get the relief well done . '' One of the biggest variables is whether the area called the annulus , which is between the inner piping and the outer casing , has sprung an oil leak . Engineers probably wo n't be able to answer that question until they drill in from the bottom , he said . `` Everyone would like to have this thing over as soon as possible , '' Allen said , adding : `` We do n't know the condition of the well until we start pushing mud into it . '' The company 's statements Monday might signal that it is more concerned than it has acknowledged about debris found in the relief well after it was briefly capped as Tropical Storm Bonnie passed last week , said Ed Overton , a Louisiana State University environmental sciences professor . Plus , trying to seal the well from the top gives BP two shots at ending the disaster , Overton said . `` Frankly , if they can shut it off from the top and it 's a good , permanent seal , I 'll take it , '' Overton said . `` A bird in the hand at this point is a good thing with this deal . '' Before the effort can begin , engineers must probe the broken blowout preventer with an oil-like liquid to decide whether it can handle the static kill process . They had hoped to begin the hours-long test Monday but delayed it until Tuesday after a small leak was discovered in the hydraulic control system . The static kill is meant as a bit of insurance for the crews who have spent months fighting the oil spill . The only thing keeping oil from blowing into the Gulf at the moment is the experimental cap , which has held for more than two weeks but was never meant to be permanent . BP and federal officials have managed to contain large parts of the spill through skimmers , oil-absorbant boom and chemical dispersants meant to break up the oil . Federal regulators have come under fire from critics who say that BP was allowed to use excessive amounts of the dispersants , but government officials counter that they have helped dramatically cut the use of the chemicals since late May . The Environmental Protection Agency released a study Monday concluding that when mixed with oil , chemical dispersants used to break up the crude in the Gulf are no more toxic to aquatic life than oil alone .

'' Here 's a look at what the president and administration have been doing every day since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 , triggering the massive spill . The following daily updates are based on a review of White House schedules , news releases and news coverage and do not cover every activity in the Gulf or in Washington : In the Gulf : BP claimed a key milestone Wednesday in the effort to plug its blown-out well as a government report said much of the spilled oil is gone , heartening officials who have taken heat during the tricky cleanup but leaving some Gulf Coast residents still skeptical . BP reported that mud forced down the well overnight was pushing the crude back down to its source for the first time since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded off Louisiana on April 20 , killing 11 workers . And a federal report being released Wednesday indicated that only about a quarter of the spilled oil remains in the Gulf , with the rest having been contained , cleaned up or otherwise disappeared . At the White House : President Obama applauded the headway that has been made to stop the worst U.S. oil spill , telling union officials in Washington that the Gulf of Mexico operation is `` finally close to coming to an end . '' He said people 's lives `` have been turned upside down '' as a result of the April 20 BP oil spill , but said he was heartened by indications the spill is , at last , being brought under control . In the Gulf : Crews prepared to pump mud into the blown-out well , provided a test on the process is successful . Meanwhile , BP announced it had created a new team to accelerate compensation to Gulf businesses . At the White House : President Obama signed a law reducing disparities between crack and cocaine prison sentences . He was hosting a meeting with `` young African leaders '' in the East Room of the White House Tuesday afternoon . In the Gulf : Crews prepared to test whether they could move forward with a plan to pump mud and other material into the blown-out well on the Gulf of Mexico floor . The process known as a `` static kill '' was being considered as BP neared completion on a pair of relief wells , long seen as the way to choke off the leak for good . At the White House : President Obama delivered a speech in Atlanta outlining his commitment to ending the war in Iraq . In the Gulf : Congressional investigators said the Coast Guard routinely approved requests made by BP to use chemical dispersants to break up the oil slicks in the Gulf despite a federal order to use the chemicals sparingly . At the White House : President Obama played basketball with White House staff members at Fort McNair . In the Gulf : Tropical Storm Bonnie left crews working to plug the Gulf oil gusher a little memento that is expected to push their work back about a day . Crews found debris in the bottom of the relief well that ultimately will be used to plug the leak for good , retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said Friday . The government 's point man on the spill said the sediment settled in the relief well last week when crews popped in a plug to keep it safe ahead of Bonnie . At the White House : President Obama has no public events scheduled . In the Gulf : BP 's new boss says it 's time for a `` scaleback '' in cleaning up the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . Federal officials say there is no way the crude could reach the East Coast . And fishing areas are starting to reopen . There were several signs Friday that the era of thousands of oil-skimming boats and hazmat-suited beach crews is giving way to long-term efforts to clean up , compensate people for their losses and understand the damage wrought . Local fishermen are doubtful , however , and say oil remains a bigger problem than BP and the federal government are letting on . Other people contend the impact of the spill has been overblown , given that little oil remains on the Gulf surface , but Bob Dudley , who heads BP 's oil spill recovery and will take over as CEO in October , rejected those claims . At the White House : President Obama headed to the heart of the U.S. auto industry to push an important election-year claim : his administration 's unpopular auto industry bailout has turned into an economic good-news story . In the Gulf : Even when the oily sheen starts fading from the surface of the Gulf of Mexico , it manages to become bad news for fishermen . Many of those whose fisheries were shut down by the oil spill have found work skimming oil , putting out boom or ferrying cleanup supplies through BP 's Vessels of Opportunity program . But as the crude sinks , evaporates or breaks down , they may be left with nothing to do but wait for their claim checks to arrive and for their fishing grounds to reopen . At the White House : President Obama delivered an education reform speech Thursday morning at the National Urban League 's 100th Anniversary Convention in the nation 's capital . Later in the morning , the president met with his national security team to discuss Afghanistan and Pakistan . In the afternoon , he delivered remarks and signed the Tribal Law and Order Act in the East Room . In the Gulf : With 100 days having passed since the April 20 explosion that triggered the massive leak , oil has mostly stopped collecting at the surface . Scientists , though , are unsure how much is left and where it all is . At the White House : President Obama was heading to New York City for a taping of `` The View '' and two Democratic fundraisers . In the Gulf : BP named its first American CEO , Robert Dudley , who is set to replace Tony Hayward on Oct. 1 . The firm also announced a record $ 17 billion loss in the last quarter . At the White House : President Obama spoke in the Rose Garden about the Afghanistan war , addressing the leak of thousands of sensitive documents by the online group Wikileaks . In the Gulf : More details emerged about the future of embattled BP CEO Tony Hayward . Sky News reported that Hayward will step down from BP 's top post in October and take a job with TNK-BP , the company 's joint venture in Russia . At the White House : President Obama delivered a public statement urging GOP senators to clear the way for a vote on Democrat-backed campaign finance legislation . In the Gulf : Reports surfaced that BP CEO Tony Hayward would be replaced , likely by Managing Director Bob Dudley . The move comes after Hayward was persistently criticized for his comments on and handling of the BP spill . Meanwhile , crews working to permanently seal the Gulf of Mexico oil leak were back on the scene Sunday after evacuating ahead of Tropical Storm Bonnie . Though the storm fizzled , crews are working hard to finish a relief well before more bad weather disrupts the procedure . At the White House : President Obama played golf at Andrews Air Force Base . In the Gulf : Ships steamed to safer waters and coastal workers packed up oil removal operations as remnants of Tropical Storm Bonnie rolled into the Gulf of Mexico on Saturday . By daybreak , all but a handful of the ships working at the well site were expected to be out of the way of the storm . The mechanical cap that has mostly contained the oil for eight days was left closed , and there was no worry the storm could cause any problems with the plug because it 's nearly a mile -LRB- 1.6 kilometers -RRB- below the ocean 's surface . At the White House President Obama has no public events scheduled . In the Gulf : Ships monitoring BP 's broken oil well stood fast Friday as the remnants of Tropical Storm Bonnie blew toward the spill site , threatening to force a full evacuation that would leave engineers clueless about whether a makeshift cap on the gusher was holding . Vessels connected to deep-sea robots equipped with cameras and seismic devices would be among the last to flee and would ride out the rough weather if possible , retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said . At the White House : President Obama proclaimed a week of `` enormous progress '' in fixing economic problems and cracking down on Wall Street , prodding the Senate to do even more by passing tax credits for small businesses . Obama went before the cameras to praise a trio of matters he signed into law this week -- an overhaul of financial regulations , an effort to shrink wasteful government payments , and an extension of unemployment benefits for millions of jobless people . In the Gulf : Dozens of ships were preparing Thursday to pull out of the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical storm brewed in the Caribbean , halting deep-sea efforts to plug BP 's ruptured oil well . Though the rough weather was hundreds of miles -LRB- kilometers -RRB- from the spill site , officials ordered technicians to suspend work Wednesday as they would need several days to clear the area . The government 's oil spill chief was waiting to see how the storm developed before deciding whether to order the ships to evacuate . At the White House : President Obama will sign into law a bill that would require U.S. agencies to redouble their efforts to identify and recover billions of dollars lost annually to wasteful spending . He 's also meeting with Gen. Ray Odierno , the top U.S. commander in Iraq and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner . In the Gulf : Tropical rainstorms moving toward the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday threatened to shut down undersea efforts to seal BP 's ruptured well , interrupting work just as engineers get close to plugging the leak with mud and cement . A weather system brewing in the Caribbean prompted crews to temporarily cork a relief tunnel deep beneath the sea floor , BP vice president Kent Wells said Wednesday afternoon . The storm is still hundreds of miles away and may never reach the area , but the oil giant does n't want to risk damaging BP 's best bet at permanently sealing the well . At the White House : President Obama signs financial overhaul bill into law . Receives oil spill briefing . In the Gulf : The government 's oil spill chief tried to tamp down fears Tuesday that BP 's capped well is buckling under the pressure , saying that seepage detected along the sea floor less than two miles away is coming from an older well no longer in production . Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen also said at least five leaks have been discovered around the well machinery , but he dismissed them as `` very small drips '' -- `` not unlike an oil leak you might have in your car . '' At the White House : President Obama welcomes British Prime Minister David Cameron for his first visit . In the Gulf : After detecting possible seepage near the blown-out well on the Gulf floor , the federal government on Monday allowed BP to keep its new well cap in place for another day . Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said the firm is monitoring for any new leaks at the site . At the White House : President Obama , in a morning statement to the press , urged Senate Republicans to support a jobless benefits extension coming up for a vote . He later was hosting the WNBA 's Phoenix Mercury in honor of the team 's 2009 championship . In the Gulf : BP said it wants to keep using a new well cap to prevent any more oil from leaking into the Gulf of Mexico . However , administration pointman Thad Allen said the day before that the plan was to use the cap to continue pumping oil to the surface after testing is complete . Allen will make the final call . At the White House : The Obama family returned to Washington after their vacation in Bar Harbor , Maine . In the Gulf : Engineers kept vigil Saturday over the massive cap holding back oil from BP 's busted Gulf well , their eyes glued to monitors in a faraway control room that displayed pressure readings , temperature gauges and underwater images . Their round-the-clock work deciphering a puzzle of data from undersea robots and instruments at the wellhead is helping BP and the government determine whether the cap is holding tight as the end of a critical 48-hour testing window approaches . Signs so far have been promising but inconclusive . At the White House : President Obama is on a family vacation in Maine . In the Gulf : BP says there are no signs that its busted Gulf of Mexico well has started leaking underground more than a day after it was capped . Kent Wells , a BP PLC vice president , said on a Friday evening conference call that engineers are closely monitoring pressure as well as the temperature and sounds around the well . At the White House : Cheered by a key victory in Congress and good news from the Gulf oil spill zone , a relaxed President Obama began a weekend holiday Friday on a sun-dappled mountain peak overlooking the rocky Atlantic coast . In the Gulf : BP says oil from its broken well has stopped gushing into the Gulf of Mexico for the first time since April . The announcement Thursday came after company officials said all valves had been shut on a new cap over the busted well in an experiment to stop the spill . At the White House : President Obama delivered remarks at a groundbreaking ceremony in Michigan . In the Gulf : As BP waited for the all-clear to resume testing of its new well cap , scientists reportedly found that the spill was beginning the affect the food chain in the Gulf by killing some organisms and triggering others to multiply in the tainted water . At the White House : President Obama was scheduled to attend a meeting about his administration 's cybersecurity efforts . He was set to meet with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and House Democratic leaders later in the day . In the Gulf : BP decided to delay tests on its new well cap after government officials called for more analysis . The oil firm is hoping to use the cap to be able to stop the oil flow for the first time since the April 20 explosion that triggered the leak . At the White House : President Obama unveiled his new strategy for fighting HIV\\/AIDS , calling for reducing new infections by 25 percent over the next five years . In the Gulf : BP planned to attach a new cap on Monday to the blown-out oil well on the Gulf floor . After attaching the 150,000-pound device , BP planned to test it to see whether it would be able to plug the oil . At the White House : President Obama was hosting Dominican Republican President Leonel Fernandez at the White House . In the Gulf : BP was in the process of replacing a leaking cap with what they claimed would be a better containment system . Until that system is in place , though , oil could be seen spewing out of the hole into the Gulf of Mexico -- BP estimated it would take between three and six days to finish the operation . At the White House : President Obama played golf at Fort Belvoir in Virginia . In the Gulf : Undersea robots manipulated by engineers a mile above will begin work Saturday removing the containment cap over the gushing well head in the Gulf of Mexico to replace it with a tighter-fitting cap that could funnel all the oil to tankers at the surface . If all goes according to plan , the tandem of the tighter cap and the tankers could keep all the oil from polluting the fragile Gulf as soon as Monday . But it 's only a temporary solution . It wo n't plug the busted well , the leak will get worse before it gets better -- and it remains uncertain that it will succeed . As much as 5 million gallons could gush out between the old cap 's removal and the new cap 's installation and connection to a ship . At the White House : President Obama has no public events scheduled . In the Gulf : The first of two relief wells being drilled to stop the Gulf oil gusher could be done by the end of the month , BP officials say , but if that does n't succeed , one backup being considered is transferring the crude to non-producing underwater wells that are miles away . BP would run the flow through pipelines across the floor of the Gulf of Mexico , said retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the Obama administration 's point man on the crisis . At the White House : President Obama is wrapping up a two-day swing through Missouri and Nevada with a speech on clean energy . In the Gulf : A relief well being drilled deep into the seafloor of the Gulf of Mexico to shut down the gushing oil well could be completed ahead of a long-set deadline of mid-August only if conditions are ideal . National Incident Commander and retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said Thursday that the relief well is expected to intercept and penetrate the Deepwater Horizon well pipe about 18,000 feet -LRB- 5,500 meters -RRB- below sea level within seven to 10 days . At the White House : President Obama traveled to Kansas City , Mo. , to talk about the economy and delivered speeches at back-to-back fundraisers for Senate candidate Robin Carnahan before heading for Las Vegas . At the White House : President Obama will spend part of his day on export promotion as well as the Gulf oil spill . In the morning , Obama will give remarks in the East Room on his administration 's commitment to export promotion to grow the economy and support new American jobs . At midday , he and Vice President Biden will get a briefing in the Oval Office on the oil spill . In the Gulf : Authorities were probing whether tar balls that washed up on the Texas shore came directly from the BP oil spill . The Galveston mayor said he was `` cautiously optimistic '' the contamination was a fluke , and not a sign of more oil to come . At the White House : President Obama met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House . In the Gulf : Rough weather and rough waters put a hold on testing for a massive Taiwanese oil skimmer , the latest hope for cleaning up millions of gallons of oil in the Gulf . Meanwhile , the cost to BP of cleaning up the disaster passed the $ 3 billion mark . At the White House : No public events . In the Gulf : A massive oil skimmer was undergoing testing in the Gulf as BP and the Coast Guard hoped to unleash it on the widespread oil spill . The Taiwanese vessel is billed as the biggest oil skimmer in the world and is the latest hope for cleaning up the millions of gallons of oil that have spewed into the waters . At the White House : President Obama played golf at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland in the morning . He was set to make Fourth of July remarks at the White House in the evening . In the Gulf : BP is not hiring nearly enough claims adjusters to keep up with a flood of claims from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , a consultant hired by the state of Louisiana says . The consultant also says the number of checks being sent spiked less than a week after Louisiana put pressure on the company to speed up claims . And it says the average amount per check peaked when BP gave the state data for large loss claims . A BP spokesman did not comment directly about the findings , but asserted the company has responded appropriately . At the White House : President Obama is at Camp David but will return in the evening to get ready for July Fourth celebrations at the White House . On Sunday , the first family hosts military heroes and their families for an Independence Day celebration that includes a barbecue , concert and a view of fireworks from the South Lawn . Staff and their families from throughout the administration will also be there . The president will deliver remarks . In the Gulf : BP and several wildlife protection groups are working out the final details of an agreement to resolve a lawsuit alleging turtles were being killed as BP burned oil from its blown-out well in the Gulf of Mexico , attorneys said Friday . The deal under negotiation calls for biologists or other trained observers to be present whenever oil is burned , looking for any turtles trapped in corrals that BP PLC is using to capture and burn oil on the surface of the water , said plaintiffs ' attorney William Eubanks . At the White House : President Obama traveled to Charleston , WV to attend the state memorial service for Sen. Robert Byrd . In the Gulf : Based on a federal government estimate , the BP spill was expected to become the largest ever in the Gulf by Thursday . By reaching 140 million gallons of leaked oil , it would surpass the prior record set by the Ixtoc I spill three decades ago . At the White House : President Obama was set to deliver a speech calling for a comprehensive immigration package . He was scheduled to receive a briefing on the oil spill later in the afternoon , before welcoming the winners of the Women 's Professional Soccer championship at the White House . In the Gulf : Small skimmers were forced into port for a second day after winds from Hurricane Alex churned up big waves . Most cleanup crews ' work was halted , though the government brought in a massive former tanker to take on oil-skimming duties . At the White House : President Obama delivered an economic speech and answered questions at a town hall-style meeting in Racine , Wis. . In the Gulf : Concerns continued to grow that Tropical Storm Alex could disrupt cleanup efforts in the Gulf of Mexico . The storm was expected to gain hurricane strength later in the day and while its projected course is not near the spill site the waves generated by high winds could make it impossible to use skimmers and boom . At the White House : President Obama was scheduled to meet with senators to discuss climate legislation , before meeting with Saudi Arabian King Abdullah and later members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to discuss immigration . In the Gulf : BP denied a report that CEO Tony Hayward is resigning , as its cleanup costs for the spill reached $ 2.65 billion . The report came from Russia 's RIA Novosti news agency , but BP claimed it was `` definitely not correct . '' At the White House : President Obama received briefings at the Oval Office and met with senior advisers . In the Gulf : Tropical Storm Alex was downgraded to a tropical depression as it hit part of Mexico , but concerns remained that the system could become more severe as it tracked toward the Gulf of Mexico . It was n't expected to hit the site of the spill , but if it changed course or stirred up high winds could grind the clean-up to a halt . At the White House : President Obama held a series of meetings on the economy in Toronto at the G20 summit . World leaders pledged to cut deficits in half in three years . In the Gulf : Tropical weather gathering strength in the Caribbean could be the latest bad news for BP crews trying to contain and clean up the massive oil spill in the Gulf , an effort that has been plagued with setbacks for more than two months . It is still too early to tell exactly where tropical storm Alex might go how it might affect oil on and below the surface of the Gulf of Mexico , forecasters said . At the White House : President Obama finishes up with the G8 meeting in Huntsville and then travels south to Toronto where he will participate in the G20 meeting . In the Gulf : BP claimed that tests show a relief well should be completed by mid-August . The well is considered the best hope for permanently plugging the leaking oil . At the White House : President Obama traveled to Toronto to meet with G8 leaders . In the Gulf : A cap was back in place on BP 's broken oil well after a deep-sea blunder forced crews to temporarily remove what has been the most effective method so far for containing some of the massive Gulf of Mexico spill . Engineers using remote-controlled submarines repositioned the cap late Wednesday after it had been off for much of the day . It had captured 700,000 gallons of oil in 24 hours before one of the robots bumped into it late in the morning . Bob Dudley , BP 's new point man for the oil response , said crews had done the right thing to remove the cap because fluid seemed to be leaking and could have been a safety hazard . At the White House : President Obama held a bilateral meeting and joint news conference with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev . In the Gulf : BP PLC said that managing director Bob Dudley will head the new Gulf Coast Restoration Organization , which is in charge of cleaning up the oil spill . Dudley wo n't say if the oil giant will resume deepwater drilling in the Gulf , where it 's the largest oil and gas producer . Dudley says the company will `` step back '' from the issue while investigating the April 20 explosion . Dudley told the CBS `` Early Show '' he has completed taking over the disaster response and cleanup from CEO Tony Hayward . Hayward repeatedly sparked criticism from the Gulf to the U.S. Capitol for missteps and insensitive comments . At the White House : The White House has promised an immediate appeal of a federal judge 's reversal of the administration 's six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico . And Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said he will issue a new order imposing a moratorium that eliminates any doubt it is needed and appropriate . Judge Martin Feldman overturned the ban Tuesday , saying the government simply assumed that because one rig exploded , the others pose an imminent danger , too . The Interior Department had imposed the moratorium last month in the wake of the BP disaster , halting approval of any new permits for deepwater projects and suspending drilling on 33 exploratory wells . In the Gulf : The owner of the offshore rig involved in the massive Gulf oil spill sharply criticized the U.S. government 's six-month ban on deepwater drilling . Transocean Ltd. president Steven Newman told reporters at an oil industry conference in London that there were things the Obama administration `` could implement today that would allow the industry to go back to work tomorrow without an arbitrary six-month time limit . '' At the White House : President Obama will meet with health insurers and state insurance commissioners at the White House . Afterward , he will speak to reporters about the ongoing effort to implement the new health care overhaul law , and the new benefits it affords to families across the country . He 'll deliver his remarks in the East Room . In the evening , Obama will speak to gay activists at the White House . Vice President Biden will also attend the event . In the Gulf : BP announced that it has spent $ 2 billion so far to tackle the oil spill in the Gulf and compensate victims . BP also confirmed to Fox News that the company was shifting responsibility for day-to-day handling of the spill from CEO Tony Hayward -- who has come under fire for his remarks about the spill and most recently for spending the weekend at a yacht race -- to Managing Director Robert Dudley . At the White House : President Obama delivered remarks on fatherhood in Washington , D.C. , before hosting a Father 's Day `` mentoring barbecue '' at the White House . In the Gulf : Louisianans observe a day of prayer over the oil spill . At the White House : President Obama has no public events scheduled . In the Gulf : As Gulf states struggled to deal with the up to 120 million gallons of oil that have escaped from a blown-out undersea well , BP chief executive Tony Hayward took time off Saturday to attend a glitzy yacht race off England 's Isle of Wright . In a statement , BP described Hayward 's day off as `` a rare moment of private time '' and said that `` no matter where he is , he is always in touch with what is happening within BP '' and can direct recovery operations if required . At the White House : President Obama and Vice President Biden went golfing together . In the Gulf : Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said an estimated 2,000 private boats in the so-called `` vessels of opportunity '' program will be more closely linked through a tighter command and control structure to direct them to locations less than 50 miles offshore to skim the oil . Allen , the point man for the federal response to the spill , previously had said surface containment efforts would be concentrated much farther offshore . At the White House : Kenneth Feinberg , who was chosen by President Obama and BP to oversee a program processing claims from the oil spill , said a plan to handle the remaining damage claims will be in place in 30 to 45 days . In the Gulf : A relief well meant to stanch a gushing flow of oil into the Gulf of Mexico is ahead of schedule and could reach its target in three to four weeks , says Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen . He said a rig has drilled nearly 10,000 feet below the seafloor and should be within 10 feet of the existing well within weeks . It will then bore down about 1,000 feet to intersect with the damaged well farther underground . Allen says the final push of drilling is the most difficult . The well originally was slated for completion in mid-August . On Capitol Hill : A grim-faced BP chief executive Tony Hayward said Thursday he was `` deeply sorry '' for his company 's catastrophic oil spill . `` I understand the seriousness of the situation , the frustrations and fears that continue to be voiced , '' he told a House investigations subcommittee . He also said , `` The fire and explosion on the Deepwater Horizon never should have happened and I 'm deeply sorry that it did . '' And , while `` we need to know what went wrong '' Hayward also said there is still `` extensive work to do '' before anyone can say what caused the blowout . In the Gulf : Trying to shrink the amount of crude polluting the Gulf of Mexico , BP started burning oil siphoned from the leaking well . The firm was continuing to work after a lightning strike Tuesday started a fire and forced operations to stop for hours . At the White House : President Obama announced that BP has agreed to set up a $ 20 billion account to compensate spill victims following his first meeting with top-level executives . BP 's chairman , who publicly apologized for the disaster , also announced that the company would not pay out any more dividends for the rest of the year . In the Gulf : As BP continued to siphon leaking oil to the surface , the company faced new questions about documents turned up by congressional investigators that suggested BP was cutting corners with the Deepwater Horizon well when it came to design and safety measures . At the White House : President Obama was scheduled to tour an emergency resource center in Pensacola , Fla. , where oil has not yet hit the beaches but local officials are preparing . The president was meeting again with Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , before returning to Washington where he planned to deliver his first Oval Office address to the nation . In the Gulf : BP submitted a plan to the Coast Guard to speed up the containment of oil gushing out of the blown-out well . Under the new timeline , BP claims it can capture more than 50,000 barrels a day by the end of June . Under the prior timeline , that target would n't be reached until mid-July . The company said it plans to bring in vessels from Europe and South America to keep on schedule . At the White House : President Obama made his fourth trip to the Gulf Coast to survey the oil spill damage . He landed in Biloxi , Miss. , to meet with local officials before heading to Alabama . Obama said he was pressing to make sure local residents suffering from economic damages are adequately compensated . In the Gulf : BP was to submit a plan for a faster containment of the oil after it multiplied estimates last week about the number of barrels pouring into the Gulf each day . Adm. Thad Allen , the national incident commander , said more than 4,000 vessels are in the water trying to help catch the oil . The oil , however , continues to wash ashore in Alabama . Sensors are also being placed on the sea floor to determine how much oil is being collected . At the White House : The White House announced that President Obama will address the nation on Tuesday night after his return from a two-day trip to the Gulf region . The White House also is planning an escrow fund for BP to contribute money for local businesses . It will be managed by a third party In the Gulf : BP announced it will donate its share of the proceeds generated by selling the oil captured from the well to fund efforts to protect and restore wildlife habitat along the Gulf Coast . But the company has not released specifics on how the fund will work and said it does n't know how much money might be raised . Yet once the oil is brought to shore , it will creep into the world 's economic supply chain unnoticed by consumers . At the White House : Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the Obama administration 's point man for the oil spill , said that since the leak began , 4 million gallons -LRB- 15 million liters -RRB- of crude have been siphoned off the leaking well using tubes and caps . An additional 18 million gallons -LRB- 68 million liters -RRB- have been skimmed from the ocean surface , he said . The skimmed liquid is generally only 10 to 15 percent oil . In the Gulf : The situation turned out to be more dire than previously thought after new scientific estimates were released that showed oil flowing at a rate of up to 2.1 million gallons a day -- more than twice the previous estimate . That means more than 100 million gallons may have already spilled into the Gulf of Mexico . At the White House : President Obama received a briefing on the oil spill , before meeting with small business owners and delivering remarks about his small business initiative . The White House released new details of the president 's upcoming trip to the Gulf , his fourth since the oil rig explosion . Obama plans to visit Gulfport , Miss. ; Theodore , Ala. ; and Pensacola , Fla. , on Monday and Tuesday . In the Gulf : BP awaited the arrival of a second vessel to help pump more oil from the ruptured well up to the surface -- the containment cap was capturing 630,000 gallons a day , but the second vessel is expected to double that . Meanwhile , local business owners and workers who have filed damage claims were complaining that BP is slow to respond and not paying them enough for their losses . At the White House : President Obama was scheduled to meet in the afternoon with the families of those killed on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig . He was also receiving a briefing on the oil spill in the morning and meeting with business leaders and energy experts to discuss energy reform after his meeting with the families . In the Gulf : BP said it is dialing back a prediction by its chief operating officer that the leaking oil would be reduced to a `` relative trickle '' by next week . COO Doug Suttles now says it will take more time to reach that point . At the White House : Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , who is heading the U.S. oil spill response , said the containment operation is now catching up to 630,000 gallons -LRB- 2.3 million liters -RRB- a day and that the amount could nearly double by next week as processing of the captured oil is expanded . In the Gulf : While the wellhead has been capped , oil that was still leaking and oil that has already leaked was separating and spreading out along the Gulf shore . Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen warned the day before that the slick is no longer a `` large , monolithic spill . '' Rather , it is an `` aggregation of hundreds or thousands of patches of oil that are going a lot of different directions . '' Local officials continued to express concerns about the impact the spill would have on the economy as tourism season begins . At the White House : President Obama was receiving a briefing on the spill in the morning before leaving to conduct a `` tele-town hall meeting '' on health care issues concerning seniors . He and first lady Michelle Obama were holding a congressional picnic at the White House later in the day . In the Gulf : Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen reported that the cap on the wellhead was capturing 460,000 gallons of oil a day -- up from 250,000 on Friday . At that rate , the cap could be diverting as little as 37 percent or as much as 77 percent of the oil leaking from the Gulf floor . Patches of oil were spreading out all along the Gulf region . Florida 's Panama City Beach was expected to get hit by oil within 72 hours , while Pensacola Beach continued to have tar balls wash ashore . At the White House : President Obama and top federal officials were briefed in Washington by Allen on the BP spill . The president said the Gulf region will `` bounce back '' from the crisis and be `` stronger than ever . '' Obama was scheduled to participate in a high school graduation ceremony in Kalamazoo , Mich. , later in the evening . In the Gulf : BP CEO Tony Hayward said the container collected 10,500 barrels in 24 hours . Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour said the spill is killing tourism though the beaches in his state are not suffering badly from the oil . National Incident Commander Adm. Thad Allen told morning news shows that progress is being made but the relief well is the ultimate solution . At the White House : More Coast Guard are being sent to the region for direct oversight of the contractors . Allen said he reports to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and President Obama but he is the on-scene coordinator and he makes the calls in the gulf . In the Gulf : BP worked on its latest attempt to tame the runaway well by capping it and trying to siphon off some of the crude . The damaged rig has disgorged at least 22 million gallons of crude in the Gulf . At the White House : In his weekly radio and Internet address recorded from the Gulf , President Obama promised to fight the oil spill and maintained his increasingly forceful tone toward BP . In the Gulf : BP engineers adjusted a sophisticated cap over the Gulf oil gusher , trying to collect the crude now fouling four states .

At the White House : President Obama was in Louisiana , his second trip in a week and the third since the disaster unfolded . In the Gulf : BP CEO Tony Hayward hailed the company 's work after underwater robots successfully sheared off a busted oil pipe spewing millions of gallons of crude into the Gulf , telling reporters that the company would have a `` fully sealed '' containment system in place by the end of June . At the White House : The White House announced President Obama will return to the Louisiana Gulf Coast Friday , his third trop to the region since the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion on April 20 . In the Gulf : BP 's effort to contain the oil gusher hit a snag when a saw became stuck in a thick pipe on a blown-out well in the Gulf of Mexico . Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said the goal was to free the saw and finish the cut later in the day . At the White House : The Justice Department has announced it started criminal and civil probes into the spill , although the department did not name specific targets for prosecution . In the Gulf : BP is moving to start its first major pipe cut as soon as Wednesday , after which they will attempt to place a cap-like containment device over the leaking riser that would siphon the mixture to the surface . At the White House : President Obama gave the leaders of an independent commission investigating the Gulf oil spill marching orders to thoroughly examine the disaster and its causes to ensure that the nation never faces such a catastrophe again . He said if any laws were broken , people will be prosecuted . In the Gulf : Transocean , which owned the rig that it leased to BP , said it would like its liability limited . The beach at Grand Isle , La. , which was hit with oil from the spill , and other areas along the coast were opened but swimming and fishing was prohibited .

AP Aug 3 : The Helix Q4000 , the vessel being used to conduct the ` static kill ' procedure , at the site of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill . AP ON THE GULF OF MEXICO -- In a significant step toward stopping the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history , BP said Wednesday mud that was forced down its blown-out well was holding back the flow of crude in the Gulf of Mexico and it was in a `` static condition . '' Workers stopped pumping mud in after about eight hours of their `` static kill '' procedure and were monitoring the well to ensure it remained stable , BP said . `` The well pressure is now being controlled by the hydrostatic pressure of the drilling mud , the desired outcome of the static kill procedure , '' the company said in a statement . BP spokeswoman Sheila Williams said , `` It 's a milestone . It 's a step toward the killing of the well . '' The next step would be deciding whether to cement the well , Williams said . The pressure in the well dropped quickly in the first 90 minutes of the static kill procedure Tuesday , a sign that everything was going as planned , wellsite leader Bobby Bolton told AP . Bolton said Tuesday night that the procedure was going well . `` Pressure is down and appears to be stabilizing , '' he told the AP then . But the mud that was forced down the broken wellhead to permanently plug the gusher is only half the story . To call the mission a success , crews working on a flotilla of vessels on a desolate patch of water need to seal off the well from two directions . The static kill -- also known as bullheading -- involved slowly pumping the mud from a ship down lines running to the top of the ruptured well a mile below . BP has said that may be enough by itself to seal the well . Still , an 18,000-foot relief well that BP has been drilling for the past three months will be used later this month to execute a `` bottom kill , '' in which mud and cement will be injected into the bedrock 21\\/2 miles below the sea floor to finish the job , retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said . `` There should be no ambiguity about that , '' Allen said . `` I 'm the national incident commander , and this is how this will be handled . '' A 75-ton cap placed on the well in July has been keeping the oil bottled up inside over the past three weeks , but that is considered only a temporary measure . BP and the Coast Guard want to plug up the hole with a column of heavy drilling mud and cement to seal it off more securely . Before the cap was lowered onto the well , 172 million gallons of crude flowed into the sea , unleashed by the April 20 explosion aboard the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon that killed 11 workers . A previous , similar effort failed in May when the mud could n't overcome the unstemmed flow of oil . BP wo n't know for certain whether the static kill has succeeded until engineers can use the soon-to-be-completed relief well to check their work . The task is becoming more urgent because peak hurricane season is just around the corner , Allen said . Tropical Storm Colin formed then dissipated far out in the Atlantic on Tuesday , but early forecasts say it will travel toward the East Coast rather than the Gulf .

AP BP officials on Friday left open the door to someday drilling again into the same lucrative undersea pocket of oil that spilled millions of gallons of crude , wrecked livelihoods and fouled beaches along the Gulf of Mexico -- and , for now , the Obama administration is n't shooting the idea down either . The Interior Department would only go as far as to say that BP would n't regain access to the now-capped well that began gushing oil after the deadly April 20 explosion at a company-run rig off Louisiana . `` The well is almost dead . Under no circumstances are we going to allow them to reopen the well to extract oil and gas from the Macondo well , '' Interior spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff told FoxNews.com . But BP may be interested in the vast oil reservoir beneath the blown well that is still believed to hold nearly $ 4 billion worth of crude . With the company and its partners facing tens of billions of dollars in liabilities , the incentive to exploit the wells and the reservoir could grow . `` There 's lots of oil and gas here , '' Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said at a news briefing Friday when asked about the possibility . `` We 're going to have to think about what to do with that at some point . '' BP spokesman Daren Beaudo emphasized to FoxNews.com that the company has no plans to develop the reservoir . `` We 're focused 100 percent on the job at hand , which is killing the well , cleaning up the oil and restoring the Gulf Coast economy , '' he said . Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man on the spill , said he had no information on BP 's future plans . `` I would assume that 's a policy issue related to the management of the lease , '' he told reporters . `` Frankly , it has n't been raised to my level at this point . I 'm not sure I can comment on it . '' A senior official with the Interior Department told FoxNews.com that the agency has had no communications with BP about drilling in the reservoir . `` It is too premature to talk or even speculate about them drilling there , '' the official said . Suttles has spent more than three months managing BP 's response efforts on the Gulf but is now returning to his day job in Houston , the company said . Mike Utsler , a vice president who has been running BP 's command post in Houma , La. , since April , will replace him . The personnel shift comes as BP appears to be gaining the upper hand on plugging the leak . Engineers this week poured in cement to complete a plug at the top of the well bore as part of a process dubbed a `` static kill , '' but they needed to wait at least a day for the cement to harden . Once it does , crews can finish the last stretch of a relief well intersecting the blown well just above the oil 's source , injecting more mud and cement from the bottom to form a final plug . Suttles confirmed Friday that crews for now plan to use the 18,000-foot relief well to seal off with mud and cement the underground reservoir feeding the blown well . The company had been hedging on how exactly it would use the relief well , which it has been digging for three months , as federal officials insisted it should be used to perform the so-called `` bottom kill . '' If not used for the bottom kill , the relief wells could have conceivably offered a way for BP or another company to pump oil from the reservoir and sell it , an idea unlikely to sit well with Gulf Coast residents and families of workers who died on the rig . The static kill started Tuesday with engineers pumping enough mud down the top of the well to push the crude back to its underground source . Suttles said engineers plan to monitor the cement newly pumped in from the top and test the plug to make sure it 's sealed . `` All the indications so far look very encouraging , '' he said . A federal report this week indicated that only about a quarter of the spilled crude remains in the Gulf and is degrading quickly . `` There 's essentially no skimmable oil left on the surface , no recoverable oil left on the surface , '' Suttles said . Some scientists disputed the report 's veracity , and much of the remaining crude has permeated deep into marshes and wetlands , complicating cleanup . BP had 31,000 workers along the Gulf on Friday , down from 48,000 at the height of the response , Suttles said . As BP pulled brought in 33-year employee Utsler to take over the response and the blown well appeared to have flatlined , some Gulf residents who still see the oil wreaking havoc worried the nation 's attention was shifting . Utsler told them not to worry , saying the spill 's effects are `` a challenge that we continue to recognize with more than 20,000-plus people continuing to work . '' Willie Davis , a 41-year-old harbormaster in Pass Christian , Miss. , feared his area would be forgotten if BP pulls out too soon . `` I 'm losing trust in the whole system , '' Davis said . `` If they do n't get up off their behinds and do something now , it 's gonna be years before we 're back whole again .

More than three months after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and triggered one of the world 's worst oil spills , authorities weighed how to gather evidence from the mile-deep waters to help investigators determine what happened -- and who could be at fault . Even retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , who was brought in by the government to oversee the spill response amid poorly received efforts by the British petroleum giant , began looking ahead to a day when he could hang up his hat . He told The Associated Press in an interview Friday that although he 's still signed up `` for the foreseeable future , '' he 's had preliminary discussions with Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano about what 's next for him . `` I 'll be the national incident commander until they do n't have one anymore , '' he said , reflecting on the frenetic pace he 's kept in the past few weeks not only by monitoring containment and cleanup progress , but keeping the media and the public updated . `` You have to pace yourself , '' he said . `` You have to know when you can rest , take a nap . I try to achieve an economy of effort . It 's obviously a fast pace and there are some long hours . '' There was heartening news from other quarters , too , as scientists released a report saying that only about one-quarter of the nearly 207 million gallons of oil that leaked into the Gulf of Mexico is still oozing around the sea . Even the amount left , though , would still rank among the nation 's worst spills . BP left open the possibility that it could someday drill a new path into the same undersea reservoir of oil , still believed to hold nearly $ 4 billion worth of crude . Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said that BP had n't considered the option yet but that `` we 're going to have to think about what to do with that at some point . '' The prospect did n't sit well with Gulf Coast residents and officials . `` We ca n't trust 'em , '' said Billy Nungesser , president of Plaquemines Parish in coastal Louisiana , adding that federal authorities should assign special overseers to track BP every step of the way . `` We ca n't trust them to clean it up , we ca n't trust them to dig a new well , '' he said . `` There 's a lot of mistrust . We do n't have any confidence in BP . '' The Interior Department cautioned that the blown-out well , a relief well and a backup being drilled to help stop the leak would not themselves be used to pump new oil out of the reservoir . `` The well is almost dead . Under no circumstances are we going to allow them to reopen the well to extract oil and gas , '' spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff said .

Researchers wondering how badly the Gulf of Mexico will suffer from the oil spill are paying close attention to the blue crab . -LRB- AP -RRB- BARATARIA , La. -LRB- AP -RRB- -- To assess how heavy a blow the BP oil spill has dealt the Gulf of Mexico , researchers are closely watching a staple of the seafood industry and primary indicator of the ecosystem 's health : the blue crab . Weeks ago , before engineers pumped in mud and cement to plug the gusher , scientists began finding specks of oil in crab larvae plucked from waters across the Gulf coast . The government said last week that three-quarters of the spilled oil has been removed or naturally dissipated from the water . But the crab larvae discovery was an ominous sign that crude had already infiltrated the Gulf 's vast food web -- and could affect it for years to come . `` It would suggest the oil has reached a position where it can start moving up the food chain instead of just hanging in the water , '' said Bob Thomas , a biologist at Loyola University in New Orleans . `` Something likely will eat those oiled larvae ... and then that animal will be eaten by something bigger and so on . '' Tiny creatures might take in such low amounts of oil that they could survive , Thomas said . But those at the top of the chain , such as dolphins and tuna , could get fatal `` megadoses . '' Marine biologists routinely gather shellfish for study . Since the spill began , many of the crab larvae collected have had the distinctive orange oil droplets , said Harriet Perry , a biologist with the University of Southern Mississippi 's Gulf Coast Research Laboratory . `` In my 42 years of studying crabs I 've never seen this , '' Perry said . She would n't estimate how much of the crab larvae are contaminated overall , but said about 40 percent of the area they are known to inhabit has been affected by oil from the spill . Tulane University researchers are investigating whether the splotches also contain toxic chemical dispersants that were spread to break up the oil but have reached no conclusions , biologist Caz Taylor said . If large numbers of blue crab larvae are tainted , their population is virtually certain to take a hit over the next year and perhaps longer , scientists say . How large the die-off would be is unclear , Perry said . An estimated 207 million gallons of oil have spewed into the Gulf since an April 20 drilling rig explosion triggered the spill , and thousands of gallons of dispersant chemicals have been dumped . Scientists will be focusing on crabs because they 're a `` keystone species '' that play a crucial role in the food web as both predator and prey , Perry said . Richard Condrey , a Louisiana State University oceanographer , said the crabs are `` a living repository of information on the health of the environment . '' Named for the light-blue tint of their claws , the crabs have thick shells and 10 legs , allowing them to swim and scuttle across bottomlands . As adults , they live in the Gulf 's bays and estuaries amid marshes that offer protection and abundant food , including snails , tiny shellfish , plants and even smaller crabs . In turn , they provide sustenance for a variety of wildlife , from redfish to raccoons and whooping cranes . Adults could be harmed by direct contact with oil and from eating polluted food . But scientists are particularly worried about the vulnerable larvae . That 's because females do n't lay their eggs in sheltered places , but in areas where estuaries meet the open sea . Condrey discovered several years ago that some even deposit offspring on shoals miles offshore in the Gulf . The larvae grow as they drift with the currents back toward the estuaries for a month or longer . Many are eaten by predators , and only a handful of the 3 million or so eggs from a single female live to adulthood . But their survival could drop even lower if the larvae run into oil and dispersants . `` Crabs are very abundant . I do n't think we 're looking at extinction or anything close to it , '' said Taylor , one of the researchers who discovered the orange spots . Still , crabs and other estuary-dependent species such as shrimp and red snapper could feel the effects of remnants of the spill for years , Perry said . `` There could be some mortality , but how much is impossible to say at this point , '' said Vince Guillory , biologist manager with the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries . Perry , Taylor and Condrey will be among scientists monitoring crabs for negative effects such as population drop-offs and damage to reproductive capabilities and growth rates . Crabs are big business in the region . In Louisiana alone , some 33 million pounds are harvested annually , generating nearly $ 300 million in economic activity , Guillory said . But fishermen who can make a six-figure income off crabs in a good year now are now idled -- and worried about the future . `` If they 'd let us go out and fish today , we 'd probably catch crabs , '' said Glen Despaux , 37 , who sets his traps in Louisiana 's Barataria Bay . `` But what 's going to happen next year , if this water is polluted and it 's killing the eggs and the larvae ? I think it 's going to be a long-term problem .

Attorney General Troy King filed two lawsuits in federal court in Montgomery late Thursday afternoon on behalf of the state . The lawsuits -- one against BP and the other against Transocean , Halliburton and other companies associated with the spill -- seek economic and punitive damages . No specific amount was listed . The lawsuit accuses them of damaging Alabama 's coast and economy through `` negligent or wanton failure to adhere to recognized industry standards . '' BP spokesman Justin Saia said the company had not seen the lawsuit and had no comment . At least 300 federal lawsuits have been filed in 12 states against BP and the other three main companies involved in the April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drill rig , which triggered the disaster . King sued against the wishes of fellow Republican , Gov. Bob Riley , who hopes to reach an out-of-court settlement with the companies . BP was leasing the rig Deepwater Horizon from owner-operator Transocean Ltd. when it exploded and sank , killing 11 workers . Halliburton Energy Services Inc. , had been working to cap the well that ended up leaking with cement prior to the explosion . The broken well spewed some 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf for three months before it was plugged . Riley spokesman Todd Stacy said the governor had not seen the lawsuits . He said the state is still compiling a list of economic damages that it will submit to BP soon . If the company does n't provide fair and fast compensation , then the state would have a dispute . `` When there is a dispute , then a lawsuit is appropriate , '' he said . King said his move is not premature . `` As Alabama 's lawyer , I say that , if anything , based on BP 's broken promises , their history of saying one thing and doing another , and now , new information that they have been secretly working to gain a legal advance , further delay can only further damage our people , '' King said . He said BP is retaining the best expert witnesses to keep the other side from using them to testify against BP and is selling assets perhaps to keep an American court from reaching them to satisfy a judgment . Riley appointed King as attorney general in 2004 . But since then , they have become adversaries . Riley created the task force on gambling because King would n't take action against electronic bingo games at casinos . They 've been battling it out in the courts over whether the task force has the authority to raid the casinos and seize the games . As for the spill , a team of economic experts is still trying to put a figure on the state 's economic losses . King will be out of office before the lawsuit makes much progress in court . He lost the Republican primary June 1 to Birmingham lawyer Luther Strange . Strange said King should have consulted with the governor and Gulf coast mayors to make sure the litigation does n't hurt ongoing negotiations with BP . The Democratic nominee for attorney general , Montgomery lawyer James Anderson , said King may have had a stronger case if he brought in Alabama cities and counties affected by the spill and possibly even other Gulf states . He said BP has already lined up some of the top lawyers in the state , and the attorney general 's office will have to bring in outside lawyers with experience in this type of litigation if it hopes to win . `` We 've got plenty of time to add on attorneys , '' said Chris Bence , the attorney general 's chief of staff .

AP Photo\\/Dave Martin The largest ecological disaster in U.S. history has largely been taken care of , the government claims . Many scientists are n't so sure , however . In a five-page report , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- NOAA -RRB- claimed `` a vast majority '' of the BP oil spill is now completely gone . The remaining 25 % consists of residual oil that is buried in sediments and sand . The report , released August 4 , claims that most of the oil evaporated naturally or -- through what the report calls a `` robust federal response '' -- was skimmed , burned , recovered , or dispersed . As the report came out on his 49th birthday , President Obama thanked the NOAA for the well-timed gift . But researchers and scientists as well as environmental groups and Gulf residents have cried foul , saying the NOAA report unfairly claims `` mission accomplished , '' an attitude that flies in the face of reality . `` There is still considerable oil in the Gulf as residual oil -- and that 25 % is still ` oil ' oil , '' said Justin Revenaugh , a seismologist and professor of geology and geophysics at the University of Minnesota . Revenaugh told FoxNews.com that the residual oil is still a massive spill , five times that of the Exxon Valdez and the 11th largest in history . It 's also still extremely harmful to the environment , he said . Several other scientist and oceanographers have criticized the NOAA report more directly . At issue is how the report describes oil -- vastly gone , and not a lingering deposit that will affect the environment . John Kessler , an oceanographer from Texas A&M , is one of the report 's most outspoken critics . He estimates that as much as 75 % of the BP oil spill is still in the Gulf and traceable , and he called the NOAA report `` misleading if not totally inaccurate '' in a news release . Ian MacDonald , an oceanographer at Florida State University , told FoxNews.com that the report `` mixes apples and oranges , then counts everything as apples '' because it uses hard data on skimming , burning and chemical dispersion with conjecture on natural dispersion and dissolution . And Dr. Larry McKinney , executive director of the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies , believes there are still oil deposits in the water columns and in sediment layers . Still , McKinney thinks the NOAA used `` a reasonable and thoughtful process . When you look at the actual report , there are the types of caveats that any exercise of this type might include . I do not think it likely we will have a better estimate , but some improvements might be possible as additional data come in . '' Not all scientists are critical of the NOAA report . Peter Lane , the chairman of the ASTM F20 Committee on Oil Spills and Hazardous Substances , who is also the president of Applied Fabric Technologies , an oil spill clean-up equipment company , agreed with its conclusions . `` I thought the oil was gone or was going to be gone about five days after the blowout , '' said Lane . `` The rest is just backpedaling by those who made dire predictions about the long-lasting effects of oil going all over the world . '' `` They have no idea how to put something like this into perspective , they want to shed blame on someone and\\/or gain political mileage , '' he added . Interestingly , Lane said those who are critical of the clean-up process are usually uninformed about what is required for the clean-up efforts -- armchair quarterbacks for oil spills . `` The oil industry and BP were the only ones prepared in any way to do anything , '' Lane said . `` The -LRB- United States Coast Guard -RRB- and Navy have equipment which they contributed , the USCG has some personnel who helped on oversight , but the rest of them are first-time spill fighters who are learning from a clean sheet of paper . '' While researchers have taken issue with the process used to evaluate the remaining oil deposits , the NOAA defended its process as highly scientific and thorough . `` Scientists have been conducting ongoing testing for subsurface oil using a number of techniques , including the use of fluorometric and acoustic scanning , monitoring of dissolved oxygen in the water column , and collecting water samples for detailed chemical analysis in the laboratory , '' said Chris Vaccaro , an NOAA spokesperson . `` Research vessels owned and operated by NOAA and by our academic partners have been continuously testing the subsurface oil since this disaster began and will continuing doing so since we know oil still exists below the surface , '' he told FoxNews.com On one issue all sides seem to agree : The long-term impact of the oil spill is still a concern . NOAA head Jane Lubchenco , speaking at a press briefing last week , made it clear that the oil leak 's effects will linger , though the NOAA claims the oil is mostly gone . `` We remain concerned about the long-term impacts , both on the marshes and the wildlife , but also beneath the surface , and are actively studying that , both as part of our federal response and in partnership with much of the academic community that is also very interested in the overall long-term impacts of this , '' she said .

But four months after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon , regulators have only started to make good on promises to overhaul drilling . Tough measures are stalled in Congress . A $ 1 billion emergency response network proposed by the industry wo n't be operational for another year . And while doomsday scenarios from the BP spill , like oil washing up the East Coast , have not come to pass , there are no guarantees that drilling will be any safer once it does resume . What 's changed is `` not enough to make a big difference , '' said Charles Perrow , a Yale professor who has studied the spill in the Gulf . Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has halted deepwater drilling until Nov. 30 , saying the BP spill demonstrated the industry was n't prepared for a massive underwater blowout . He 's ordered rigs to re-examine their equipment and safety procedures , and next month plans to order new safeguards for blowout preventers . Before drillers can return to the deep water , however , Salazar said the industry should be able to show that it 's capable of responding to and containing future blowouts . Some energy experts , engineering consultants and Gulf Coast leaders joined Big Oil to ask Salazar to change his mind . Drilling was safe before the BP spill , they said , and Gulf communities that depend on the industry were suffering unfairly . That argument appears to have gained traction , even among people most affected by the spill , now that BP is close to plugging the well for good . Billy Nungesser , president of hard-hit Plaquemines Parish , La. , said he 's seen attitudes change in his community now that the deepsea disaster is easing . Even though oil has been washing ashore for months and he 's fought constantly with BP and the government over their response , Nungesser thinks the ban should be lifted . Offshore drilling means jobs . According to the most recent state data , the oil and gas industry supports more than 320,000 jobs in Louisiana and generates more than $ 12.7 billion in household earnings . George Hirasaki , a Rice University engineering professor who was involved in the oil containment effort in the Bay Marchand field off Louisiana after a rig burned in the early 1970s , agrees . `` I think what is needed is improved standards and procedures , and not just restrictions on drilling , '' Hirasaki said . As Salazar continues to weigh the evidence , others close to President Obama are questioning the ban . William K. Reilly , a former Environmental Protection Agency administrator who co-chairs the president 's commission investigating the oil spill , said in an interview with The Associated Press that he does n't understand why rigs that have passed inspections ca n't resume drilling even while the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management conducts a broader review of safety offshore . The group also asked the Washington-based Bipartisan Policy Center to look into the `` wisdom of using a moratorium '' for preventing spills in the aftermath of the BP disaster , according to a copy of the letter obtained by the AP . The moratorium bans exploratory drilling but not production . At an estimated 1.66 million barrels of per day , Gulf oil production accounts for about 30 percent of domestic output . However , the government estimates 2011 production at just 1.54 million barrels per day -- equal to 2009 levels -- in part because no new wells are currently being drilled . By contract , the U.S. is expected to import 9.11 million barrels per day this year . Opponents say the moratorium will only boost the need for foreign oil , but the government currently forecasts a drop in imports next year because of increased production onshore in the U.S. Meanwhile , the offshore drilling industry is facing its biggest overhaul in decades . Shortly after the April 20 rig explosion , Salazar ordered rig owners to re-evaluate their emergency procedures and re-examine safety equipment . A slate of other measures , including a requirement that blowout preventers have additional backup safety equipment , is expected next month . Other regulations could be announced in the next 12 months . Congress also is considering measures that could make the Gulf one of the strictest places on the planet for offshore drillers to work . Bills in the House and Senate would lift the $ 75 million cap on liabilities for economic damages -- such as lost wages , shortened fishing seasons or lagging tourism . If that becomes law , smaller drillers probably would be forced out of the Gulf , analysts said . It `` pushes the smaller guys out , '' Argus Research analyst Phil Weiss said . `` They 're going to be afraid of the risks . '' BP essentially waived its rights under the cap . As of Aug. 5 , it had spent more than $ 6 billion on the spill , about $ 303 million of that on claims payments to more than 40,000 individuals and businesses . And BP is expected to pay billions more as hundreds of lawsuits work their way through the court system . A bill that passed the House includes a provision that would shut out anyone with a poor safety record -- like BP -- from gaining new permits . But the Obama administration may hesitate to limit BP 's ability to operate in the Gulf . A $ 20 billion compensation fund established for victims ' of the oil spill may use revenue from BP 's oil and gas drilling as collateral , according to details released this week by the White House . `` Let 's face facts , '' says Nungesser . `` BP needs that oil coming out of the ground . Anybody tells you differently is lying to you . '' While driller Diamond Offshore moved a couple of rigs out of the Gulf , and another 30-some rigs are idle or doing other work , economists say job losses resulting from the moratorium so far have been fewer than predicted by the industry . In Louisiana , the staging site for most of the deepwater Gulf industry , there were 595 first-time claims for jobless benefits in the 099mining sector in June and July , according to the Louisiana Work force Commission . That sector consists almost entirely of the petroleum industry . Even so , the region still could lose tens of thousands of jobs if the moratorium continues , said David Dismukes , associate executive director for the Louisiana State University Center for Energy Studies . Still , the decision on the moratorium will come down to safety . Four top oil companies -- Shell , Exxon , Chevron and ConocoPhillips -- are pitching in on a rapid-response spill containment system , a step towards meeting Salazar 's requirement that the industry demonstrate a better response capability . Some pieces will be ready around year 's end but others wo n't be ready for another year or so . Salazar has said a fully operational system was n't a perquisite for lifting the ban . But experts like Perrow , the Yale sociologist , wonder what 's the rush , given the devastating impact that this one spill has had . He says the U.S. would benefit if it waits for the government to write new rules that increases scrutiny of drilling operations . The industry also needs to find ways to keep rigs from drilling too quickly and putting their wells at risk of a blowout , he said . `` They do n't want accidents , they 're expensive , '' Perrow said .

The president , first lady , daughter Sasha -LRB- sister Malia is at summer camp -RRB- and family dog Bo visited the Sunshine State for a brief weekend trip -- part vacation , part sales pitch -- as the president sought to boost a tourism industry reeling after the spill . On a warm , muggy afternoon , Obama said he brought his family to Florida , `` to let our fellow Americans know that they should come down here . And not just to support the region , but also because it 's a beautiful place to visit . '' It was his fifth trip to the region since April 20 explosion on a deepwater rig that caused the spill . Obama said he knows Gulf Coast residents have been frustrated by the slow payment of claims from a $ 20 billion BP fund for those who have suffered damages as a result of the spill , and he pledged to rectify that . `` Any delays -- by BP or by those managing the new fund -- are unacceptable , and I will keep pushing to get these claims expedited , '' Obama said . Perhaps the most intriguing question of the Obamas ' 27-hour dash south was whether the president would take a dip in the Gulf . The president and first lady were joined at a roundtable discussion by Florida Gov. Charlie Crist , Navy Secretary Ray Mabus , a former Mississippi governor appointed by Obama to develop a long-term Gulf restoration plan ; the mayors of Panama City and Panama City Beach ; the general manager of a three-hotel chain that has had 1,000 room night cancellations due to the spill , translating into more than $ 191,000 in lost room revenue alone ; the owner of a charter boat company ; and the co-owner of a restaurant and two fishing boats . Tourism officials say the region typically brings in 70 percent of its yearly income between June and August . Although only 16 of the 180 beaches in the western part of the Panhandle were affected by the spill , tourism officials say many potential visitors have stayed away , deterred by images of oil-slicked waters and tarball-strewn beaches in other parts of the region . The head of the U.S. Travel Association has proposed that BP , responsible for the oil spill , set aside $ 500 million for a marketing campaign to help draw tourists to the Gulf states . Alabama 's attorney general on Thursday sued BP and others companies associated with the spill , seeking unspecified economic and punitive damages . At least 300 federal lawsuits have been filed in 12 states against BP and the other three main companies involved in the explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drill rig . The White House scheduled the Obamas ' trip after facing criticism that the president was n't heeding his own advice that Americans vacation in the Gulf . `` This is still a place that 's open for business and welcoming so vacationers and people can have a wonderful holiday here , '' Obama said during a June trip to Pensacola , Fla. -- one of his four to the region before this weekend . The first lady went a step further during a July visit to Panama City Beach . `` One of the best ways that fellow Americans can help is to come on down here and spend some money , '' she said . Obama has vacationed in North Carolina this summer and is heading to Martha 's Vineyard , off the Massachusetts coast , later in August . Mrs. Obama also traveled to Spain this month with Sasha . The government 's point man on the spill , retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , said Friday that the blown-out well was not securely plugged to his satisfaction . He said that drilling a relief well -- long regarded as the only way to ensure that the hole at the bottom of the Gulf never leaks oil again -- must go forward . Work on the relief well was suspended this week because of bad weather .

As the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reports that most surface oil in the Gulf of Mexico has degraded to a thin sheen and the incoming BP PLC CEO calls for a `` scaleback '' in cleanup efforts , local officials on the Louisiana coast say they are still finding new patches of heavy oil -LRB- AP -RRB- . A government report that concludes only 10 percent of oil from the Gulf of Mexico gusher was burned or skimmed does not earn BP a `` passing grade , '' the Democratic chairman of a House subcommittee said Thursday . Rep. Ed Markey , D-Mass . , chairman of a House Subcommittee on Energy and Environment , said in a hearing Thursday that the 10 percent that BP was able to remove from the ocean by burning or skimming is no better than recovery efforts 21 years ago during the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska . `` It seems to me that BP 's oil recovery effort comes in on the low effort of what was achievable 21 years ago , '' Markey said , pointing to both a Government Accountability Office and Office of Technology Assessment report that found -- given technologies available at the time of the 1989 accident -- only 10 to 15 percent of the spilled oil could be recovered . . `` In my mind , that is not a passing grade , only 10 percent of the 4.1 million barrels actually having been recovered , '' he continued . `` I think we all saw this coming ... I think it 's important that , even using a 21-year-old grading system , that BP has done a very poor job in cleaning up the Gulf . '' Markey convened Thursday 's hearing to press government officials on the state of the BP oil cleanup . Bill Lehr , a senior scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , testified that one quarter of the gusher was recovered , burned or skimmed from the beaches or in the Gulf . Another quarter evaporated or degraded , one quarter ended up `` dispersed '' in the water column and one quarter is still floating around . Another 800,000 barrels of oil were pulled directly from the well to ships , explaining the difference between the 4.1 million barrels determined to have gone into the Gulf water and 4.9 million barrels that gushed out of the well overall during the spill that lasted three and half months . NOAA released a five-page report Aug. 4 that claimed `` a vast majority '' of the BP oil spill is now completely gone . The remaining 25 percent , the report said , consists of residual oil that is buried in sediments and sand in the water or along the shoreline . The government report , however , is undermined by scientific data that found an oil plume at least 22 miles long , 3,000 feet deep in the Gulf of Mexico -- suggesting that the tens of millions of gallons of oil that leaked from a broken BP well could persist far longer than expected . Whether the plume 's existence poses a significant threat to the Gulf ecosystem and sea life is not yet clear , the researchers say . `` We do n't know how toxic it is , '' said Christopher Reddy , a Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute -LRB- WHOI -RRB- marine geochemist and oil spill expert and one of the authors of a study conducted from observations made in late June . Researchers and scientists as well as environmental groups and Gulf residents were quick to disagree with the NOAA report , calling it `` misleading if not totally inaccurate . '' But Reddy said he ca n't say `` how much oil is in the plume '' so the information does n't necessarily contradict the government report . The Obama administration used the Aug. 4 report to claim that 75 percent of the spill is gone and only one-quarter of the oil that began gushing after the April 20 accident remains in the water . Rep. Darrell Issa , R-Calif . , a chief critic of the White House , called those claims irresponsible since NOAA has n't completed its evaluation . `` This is yet another in a long line of examples where the White House 's preoccupation with the public relations of the oil spill has superseded the realities on the ground , '' Issa , who is ranking Republican on the Government Reform and Oversight Committee , said in a statement . `` It is deeply troubling that White House officials apparently preempted the completion and review of a scientific study on the oil spill by NOAA scientists in order to tout conclusions that many experts believe may be deeply flawed , '' he added . On Thursday , Markey told Lehr that his testimony gave a `` false sense of confidence '' on the cleanup and long-term consequences to the environment . `` People want to believe that everything is OK and I think this report and the way it is being discussed is giving many people a false sense of confidence regarding the state of the Gulf , '' he said . Lehr did not disclose in his testimony the methodology used to determine how much oil was released into the Gulf . He said his office will release the formulas and methodologies in about two months , after it has determined that its figures are correct . `` You should not have released it until you knew it was right . If you are not confident that it is right then it should not have been released because it basically sent a signal with regard to how much of the problem remains , '' he said . `` The public has a right to know right now what 's going on in the Gulf of Mexico . Because if your numbers are wrong , it could be too late , '' he added . `` You do n't want to give us all of the data . But you 've given us conclusions .

New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu reported Thursday on the city 's progress as it continues to deal with the effects of Katrina and the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . Both events , he said , brought the coast `` to its knees . '' He addressed a luncheon at the National Press Club where Gulf shrimp was served . As Landrieu urged listeners to visit Louisiana , he also emphasized the need to lift the moratorium on deepwater drilling . He said he 'd discuss the issue with President Barack Obama during his visit to the Gulf on August 29 to mark the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina 's devastating hit . The Obama administration banned such drilling after the BP oil spill disaster . Though BP , he said , has been negligent and irresponsible , drilling oil is necessary to let the Gulf coast continue providing oil , energy and food to the rest of the country . `` We are not limited to , ` Drill , baby , drill ' or stop drilling forever . We can do better , '' Landrieu said . `` We must drill and restore . '' The city 's transformation will be slow and dependent on resources , but Landrieu said there will be more immediate transformation in the city 's safety , schools and job market . As other issues take longer , he expects it to be at least five years for New Orleans to have recovered . There 's a $ 79 million hole in its $ 460 million budget . Landrieu said cuts have included 14 furlough days for city employees and reorganizing usage of overtime . Still , he 'd like to see New Orleans back on its feet in time for the city 's 300th anniversary in 2018 . As New Orleans builds from the ground up , Landrieu said the city is already seeing a revival in volunteerism and nightlife and student test scores have gone up in the last three years . New Orleans , he said , is a city ripe for innovation . `` Our future is not just about survival , '' Landrieu said . `` It 's about resurrection . It 's about redemption . '' Landrieu was elected in February to replace term-limited Ray Nagin as residents became frustrated with Nagin 's leadership following Katrina . Landrieu became the majority-black city 's first white mayor since 1979 , the year his father Moon left the office . His sister , U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu , D-La . , also attended the luncheon .

Blue indicates low methane concentrations , red high . Science\\/AAAS Is the Gulf getting cleaner ? Or does oil there pose a long-term hazard ? It seems to depend mostly on whom you ask . Scientists have discovered an oil plume at least 22 miles long , 3,000 feet deep in the Gulf of Mexico -- suggesting that the tens of millions of gallons of oil that leaked from a broken BP well could persist far longer than expected . Whether the plume 's existence poses a significant threat to the Gulf ecosystem and sea life is not yet clear , the researchers say . `` We do n't know how toxic it is , '' said Christopher Reddy , a Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute -LRB- WHOI -RRB- marine geochemist and oil spill expert and one of the authors of the study . `` But knowing the size , shape , depth , and heading of this plume will be vital for answering many of these questions . '' The existence of the plume , which was concretely pinned to the blown-out well , seems to contradict a five-page report released August 4 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- NOAA -RRB- , which claimed `` a vast majority '' of the BP oil spill is now completely gone . The remaining 25 % consists of residual oil buried in sediments and sand , the report claimed . Researchers and scientists as well as environmental groups and Gulf residents immediately disagreed with the report , calling it `` misleading if not totally inaccurate . '' Yet despite the seeming contrast between the government report and their new findings , Reddy refused to describe this new evidence as a contradiction . `` What the government has done and other universities are trying to do is constrain a budget , '' he said , arguing that it was too early to determine whether this finding was a smoking gun or just `` a penny in a very big checking account . '' `` I ca n't tell you how much oil is in the plume , '' he noted , so it does n't contradict the government 's report that only 26 % of the leak remains . And the picture will change as more chemical analysis is done , Reddy pointed out . But one thing is clear : There 's definitely still oil down there . `` We 've shown conclusively not only that a plume exists , but also defined its origin and near-field structure , '' said Richard Camilli the other lead researcher from WHOI , of the 1.2 mile wide , 650 foot high plume . The team 's observations were made during a June 19-28 scientific cruise aboard the National Science Foundation owned ship Endeavor . It was halted by the onset of hurricane Alex. Since measurements ended nearly two months ago , the scientists admit they are unsure what has happened to the plume . `` We do n't know where these hydrocarbons are . We saw them in June , '' Reddy said . The findings were based on two technologies : an autonomous underwater vehicle called Sentry and an underwater mass spectrometer . By integrating the two , researchers were able to detect even minute quantities of petroleum as well as other chemical compounds , something previous investigators were unable to achieve using conventional profiling . They discovered consistent concentrations of hydrocarbons throughout the plume . Given the makeup and concentration -- in excess of 50 micrograms per liter -- the researchers concluded that the plume could not have developed from natural seepage . Further analysis of the samples will provide a clearer picture of the plume structure as well as a better estimate of the total amount of spilled oil . It will also give insight into what sort of threat the plume poses . `` The plume is not pure oil , '' Camilli said . `` But there are oil compounds in there . '' It may require a few months of laboratory analysis and validation , Reddy said . Both researchers were surprised by the size and concentration of the plume . `` -LRB- The plume -RRB- is persisting for longer periods than we would have expected , '' Camilli said . `` Many people speculated that subsurface oil droplets were being easily biodegraded . '' The underwater oil was also remarkably stable , hanging at around 3,000 feet beneath the surface . `` We do n't have any indications as to why it 's set up at that water depth , '' he said , an area meriting additional research . Another unexpected result was the lack of `` dead zones , '' regions of significant oxygen depletion as a result of microbe metabolism . `` The oxygen data from the plume layer are telling us it is n't being rapidly consumed by microbes near the well , '' said Benjamin Van Mooy , a geochemist on the research team . `` The hydrocarbons could persist for some time . So it is possible that oil could be transported considerable distances from the well before being degraded .

And unlike many oysters across the Gulf Coast , ruined by BP 's massive oil spill and the fresh water poured in to fight it , Supan 's oysters are all alive . Now , nearly four months after the spill , Supan 's oysters may offer the Gulf oyster industry a chance for a better long-term recovery . But his special breed of modified oysters , which some say are prohibitively expensive , could be a hard sell to an industry reeling from the BP disaster . Most oystermen agree that few oysters will be harvested from the Gulf Coast in the next year or two , signaling a potential calamity for shucking houses , oyster farmers and people who love a half dozen oysters on the half shell . As much as 65 percent of the nation 's oysters come from the Gulf . Oysters are particularly susceptible to pollution , taking longer than fish or shrimp to clear oil contamination from their bodies . Supan 's oysters are bred for performance , making them more fit to deal with viruses and other contaminants . Being sterile , they do n't go through the stress of reproduction , so they stay fat and juicy all year round . Supan says his oysters are sweet , plump and meaty in summertime when other oysters become thin and watery . But the most crucial advantage this year was their mobility . Unlike the vast majority of oysters in the Gulf , which spend their lives on the bottoms of bays and sounds , Supan 's oysters dangle in the water in cages at a hatchery on the inland side of this island . When the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 just a few dozen miles from his hatchery , the 57-year-old Louisiana State University oyster biologist evacuated his broods to a research hatchery in Alabama and a wildlife preserve in western Louisiana . Then he brought them back . `` In my opinion , this is the most important brood of oysters in the history of the Gulf of Mexico , '' Supan says . `` But you know , you ask an oysterman that and they will say , ` Huh ? ' '' He said the day is coming when all the Gulf 's oystermen will know what he 's talking about . For three decades , Supan has been developing new oysters by mixing up their chromosomes in a process known as triploid production . He breeds a rare oyster that has extra chromosomes with a normal oyster and produces a sterile hybrid . The process is common on the East and West coasts but still untried in the Gulf , besides Supan 's batch . `` I do n't know if it 's the future with a capital ` THE , ' but it 's very important , '' said Bill Walton , an Auburn University shellfish biologist . `` It can give you a faster growing oyster . It cuts down production time and it does seem to solve the problem of ` water bellies ' in the summer when oysters spawn and you have a tired , thin oyster . '' `` For the long-term viability of oysters in Louisiana what -LRB- the hatchery -RRB- is doing is the kind of pioneer work , '' said Mike Voisin , an oyster processor and leader in the Louisiana oyster industry . The industry in Louisiana faces daunting threats from the oil pollution , oyster diseases and pressure from state and federal officials who want to reclaim lost marshland by opening up the Mississippi River even more often . If that happens , traditional oyster grounds could be ruined in many of the inland bays where they are grown today . Helen Skansi , a 75-year-old Plaquemines Parish oyster company owner with more than 1,000 leased acres , is painfully aware of the problems . `` Things will never be the same with the bedding grounds they had before with the oil , '' she said . Kenneth Fox , who leases 15,000 acres of state waters to grow his oysters , is equally concerned . `` I lost 95 percent of my leases with this oil spill , '' he said . `` Everything is dead on the west side of the river . '' Asked about Supan 's super oysters , however , he was unconvinced . `` I think the research is great , and I think what he 's doing is going to be a big help . But that is going to be a costly process . '' Supan would like to see his special oyster larvae distributed through hatcheries across the Gulf to oyster growers . He said he could start distributing the larvae now . But a lot has to happen for that to materialize . Ideally , the sterile oysters would be grown in cages in special areas designated as marine farms . And a host of permitting and zoning issues would have to be resolved . Growing oysters the way Supan does is tricky . They are raised in structures propped up off the water bottom . That requires new harvesting equipment . Oystermen currently use mechanical devices like plows to scour their catch from the Gulf floor . It also would require new permits . It takes about two years for an oyster to grow to market size . Once the special summer oysters grow to adult size , then the oyster growers would have to find buyers . Typically , a dozen oysters cost about $ 12 at an oyster bar on the Gulf Coast . Supan said a cost analysis has not been done to figure out how much the summer oysters would cost . He says the market would take care of that . `` That 's a big investment on a gamble , '' Fox said of Supan 's experiments . `` I 'm not saying it wo n't happen one day , but the way Louisiana is set up , it 's going to be hard to make happen . Half the people in the industry would have to get out of the business for the other half to make a profit . '' Still , some institutions that fund research are persuaded that Supan 's technique holds promise . Supan 's research has been backed by federal and state grants over his 30-year career . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently awarded Supan and other researchers a $ 250,000 grant to develop more hatchery technology . Inside his algae room , Supan looks like a winemaker as he surveys tanks of algae he feeds to his oysters . The bacteria grows under fluorescent light . `` It takes a wet green thumb to grow algae , '' he said . `` You got to be patient with it . It 's very intuitive . Just like growing a garden . Some people say they talk to their house plants ; well , my algae and myself have conversations all the time . '' He hopes the state will build an oyster dock where he can teach oyster farmers to grow oysters in saltier Gulf farms similar to his , where the oysters are reared to market size on platforms that thwart predators such as snails and bottom-feeding fish .

Subcommittee Chair Ed Markey , the only committee member to attend the hearing during recess , stated his disapproval of the often criticized BP efforts to clean up the spill . Some speculate that effort has been hampered by a tight budget and resistance to expensive , if experimental new cleanup efforts that could have protected more of the Gulf coastline . Markey 's displeasure with cleanup efforts and the subsequent impact on the seafood industry ; however , still do not get to the heart of the matter . Without BP 's disregard for safety leading up to the Deepwater Horizon disaster , the seafood industry and the broader Gulf Region would not face these dire circumstances . Instead of condemning an entire industry for what one company did , Congress must look specifically at BP 's safety history and every American must demand that they do so . Government overreaction to the missteps of one safety outlier are resulting in further desperation and economic degradation in our minority communities who rely on the many jobs provided by the oil and gas industry . Punishment must be doled out as a result of the gross safety oversight in the Gulf , but it must be directed toward those at fault , not the hardworking Americans currently being deprived of jobs . Below is a list of failures on the part of BP , a company whose reckless and careless actions have severely damaged both the Gulf Coast and energy industry : For more than a decade before the fateful Gulf oil spill disaster , BP was frequently alleged to be sacrificing occupational and environmental safety to control costs , whether by intimidating its workers who spoke out or by cutting maintenance budgets ; by sweating low-impact events instead of larger risks , or just by not having a strong enough `` safety culture '' to avoid occasional breakdowns . Whatever the causes , BP 's safety failures have sometimes been so dramatic that they attract publicity . Here are the worst offenses , several taking place at the same facilities . THUNDER HORSE , JULY 2005 Thunder Horse PDQ is the largest offshore platform of its kind in the world . It was designed to survive a once-in-a-century hurricane event , but just months after completion this $ 5 billion marvel was nearly capsized by an incorrectly plumbed 6-inch length of pipe . Thunder Horse was evacuated at the approach of Hurricane Dennis , and three days later the titanic platform was sighted tilting heavily in the water , in danger of sinking . The hurricane was n't at fault ; the pipe had simply allowed water to flow freely into ballast tanks on one side of the platform . The water damaged pumps , motors , wiring and cables , forcing an estimated $ 250 million in repairs . Later tests would reveal inch-wide gashes in the undersea pipeline caused by inadequate welds . As The New York Times reported , `` It could have been catastrophic , '' said Gordon A. Aaker Jr. , a senior engineering consultant on the project . `` You would have lost a lot of oil a mile down before you would have even known . It could have been a helluva spill -- much like the Deepwater Horizon . '' And that , of course , would have moved this incident much closer to # 1 . For years , a BP subsidiary was permitted to police its own facilities in the Los Angeles area for emissions problems . BP 's Carson Refinery , to take their word for it , `` had nearly perfect compliance , reporting no tank problems and making virtually no repairs . '' How convenient for a cost-cutting company to discover it has no need for maintenance ! Local regulators thought so too . After BP forced them to get a warrant to investigate , they found that the noncompliance rate was some 20 times higher than reported , as `` some tanker seals had extensive tears , tank roofs had pervasive leaks and there were enough major defects to lead to thousands of violations . '' TEXAS CITY 46-DAY TOXIC CHEMICAL RELEASE , APRIL 6 , 2010 This gave BP a choice : shut down the plant , which is time-consuming and expensive , or divert the gases to be burned off into carbon dioxide by a flare high above the ground . The downside to the latter option is unburned emissions ; as ProPublica reported , `` Widely circulated industry guidelines assume that at least 2 percent of what is sent to a flare goes unburned and passes into the atmosphere . '' That can quickly add up , so in most places the flare is used only in emergencies . BP diverted the gases to the flare for several weeks while they replaced the machinery , believing that they would be able to detect excess emissions . But until June 4 , they had n't analyzed the data from their monitors and discovered that they had released hundreds of tons of chemicals into the air . The company now estimates that 538,000 pounds of chemicals escaped from the refinery while it was replacing the equipment . These included 17,000 pounds of benzene , a known carcinogen ; 37,000 pounds of nitrogen oxides , which contribute to respiratory problems ; and 186,000 pounds of carbon monoxide . Even by Texas 's relatively lenient air standards , that 's a problem . NORTH SLOPE PIG INCIDENT , JANUARY 15 , 2009 Pipeline inspection gauges , or `` pigs , '' are tools sent through pipes to clean and inspect them , propelled by the pressure of the oil\\/gas\\/etc . In this case , a pig got stuck and lost , allowing gas to pass around it , which ended up `` causing a significant venting of gas to the atmosphere and the complete , temporary shutdown of the -LRB- Trans-Alaska Pipeline System -RRB- , '' the 800 mile artery connecting Alaska 's northern and southern coasts . TEXAS CITY VAPOR CLOUD , AUGUST 10 , 2005 A gas-oil leak at the Texas City refinery produced a vapor cloud that prompted a `` shelter-in-place '' order to be issued for the Texas City area , meaning residents are supposed to hunker down , put out any fires and take steps to avoid breathing any outside air . No one was injured , so what makes this one of BP 's darkest days ? Two things : It happened on the same day that an unrelated fire broke out at Chocolate Bayou , another Texas plant run by a BP subsidiary . The fire required an emergency shutdown , and it would continue burning for two days . Locals were advised to stay indoors . This leak came at the same Texas City location where a ruptured pipe had caused an explosion just two months earlier -LRB- also requiring a shelter-in-place order -RRB- , and where BP had suffered the deadliest accident in the company 's history just two months before that -- more on that later . PRUDHOE BAY GAS PIPELINE RUPTURE , SEPTEMBER 29 , 2008 A high-pressure natural gas pipeline in the great Alaskan field `` separated , '' sending 14-foot and 28-foot sections of the pipe flying 900 feet away from the line -- but fortunately , the gas itself did n't ignite . `` No one was hurt , but the official state report said the incident could have been catastrophic , '' The Wall Street Journal reported . Bea , an engineering professor at U.C. Berkeley , is `` a well-known expert on catastrophes involving complex systems , '' who , at BP 's request , in 2002-03 studied their `` approach to catastrophic risk management at its U.S. facilities in Texas City , Prudhoe Bay , and Cherry Point , Washington , and made recommendations directly to John Browne , then CEO of BP , and other members of top management . '' Again , timing is everything : half an hour later , an unrelated BP incident on another part of the North Slope caused a gas release . And these events happened more than two years after the next item on this list , the most consequential mistake BP has made on the Slope to date . THE NORTH SLOPE 'S BIGGEST SPILL , MARCH 2 , 2006 As production from the Prudhoe Bay field on Alaska 's North Slope declined in the late 90s and early 2000s , BP slashed costs to compensate . Despite their Alaska operations being on probation for the first half of the decade after they pled guilty to illegal dumping at an offshore drilling field , a steady stream of complaints and investigations -LRB- both internally and by state inspectors -RRB- revealed that safety and maintenance were sacrificed to cut costs . The neglect culminated in the largest spill ever recorded on the North Slope : more than 200,000 gallons -LRB- more than 5,000 barrels -RRB- of crude oil . BP was oblivious to the spill for five days until a field worker drove through the area and smelled the crude . The leak issued from a dime-sized hole , but 16 miles of pipeline proved to be dangerously corroded ; replacing that pipe and installing a new leak-detection system cost BP half a billion dollars . You might think that this incident would teach BP 's Alaskan management that cutting corners ultimately does n't pay . But five months later , a safety technician contractor who had been complaining about pipeline inspectors faking their reports found himself canned after he pointed out a crack in a service pipe and halted some nearby work that was kicking up sparks . TEXAS CITY -- THE BIG EXPLOSION , MARCH 23 , 2005 The big explosion at the Texas City refinery in 2005 was only the most dramatic episode in the facility 's history of serious safety problems . Despite malfunctioning alarm systems , an octane-boosting unit was restarted , following which `` a distillation tower and attached blow down drum were overfilled with highly flammable liquid hydrocarbons , '' and when the blow down drum vented the liquids like a geyser into the air , it caused an explosion that was felt five miles away , which along with the resulting fires killed 15 and injured 170 . The same blow down drum had vented these vapors eight times between 1994 and 2004 , and twice the system had caught fire . In fact , the refinery experienced 40 to 80 fires a year , contributing to a sense of danger among the crew : A worker suggested in 2004 that to improve the plant , `` Quit waiting for a known possible unit disaster to happen before correcting the problem . '' A month before the explosion , another worker e-mailed management and warned , `` I truly believe that we are on the verge of something bigger happening . '' A record $ 21 million in fines followed . BP even failed to address these problems years later : in October 2009 , after a 6-month inspection , the Texas City refinery was found to have hundreds of `` egregious willful '' safety violations , earning them another $ 87.4 million in fines to eclipse the previous record . While the big Texas City explosion was the deadliest accident in BP 's history , it could have been a distant second or third . PRUDHOE BAY CENTRAL COMPRESSOR PLANT , OCTOBER 10 , 2009 This is a contingency BP plans for , but their system for handling this problem was n't operating , and BP did n't know it : A backup flare meant to burn off that collection of gas was not lit at the time , and cameras , installed so BP 's staff could monitor the flare 's functions in real time , were not pointed in the right direction . There was no explosion ; the gas vented out before anything could ignite it . That is , while BP monitors were unable to see that the pilot was out , a great buildup of gas escaped past it and fortunately was n't ignited by anything else . Robert Bea `` said the situation at the compressor station sounded like a ticking bomb . '' `` It 's hard to describe these explosions in terms that people can understand , '' he said . `` It would rival the biggest ones that we have ever had in the history of the oil and gas industry . '' Bea said a blast zone could reach 300 feet and leave a crater 90 feet wide . He likened the potential scenario to a gas valve error that led to the massive explosion of an offshore drilling platform called Piper Alpha in the North Sea in 1988 , in which 167 workers were killed . FORTIES ALPHA , NOVEMBER 27 , 2003 Another incident that resembled Piper Alpha was a near-catastrophe at another aging offshore rig in the North Sea called Forties Alpha , where BP had slashed the maintenance budget , leading them to break safety laws by failing to guard against corrosion on a gas pipe . As reported in the Weekly Standard : ... -LRB- the -RRB- gas line had ruptured -- allowing thousands of pounds of pressurized gas to escape at supersonic velocity . That caused a thunderous sonic boom . Debris from the burst pipe and its cladding rained down , adding to the impression that `` an artillery shell had just hit the platform . '' The escaping gas quickly formed a huge and potentially lethal cloud around the rig . Now the threat of an actual explosion was very real . The smallest spark would detonate more than a ton of methane gas . No one died or was even hurt that day on Forties Alpha , thanks in part to high winds that helped to disperse the gas after about 20 minutes of extreme danger to the platform and its crew of 180 people . BP was fined $ 290,000 , and the company 's first calamity on an offshore rig was averted . For a little while . In a few short weeks when members of Congress return to Washington , it is vital they tackle this issue head on . Look specifically at BP 's record -- a clear deviation from the industry norm . The stage has been set , the evidence laid out . It is time to stop punishing the entire energy industry for the negligence of one player . Fox Forum is on Twitter .

Scientists discovered the new microbe while studying the underwater dispersion of millions of gallons of oil spilled into the Gulf following the explosion of BP 's Deepwater Horizon drilling rig . And the microbe works without significantly depleting oxygen in the water , researchers led by Terry Hazen at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley , Calif. , reported Tuesday in the online journal Sciencexpress . `` Our findings , which provide the first data ever on microbial activity from a deepwater dispersed oil plume , suggest '' a great potential for bacteria to help dispose of oil plumes in the deep-sea , Hazen said in a statement . Environmentalists have raised concerns about the giant oil spill and the underwater plume of dispersed oil , particularly its potential effects on sea life . A report just last week described a 22-mile long underwater mist of tiny oil droplets . `` Our findings show that the influx of oil profoundly altered the microbial community by significantly stimulating deep-sea '' cold temperature bacteria that are closely related to known petroleum-degrading microbes , Hazen reported . Their findings are based on more than 200 samples collected from 17 deepwater sites between May 25 and June 2 . They found that the dominant microbe in the oil plume is a new species , closely related to members of Oceanospirillales . This microbe thrives in cold water , with temperatures in the deep recorded at 5 degrees Celsius -LRB- 41 Fahrenheit -RRB- . Hazen suggested that the bacteria may have adapted over time due to periodic leaks and natural seeps of oil in the Gulf . Scientists also had been concerned that oil-eating activity by microbes would consume large amounts of oxygen in the water , creating a `` dead zone '' dangerous to other life . But the new study found that oxygen saturation outside the oil plume was 67-percent while within the plume it was 59-percent . The research was supported by an existing grant with the Energy Biosciences Institute , a partnership led by the University of California Berkeley and the University of Illinois that is funded by a $ 500 million , 10-year grant from BP .

Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man for the spill response , told reporters Friday that engineers must remove the cap so they can raise the failed blowout preventer . The blowout preventer is considered a key piece of evidence in determining what caused the April rig explosion that unleashed the gushing oil . The leak was first contained when engineers were able to place a cap atop BP 's well . Workers then pumped mud and cement in through the top in a so-called `` static kill '' operation that significantly reduced pressure inside the well . Officials do n't expect oil to leak into the sea again when the cap is removed , but Allen has ordered BP to be ready to collect any leaking crude just in case . The Department of Justice and other federal investigators are overseeing the work to remove the blowout preventer , Allen said . The 50-foot -LRB- 15-meter -RRB- , 600,000-pound -LRB- 272,000-kilogram -RRB- device -- which was designed to prevent such a catastrophe -- will be taken out of the water with the well pipe still inside to ensure the pipe does n't break apart any more than it already has . Keeping the blowout preventer intact is important because it 's considered an essential piece of evidence in determining what caused the blast aboard the Deepwater Horizon on April 20 . After the explosion , 206 million gallons -LRB- 800 million liters -RRB- of oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico until the temporary cap stopped the flow . The explosion on the rig -- which was owned by Transocean Ltd. and being operated by BP PLC -- killed 11 workers . Engineers are hoping the blowout preventer can be detached easily , but they are prepared to exert 80,000 pounds -LRB- 36,000 kilograms -RRB- of pressure if needed , Allen said . A new blowout preventer will be placed atop the well once the one that failed is raised . After that , the goal is to drill the final 50 feet -LRB- 15 meters -RRB- of a relief well beginning Sept. 7 , Allen said . From there , it will take about four days for drilling crews to reach their target . The relief well has been called the ultimate solution to plugging the well . Once the relief well is drilled , engineers will be able to pump mud and cement in through the bottom of the well , plugging the one that gushed oil once and for all . Meanwhile , the U.S. government said Friday that it is reopening more federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico for commercial and recreational fishing that had been closed because of the spill . The government is reopening 4,281 square miles -LRB- 11,000 sq. kilometers -RRB- of waters off the coast of western Louisiana . Oil sheen has not been seen there since July 29 , and scientists found no oil or dispersants on samples of the area 's shrimp and fish . Twenty percent of federal waters in the Gulf remain closed . `` We 're sort of nibbling at the edges if you will , areas that have been free of oil for the longest time and were oiled the least , '' Lubchenco said . The news came as hearings continued in Houston before the joint U.S. Coast Guard-Bureau of Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement investigative panel . On Friday , Mark Hafle -- a BP drilling engineer who was a key decision maker at the now-sunken rig -- exercised his constitutional right to refuse to testify . The panel 's goal is to determine what caused the explosion . The panel also will make recommendations to prevent such a catastrophe in the future .

AP NEW ORLEANS -- Engineers removed a temporary cap Thursday that stopped oil from gushing into the Gulf of Mexico from BP 's blown-out well in mid-July . No more oil was expected to leak into the sea , but crews were standing by with collection vessels just in case . The cap was removed as a prelude to raising the massive piece of equipment underneath that failed to prevent the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history . The government wants to replace the failed blowout preventer first to deal with any pressure that is caused when a relief well BP has been drilling intersects the blown-out well . Once that intersection occurs sometime after Labor Day , BP is expected to use mud and cement to plug the blown-out well for good from the bottom . The April 20 rig explosion killed 11 workers and led to 206 million gallons of oil spewing from BP 's well . BP was leasing the rig from owner Transocean Ltd. . As the cap was slowly removed at 4:25 p.m. CDT , hours after a pipe latched to the top of it , there was no sight of anything spewing into the water . Undersea video feeds showed the cap suspended in the water . BP planned to place the cap on the seafloor nearby . With the cap gone , the old blowout preventer can be removed and a new one put in place before engineers try to seal the well for good deep underground . Once the blowout preventer is removed , a lot will be riding on the stability of a plug that was created when mud and cement were pumped down into the well from the top . Essentially , the pressure exerted downward served to counter the pressure coming up . But Rice University engineering professor George Hirasaki said there is still uncertainty about whether the cement settled everywhere it needed to in order to keep oil and gas from finding its way up . `` Just because it did n't flow when they tested it does n't mean the cement displaced all of the oil and gas , '' Hirasaki said . That 's why many people have felt that finishing a relief well and pumping mud and cement in through the bottom would be the ultimate solution to the crisis , said Hirasaki , who was involved in the oil containment effort in the Bay Marchand field off Louisiana after a rig burned in the early 1970s . The government still plans on ordering BP PLC , the majority owner of the well , to do the so-called bottom kill operation . But it believes the wisest course is to put on a new blowout preventer first to deal with any pressure that is caused when the relief well intersects the blown-out well . Another potential risk : What happens if the crane attached to the blowout preventer accidentally drops the 50-foot , 300-ton device onto the wellhead ? By itself , that might not cause more oil to spew , as long as the plug held , but it would make it difficult to continue the operation , Hirasaki said . `` It would crush everything , '' he said . `` It would be hard to place another blowout preventer on top of it . Right now the wellhead condition is in good condition . But if you dropped it , everything could be opened up . '' Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man on the oil spill response , told reporters Wednesday during a visit to BP 's U.S. offices in Houston that engineers believe the crane will be able to handle the weight of the blowout preventer and some fragile pipe that is believed to be lodged inside . But if the crane were to swing like a pendulum , that could cause problems , which is why officials have been waiting for rough seas at the site to calm down before continuing with removal of the blowout preventer . With the cap now removed , the Helix Q4000 will soon latch its hooks onto the blowout preventer and wait for instructions to begin lifting it up . Engineers are prepared to exert a tremendous amount of pressure to get the blowout preventer free , but they must be careful not to damage it because it is a key piece of evidence in ongoing investigations . Allen said there is no `` significant risk '' of more oil leaking into the environment . But he said that after the cap and blowout preventer are removed , `` The goal there will be to secure the annulus as quick as we can . '' The annulus is an area between the inner piping and the outer casing . Based on an updated timeline Allen released Wednesday , the blowout preventer could begin being raised late Thursday or early Friday . But Allen cautioned that timeline could be stretched again if high seas continue to kick up . The final plugging of the well is n't expected until after Labor Day . A 12-person government evidence team is waiting to take possession of the blowout preventer when it reaches the surface .

All 13 crew members were rescued . AP NEW ORLEANS -- Unlike the blast that led to the massive BP spill , the latest oil platform fire in the Gulf of Mexico killed no one and sent no crude gushing into the water . The Mariner Energy-owned platform that erupted in flames Thursday was just 200 miles west of the spill site , but everything from the structures to the operations to the safety devices were different . Click here for more on this story from Fox News ' LIVESHOT coverage . Yet when word of the latest mishap spread , residents along the coast could think only of the three-month spill that began after the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon exploded on April 20 , killing 11 workers . `` It 's unbelievable , '' said Sophie Esch , 28 , a Tulane graduate student from Berlin . `` They should finally stop drilling in the Gulf . They should shut down all the drilling out there and not give permission to do any more . They 've shown that it 's just unsafe . '' The Coast Guard initially reported that an oil sheen a mile long and 100 feet wide had begun to spread , but hours later said crews were unable to find any spill . Coast Guard Petty Officer Steve Lehmann in New Orleans said Friday morning that an 87-foot Coast Guard cutter patrolling the area has not reported any signs of leaks . A helicopter was to survey the site later in the day . Houston-based Mariner did not know what caused the fire . The 13 workers who were pulled from the water told rescuers that there was a blast on board , but Mariner 's Patrick Cassidy said he considered what happened a fire , not an explosion . Platforms are vastly different from oil rigs like BP 's Deepwater Horizon . They are usually brought in after wells are already drilled and sealed and the oil is flowing at a predictable pressure . A majority of platforms in the Gulf do not require crews on board . `` A production platform is much more stable , '' said Andy Radford , an API expert on offshore oil drilling . Many platforms , especially those in shallower water , stand on legs that are drilled into the sea floor . Like a giant octopus , each spreads numerous pipelines and can tap into many wells at once . The Deepwater Horizon was drilling a well a mile beneath the sea , which made trying to plug it after it blew out an incredible challenge , with BP trying techniques never tested . The platform that caught fire , meanwhile , was operating in 340 feet of water in a shallow area of the Gulf known as a major source of gas . Responding to any oil spill in such a shallow spot would be much easier than in deep water , where crews depend on remote-operated vehicles to access equipment on the sea floor . Platforms do not have blowout preventers like deep water rigs that are supposed to shut down wells if there is problem . But they are usually equipped with a series of redundant valves that can shut off oil and gas at different points along the pipeline . Mariner Energy officials said there were seven active production wells on its platform , and they were shut down shortly before the fire broke out . The platform was still intact and a small portion appeared burned , Cassidy said . Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said the company told him the fire began in 100 barrels of light oil condensate . Photos showed at least five ships floating near the platform . Three were shooting great plumes of water onto the machinery , an image similar to when the Deepwater Horizon exploded . Crews decided to let that blaze burn itself out , and the rig sank into the Gulf two days after the blast . On the Mariner Energy platform , the fire was out less than 12 hours . A Homeland Security update obtained by The Associated Press said the platform was producing 58,800 gallons of oil and 900,000 cubic feet of gas per day . The platform can store 4,200 gallons of oil . The workers aboard the platform were found huddled together , holding hands and wearing life jackets . A captain of the Crystal Clear , a 110-foot boat that rescued them , said his craft was 25 miles away when it received a distress call . When Capt. Dan Shaw arrived at the scene , the workers had been in the water for two hours and were thirsty and tired . `` We gave them soda and water , anything they wanted to drink , '' Shaw said . `` They were just glad to be on board with us . '' Shaw said workers told him the blast was so sudden that they did not have time to get into lifeboats . They did not mention what might have caused it . `` They just said there was an explosion , there was a fire , '' Shaw said . `` It happened very quick . '' Crew members were flown to a hospital and released by early Thursday evening . Environmental groups and some lawmakers said the newest problem showed the dangers of offshore drilling , and urged the Obama administration to extend a temporary ban on deepwater drilling to shallow water . `` How many accidents are needed and how much environmental and economic damage must we suffer before we act to contain and control the source of the danger : offshore drilling ?

AP NEW ORLEANS -- BP crews worked Saturday to slowly raise the 300-ton blowout preventer that failed to stop oil from spewing into the Gulf of Mexico , careful not to damage or drop a key piece of evidence in the spill investigation . When the blowout preventer reaches the surface after its mile-long journey , government investigators will take possession of it and eventually examine it , hoping to gain insight into why the device failed . A BP PLC spokesman said in an e-mail to The Associated Press that the 50-foot device was detached from the wellhead Friday afternoon . Another blowout preventer had successfully been placed on the blown-out well , the government said later . The April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon killed 11 workers and led to 206 million gallons of oil spewing from BP 's undersea well . Investigators know the explosion was triggered by a bubble of methane gas that escaped from the well and shot up the drill column , expanding quickly as it burst through several seals and barriers before igniting . But they do n't know exactly how or why the gas escaped . And they do n't know why the blowout preventer did n't seal the well pipe at the sea bottom after the eruption , as it was supposed to . While the device did n't close -- or may have closed partially -- hearings have produced no clear picture of why it did n't plug the well . Lawyers will be watching closely , as hundreds of lawsuits have been filed over the oil spill . Future liabilities faced by a number of corporations could be riding on what the analysis of the blowout preventer shows .

Thursday 's fire at the Mariner Energy platform 100 miles south of Louisiana came on the heels of the massive BP oil spill sparked by an explosion at the Deepwater Horizon rig -- and as the Obama administration appeared ready to lift the unpopular drilling ban . `` How many accidents are needed and how much environmental and economic damage must we suffer before we act to contain and control the source of the danger : offshore drilling ? '' said Rep. Frank Pallone , a New Jersey Democrat . Mike Gravitz , oceans advocate for Environment America , said President Obama `` should need no further wake-up call to permanently ban new drilling . '' But others say that the latest fire is no cause for concern -- and may even support arguments against the ban . Charlotte Randolph , president of the Lafourche , La. , Parish and an outspoken critic of the moratorium , said the outcome of Thursday 's platform fire proved that the oil and gas industry has effective safety procedures . `` The people were safely recovered . The oil did not spill . It 's everything the Deepwater Horizon was not , '' she said . The current drilling ban , which does n't apply to oil platforms like the one affected by Thursday 's fire , has halted drilling at 33 ocean wells , but there still are more than 7,300 active leases in the Gulf of Mexico , 58 percent of them in deep waters , according to the American Petroleum Institute . There are about 3,400 platforms operating in the Gulf , pumping about a third of America 's domestic oil . Platforms are vastly different from oil rigs like BP 's Deepwater Horizon . They are usually brought in after wells are already drilled and sealed and the oil is flowing at a predictable pressure . A majority of platforms in the Gulf do not require crews on board . The initial reports of Thursday 's platform fire triggered a collective panic , but unlike the April explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig -- which killed 11 people and led to the largest offshore oil spill in the nation 's history -- this fire killed no one and sent no crude gushing into the water . The latest fire `` is another reminder that drilling accidents happen all too frequently . We can not afford to lose any more human lives , nor can we tolerate further damage to the Gulf and its irreplaceable ocean ecosystems , '' said Jacqueline Savitz of the environmental group Oceana . Rep. Edward Markey , D-Mass . , a leading critic of BP , said the fire highlights the risks associated with offshore drilling . Lawmakers `` have a duty to ... all oil workers to make sure the oil industry 's drilling practices are safe and sound , '' Markey said . The Interior Department has said it is considering lifting the ban for certain categories of rigs before the scheduled Nov. 30 expiration . But after Thursday 's accident the department may hesitate to act . White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said he did n't think the incident would affect the drilling moratorium . Gibbs resisted any effort to link the platform fire to the BP spill . `` At this point , based on what we know , I do n't want to marry those two up , '' Gibbs told reporters Thursday . A spokeswoman for Interior Secretary Ken Salazar declined to comment . Industry representatives also distinguished between the two incidents , saying that the fire did not involve drilling and occurred on a production platform where wells have already been drilled and sealed , rather than a drilling rig like the Deepwater Horizon . Mariner Energy said there were seven active production wells on its platform , but they were shut down for maintenance shortly before the fire broke out . A crew was on the platform painting and sandblasting when the fire occurred , a company spokesman said Friday . Lee Hunt , chief executive of the International Association of Drilling Contractors , said those urging tighter restrictions on offshore drilling were overreacting . `` These things have happened and been reported before '' and generated little media attention , Hunt said . Still , Hunt conceded that the timing of the fire was `` not fortuitous , '' adding that he expects upcoming congressional hearings on the Mariner fire to be a `` minor circus . '' Hunt called the fire a `` major blast '' similar to one at a land-based refinery . `` As a geographical workplace , you would expect some fires . Just like you 'd expect some chemical storage facilities ... will occasionally have three-alarm fires on land , '' he said . `` They do happen . '' Federal authorities have cited Mariner Energy and related entities for 10 accidents in the Gulf of Mexico over the past four years , according to safety records from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement . The accidents range from platform fires to pollution spills and a blowout . A day before the fire , the American Petroleum Institute held a `` Rally for Jobs '' in Houston to protest the drilling moratorium . Mariner official Barbara Dianne Hagood was among those in attendance , according to a Financial Times report . `` I have been in the oil and gas industry for 40 years , and this administration is trying to break us , '' she told the London-based paper . `` The moratorium they imposed is going to be a financial disaster for the Gulf Coast , Gulf Coast employees and Gulf Coast residents .

The blowout preventer was n't expected to reach the surface until Saturday , at which point government investigators will take possession of it . AP ON THE GULF OF MEXICO -- Investigators looking into what went wrong in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill are a step closer to answers now that a key piece of evidence is secure aboard a ship . hours to lift the 50-foot , 300-ton blowout preventer from a mile beneath the sea . The five-story high device breached the water 's surface at 6:54 p.m. CDT , and looked largely intact with black stains on the yellow metal . FBI agents were among the 137 people aboard the Helix Q4000 vessel , taking photos and video of the device . They will escort it back to a NASA facility in Louisiana for analysis . The AP was the only news outlet with a print reporter and photographer on board the ship . The blowout preventer was placed into a metal contraption specifically designed to hold the massive device at 9:16 p.m. CDT Saturday . As it was maneuvered into place , crew members were silent and water dripped off the device . Crews had been delayed raising the device after icelike crystals -- called hydrates -- formed on it . The device could n't be safely lifted from the water until the hydrates melted because the hydrates are combustible , said Darin Hilton , the captain of the Helix Q4000 . Hydrates form when gases such as methane mix with water under high pressure and cold temperatures . The crystals caused BP PLC problems in May , when hydrates formed on a 100-ton , four-story dome the company tried to place over the leak to contain it . As a large hatch opened up on the Helix to allow the blowout preventer to pass through , several hundred feet of light sheen could be seen near the boat , though crews were n't exactly sure what it was . The April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon killed 11 workers and led to 206 million gallons of oil spewing from BP PLC 's undersea well . Investigators know the explosion was triggered by a bubble of methane gas that escaped from the well and shot up the drill column , expanding quickly as it burst through several seals and barriers before igniting . But they do n't know exactly how or why the gas escaped . And they do n't know why the blowout preventer did n't seal the well pipe at the sea bottom after the eruption , as it was supposed to . While the device did n't close -- or may have closed partially -- investigative hearings have produced no clear picture of why it did n't plug the well . Documents emerged showing that a part of the device had a hydraulic leak , which would have reduced its effectiveness , and that a passive `` deadman '' trigger had a low , perhaps even dead , battery . Steve Newman , president of rig owner Transocean , told lawmakers following the disaster that there was no evidence the device itself failed and suggested debris might have been forced into it by the surging gas . There has also been testimony that the blowout preventer did n't undergo a rigorous recertification process in 2005 as required by federal regulators . Testimony from BP and Transocean officials also showed that repairs were not always authorized by the manufacturer , Cameron International , and that confusion about the equipment delayed attempts to close the well in the days after the explosion . A Transocean official has said he knew the blowout preventer was functioning because he personally oversaw its maintenance , and he said the device underwent tests to ensure it was working . The device , he said , had undergone a maintenance overhaul in February as it was being moved to the Deepwater Horizon to be placed over BP 's well . Also , according to testimony , a BP well site leader performed a pressure test April 9 on the blowout preventer , and he said it passed . Some have cautioned that the blowout preventer will not provide clues to what caused the gas bubble . And it is possible a thorough review may not be able to show why it did n't work . That could leave investigators to speculate on causes using data , records and testimony . Lawyers will be watching closely , too , as hundreds of lawsuits have been filed over the oil spill . Future liabilities faced by a number of corporations could be riding on what the analysis of the blowout preventer shows . A temporary cap that stopped oil from gushing into the Gulf in mid-July was removed Thursday . No more oil was expected to leak into the sea , but crews were standing by with collection vessels in case . The government said a new blowout preventer was placed on the blown-out well late Friday .

But in a possible preview of its legal strategy , it also pointed the finger at its partners on the doomed rig . The highly technical , 193-page report attributes the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history and the rig explosion that set it off to a complex chain of failures both human and mechanical . Some of those problems have been made public over the past 4 ? months , such as the failure of the blowout preventer to clamp the well shut . The report is far from the definitive ruling on the cause of the catastrophe . For one thing , government investigators have not yet begun to fully analyze the blowout preventer , which was raised from the bottom of the sea over Labor Day weekend . But it provides an early look at the company 's probable legal strategy -- spreading the blame among itself , rig owner Transocean , and cement contractor Halliburton -- as it deals with hundreds of lawsuits , billions of dollars in claims and possible criminal charges in the coming months and years . Critics of BP called the report self-serving . `` This report is not BP 's mea culpa , '' said Rep. Edward J. Markey , D-Mass . , a member of a congressional panel investigating the spill . `` Of their own eight key findings , they only explicitly take responsibility for half of one . BP is happy to slice up blame as long as they get the smallest piece . '' The report 's conclusions stand in contrast to a widely seen BP ad campaign in which the company casts no blame for the explosion and vows to clean up and restore the Gulf Coast . `` BP blaming others for the Gulf oil disaster is like Bernie Madoff blaming his accountant , '' said Robert Gordon , an attorney for fishermen , hotels and restaurants affected by the spill . Another plaintiff 's lawyer , W. Mark Lanier , scoffed : `` This is like the ringleader of a lynch mob saying , ` Well , I did n't bring the rope ; he did . ' '' The disaster began when the Deepwater Horizon exploded off the coast of Louisiana on April 20 , killing 11 workers . BP 's well spewed more than 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf before a temporary cap stopped it in mid-July . Members of Congress , industry experts and workers who survived the blast have accused BP 's engineers of cutting corners to save time and money on a project that was 43 days and more than $ 20 million behind schedule at the time of the blast . Nearly 24 hours before the explosion , Halliburton was using cement to seal the gap between the well casing and the hole drilled in the seafloor . It was also cementing the bottom of the well shut until the day BP was ready to begin extracting oil and gas from it . In its report , BP said that it was a bad cementing job that contributed to the blowout and that the design of the well was probably not to blame . It also said `` more thorough review and testing by Halliburton '' and `` stronger quality assurance '' by BP 's well team might have identified weaknesses in the plan for cementing . The report acknowledged , as investigators have previously suggested , that BP 's engineers and employees of Transocean misinterpreted a pressure test of the well 's integrity before the explosion . `` The Transocean rig crew and BP well site leaders reached the incorrect view that the test was successful and that well integrity had been established , '' the investigators said . They also blamed employees on the rig from both companies for failing to respond to other warning signs that the well was in danger of blowing out . The words `` blame '' and `` mistake '' never appear in the report . `` Fault '' shows up 20 times , but only once in the same sentence as the company 's name . `` The team did not identify any single action or inaction that caused this accident , '' the investigators said . `` Rather , a complex and interlinked series of mechanical failures , human judgments , engineering design , operational implementation and team interfaces came together to allow the initiation and escalation of the accident . Multiple companies , work teams and circumstances were involved over time . '' Mark Bly , who as BP 's safety chief led the internal investigation , said the report was a reconstruction of what happened on the rig based on the company 's data and interviews with mostly BP employees and was not meant to focus on assigning blame . The six-person investigating panel had access to only a few workers from other companies , and samples of the actual cement used in the well were not released to BP . Transocean blasted the report as a self-serving attempt to conceal what it called the real cause of the explosion -- `` BP 's fatally flawed well design . '' Halliburton said it found a number of omissions and inaccuracies in the report and is confident the work it completed on the well met BP 's specifications . `` Contractors do not specify well design or make decisions regarding testing procedures as that responsibility lies with the well owner , '' the company said . White House press secretary Robert Gibbs noted `` there is an active investigation into what went wrong '' and said the administration 's job is to find out what happened and hold those responsible accountable . Federal prosecutors are among those investigating . In Wednesday trading in New York , BP stock rose $ 1.18 , or 3.2 percent , to close at $ 38.37 . Investigators know the explosion was triggered by a bubble of methane gas that shot up the drill column and ignited . But they do n't know exactly how and why the gas escaped . And they do n't know for certain why the blowout preventer did n't work . But in its report , BP said the blowout preventer did n't do its job because it was damaged in the explosion and because it had a bad valve and weak batteries . Transocean , which was responsible for maintaining the blowout preventer , has insisted the batteries were in working order . -- Its use of six centralizers during the cementing , instead of the 21 recommended by Halliburton , probably did not contribute to the cement 's failure . Centralizers make sure the casing is running down the center of the well bore . If the casing is cemented off-center , there is a risk of an imperfect seal that could allow oil and gas to escape . -- Just before the blast , the flammable gas leaking from the well was directed onto the rig instead of being vented overboard . The rig 's ventilation system may have allowed the gas to enter the engine rooms , where it may have ignited . -- Recommendations should be considered to improve offshore drilling practices . It suggested , among other things , that standards for reporting and investigating incidents be clarified and strengthened . Separately on Wednesday , the Obama administration said it sent a sixth bill , for $ 128.5 million , to BP and others for costs associated with the spill . The first five bills , totaling $ 389.9 million , have been paid in full by BP , the government said .

He said his computer model was predicting a `` serious gas flow problem '' with BP 's well abandonment plan . His idea for addressing the issue would never be carried out . BP decided it was n't necessary . Five days later , on April 20 , the well blew out , causing the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history . In an internal report released Wednesday , BP stood by its decision , saying Gagliano 's plan would not have stopped the explosion . The disagreement was just one of several that emerged in the days and hours before the blast , according to BP 's report and e-mails , documents and testimony gathered by federal investigators . Confusion surrounded crucial tasks and frustration rose among people involved . The cause of the explosion , which killed 11 workers , remains under investigation by federal authorities . But as more information trickles out , the image of a high-stakes , high seas venture collapsing in disarray is sharpening . The mile-deep exploratory well was being capped with cement so it could be abandoned until a production phase later . BP operated the well , Transocean owned the rig and Halliburton carried out the cement job . They had to work together . Yet key plans kept changing . Critical tests meant to ensure the well would be safely cemented were not going smoothly . BP accepts some of the blame for decisions that led to the blowout , but its report also assigns fault to Transocean and Halliburton workers . Those companies , in turn , point the finger at BP 's well design . The head of the Deepwater Horizon rig , who was most familiar with its crew and operations , had left for training and was replaced by Bob Kaluza , who was less familiar with earlier problems surrounding the well . The operation was running 45 days late and millions of dollars over budget . Gagliano 's computer model exposed yet another possible problem . The longtime technical adviser concluded that the cementing operation needed more centralizers , devices designed to ensure that the casing -- or drilling pipe -- runs down the center of the wellbore to increase the chance for a perfect seal and prevent leaks . BP had planned to run six centralizers and had them onboard . After a corridor chat with BP 's senior drilling engineer , Gagliano worked up more models . By the evening of April 15 , Gagliano had a model with 21 centralizers that resolved the gas flow problem . The 15 additional centralizers were acquired and scheduled for delivery the next morning , in time for the Halliburton cementers to do the job . Still , the debate did n't end . BP drilling engineer Brett Cocales learned the next afternoon , April 16 , that his company 's engineers had decided against using the additional centralizers because of questions about their mechanical integrity . Members of a BP investigation panel said Wednesday that those concerns were unfounded because engineers were mistaken about which centralizers had been shipped . In an e-mail to fellow drilling engineer Brian Morel , Cocales explained the extra centralizers could help meet the goal of inserting the casing properly . Then he continued : `` But who cares ? We 'll probably get a good cement job , '' he wrote , frustrated it had taken so long to make a decision . A few hours later , Halliburton cementer Nathaniel Chaisson , who was already on the rig , also learned the additional centralizers would not be used and notified Gagliano , who he said seemed concerned . On April 19 , Gagliano 's models still showed that using only six centralizers raised the risk of a failed cement job . Still in Houston , he participated in the daily morning call with the rig . The centralizers were n't mentioned . He did n't raise the issue . `` BP made their decision , '' Gagliano recalled when testifying before a federal panel . He thought the worst-case scenario would be that they would have to go back to fix the cement job after it was completed . Months later , BP is defending the decision . In Wednesday 's report , the company said the decision not to use 21 centralizers likely did n't contribute to the cement 's failure . Meanwhile , the well lining job , known as casing , was completed . The casing , critical to ensuring no gas slips out of the wellbore uncontrolled , looked good , paving the way for that night 's cementing . The cement would essentially seal the gap between the well casing and the hole drilled in the seafloor . It would also shut in the well until the day BP was ready to extract oil and gas . At 9 p.m. April 19 , the Halliburton workers began the complicated cement job 5,000 feet below the surface . Sometime during the night , Chaisson , the Halliburton cementer , noticed a BP drilling engineer calling Houston headquarters . `` We may have blown something out higher in the casing , '' the engineer said , triggering a flurry of phone calls between the rig and Houston . Ultimately , they continued the job and Chaisson did not indicate there was ever discussion to halt the work . Since then , however , BP has said it found weaknesses in the design and testing of the cement . It said the weaknesses may have allowed hydrocarbons to escape from the wellbore , causing the blowout . Halliburton insists the problem was not in the cement but in BP 's design of the well . By 1 a.m. , on April 20 , the cement job was completed . `` We have completed the job and it went well , '' Chaisson wrote to Gagliano in an e-mail at 5:44 a.m. Confidence was up . Yet at the 11 a.m. meeting , rig leader Jimmy Harrell was unhappy . BP 's plan for shutting down operations did n't include a `` negative pressure test '' -- a procedure that reduces the fluid pressure in the well to ensure there are no gas leaks . Harrell learned a long time ago this was risky . He demanded the test . Meanwhile , in Houma , La. , a group of VIPs -- BP executives Pat O'Bryan and David Sims , and Transocean executives Daun Winslow and Buddy Trahan -- boarded a helicopter headed for the Deepwater Horizon . They were going for a 24-hour `` visibility '' visit to one of their best-performing Gulf rigs . They arrived on the rig floor as the negative test was going on . Winslow realized there was confusion over the pressures -- indicating there might be a leak somewhere in the wellbore -- and decided it was not a good environment for the group . `` Let 's let these guys get back to work , '' he said , taking the VIPs to the pontoon area . Harrell and a Transocean toolpusher , Randy Ezell , stayed to help with the test . Kaluza , the BP company man , was not satisfied . He got permission from Houston to run a second test . After dinner , Chris Pleasant , a Transocean subsea supervisor , went to the drill shack to begin his shift . He was told that 60 barrels of mud appeared to have been lost during the pressure test . Ideally , rig workers like to see little or no mud lost in the test . Losing too much mud can signal a leak in the casing -- which could cause an oil spill , or in the worst-case scenario , allow gas and highly explosive methane to seep through the casing , leading to a blowout . Wyman Wheeler , a Transocean toolpusher , said something was n't right . He ended his shift and was relieved by Jason Anderson . An argument erupted over how to do the second negative test . Anderson wanted it done as it had always been done on the Horizon , and finally persuaded the BP crew . By 8 p.m. , the test had ended . `` Go call the office , '' BP 's well site leader Don Vidrine told his counterpart , Kaluza . `` Tell them we 're going to displace the well '' -- a critical task in which the mud that keeps the oil and gas under control is replaced with seawater before the well is closed and abandoned . Vidrine 's decision to proceed may have been a fateful one . BP now believes that Transocean and BP supervisors misinterpreted the results of the negative-pressure tests . While workers removed mud from the well , the VIPs ended a meeting with the rig leadership and headed for the bridge . Capt. Curt Kuchta showed them the controls and the radar . David Sims of BP got in a video-game-like machine that simulates piloting the rig . Winslow went to have a cigarette . The phone on the rig floor rang . It was Ezell , who had reluctantly gone to dinner and was asking about the test results . `` It went good , '' Anderson responded . `` What about your displacement ? How 's it going ? '' `` It 's going fine , '' Anderson answered . But the rig crew apparently missed warning signs that oil and gas had entered the well . BP investigators suspect the rig crew was distracted by other `` end-of-well activities . '' It was 9:30 when Ezell followed Anderson 's instructions and went to his cabin . He chatted with his wife . Then he turned off the lights and laid down to watch TV . Eight minutes later , unbeknownst to Anderson , hydrocarbons started to shoot toward the rig . Three minutes later , rig workers started trying to control the well , but by then , mud was already flowing unchecked onto the rig floor . Pleasant , the Transocean subsea supervisor , was doing paperwork . He had the rig leader sign some documents . Senior toolpusher Randy Harrell closed out some permits and went to take a shower . On the bridge , Sims got out of the simulator . The phone rang in Ezell 's bunk . `` We have a situation , '' an assistant driller said . `` The well is blown out . We have mud going to the crown . '' `` Do y ' all have it shut in ? '' Ezell asked , horrified . `` Jason is shutting it in now , '' Curtis responded . `` Randy , we need your help . '' Ezell jumped into his coveralls , shoved his feet into boots , grabbed his hardhat and ran . In Pleasant 's office , a rig worker looked over . `` Chris , what 's that water ? '' he asked , apparently seeing the fluid rising from the well and onto the rig . `` They 're probably coming out the hole , '' Pleasant answered , fixated on the computer screen . `` I see mud , '' the worker said . He called the rig floor . `` We got to go , '' Pleasant said , and took off down the hall . It was nearly 10 p.m. O'Bryan was in the simulator . Sims was on the bridge . Harrell was in the shower . Ezell was running to the rig floor . The captain opened the portside door and saw fluid pouring onto the rig . Associated Press writer Michael Kunzelman in New Orleans contributed to this report .

Louisiana lawmakers and the oil and gas industry immediately disputed the finding . The report , released at a Senate hearing Thursday , said the moratorium imposed after the BP oil spill likely caused a temporary loss of 8,000 to 12,000 jobs in the Gulf region , including about 2,000 on deepwater rigs . Total industry spending in the region decreased by nearly $ 2 billion , the report said , most of it by drilling operators . But the report found no large increases in unemployment claims , thanks in part to a big hiring push for cleanup crews and massive spending by BP on the recovery effort . The scenario is far rosier than described in some previous reports , including an Interior Department estimate over the summer that 23,000 jobs could be lost to the moratorium . Sen. Mary Landrieu , D-La . , a leading critic of the moratorium , attacked the report and said the `` heavy hand of the federal government '' was placing thousands of jobs in the Gulf at risk . `` I find it stunning that the administration was aware that their actions might eliminate nearly 23,000 jobs in an already faltering economy and proceeded anyway , '' Landrieu said . `` That decision has imperiled thousands of small businesses who are reliant on the revenue generated by the oil and gas industry . '' Landrieu and fellow Louisiana Sen. David Vitter repeatedly challenged the report 's accuracy and noted that it did not address what they called a de facto moratorium on shallow-water drilling . Fewer than a dozen shallow-water drilling permits have been issued in recent months , compared with an average of 40 a month before the BP spill , they said . Vitter , a Republican , told a Commerce Department official that the report 's upbeat analysis was at odds with reality in the Gulf . `` I have to tell you , I talk to these people every day . It sure as heck is not what they are telling me , '' he told Commerce Undersecretary Rebecca Blank at a hearing of Senate Small Business Committee . `` Every day I hear the exact opposite . '' Jim Noe , executive director of the Shallow Water Energy Security Coalition , said it was outrageous that the report credited spill cleanup work as a net positive for the Gulf Coast . `` Spinning this as a positive is like saying that a hurricane is good for the economy because of all of the rebuilding work it will provide afterward , '' Noe said . `` It 's the cleanup that 's ` temporary , ' not the impact of the moratorium . '' Louisiana State University economist Joseph Mason called the report overly optimistic , noting that it did not address shallow-water drilling and assumed that job losses would stop once the moratorium ends . `` The White House characterizes these as the most probable numbers . I characterize them as the lower bounds , '' Mason said . Still , Mason 's own study offered a similar conclusion , projecting that the moratorium could cost the Gulf Coast at least 8,169 jobs , $ 2.1 billion in economic activity and $ 98 million in lost revenue from state and local taxes . Mason , who also works with the American Energy Alliance , a pro-industry group , said his estimates of job losses will grow if the moratorium continues beyond six months . Vitter said he was astonished to learn that the Obama administration did not do an economic analysis before imposing the moratorium in May , calling that inexcusable . But Blank , the Commerce Department official , said that in the wake of the BP spill , officials were focused on safety . `` The concern for protecting the environment , protecting the safety of the drilling industry , was the paramount concern , '' she said . Blank told the Senate panel that of 41 rigs operating in deep waters at the time of the moratorium , only five have left the Gulf . The new report said other surveys , including the one by Interior , measured worst-case scenarios that never came to pass . Instead , the report said , the majority of rig workers have kept their jobs during the moratorium as the oil industry used the opportunity to repair rigs or kept skilled workers employed in anticipation that deep-water drilling would resume . President Barack Obama imposed the deepwater drilling moratorium in May following the April 20 oil well blowout that killed 11 workers and spewed more than 200 million gallons of crude into the Gulf before it was capped in mid-July . Meant to allow time to ensure adequate safety and cleanup procedures are in place on other deepwater drilling rigs , the moratorium is scheduled to last through November , although federal officials have indicated it could end before then . It 's also being challenged in court . Officials in Louisiana and elsewhere contend the moratorium is an unnecessary job-killer , but Thursday 's report disagreed . It found no greater rise in unemployment in the five Louisiana parishes most affected by the moratorium than elsewhere in the state or nation . `` There is no evidence of declining employment after the moratorium was announced , '' the report said . The report focuses narrowly on the moratorium and does not seek to measure wider economic impacts from the oil spill itself -- for example , on fishing or tourism . The report finds a modest impact on oil and natural gas production in the Gulf from the moratorium , which should not affect the price of oil .

A BP spokesman said there no longer was a need to use mud in tandem with the cement because pressure from the well was n't an issue . BP expects the well to be completely sealed on Saturday . The government had previously said it expected the well to be declared dead by Sunday , but on Friday the Coast Guard indicated the culmination was likely to be Saturday . Cement began flowing at 1:30 p.m. CDT . It was expected to flow for several hours and then take up to 24 hours to set , according to BP . The pumping of cement followed the successful intersection late Thursday between a relief well drilled nearly 2.5 miles beneath the floor of the Gulf and the blown-out well . An April 20 explosion killed 11 workers , sank a drilling rig and led to the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history . `` I am ready for that cigar now , '' John Wright , who led the team drilling the relief well , said in an e-mail Friday to The Associated Press from aboard the Development Driller III vessel . Wright , who is not a BP employee but is working on a contract basis , had told the AP in August that he was looking forward to finishing his mission and celebrating with a cigar , a dinner party with his crew and a trip somewhere quiet to unwind with his wife . He has never missed his target over the years , with this relief well being the 41st he 's successfully drilled . The gusher was contained in mid-July after a temporary cap was successfully fitted atop the well . Mud and cement were later pushed down through the top of the well , allowing the cap to be removed . But the blown-out well can not be declared dead until it is sealed from the bottom . The blast sank the Deepwater Horizon rig and triggered the spill that eventually spewed 206 million gallons of oil from the well . BP PLC is a majority owner of the well and was leasing the rig from owner Transocean Ltd. . The disaster caused an environmental and economic nightmare for people who live , work and play along hundreds of miles of Gulf shoreline from Florida to Texas . It also spurred civil and criminal investigations , cost gaffe-prone BP chief Tony Hayward his job and brought increased governmental scrutiny of the oil and gas industry , including a costly moratorium on deepwater offshore drilling that is still in place . Gulf residents will be feeling the pain for years to come . There is still plenty of oil in the water , and some continues to wash up on shore .

Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the federal government 's point man on the disaster , said Sunday that BP 's well `` is effectively dead '' and posed no further threat to the Gulf . Allen said a pressure test to ensure the cement plug would hold was completed at 5:54 a.m. CDT -LRB- 10:54 GMT -RRB- . President Obama commended Allen and other federal officials Sunday for achieving an `` important milestone , '' and said the U.S. remains committed to restoring the environment in the Gulf . `` While we have seen a diminished need for our massive response that encompassed more than 40,000 people , 7,000 vessels and the coordination of dozens of federal , state and local agencies and other partners , we also remain committed to doing everything possible to make sure the Gulf Coast recovers fully from this disaster , '' Obama said in a statement . `` This road will not be easy , but we will continue to work closely with the people of the Gulf to rebuild their livelihoods and restore the environment that supports them . '' The gusher was contained in mid-July after a temporary cap was successfully fitted atop the well . Mud and cement were later pushed down through the top of the well , allowing the cap to be removed . But the well could not be declared dead until a relief well was drilled so that the ruptured well could be sealed from the bottom , ensuring it never causes a problem again .

Its image as a steward of the environment was stained and its stated commitment to safety was challenged . Owners of BP-branded gas stations in the U.S. were hit with lost sales , as customers protested at the pump . And on the financial side : BP has already shelled out more than $ 8 billion in cleanup costs and promised to set aside another $ 20 billion for a victims compensation fund . The company could face tens of billions of dollars more in government fines and legal costs from hundreds of pending lawsuits . BP took some of the blame for the Gulf oil disaster in an internal report issued this month , acknowledging among other things that its workers misinterpreted a key pressure test of the well .

Now , it 's home to depression , worry and sadness for many . A Gallup survey released Tuesday of almost 2,600 coastal residents showed that depression cases are up more than 25 percent since an explosion killed 11 people and unleashed a three-month gusher of crude into the Gulf in April that ruined many livelihoods . The conclusions were consistent with trends seen in smaller studies and witnessed by mental health workers . People just are n't as happy as they used to be despite palm trees and warm weather . A `` well-being index '' included in the Gallup study said many coastal residents are stressed out , worried and sad more often than people living inland , an indication that the spill 's emotional toll lingers even if most of the oil has vanished from view . Margaret Carruth is among those fighting to hang on . Her hairstyling business dried up after tourists stopped coming to the beach and locals cut back on nonessentials like haircuts . All but broke and unable to afford rent , Carruth packed her belongings into her truck and a storage shed and now depends on friends for shelter . `` I 'm a strong person and always have been , but I 'm almost to the breaking point , '' says Carruth . The Gallup survey was conducted in 25 Gulf-front counties from Texas east to Florida over eight months before and after the spill , ending Aug. 6 . The survey found that 19.6 percent of people reported receiving a clinical diagnosis of depression after the spill compared with 15.6 percent before , an increase of 25.6 percent . The study did n't conclude the additional cases were tied directly to the oil , however . The survey said people along the Gulf reported feeling sad , worried and stressed after the spill , while people living inland reported less over the same period . Another survey found that more than 40 percent of people in coastal Mississippi reported feeling stress after the BP geyser blew , a 15 percent increase from before . The survey is part of an ongoing health index survey sponsored by Healthways , a wellness and alternative health care company based in Nashville , Tenn. . Respondents were randomly selected and interviewed by telephone , and the survey of coastal residents has a margin of error of 3 percentage points . The oil spill followed waves of hard luck for the Gulf region , including hurricanes and recession . Experts say it 's impossible to determine how much of the current mental health downturn could have roots in problems other than crude washing into marshes and beaches , damaging the seafood and tourist industries . But an earlier study conducted in 13 counties and parishes with a total population of 1.9 million showed that 13 percent of coastal adults from Louisiana to Florida suffered probable serious mental illnesses after the spill . The level of mental illness was similar to that seen six months after Hurricane Katrina decimated the coast five years ago , and experts are n't yet seeing any improvement in mental health five months after the oil crisis began . Before Katrina , a study by the National Institute of Mental Health said only 6 percent of area residents had likely mental illnesses . `` From the types of patients we are seeing in our emergency departments , clinics and hospitals , the problems are persisting , '' said William Pinsky of the New Orleans-based Ochsner Health System , which conducted the random telephone survey of 406 people in four states during the summer . Sleeplessness , anxiety , depression , anger , substance abuse and domestic violence are among the most common problems reported by mental health agencies . BP has provided $ 52 million for mental health care in the Gulf region , with $ 15 million going to the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals ; $ 12 million each to the states of Alabama and Mississippi ; $ 3 million to Florida ; and $ 10 million to the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration . Even though the oil stopped flowing in July and the BP well was finally killed this month , some officials say the toll on mental health may get worse as the financial strains of summer persist into the fall . `` It 's like a virus that 's spreading , '' said Tonya Fistein , one of four counselors hired by AltaPointe Health Systems specifically to help people deal emotionally with the spill in Bayou La Batre , a tiny Alabama fishing community hard hit by the disaster . AltaPointe 's clinic is seeing twice as many new patients as in 2009 , an increase it blames on the spill . In Gulfport , Miss. , 42 percent of the patients surveyed at the Gulf Coast Mental Health Center said they were sad or depressed because of the spill . Steve Barrileaux , a psychologist at the Gulfport center , said some of the problems leading to mental health issues are obvious , like the loss of work by a person who rented chairs on the beach . Others are more subtle . Many people are deeply worried about the environment , for instance , or lament the lost moments they would have spent fishing recreationally with loved ones . Others are still afraid to eat seafood , even on the coast where livelihoods depend on it . `` What 's scary is the long-term damage that can be done , and we just do n't know about that , '' Barrileaux said . Chanthy Prak frets constantly about how to make ends meet in the post-spill world . Prak worked in crab houses around Bayou La Batre before the oil hit . She and her husband , another seafood worker displaced by the spill , have received only $ 5,000 in claims payments since May to support them and their seven children . There 's money going out but no money coming in , '' said the Cambodia native . In some areas , higher rates of mental problems appear to have little to do with the oil . At Lakeview Center , which provides mental health services in Pensacola , Fla. , calls have increased to a crisis intervention line compared to 2009 , but relatively few people have mentioned the oil spill as the reason they need help , said spokeswoman Karen Smith . Psychologists believe the uptick is most likely linked to the recession , she said . More oil came ashore just to the west of Pensacola in Baldwin County , Ala. , however , and a survey conducted for the state by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found significant mental health problems that people blamed on the spill . Twenty-three percent of households in the area reported having at least one person who blamed sleep troubles on the spill , and 11 percent had at least one person with appetite loss . Perhaps most tellingly , 32 percent reported a decrease in income linked to the oil spill , which could lead to additional strain , said Dr. Charles Woernle , the state epidemiologist with the Alabama Department of Public Health . Officials along the Gulf Coast worry that many of the hardest-hit groups -- shrimpers , Asian seafood workers and low-wage tourism employees -- wo n't seek help for mental problems because of cultural taboos . At AltaPointe , officials hope to use a share of the BP money to pay for additional oil-spill counselors . Tejuania Nelson , who runs a day-care center in fishing-dependent Grand Bay , Ala. , said preschoolers whose parents were left jobless because of the spill are lashing out in unsettling ways . `` They 're throwing desks , kicking chairs , '' she said . `` It 's sad . With this , people do not have hope . They can not see a better time .

For those that rely on Gulf Seafood to make money -- fishermen , wholesalers , distributors -- the problem is n't available local product . It 's demand that remains down , even though no oil from BP 's Deepwater Horizon disaster has seeped into the Gulf for 2 months . Pure and simple , it 's a public perception issue that continues to plague the Gulf seafood industry . `` Our sales are down 52 % from what they were at this point last year , '' says Frank Patti , of Pensacola , Florida 's legendary Joe Patti Seafood , named after his father in 1930 . For the first time in 80 years of doing business , the signs above the fish on ice at his wholesale business now say exactly where each shrimp , oyster , scallop and tuna was caught . `` People did n't ask where it came from , but now , today , they do . Ever since the spill , they want to know where it came from , '' says Patti . Seafood caught in the Gulf of Mexico is perhaps the most thoroughly tested seafood in the world right now , according to retired Admiral Thad Allen , the federal government 's point man on the BP oil spill . He as well as federal scientists have repeatedly proclaimed gulf seafood safe , healthy and delicious . But there remains a national squeemishness among many fish eaters , thanks in large part to non-stop tv coverage of the oil spill for weeks on end . When the customers do n't want Gulf of Mexico shrimp , for example , then the fishermen , wholesalers and distributors -- who all want to make money -- look elsewhere for product . Even if a Mississippi shrimper went out today and brought back a huge haul of safe-to-eat shrimp , he can only sell it for $ 2.50 a pound , down from at least $ 4 a pound before the oil spill . For many , that 's not worth the cost to go net them . Patti thinks the solution to getting the seafood industry back on normal footing is all about the nation 's memory . `` Memory is the worst thing right now . I think it 'll come back , '' says Patti . `` Will they do it this year ? Hopefully next year it will . '' FOX News covers the action from all the angles .

Kenneth Feinberg said more than a third of the roughly 104,000 applicants need to do more to back up their claims , and thousands of claims have no documentation at all . He added that the amount sought in some cases bears no resemblance to actual losses , such as a fisherman 's claim for $ 10 million `` on what was obviously a legitimate claim of a few thousand dollars . '' `` People can put down on a claims form all sorts of numbers , '' he said . At the same time , hundreds of claims that were initially denied have been accepted as Feinberg adjusts rules for compensation , such as whether people need to be physically close to the spill to get paid . `` At the beginning , it 's always rough , '' said Feinberg , an attorney who previously oversaw claims for 9\\/11 victims . `` Hopefully , by the end of this program , people will feel that the fund treated them fairly . '' Many claimants are still waiting for checks from the Gulf Coast Claims Facility , which is doling out BP 's money to oil spill victims . The Associated Press interviewed dozens who say they have received small fractions of the compensation they requested . Claims have been bogged down by the sheer volume of requests for money as livelihoods have crumbled since the April 20 rig explosion that killed 11 workers and spewed more than 200 million gallons of oil over about three months . `` We do n't have any business left , '' said Sheryl Lindsay , a beach wedding planner who filed a claim for about $ 240,000 for lost revenue from July through December because of cancellations . The check she received from the BP claims center was for just $ 7,700 . Lindsay said she recently learned that her claim will be reviewed for possible additional payments , but she needs money now . She closed her coastal Alabama office and said she will soon file for bankruptcy . Such complaints have `` not fallen on deaf ears , '' Feinberg said . In an interview last week , he promised that kinks would be worked out and more generous payments would come , but that it is taking time to sort the legitimate claims from the overstated and the fraudulent . `` We have scores of applications for financial aid that appear to be fraudulent , '' and are being reviewed for possible forwarding to the Justice Department for criminal investigation , Feinberg said . Some of the suspect claims have obvious discrepancies , while others appear to be multiple filings for the same loss , he said . `` Our resources are diverted , and we become skeptical and concerned , '' he added . `` Fraud always slows the process down . '' To date , the fund has paid out nearly $ 1 billion to about 50,000 claimants . Claims officials would not provide AP with the total amount actually requested by those claimants . A Feinberg spokeswoman said the number is `` irrelevant , '' given the volume of claims filed with problems . In the past week , the number of denied claims actually fell , from 528 to 118 , as checks were cut and mailed to businesses that were initially told they would get no help . Sales manager Jeff Silvers had been shocked to learn that his building supplies shop just a half mile from the Alabama coast was not considered to be affected by the oil that sullied beaches and marshes , sent tourists packing and kept fishing boats idle at harbors . Swift Supply , he said , lost a huge chunk of revenue because customers canceled plans to build docks , do home improvements and complete construction on new houses with the uncertainty that followed the explosion and oil gusher . But after he applied for compensation , he initially was told `` we were n't in the geographic area of the spill . '' Just last week , however , Silvers got a check for everything he asked for . He would not say how much he received . Feinberg has decided that proximity to affected areas will no longer play a role in compensation approval . `` I 'm very happy , '' Silvers said , `` but there 's still a lot of businesses that have n't been paid . '' Even the Justice Department has raised concern about the slow pace of payments . `` The Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill has disrupted the lives of thousands upon thousands of individuals , often cutting off the income on which they depend , '' the department said in a Sept. 17 letter to Feinberg . `` Many of these individuals and businesses simply do not have the resources to get by while they await processing . '' Feinberg , however , said many of the claims are simply too flawed to pay out . `` We have thousands of claims where there is no documentation , none , '' he said . Of the more than 104,000 claims filed as of Monday , more than 39,000 require additional documentation and remain on hold . Thousands of others remain under review . President Barack Obama tapped Feinberg to oversee the BP claims fund , which the oil giant created under government pressure to ensure that it paid those hurt by the spill . Feinberg declined to say how much he is being paid by BP , only that it is a flat fee `` totally unrelated '' to the size of the fund and amounts paid . A final settlement will be offered in the coming months , but to accept the money , applicants will have to give up the right to sue BP . The money being doled out now is considered only emergency help , but will be factored into the final payment offer . Fishing guide Mike Garey , who got just $ 21,000 in response to his request for $ 70,000 in losses , is n't sure what he 'll do . `` The phones are n't ringing . The e-mails are n't coming in , '' he said . `` Where will we be in a year from now ? Nobody knows the answer to that so how can we accept a final payment ?

AP Photo The White House is denying accusations that the administration prevented government scientists from informing the public of the worst-case scenario for the BP oil spill . White House chief spokesman Robert Gibbs said Thursday the administration never tried to withhold `` the most accurate and timely information '' on the amount of oil spilling into the Gulf of Mexico as soon as it became available . `` Look , I think it is important to understand that our response attacked the oil spill in an unprecedented way , '' he said . `` It was the largest environmental disaster that we have ever faced . And we attacked it with the largest federal response . `` We did all that was humanly possible in the most challenging of environments . '' The national oil spill commission said in documents released Wednesday that the Obama administration kept scientists from being frank with the public and committed other missteps that raised questions about its competence and candor in the wake of the April 20 accident . President Obama created the commission to investigate the BP spill . Among other things , the report says , the administration made erroneous early estimates of the spill 's size , and Obama 's senior energy adviser went on national TV and mischaracterized a government analysis by saying it showed most of the oil was `` gone . '' The analysis actually said it could still be there . The administration has disputed the commission findings , saying senior government officials `` were clear with the public what the worst-case flow rate could be . '' The report , citing interviews with government officials , reveals that in late April or early May , the White House budget office denied a request from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to make public its worst-case estimate of how much oil could spew from the blown-out well . The Unified Command -- the government team in charge of the spill response -- also was discussing the possibility of making the numbers public , the report says . But Kenneth Baer , a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget , said the budget office had concerns about the reliability of the NOAA estimates . `` The issue was the modeling , the science and the assumptions they were using to come up with their analysis . Not public relations or presentation , '' he said . `` We offered NOAA suggestions of ways to improve their analysis , and they happily accepted it . '' The explosion in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 workers , spewed 206 million gallons of oil from the damaged oil well , and sank the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig . BP 's drilling permit for the well originally estimated the worst-case scenario to be a leak of 6.8 million gallons per day . In late April , just after the spill began , the Coast Guard and NOAA received an updated worst-case estimate of 2.7 million to 4.6 million gallons per day . While those figures were used as the basis for the government 's response to the spill -- they appeared on an internal Coast Guard situation report and on a dry-erase board in NOAA 's Seattle war room -- they were never announced to the public , according to the report . For more than a month after the explosion , government officials were telling the public that the well was releasing 210,000 gallons per day . In early August , in its final estimate of the spill 's flow , the government said it was gushing 2.6 million gallons per day -- close to the worst-case predictions . The documents also criticize Carol Browner , director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy , saying that during a series of morning-show appearances on Aug. 4 , she misrepresented the findings of a federal analysis of where the oil went and incorrectly portrayed it as a scientific assessment that was peer-reviewed by inside and outside experts . `` I think it 's also important to note that our scientists have done an initial assessment , and more than three-quarters of the oil is gone , '' Browner said on NBC 's `` Today '' show . But the analysis never said it was gone , according to the commission . It said it was dispersed , dissolved or evaporated -- meaning it could still be there . And while NOAA administrator Jane Lubchenco was more cautious in her remarks at a news conference at the White House later that day , the commission staff accuses the two senior officials of contributing to the perception that the government 's findings were more exact than they actually were . Gibbs said he believes the administration was `` abundantly clear '' that day about what the oil budget represented . `` It represented the fact that there was very good news , that oil had biodegraded , that oil had been skimmed , that oil had been burned , '' he said . `` That the very worst-case scenarios that many people thought we would be dealing with never came to fruition largely because of that federal response .

Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announced a lifting of the moratorium on Tuesday after reviewing progress of safety reforms , availability of spill response resources , improved blowout containment capabilities and a report by Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation , and Enforcement -LRB- BOEM -RRB- Director Michael R. Bromwich . Bromwich is head of the office that succeeded the Minerals Management Agency blamed with not doing enough inspections on oil platforms like the Deepwater Horizon rig that exploded on April 20 and created the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history . `` In light of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill , we must continue to take a cautious approach when it comes to deepwater drilling and remain aggressive in raising the bar for the oil and gas industry 's safety and environmental practices , '' said Salazar , who announced the moratorium on July 12 . `` The oil and gas industry will be operating under tighter rules , stronger oversight , and in a regulatory environment that will remain dynamic as we continue to build on the reforms we have already implemented , '' he said . Even though the ban is being lifted immediately , it will likely take a couple weeks for new permitting to be approved . In addition to new safety rules , the BOEM will conduct inspections and require certifications from oil rig operators about operator compliance as well as mechanisms to contain failures of the blowout preventers -LRB- BOPs -RRB- designed to shut down a well that has an accident . The removal of the ban also does not mean that U.S. companies will operate at the pace and levels they did before the accident 40 miles off the coast of Louisiana . A de facto moratorium has also been in place on shallow-water drilling , with only four permits for such work approved by the federal government since the explosion , as contrasted with an average of 14 such permits having been approved per month for the 11 months that led up to the explosion . This slow-walking approach to drilling has been blamed for uncertainty in not only the drilling industry but other industries where the current regulatory and recession-era climate has made it difficult to hire or plan for the future . Sen. David Vitter , R-La . , called on Salazar to expedite distribution of drilling permits , saying a new study by Southern Methodist University shows that the slowdown in new shallow-water permits has placed nearly 40,000 jobs in jeopardy . `` I guess this is movement in the right direction , but it 's painfully slow . It 's clear that President Obama is going to preside over a continuing de facto moratorium for months or years , with new drilling held back to a fraction of previous levels . I 'll keep fighting until real drilling happens and jobs are actually created , '' Vitter said . Sen. Mary L. Landrieu , D-La . , agreed with Vitter in spirit , adding that she is not going to remove a hold she put on Jacob Lew , President Obama 's nominee to be director of the Office of Management and Budget , whom Landrieu is preventing from joining the administration until the Gulf of Mexico oil industry is back to work . `` I will take this time to look closely at how BOEM is handling the issuing of permits and whether or not drilling activity in both shallow and deep water is resuming . When Congress reconvenes for the lame-duck session next month , I will have had several weeks to evaluate if today 's lifting of the moratorium is actually putting people back to work , '' she said . Nonetheless , supporters of the moratorium and the additional rules said they were pleased with the outcome but wanted additional authority for an independent commission to question BP about the spill . `` Because there was a suspension of belief on the part of the oil industry that an accident like this could ever happen , a suspension of drilling was necessary to bring those companies back to reality , '' said House Environment and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Ed Markey , D-Mass . `` Much more is left to be done in the wake of the BP spill . Senate Republicans continue to block subpoena power for the independent commission investigating the spill , and the Senate has still yet to take up the spill safety legislation that the House approved last summer , '' he added . White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said that the new rules are not aimed at chasing away companies from future business nor were politics a consideration . He expressed disappointment that Landrieu is holding up Lew 's nomination in the aftermath of the accident . `` Our feeling is that the nomination is n't connected to the moratorium . He did n't have any connection to issuing -LRB- the moratorium -RRB- , '' Gibbs said . `` I hope that as we work through this process the senator will judge Jack Lew on the merits of being a director , not on politics .

Dolphin tissue samples and dead sea turtles are kept in locked freezers . Field notebooks are collected and secured . Scientists examining dead animals that were discovered along the Gulf Coast in the wake of the BP oil spill are observing strict laboratory protocols , knowing everything they touch could become evidence in what may prove to be the biggest environmental case in U.S. history . Like detectives on a murder case , government scientists -- and outside experts under contract to the government -- are using CSI-style techniques to determine whether the oil is to blame for the wildlife deaths . The U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether those responsible for the spill violated environmental laws that carry civil and sometimes criminal penalties , and the scientists are taking extraordinary steps to make sure their findings hold up in court . `` What we want to do is to make sure that the findings and the results we get are n't called into question in court based on chain of custody or other legal issues , '' said Dr. Michael Ziccardi , a veterinarian . `` We 're treating oiled wildlife response like a crime scene . '' Justice Department spokeswoman Hannah August declined to comment on the investigation . Attorney General Eric Holder said in June that the government will prosecute violations of such laws as the Clean Water Act , the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Endangered Species Act . The number of dead creatures will help determine the fines and penalties levied against BP and other companies involved . Wildlife deaths will also figure into the government 's assessment of the spill 's damage to the Gulf 's natural resources . That accounting could take years and will be used to bill BP and the other companies for the cost of restoring the environment . By some estimates , they could be forced to pay billions of dollars -- more , perhaps , than the penalties associated with the Exxon Valdez disaster . Exxon was hit with a record criminal fine of $ 150 million for the 1989 tanker spill in Alaska but ultimately paid $ 125 million in penalties . It also agreed to pay $ 900 million to settle federal and state civil claims . The spill of nearly 11 million gallons was the largest in U.S. history until it was eclipsed by the Gulf gusher that spewed some 206 million gallons from the blown-out BP well over three months . BP spokesman Robert Wine noted the oil company set aside $ 32.2 billion during the second quarter to cover the long-term cost of the spill . Since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers and triggering the spill , authorities have found thousands of dead animals . But animals die every year in the Gulf from a variety of factors , including fishing , hurricanes , low oxygen levels and disease . And the vast majority of the hundreds of dead dolphins and sea turtles have had no visible signs of oil , so scientists have been forced to look more deeply . `` Is there damage to the eyes , to the skin ? Are there lesions in the stomach or in the lungs , which can occur during oil exposure . Is there microscopic damage to the liver , the kidney ? '' said Ziccardi , who directs the Oiled Wildlife Care Network at the University of California at Davis . The results of the laboratory tests are still being compiled . The dead animals are being kept at universities and public and private research centers across the Gulf Coast . Carcasses are taken from the freezer , thawed , photographed and examined internally and externally . Anyone who handles one of the carcasses must sign a log sheet that is used to keep track of when remains are removed and when are they put back . The notebooks in which scientists recorded when and where they found a particular animal are regarded as vital evidence , too .

AP\\/Discovre Team 2010 ON THE FLOOR OF THE GULF OF MEXICO -- Just 20 miles north of where BP 's blown-out well spewed millions of gallons of oil into the sea , life appears bountiful despite initial fears that crude could have wiped out many of these delicate deepwater habitats . Plankton , tiny suspended particles that form the base of the ocean 's food web , float en masse 1,400 feet beneath the surface of the Gulf of Mexico , forming a snowy-like underwater scene as they move with the currents outside the windows of a two-man sub creeping a few feet off the seafloor . Crabs , starfish and other deep sea creatures swarm small patches of corals , and tiny sea anemones sprout from the sand like miniature forests across a lunar-like landscape illuminated only by the lights of the sub , otherwise living in a deep , dark environment far from the sun 's reach . Scientists are currently in the early stages of studying what effects , if any , BP PLC 's April 20 oil well blowout off Louisiana and the ensuing crude gusher has had on the delicate deep sea coral habitats of the northern Gulf . So far , it appears the area dodged a bullet , but more research is needed . Some of the deep sea corals near the spill site were only discovered just last year . `` Originally , when we saw the trajectory for the oil spill and where it was going , we were very concerned that these habitats would be impacted , '' said researcher Steve Ross of the Center for Marine Science at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington . Ross and others are conducting research from a Greenpeace ship in the Gulf , using a two-man sub as they work to determine if the corals have suffered damage , or may take a hit from long-term impacts , such as stunted reproduction rates . `` We thought certainly that ... we would see signs of damage , '' Ross said . `` And we 're very pleased to say so far , that in these locations , we have n't seen a large scale damage to the coral habitats . We 're still looking , but so far , it 's good . '' Ross was part of a team of researchers that studied deep sea corals in the Atlantic Ocean between North Carolina and Florida . The research eventually helped lead to added federal protections for a roughly 23,000 square-mile network believed to be among the largest continuous distribution of deep water corals in the world . Ross and others have now turned their attention to the Gulf . While fishermen have for centuries dragged up corals from the deep sea , it was n't until the early 1900s that scientists discovered these extensive cold-water reefs . And it was n't until the 1970s that researchers were able to use subs and cameras to reach the sea floor to document them . It had long been thought coral reefs only formed in shallow , warm waters . Deepwater reefs and pinnacles are much more slow-growing and can take several million years to form . Science is only now beginning to understand these underwater `` frontier zones . '' Researchers are looking to these regions for the development of additional pharmaceuticals since these cold-water critters have adapted to live in such unique environments void of sunlight , they possess unusual qualities that federal scientists say could aid in creating new drugs for cancer , heart disease and other ailments . `` We are very interested in any potential damage to deep sea corals , '' said Steve Murawski , chief fisheries scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , which is currently conducting research into oil in Gulf sediments , among other studies . The federal government maintains much of the oil is now gone from the Gulf , but some studies indicate it remains in significant amounts on the sea floor . Microscopic particles have also been found in the water column . It is now a prime time for coral spawning in the Gulf , when the corals release tiny larvae that eventually form new corals . `` It could alter the reproduction of these animals , '' Murawski said . `` Even though the adults may survive the event , did we lose the opportunity to have more juveniles produced ? '' Sandra Brooke , coral conservation director at the Marine Conservation Biology Institute , who is also participating in the research , agreed . The corals ' reproduction rates will be studied over the coming weeks , she said . `` We have to be careful with our conclusions about this kind of data , '' Brooke said , noting it will take more than just a few dives to determine the extent of the damage . `` We 'll take further analysis but from what we 've seen so far , it seems like they 've dodged a bullet . '' Long-term impacts , for instance , from 1989 's much smaller Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska took years , even decades to understand . `` We 're just going to have to continue watching , '' said Margot Stiles , a marine scientist with the conservation group Oceana .

Reuters Aug. 3 : In this image taken from video provided by BP PLC , the new 75-ton cap sits atop the site of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . AP WASHINGTON -- Tests performed before the deadly blowout of BP 's oil well in the Gulf of Mexico should have raised doubts about the cement used to seal the well , but the company and its cementing contractor used it anyway , investigators with the president 's oil spill commission said Thursday . It 's the first finding from the commission looking into the causes of the April 20 explosion that killed 11 workers and led to the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history . And it appears to conflict with statements made by Halliburton Co. , which has said its tests showed the cement mix was stable . The company , which has blamed BP 's well design and operational decisions for the disaster , acknowledged in a six-page statement released late Thursday that it never tested the final mixture of cement for stability after BP made a last-minute change to the mix . The cement mix 's failure to prevent oil and gas from entering the well has been identified by BP and others as one of the causes of the accident . BP and Halliburton decided to use a foam slurry created by injecting nitrogen into cement to secure the bottom of the well , a decision outside experts have criticized . The panel said that of four tests done in February and April by Halliburton , only one -- the last -- showed the mix would hold . But the results of that single successful test were not shared with BP , and may not have reached Halliburton , before the cement was pumped , according to a letter sent to commissioners Thursday by chief investigative counsel Fred H. Bartlit Jr. . Halliburton said Thursday that that successful test was performed on a mixture different than the one eventually used . While some tests were conducted on the new formulation requested by BP , those tests did not include a foam stability test , the company said . According to the panel , BP at the time of the blowout had in hand results from only one of the tests -- a February analysis sent to BP by Halliburton in a March 8 e-mail that indicated the cement could fail . The slurry tested in that case was a slightly different blend , and assumed a slightly different well design , but there is no indication that Halliburton flagged the problem for BP , or that BP had concerns , the letter said . `` Halliburton -LRB- and perhaps BP -RRB- should have considered redesigning the foam slurry before pumping it at the Macondo well , '' Bartlit wrote . Independent tests conducted for the commission by Chevron on a nearly identical mixture were also released Thursday . The results concluded that the cement mix was unstable , raising questions about the validity of Halliburton 's test showing that the near-final mixture was stable . The company said the `` significant differences '' between its internal tests and the commission 's were caused by the use of different materials . BP , as part of its internal investigation , also conducted independent tests that showed the cement mix was flawed , but its analysis too was criticized by Halliburton , which said it was not the correct formula . BP 's report also mentioned a cement test Halliburton performed in mid-April , but it appears BP obtained the results after the accident and considered its methods flawed . By contrast , the commission obtained proprietary additives from Halliburton as well as a recipe to re-create the slurry that was used on the well . One and a half gallons of the actual mix used on the rig remain , but it is being held as evidence in criminal and civil investigations . Halliburton rejected the commission 's claims that the February tests were conducted on a cement that was similar to the one used . `` Contrary to the letter ... the slurry tested in February was not ' a very similar foam slurry design to the one actually pumped , '' ' the statement reads . The company also says there were significant differences in how the cement was tested . Halliburton shares dropped from near $ 34 to below $ 30 in New York trading in the half hour after the commission released its finding . The shares recovered a bit , and closed at $ 31.68 , down $ 2.74 , or 8 percent . BP shares rose from $ 40.38 to $ 41.28 , then quickly reversed course and fell to $ 40.28 . The shares finished trading with a gain of 49 cents at $ 40.59 . The independent investigators do not address other decisions that could have contributed to the cement 's failure and the eventual blowout , such as BP 's decision to use fewer centralizers than recommended by Halliburton . Centralizers make sure the well 's piping is centered inside the well so the cement bonds correctly . BP has also been criticized for not performing a cement bond long , a test that checks after the cement is pumped down whether it is secure . There are also questions about whether BP pumped down enough cement to seal off the bottom of the well , which was located more than three miles below sea level .

The BP payments go to a number of lawyers working on the claims process and are not necessarily exorbitant given the workload . But Gulf coast residents who have been demanding transparency in the claims process have been eager to know how much Feinberg is earning , For some , the revelation of significant fees from BP are undermining Feinberg 's claims that he is operating independently of the oil giant . `` There 's no doubt in my mind that he 's working for BP , '' said Louisiana shrimp processor Dean Blanchard . `` He can say he 's independent , but he 's working for BP and he 's low-balling all of us , the people affected the most . '' BP PLC agreed to pay Kenneth Feinberg 's firm , Feinberg Rozen LLP , $ 850,000 a month starting in mid-June , according to the Gulf Coast Claims Facility , which has been set up to compensate fishermen , business owners , residents and other Gulf Coast victims of the April 20 well blowout that killed 11 rig workers and spewed more than 170 million gallons of oil into the sea . The claims facility on Thursday told The Associated Press the bill for the firm 's services is now up to about $ 3.35 million , and Feinberg 's firm will continue to receive $ 850,000 a month from BP through the end of the year , after which the contract will be reviewed . Claims spokeswoman Amy Weiss declined comment on the payment details , referring AP to an Oct. 8 report from former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey , whose own firm , Debevoise & Plimpton LLP , was hired by Feinberg 's office to review the deal . `` The firm 's work on the -LRB- Gulf Coast Claims Facility -RRB- is largely unprecedented , '' Mukasey wrote in his report . `` The assignment is to allocate the largest claims fund in American history and to do so under both intense time pressure and public scrutiny . '' Mukasey wrote that the fees being charged to BP by Feinberg 's firm are warranted given the enormous task . `` The engagement commands a substantial commitment of the firm 's personnel and resources , '' he wrote . As of Nov. 3 , the claims fund had paid victims about $ 1.7 billion , though many across the coast are still awaiting checks or say they have been paid too little and are struggling to keep up with bills after a summer of lost revenue . The facility has received about 337,000 claims for compensation . About 97,000 have been paid or approved for payment . Another 97,000 claimants have filed requests for money but have provided no documentation to back up their losses , according to Feinberg . The claims fund is denying many of those filings outright . To date , about 32,000 claimants have been denied . Victims have until Nov. 23 to file for emergency payments to help keep them afloat . After that , they must submit a claim for a final settlement from BP . By doing that , they must give up their right to ever sue BP . President Barack Obama tapped Feinberg , who previously oversaw money doled out to 9\\/11 victims , to run the BP claims fund , which the London-based company created under government pressure to ensure that it paid those hurt by the spill . Feinberg is paid by BP , but he insists he is operating the fund independently and remains an advocate for Gulf Coast residents and is n't influenced at all by the oil giant in the process . The claims facility said Thursday the firm 's fees are being paid directly by BP and are not coming from the compensation fund . The program declined to say how much Feinberg is making personally , just that the fee is being paid to his firm . Feinberg took over the claims process from BP in August .

Scientists recently discovered certain elements from the remains of the spill moved exceptionally quickly through the area 's ecosystem . AP WASHINGTON -- Scientists say they have for the first time tracked how certain nontoxic elements of oil from the BP spill quickly became dinner for plankton , entering the food web in the Gulf of Mexico . The new study sheds light on two key questions about the aftermath of the 172 million-gallon spill in April : What happened to the oil that once covered the water 's surface and will it work its way into the diets of Gulf marine life ? `` Everybody is making a huge deal of where did the oil go , '' said chief study author William `` Monty '' Graham , a plankton expert at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab in Alabama . `` It just became food . '' The study did n't specifically track the toxic components of the oil that has people worried . It focused on the way the basic element carbon moved through the beginnings of the all-important food web . Graham said the `` eye-opening '' speed of how the oil components moved through the ecosystem may affect the overall health of the Gulf . Michael Crosby of the Mote Marine Laboratory in Florida did n't take part in the study but said what fascinated him was that the carbon zipped through the food web faster than scientists expected . That in itself is n't alarming , but if the nontoxic part of the oil is moving so rapidly through the food web , Crosby asks : `` What has happened to the toxic compounds of the released oil ? '' Graham said it was too hard to study the toxins in tiny plankton , which are plant and animal life , usually microscopic . So he had to go with an indicator that 's easier to track : the ratio of different types of carbon in microbes and plankton around and even under the BP oil slick . That important ratio jumped 20 percent , showing oil in the food web . By late September the carbon ratios in microscopic life had returned to normal , Graham said . Graham emphasized that the results of his research do n't mean the plankton , the fish that feed on it or the people who eat Gulf seafood are at any risk . What he found , he said , is merely a biomarker that shows the movement of spill-related carbon through the food chain . Much of the plankton he studied was `` swimming around and doing great '' and in equal or higher numbers than before the spill , he said . Graham 's study , released Monday , is published in Environmental Research Letters . It was mostly funded by the National Science Foundation , with additional money from the state of Alabama and BP 's Gulf Research Initiative , which distributed money through the Northern Gulf Institute in Mississippi . For Graham it 's noteworthy how voracious the oil-munching bacteria were : `` The microbes came to the rescue . '' After they snacked on the surface oil , other microscopic sea life ate the microbes and were , in turn , chomped on by zooplankton , tiny animals . Larry McKinney , director of a Gulf research institute at Texas A&M University in Corpus Christi , said the study confirms what scientists had expected . The big question is will it affect eggs and larvae and next year 's production of shrimp , crabs and fish , McKinney said .

AP ORANGE BEACH , Ala. -- What 's typically a beautiful , quiet stretch of beach in the fall now resembles a construction site . Bulldozers and yellow dump trucks shake the ground ; a giant sifting machine spits clean sand out one end , tar balls out another . With its Macondo well dead and few visitors on the coast during the offseason , BP has launched its biggest push yet to deep-clean the tourist beaches that were coated with crude during the worst of the Gulf oil spill . Machines are digging down into the sand to remove buried tar mats left from the Deepwater Horizon disaster . The work is getting mixed reviews . Many are anxious to see the beaches cleaned as quickly as possible by whatever means are available . Others say BP may be making matters worse by bringing heavy equipment onto beaches and spreading the petroleum stain . Some fear fresh environmental damage from the work itself , which can kill tiny creatures that live in the sand . Even BP acknowledges that fresh tar balls are still hitting the coast , meaning some of the work might be premature . Still , local officials have given the company a Jan. 1 deadline to be done . The project began last month on Perdido Key at the Alabama-Florida line , and crews with sifting machines large and small are spreading out to the east and west . On a sunny day in mid-November , ground zero is the wide stretch of sand between the Gulf 's crystal water and the Silver Beach condos in Orange Beach . That 's where Sue Rose has her ground-floor unit , and she was happy to see heavy machinery loading sand into a boxlike sifter just outside her door . The machine strains tons of dirty sand at a time through fine screens , and trucks then dump the cleaned sand back on to the beach . The refuse is taken to landfills . `` It 's wonderful , '' said Rose , of Erlanger , Ky. `` Hopefully we 're going to get our clean beach back . '' A few miles away at Perdido Key , Fla. , longtime resident Terry Hanners has his doubts . He sees what appears to be an ever-expanding oil stain on the beach and fears the once-white sand will remain its current brownish tint , which is close to the color of weak tea . `` They 're just spreading it , '' said Hanners . `` We have a stain that 's going to stay with us a while . '' An April 20 rig explosion killed 11 workers and led to more than 200 million gallons of oil spewing from BP 's undersea well . Seven months later , BP has settled on a multi-pronged cleaning approach at the urging of local leaders who fear a collapse of the region 's tourist economy if all remnants of oil are n't gone from the beaches before tourists begin arriving in large numbers again next spring . Thousands of workers roamed the coast with shovels and plastic bags all summer , picking up as much oil as they could as it washed in . There was no way to get all of it , though , and waves and tidal action soon buried large patches of tar and crude on beaches . Faced with pressure to remove all the oil , BP sent assessment teams to beaches with augers to look for buried oil . Spots were marked and catalogued , and contractors worked with government officials on a plan for attacking the oil under the surface even as smaller amounts of oil continue to wash in . Today , machines resembling agricultural harvesters move slowly along the beach digging about 18 inches below the surface in search of buried oil . Sand is lifted by a conveyor system and dumped onto screens ; clean sand is expelled from the contraption , called a Sand Shark , while rust-colored tar balls , broken shells and other trash collect in a bin . Workers are using a much larger cleaning system called a Powerscreen to scrub broader areas of beach . Dozers pile up sand , which a big machine with a bucket dumps into the sifter . Cleaned sand is ejected by one belt while tar and other material goes another way . Workers have dug down about 30 inches so far to find oil , and officials say the dozers can dig as deep as needed to get the worst of the oil deposits . Different , gentler cleaning methods will be used in more delicate areas like Mississippi 's coastal islands and the marshlands of Louisiana , the company says . BP spokesman Ray Melick says the major work should be done by mid-February , before the weather turns warm and visitors begin heading back . Natural processes should finish cleaning tourist areas once the big machines have dug up all the oil they can . `` I think we 'll get 99 percent of what 's out there . There may be some little BB-sized tar balls that get left , but over time nature will take care of that on its own and it will just sort of dissolve back into the surface , '' he said . Looking to speed up nature , the company also is pumping salt water on to the beach in some areas in an attempt to rinse away the oil residue and speed up the bleaching process , he said . The work has raised concern among environmentalists who fear the heavy machinery will kill creatures that live on the beach or cause erosion problems as the natural lay of the land is disturbed . Marine scientist George Crozier says the work is doing some damage , like killing small ghost crabs that live in the dry sand . `` Certainly there 's going to be a lot of impact , but I do n't know if it 's going to be significant impact , '' said Crozier , the longtime head of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab . He favors letting the buried oil remain where it is : buried . Tony Kennon is worried about a different type of impact -- the loss of tourist dollars if there 's another oil-stained season in Orange Beach , where he serves as mayor . People do n't like the idea of an oily beach , even if they ca n't see the pollution , he said , and a hurricane could easily expose buried oil deposits , creating a new wave of concern . Business was off about 50 percent this year because the spill scared away tourists , and Kennon says the town 's economy could n't take another blow like that . Kennon has given BP a deadline of New Year 's Day to finish the deep-cleaning work on Orange Beach 's nine miles of coast . `` If they want me to sign off on it , it 's going to have to be white and squeaky clean , '' said Kennon . `` We sell ourselves on sugar-white beaches . If we do n't have that at the end of all this , we need compensation .

NASA Goddard The administrator for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill compensation fund is pledging more transparency as the deadline nears for short-term claims by those looking to get a cut of a $ 20 billion fund set aside by oil giant BP for damages caused by the massive spill that devastated the region over the spring and summer . Wednesday is the deadline for individuals seeking restitution . Kenneth Feinberg , who has paid out about $ 2 billion so far to 125,000 claimants , said he 's working as quickly as he can to respond to claims . But that has n't stopped the Department of Justice and one Republican senator from criticizing Feinberg for moving too slowly and not allowing enough transparency into the compensation process . Sen. Richard Shelby , R-Ala . , who met with Feinberg Friday , said the claim fund is not moving `` with appropriate urgency '' and people are n't getting the payments they deserve . `` Businesses along the Gulf Coast are not only trying to survive now but also prepare for the next tourist season , which is quickly approaching , '' Shelby said . `` These victims deserve a fair opportunity to appeal inadequate payments , particularly in light of the lack of transparency , clarity , and consistency in the payment process . '' Associate Attorney General Thomas Perrelli wrote Feinberg on Friday to ask him to expedite the process , which the Justice Department has complained is forcing individuals to wait for payment without the means to support themselves . `` While you have indicated that poor documentation has made it difficult to address some claims quickly , over the past two weeks the number of claims requiring additional documentation has actually gone down -- while the number of claims under review has increased significantly , '' Perrelli wrote to Feinberg . In a statement to Fox News , Feinberg , whose company is earning $ 850,000 a month to administer the claims , said he 's responding to the government 's complaints . `` I think it 's always wise to listen carefully to constructive criticism from the Department of Justice , '' Feinberg said . `` They want me to improve transparency , and I plan to do so . '' Feinberg said he estimates that about $ 6 billion of the fund will be spent , including government and cleanup claims , allowing BP to reclaim the remainder once all the settlements are paid out by August 2013 . He added that the fund is doing the best it can given the more than 400,000 claims filed so far . Of those paid out , 80 percent have received full compensation . But another 147,000 are clogging up the process because they have little or no documentation to support losses , Feinberg said , noting dozens are under review for potential fraud . About 60,000 claims have already been denied payment , and nearly 72,000 remain under review . Those companies and individuals who receive a pay-out from BP will forfeit their right to sue the company over the oil spill that lasted more than 100 days after an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig on April 22 . Eleven rig workers died and about 5 million barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico scaring away tourists from beaches and freezing the fishing industry . But victims are n't bereft of alternatives if they file now and have to wait for compensation . The fund is open for three years , and victims can receive interim payments by submitting for accumulating damages every three months during the application process . That also allows them the option to back out and sue BP . Shelby said that decision arose from a pledge by Feinberg to address concerns . `` Any business that believes it was treated unfairly will now be able to file for an interim payment every three months for the next three years . ... I appreciate Mr. Feinberg 's pledge , but I will be monitoring the situation closely to see that it is fulfilled , '' he said . On the flip side , those who decide to wait out the process may find that a gamble since the Gulf recovery could limit their options for claiming losses . `` If they decide a year from now , I 'll take the final payment , they 're going to have to show prospective damage , '' Feinberg said in a recent interview with The Associated Press . `` But my offer may not be available to them a year from now if everything is back to normal . '' Many business owners , particularly ones with larger claims , say they feel Feinberg is shortchanging them or keeping their claims under review to force them into accepting the final settlement offer because they 'll be so far behind on bills , they 'll have no choice . `` If he keeps everybody hungry , they 're going to have to take any kind of settlement , '' said Keath Ladner , a Mississippi seafood processing company owner who employs about 70 boats . His company has been at a standstill since April 20 and claims to be out $ 1.7 million . `` We 'll have to take whatever he offers . '' Feinberg , who also oversaw the $ 7 billion government fund for families of victims of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , said larger business claims are taking longer because they 're more complicated .

AP WASHINGTON -- In a reversal , the Obama administration said Wednesday it will not pursue offshore drilling off the East Coast of the U.S. and the eastern Gulf of Mexico . A senior administration official told The Associated Press on Wednesday that because of the BP oil spill , the Interior Department will not propose any new oil drilling in waters off the East Coast for at least the next seven years . President Obama 's earlier plan -- announced in March , three weeks before the April BP spill -- would have authorized officials to explore potential for drilling from Delaware to central Florida , plus the northern waters of Alaska . The new plan allows drilling in Alaska , but officials said they will move cautiously before approving any leases . Interior Secretary Ken Salazar planned to discuss details of the decision later Wednesday . The eastern Gulf -- an area stretching from 125 to 300 miles off Florida 's coast -- was singled out for protection by Congress in 2006 as part of a deal with Florida lawmakers that made available 8.3 million acres to oil and gas development in the east-central Gulf . Under that agreement , the protected region is to remain off limits to energy development until 2022 . But the administration had entertained the idea of expanded drilling , until the BP spill that spewed an estimated 172 million gallons of oil into the Gulf . In order to open more of the eastern Gulf to drilling , the administration would have to ask Congress to lift the drilling moratorium . The new plan does not affect the Pacific seaboard , which will remain off-limits to drilling in federal waters . Officials for the major oil drillers and firms that service the industry did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press . The decision to abandon offshore drilling along the East Coast follows questions raised by the president 's oil spill commission as to why top-level administration officials were not consulted before the drilling expansion was announced in March . At the time , Obama said he did not make the decision lightly and had looked at it closely for more than a year with Salazar and other administration officials . But in August , White House Council on Environmental Quality chairwoman Nancy Sutley and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief Jane Lubchenco told the commission that they were not directly involved in the decision . Florida has long banned drilling in its state-controlled waters -- those immediately off its shores , before federal jurisdiction takes over farther out -- because of fears that a spill would damage its beaches , the state 's biggest tourism draw . But even state lawmakers , including Gov. Charlie Crist , were considering opening those waters to drilling before the spill . On Wednesday , Crist called the decision `` wonderful news . '' `` That 's news that will be very favorably received by the tourist industry throughout the state , but also by the people , '' Crist said . He also said he 's not surprised that the BP spill would make the administration take another look at its management plan , considering it was one of the country 's largest environmental disasters . `` If that 's not a wake-up call , I do n't know what would be , '' Crist said . `` If that does n't have an impact on your thinking , you must not be thinking . '' Sen. Bill Nelson , D-Fla . , who has long fought for drilling bans off Florida 's Gulf coast , praised Obama for `` listening to the people of Florida .

BP 's lawyers are arguing that the government overstated the spill by 20 to 50 percent , staffers working for the presidential oil spill commission said Friday . In a 10-page document obtained by The Associated Press , BP says the government 's spill estimate of 206 million gallons is `` overstated by a significant amount '' and the company said any consensus around that number is premature and inaccurate . The company submitted the document to the commission , the Justice Department and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . `` They rely on incomplete or inaccurate information , rest in large part on assumptions that have not been validated , and are subject to far greater uncertainties than have been acknowledged , '' BP wrote . `` BP fully intends to present its own estimate as soon as the information is available to get the science right . '' In a statement Friday , the company said the government 's estimates failed to account for equipment that could obstruct the flow of oil and gas , such as the blowout preventer , making its numbers `` highly unreliable . '' BP 's request could save it as much as $ 10.5 billion or as little as $ 1.1 billion , depending on factors such as whether the government concludes that BP acted negligently . For context , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 's entire federal budget for 2010 was $ 10.3 billion . President Barack Obama has said he wants Congress to set aside some of the money BP pays for fines for the Gulf 's coastal restoration . Louisiana lawmakers are pushing legislation that would require at least 80 percent of the civil and criminal penalties charged to BP , and possibly other companies , to be returned to the Gulf Coast . William K. Reilly , co-chairman of the presidential commission , expressed amazement at BP 's case Friday . Reilly headed the Environmental Protection Agency under President George H.W. Bush . `` They are going to argue that it is 50 percent less '' than the government 's total ? Under the Clean Water Act , the oil giant -- which owned and operated the well -- faces fines of up to $ 1,100 for each barrel of oil spilled . If BP were found to have committed gross negligence or willful misconduct , the fine could be up to $ 4,300 per barrel . That means that based on the government 's estimate of 206 million gallons , BP could face civil fines alone of between $ 5.4 billion and $ 21.1 billion . `` They are going to argue it was less , '' said Priya Aiyar , the commission 's deputy chief counsel . `` BP has not offered its own numbers yet , but BP has told us that it thinks the government 's numbers are too high and thinks the actual flow rate can be actually 20 to 50 percent lower . '' Rep. Edward J. Markey , D-Mass . , a member of the House energy panel that is investigating the spill , said in a statement Friday to the AP that BP has done whatever it could to avoid revealing the true flow rate of the spill . `` With billions of dollars at stake , it is no surprise that they are now litigating the very numbers which they sought to impede , '' Markey said . `` The government engaged independent scientists and multiple techniques to arrive at their estimate . Additional independent peer-reviewed studies have corroborated their estimate . BP has a high bar to meet to overturn this estimate . '' BP 's argument could be bolstered by the federal government 's missteps in coming up with a final estimate for the spill 's volume . The Obama administration has offered nearly 10 estimates of how much oil flowed from the BP well , coming up with a refined conclusion late last month of 206 million gallons , which is likely its last . Internal documents released late Friday under the Freedom of Information Act show that the White House was intimately involved in deciding how scientific information was portrayed to the public , particularly when it came to the August 4 release of a document that showed where the spilled oil had gone . The five-page report , which was touted by Carol Browner , the president 's energy adviser , on morning talk shows and at White House press briefing showed that half the oil was gone -- either from evaporation , burning , skimming or recovery at the well head . The 3,500 pages of documents reveal that the administration wanted the oil budget to show its efforts to respond to the disaster were working , despite objections from top EPA officials , including Administrator Lisa Jackson , over how some of the data was presented . An earlier version of the press release issued with the paper said that 33 percent of the oil released was captured or mitigated by recovery efforts . A final version , changed hours before its release , said `` the vast majority '' of the spilled oil was addressed by recovery efforts or had naturally dispersed or evaporated . That morning , Browner appeared on national television saying that an initial assessment by federal scientists showed `` more than three-quarters of the oil is gone . '' In an e-mail sent later that morning addressed to Browner 's assistant , Heather Zichal , NOAA chief Jane Lubchenco finds fault with the White House 's interpretation of the report 's numbers and attribution of the report solely to NOAA . The report was drafted by several agencies . `` I 'm concerned to hear the oil budget report is being portrayed as saying that 75 percent of the oil is gone and that this is a NOAA report , '' Lubchenco writes . `` Please help make sure that both errors are corrected . '' The White House acknowledged Browner had misspoke .

The Justice Department sued BP and eight other companies on Dec. 15 in the Gulf oil spill disaster in an effort to recover billions of dollars from the largest offshore spill in U.S. history . AP WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department on Wednesday sued BP Exploration and Production Inc. and eight other companies in the Gulf oil spill disaster in an effort to recover billions of dollars from the largest offshore spill in U.S. history . The Obama administration 's lawsuit asks that the companies be held liable without limitation under the Oil Pollution Act for all removal costs and damages caused by the oil spill , including damages to natural resources . The lawsuit also seeks civil penalties under the Clean Water Act . An explosion that killed 11 workers at BP 's Macondo well last April led to oil spewing from the company 's undersea well -- more than 200 million gallons -LRB- 757 million liters -RRB- in all by the government 's estimate . BP disputes the figure . The department filed the suit in federal court in New Orleans . Anadarko and MOEX are minority owners of the well that blew out . Transocean owned the rig that BP was leasing . QBE\\/Lloyd 's can be held liable only up to the amount of insurance policy coverage under the Oil Pollution Act and is not being sued under the Clean Water Act . The lawsuit alleges that safety and operating regulations were violated in the period leading up to April 20 . It says that the defendants failed to keep the Macondo well under control during that period and failed to use the best available and safest drilling technology to monitor the well 's conditions . They also failed to maintain continuous surveillance and failed to maintain equipment and material that were available and necessary to ensure the safety and protection of personnel , equipment , natural resources and the environment , the suit charges . Before Wednesday , potential class-action lawsuits had been filed in the Gulf oil spill by fishing and seafood interests , the tourism industry , restaurants and clubs , property owners losing vacation renters -- even vacationers who claim the spill forced them to cancel and lose a deposit . So far , more than 300 suits have been spawned by the spill and consolidated in federal court in New Orleans . Wednesday 's move by the Justice Department follows the Obama administration 's decision not to open new areas of the eastern Gulf and Atlantic seaboard to drilling . That marked a reversal from an earlier decision to hunt for oil and gas , an announcement the president himself made last spring three weeks before the spill . The staff of a presidentially appointed commission looking into the spill has said that the disaster resulted from questionable decisions and management failures by three companies : BP , the well owner and operator ; Transocean , the owner of the Deepwater Horizon rig ; and Halliburton . The panel found 11 decisions made by these companies increased risk . Most saved time , and all but one had a safer alternative . Separately , an administrator is doling out money to Gulf oil spill victims from a $ 20 billion fund of BP money . The Justice Department is not the first government entity to sue BP . Alabama Attorney General Troy King filed federal lawsuits in August on behalf of the state against BP , rig owner Transocean , cement contractor Halliburton Energy Services Inc. and other companies that worked on the ill-fated drilling project . U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier is presiding over most of the consolidated federal suits . In September , Louisiana Attorney General James `` Buddy '' Caldwell 's office asked Barbier to create a `` government case track '' to handle government-related suits separately from other claims . The judge has not ruled on that request yet . Other companies that were not targeted by the Justice Department lawsuit could be added later if the department decides that the evidence warrants it . Among the other companies whose names have emerged in the aftermath of the spill are Halliburton , which handled the cementing of the well ; and Cameron International , which made the blowout preventer that apparently failed to stop the gusher after the rig exploded last April 20 .

AP NEW YORK -- As the Gulf oil spill gushed out of control , BP 's financial liabilities seemed big enough to sink the company . Cleanup , government fines , lawsuits , legal fees and damage claims will likely exceed the $ 40 billion that BP has publicly estimated , according to an Associated Press analysis . But they 'll be far below the highest estimates made over the summer by legal experts and prominent Wall Street banks , such as Goldman Sachs , which said costs could near $ 200 billion . BP will survive the worst oil spill in U.S. history for several key reasons : it has little debt ; its global businesses are forecast to generate $ 26 billion next year in cash flow from operations ; the environmental impact of the spill is n't as bad as feared ; and the government seems unlikely to ban BP from Gulf drilling . To bolster its finances , BP has cut its dividend , issued debt and sold more than $ 21 billion in assets . `` It could have been a lot worse , '' says Tyler Priest , a University of Houston petroleum historian who serves on President Obama 's oil spill investigation committee . `` BP is going to come back from this . '' Many influential investors appear to agree . According to Thomson Reuters , 23 firms with $ 1 billion or more invested in the stock market , including BlackRock Investment Management , Managed Account Advisors and Rydex Security Global Investors , more than doubled their holdings of BP stock from July through September . At $ 44.11 , BP 's stock price has risen 63 percent from its low of $ 27.02 on June 25 . It 's still down 27 percent from its close of $ 60.48 on April 20 , the day of the spill . The well was capped on July 15 . The AP analysis shows the company is likely to face $ 38 billion to $ 60 billion in spill-related costs . A settlement with the federal government could reduce that amount , while a successful class-action lawsuit could add billions more . -- The $ 10.7 billion that BP already has paid to plug its well , clean up the spilled oil and pay damage claims and other costs . -- A $ 20 billion fund that BP set up in August for individuals and private businesses that were affected by the spill . The fund , known as the Gulf Coast Claims Facility , pays for environmental damage , personal injury , cleanup and lost earnings . The fund so far has paid $ 2.7 billion to address nearly 168,000 claims . Nearly half a million individuals and businesses have filed claims , and those that settle with the fund give up their right to sue the company . If any of the $ 20 billion is left over , it goes back to BP . -- Fines : The Justice Department is suing BP for violating the Clean Water Act . Fines are based on how much oil was spilled . The government 's estimate of 4.9 million barrels means BP faces between $ 5.4 billion and $ 21.1 billion in fines . The upper limit applies if investigators conclude BP acted with gross negligence . The government has a history of settling with companies for as little as 50 cents on the dollar in order to avoid lengthy disputes , says Eric Schaeffer , former head of the Environmental Protection Agency 's enforcement division . -- Legal fees : BP has hired lawyers , engineers and geologists to defend the company . These experts could cost as much as $ 2 billion , according to Mitratech Inc. , a consulting firm that handles legal and trial logistics for Fortune 500 companies . -- Lawsuits : The toughest costs to estimate are future settlements and judgments from the hundreds of lawsuits filed against BP , including any class actions . Shrimpers , oystermen , charter-boat operators , restaurant workers and real-estate developers are suing BP for lost business . Oil rig workers and cleanup crews are making personal injury claims . And Gulf states and local governments are expected to sue for lost tax revenue and environmental damages . Alabama is seeking an initial $ 148 million from BP . Analysts at Citigroup say settlements , judgments and punitive damages from these suits will total as much as $ 6 billion . Legal experts caution that the unpredictability of juries makes it difficult to estimate the cost of losing a class-action lawsuit . A successful class-action could easily double the Citigroup estimate for total legal liabilities , says Alexandra Lahav , a University of Connecticut professor who studies such lawsuits . BP may be able to spread the spill 's costs around . Minority partners Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and MOEX 2007 LLC own 35 percent of the operation , and rig owner Transocean Ltd. also may be asked to pay . `` Companies have the incentive to settle with BP to put the matter behind them , '' FBR analyst Robert MacKenzie says . He expects BP to get as much as $ 2 billion from Transocean and as much as $ 4 billion from Anadarko . Since the spill , BP has moved aggressively to shore up its finances . The company suspended its quarterly dividend of 84 cents a share , which cost it $ 10.5 billion last year . It also raised $ 21 billion in asset sales that include : $ 7 billion for its stake in Pan American Energy ; $ 7 billion for oil fields in the U.S. , Canada and Egypt ; $ 1.9 billion for its Colombian exploration business ; and $ 1.8 billion for assets in Vietnam and Venezuela . BP also raised $ 3.5 billion in an Oct. 1 . From April through June , when BP 's stock was tanking , Fred Fromm , who manages a natural resources fund for Franklin Templeton Investments , scooped up 170,000 shares . Their value climbed by more than $ 2 million in the third quarter . A few weeks after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank , scientists worried the oil slick would reach the Gulf 's Loop Current , which sweeps around Florida and up the East Coast . Beaches would be damaged along the way . But BP got lucky . Gulf winds kept shifting , which kept the oil concentrated in the waters south of Louisiana , said David Hollander , a University of South Florida chemical oceanographer . And hurricanes mostly avoided the region . Scientists disagree about how much oil remains in the Gulf , but already the streaky sheens of oil on the surface are mostly gone . The more oil that remains , the greater the potential for environmental lawsuits . Whatever remains , `` it wo n't impact their long-term ability to do business , '' says Citigroup oil analyst Mark Fletcher . Exxon dealt with lawsuits for decades after its Valdez supertanker ran aground and spilled 11 million gallons of crude into Alaska 's Prince William Sound in 1989 . The spill cost Exxon $ 4.5 billion -- nearly half of which went to clean up the oil . The rest was spent on payments to residents and businesses , punitive damages and settlements with the government . Exxon never lost its perch among industry leaders , and BP wo n't either , says Citigroup 's Fletcher . BP remains among the top oil drillers in a world that runs on petroleum , and that may be the best way to judge the company 's lasting power . `` Did -LRB- Valdez -RRB- stop anyone from buying Exxon gasoline ? Exxon 's results are better than anyone 's on a multiyear basis , '' Fletcher said .

Fund administrator Ken Feinberg said Thursday he has agreed to pay New York University professor Stephen Gillers for his advice . Since being hired , Gillers has written a letter stating that Feinberg is neutral and not subject to BP 's direction or control . Feinberg said the Gulf Coast Claims Facility , created to administer payments from the fund to people and businesses , is billing BP for Gillers ' services . Some victims , lawyers and state officials unhappy with the claims process have questioned Feinberg 's independence and suggested he is a pawn in a BP effort to limit its liability . A statement Thursday from the Gulf Coast Claims Facility said Feinberg asked Gillers for advice about a Nov. 24 letter from Louisiana Attorney General James `` Buddy '' Caldwell questioning the independence of the fund and Feinberg 's role as the independent administrator . In a letter to Feinberg , Gillers wrote : `` You are not in an attorney-client relationship with BP . You are an independent administrator and owe none of the attributes of the attorney-client relationship -LRB- e.g. , loyalty , confidentiality -RRB- to BP . By ` independent ' I mean -LRB- and I think the context is clear -RRB- that you are independent of BP . You are not subject to its direction or control . '' The total amount Gillers will be paid is unclear . He told The Associated Press he is billing $ 950 an hour for his services and an assistant is billing $ 475 an hour . Gillers said he and the assistant have not calculated exactly how many hours they spent on the work , which Gillers said is now finished . GCCF spokeswoman Debra DeShong Reed said neither Feinberg nor the fund have any past relationship with Gillers . She said he was chosen because he is a nationally recognized expert in the field of legal ethics . Gillers said his work for Feinberg included reading the letter Caldwell sent Feinberg , reading court papers filed by lawyers suing BP , and researching rules governing lawyers in Gulf Coast states and in Washington , where Feinberg 's law firm is located . Both Gillers and Feinberg said they do n't believe there is anything wrong with using BP money to pay for the advice . `` Is he being paid by BP money ? Yes , '' Feinberg said . `` Who else is going to pay for the entire cost of this program ? You ca n't ask claimants to pay , you ca n't ask states and federal governments to pay . The buck stops with BP and BP has agreed to pay the entire cost of the infrastructure of this program . '' But Anthony Kennon , mayor of Orange Beach , Ala. , has questions about the relationship between Feinberg and BP . `` He can proclaim independence as much as he wants , '' said Kennon , whose community was hard hit by the oil spill . `` The only thing that will show true independence is if he makes those people whole who were harmed by the oil spill . We have not been made whole by a long shot . '' Lawyers who have already filed more than 300 lawsuits on behalf of Gulf residents and businesses say Feinberg should stop calling himself independent . They asked a federal judge last week to order changes to the release form people must sign if they accept a final payment from Feinberg . Feinberg currently requires people who accept final payments to agree not to sue BP or any other responsible party , including companies involved with the Deepwater Horizon rig that exploded April 20 off Louisiana 's coast . The blast killed 11 workers and led to 200 million gallons of oil spewing from BP 's well a mile beneath the Gulf of Mexico , according to government estimates that BP disputes . The lawyers say people should only have to give up the right to sue BP for compensatory damages , but they should still be allowed to go after BP in court for punitive damages . And , the lawyers say , people who accept final payments from the fund should be allowed to sue other responsible parties for both compensatory and punitive damages . So far , the fund has paid out roughly $ 2.6 billion . Money left over in the fund is expected to be returned to BP .

AP It took U.S. and British teams three months to cap the well in the BP oil spill . A Florida lawmaker does n't want to find out how long it would take Cuba to cap a similar catastrophe . Rep. Vern Buchanan , a Republican who represents part of Florida 's western coast , has introduced a bill aimed at blocking Cuba from drilling a new deepwater oil well in the waters off its northern coast . Citing threats to his state 's tourism industry and environment in the event of a potential oil spill , Buchanan has expressed concern that the communist country -- and the Spanish company it has contracted for running the Chinese-built rig -- would be incapable of handling the kind of disaster spill that strained U.S. response teams last spring . The proposal would treat Cuba 's drilling industry kind of like Iran 's sanctioned energy sector . It would empower the U.S. interior secretary to deny an oil-and-gas lease , or exploration permit , to any company dealing with a country under U.S. sanction or embargo . Though vague , the language is directed at Spanish oil-and-gas firm Repsol , which is heading up Cuba 's new oil plans . The issue troubling Buchanan is that Cuba is looking to drill for oil even deeper than BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig , which exploded last April and sent millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf . Not only would Cuba 's well be deeper -- at 5,600 feet compared to 5,000 feet -- but Buchanan said it would be at the edge of Cuba 's territorial waters , 50 miles from the Florida coast . `` As we have learned from the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico , an oil spill can devastate a regional economy and impose serious long-term environment damage to precious natural resources , '' he said in a written statement . In the event of a spill , he said , `` quickly capping the well would be extremely difficult , if not impossible . '' Buchanan said the hypothetical oil slick would take `` just three days '' to reach Florida 's beaches , which drives its tourism economy . Buchanan spokesman Max Goodman called the bill `` very time sensitive , '' with drilling slated to begin within a year . His office suggested Cuba 's government could not be counted on to clean up another mega-spill . Asked whether Repsol would be able to step in , Repsol representative Kristian Rix told FoxNews.com the company `` adheres to the strictest safety measures '' and develops `` comprehensive accident response plans '' in every country where it does business . `` We have every confidence that our teams and equipment are well prepared to carry out operations safely and effectively , '' Rix , the firm 's international and financial media manager , said in an e-mail . A Spanish court began an investigation last year into a spill at one of Repsol 's Mediterranean rigs , though that leak was not anywhere near as colossal as the BP spill . For the new rig , the United States could not directly block Cuba from drilling in its own waters . But under Buchanan 's bill the U.S. could threaten Repsol 's projects elsewhere in U.S. territory . The company operates rigs near Texas and Louisiana . With his bill , Buchanan wants to compel Repsol to abandon the Cuba drilling to protect its other assets . The company earlier backed off a natural gas project in Iran after facing pressure from the United States over Iran 's nuclear program . Buchanan 's not the only prominent Floridian to warn about the danger of new international drilling near the Sunshine State 's shores . Former Sen. Bob Graham warned in a speech Jan. 14 that Cuba is planning other drilling projects with a Russian firm . According to an account of the speech in The Miami Herald , Graham said the United States should partner with Mexico to draft new international drilling safety standards in the Gulf . In addition , he said , Mexico should press Cuba to impose such standards . Graham said the BP spill should be a `` wake-up call . '' The BP spill dumped an estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf , hammering the coastline and offshore waters as well as the region 's fishing and tourism economies . Florida 's $ 60 billion-a-year tourism industry stood to suffer the most . A report put out last summer by the U.S. Travel Association said Florida 's losses over the next three years could amount to nearly $ 19 billion . Buchanan last expressed concerns about the Cuba project in a letter to President Obama in October . His bill has so far attracted just two co-sponsors -- both Florida Republicans -- but Goodman said the congressman is seeking bipartisan support . The Interior Department had no comment when asked Monday whether Secretary Ken Salazar was interested in attaining or exercising the authority Buchanan wants to give him .

BP wo n't identify the business , citing confidentiality , but acknowledges it lobbied for the settlement . The amount far exceeds smaller stop-gap payments that some individuals and businesses have received while they wait for their own final settlements . The Gulf Coast Claims Facility was set up in August to independently administer BP 's $ 20 billion compensation fund in the aftermath of its April 20 oil well blowout off Louisiana . As of this weekend , roughly 91,000 people and businesses had filed for final settlements , but the fund 's administrator , Washington lawyer Kenneth Feinberg , has said those checks wo n't start rolling out until February at the earliest . Thousands of people have received some money to tide them over until a final settlement amount is offered , but only that one listed as paid on the facility 's web site has so far received a check . A BP spokesman called it `` a unique situation in which an existing BP business partner and BP submitted a view on a specific claim '' to the facility . The facility `` reviewed our positions and made an independent decision regarding the outcome of the claim , '' BP spokeswoman Hejdi Feick said in an e-mail Sunday night to The Associated Press . Feick did not immediately return a telephone message on Monday seeking additional details . Feinberg said Monday the facility never reviewed that claim for merit . He said BP struck an outside deal with the business and told the fund to make the payment . `` At the request of the parties , the settlement reached between BP and the other party was paid out of the GCCF fund , '' Feinberg told the AP . `` It was a private settlement and we paid it , but we were not privy to the settlement negotiations between BP and that party . `` We never reviewed the claim , '' Feinberg added . `` We honored the request of the parties to fund the claim . '' Rudy Toler , 30 , a shrimper and oysterman from Gulfport , Miss. , called the payment disgusting . `` It makes me sick , '' said Toler , a married father of four who has n't received a dime from the fund . `` It 's just criminal . '' Early on , he filed a claim for losses of about $ 140,000 for the six months he could n't work through the summer . The claims facility tells him his paperwork is under review again , but in the meantime , Toler is struggling to pay his bills and feed his family . `` I 'm doing the best I can , '' he said Monday . `` Every day is a struggle . '' Mayor Tony Kennon of Orange Beach , Ala. , a tourist town hit particularly hard by the oil spill , said the early settlement payment `` reeks of favoritism . '' `` It stinks , '' Kennon said Monday . `` It 's exactly what we 've been screaming about . There 's not an independent entity . There 's no oversight . '' Feinberg has faced repeated criticism from lawmakers , plaintiffs attorneys and claimants who complain about a lack of transparency and independence from BP , as well as claims being shortchanged and paid too slowly , or not at all . His law firm had been receiving $ 850,000 a month from BP for its work . Feinberg is currently negotiating with BP over a new payment structure to run the fund through August 2013 . Any money left over from the $ 20 billion is expected to be returned to BP . Feinberg has repeatedly promised fairness and transparency . He calls the program a success and notes it has already paid out more than $ 3.3 billion to some 251,000 claimants . However , roughly half of the 484,000 claims filed have been denied because of ineligibility or lack of documentation , meaning they got nothing , like Toler . And while there is an appeals process through the U.S. Coast Guard for disgruntled claimants , the agency has consistently sided with the facility . Feinberg told AP that the Coast Guard had processed 264 out of 507 appeals filed and in every case has agreed with the decisions by the claims fund . The program first allowed claimants to file for emergency six-month payments to keep them afloat , but many of those claims were denied . Those that were n't often were paid fractions of what they claimed they lost . The process now allows for three options . Spill victims can file for a quick cash one-time payment of $ 5,000 for individuals and $ 25,000 for businesses . More than 80,000 claimants have filed and been paid in that category , giving up their right to anymore money or to sue BP or any other responsible company . Claimants may also opt for a final settlement , but also would have to give up the right to sue . Residents and business owners who are n't ready to make that decision could instead file for interim quarterly payments through August 2013 , provided they can show proof of continued losses . "}]
