Speaking to BBC Caribbean earlier the new Chairman of the Caribbean Community -LRB- Caricom -RRB- , Prime Minister of Dominica Roosevelt Skerrit , called the quake `` gut-wrenching '' . Haiti is one of the few non-English speaking members of Caricom . Regional leaders pledged immediate assistance with a contingent from the Caribbean Disasters Emergency Management Agency formerly known as Cedera . Cdera officials had hoped that regional aid could start arriving in Haiti overnight Wednesday . A BBC correspondent in Santo Domingo said Wednesday that priority was being given to planes and helicopters carrying aid to Haiti via the Dominican Republic .

Many waited in the streets during Wednesday Speaking to BBC Caribbean , Caricom Secretariat spokesman Leonard Robertson said there was a co-ordinated regional effort underway . `` We have very little communication ... to enable us to get a picture apart from what we are seeing on the news media , '' Robertson told BBC Caribbean . He said that Caricom and Cdema planned to get representatives on the ground in haiti on Wednesday to assess what was `` most urgently needed '' there . Robertson added that the regional groupings then hoped to get relief supplies into Haiti by Thursday or Friday .

Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he was `` deeply saddened '' by the disaster and pledged whatever support was needed . A government spokesman said no British casualties had been reported so far . A 61-strong team of firefighters from across the UK has volunteered to fly out to the quake zone . The team will be taking specialist equipment and two search dogs .

Greater Manchester firefighter Peter Stevenson , who will work as operation commander when the volunteers arrive in Haiti , said they would work in two teams to search for survivors . `` One rescue can take between six and 10 hours , depending on the situation and what the building is made from , '' Mr Stevenson said . `` We go totally self-reliant , with several tonnes of equipment so we can work 24 hours a day on at least two separate sites .

And , as has happened so often in the nation 's past , just when the situation was getting better , a fresh catastrophe struck , writes Nick Caistor . Until it was destroyed in the earthquake on Tuesday , Haiti 's presidential palace was the most beautiful building in the capital , Port-au-Prince . Before and after pictures of the presidential palace Gleaming white , its imposing , harmonious structure was a symbol of the promise that has so often been dashed in this country of 10 million inhabitants . The palace is situated on the Champ de Mars , the huge open square down near the port area of Port-au-Prince . This is the center of the city , where all the main administrative and community buildings are clustered . Many of them , including the cathedral , the main hospital , and the UN peacekeeping headquarters are reported to have been crushed in the worst earthquake to hit the country in more than 200 years . Hundreds may have died here , but the death toll is likely to be even higher in the nearby squalid slums such as Cite Soleil , where tens of thousands of the poorest Haitians live in wooden or tin shacks , with no running water , no sewage systems , and no electricity . Many of these slum dwellers have been forced to come into Port-au-Prince because , if anything , conditions in the countryside are even harsher . Serious malnutrition , Aids , and other chronic diseases are widespread . The city of Gonaives was devastated in 2008 Haiti occupies the mountainous western third of the island of Hispaniola . When the Europeans first arrived more than 500 years ago , they were amazed at how wooded the country was . Now only some 3 % of those original forests remain . The rest have been chopped down for lumber or for charcoal , which is still the most widely used fuel in the countryside . It is this deforestation that increased the havoc caused by a series of storms in 2008 , when almost a thousand people were killed and up to a million were made homeless after four hurricanes struck around the important town of Gonaives in as many weeks . In 2004 , a tropical storm struck the northwest of the country . The historic port of Cap Haitien bore the brunt on that occasion , with an estimated 3,000 people killed . In addition to these natural disasters , Haiti has suffered throughout its history from political turmoil and misrule . Haiti got its first democratically elected leader after ` Baby Doc ' was ousted When ` Baby Doc ' Duvalier was forced from power in 1986 , it seemed as though the country might finally enjoy a period of democratic rule . After several years of unrest , this new hope was symbolised by the election in 1990 of a young former Catholic priest , Jean-Bertrand Aristide . But his period in office came to an end after only a few months , when army colonels seized power . The democratic experience was cut short , several thousand people became victims of the new regime , and thousands more tried to flee the country on home-made rafts . It was the huge influx of these boat people into the United States in 1994 which helped persuade President Bill Clinton that the time had come to kick out the colonels . Once again , Jean-Bertrand Aristide returned to power , and a new , more promising political era seemed about to begin . Under his rule , and that of his successor Rene Preval , and with the help of the United Nations and other international aid organizations , life improved a little , although Haiti remained the poorest country in the Western hemisphere , with average income of less than two dollars a day . It was when Mr Aristide was elected president for a second term in 2001 that the political situation began to slip back into confusion and growing violence . Refugees were often picked up off the coast of Miami in the early 1990s . President Aristide was forced out of power early in 2004 , after several months of increasing political turmoil . A UN peacekeeping force of 9,000 has been in Haiti ever since , trying not only to bring stability but also to help build roads and other vital infrastructure projects . Mr Clinton , now a UN special envoy , has spearheaded attempts to get international donors to live up to their promises of aid . Under Rene Preval , who was elected for a second term in 2006 , there has been a small but significant improvement in conditions in Haiti : jobs have been created , the slums have become less violent , and there have been some timid signs of a growth in tourism . Now , as has happened so often in Haiti 's past , the fresh hopes have been extinguished . It will take a massive effort from the United Nations and the international community simply to rescue the thousands of victims and clean up after the earthquake . Speaking after the 2008 disasters , President Preval said that Haiti needed long-term help if it were not to be `` left as always , truly alone , to face new catastrophes '' . Across the Champ de Mars from the presidential palace in Port-au-Prince is - or was - a tall statue to the maroons , the runaway slaves who are the symbol of Haiti 's fight for independence at the end of the 18th century . Haitians will need the same spirit now if they are to overcome this latest blow to their nation .

Derek Jolly , from the International Rescue Corps -LRB- IRC -RRB- , said the charity was desperate for more funds so it could go to the disaster-struck nation . The IRC , based in Grangemouth , has just # 30,000 left in the bank . A rescue mission would cost at least # 35,000 . Haiti was hit by a massive 7.0-magnitude earthquake on Tuesday . Thousands are feared dead and the Red Cross has estimated that up to three million people have been affected . Mr Jolly , 39 , said the IRC faced a stark decision . `` It looks like if we make a decision to go to Haiti today , the charity will fold . `` But if we decide not to go then we are going against what we 're constitutionally bound to do , '' he said . `` I 've been doing this for 12 years . To see it fold would be unbelievable . We chuck so much time into it - family life suffers , work life suffers . '' Derek Jolly has been a member of the team for 12 years The charity was formed in 1981 after the 1980 earthquake in Italy which claimed the lives of almost 3,000 people . IRC volunteers come from a range of backgrounds and generally take unpaid leave when they are deployed to a disaster zone . `` In the past , people put # 24,000 on their Visa cards to fund a trip and came back with no idea how to pay it back - but no-one 's that gung-ho any more , '' said Mr Jolly , who teaches intensive care nurses in Edinburgh . `` If I get away for a week I usually take a # 500 hit for it . People are more wary about putting their hand in their pockets now . '' He said donations to the IRC had slowed as a result of the recession , and they were also less likely to receive free flights and food from businesses and governments . I 've been in tears on the phone this morning , talking to other members of the team The charity has about 150 members , about 40 of whom are on standby to go to disasters . Mr Jolly said despite the huge financial and emotional commitment , team members were desperate to get to Haiti as quickly as possible . `` We might get no-one out alive , but maybe we can give a family back a body they might not have found . `` Other times you find lots of people alive and you think , what would happen if we were n't there ? '' The earthquake is Haiti 's worst in two centuries . It struck south of the capital Port-au-Prince at 1653 -LRB- 2153 GMT -RRB- on Tuesday . Mr Jolly , a father of two , said it was frustrating that the money needed was a lot to the IRC - but was `` pocket money '' to some organizations . `` I 've been in tears on the phone this morning , talking to other members of the team , '' he added .

He says a total of 15 UN staff are now confirmed as dead - 11 Brazilian peacekeepers , as well as three Jordanians , one Argentine and one Chadian who were police officers . Addressing comments from Haitian President Rene Preval that the head of the UN mission , Hedi Annabi , was among the dead , Mr Ban says : `` We have been trying to confirm this news through our mission in Haiti and through the permanent mission of Haiti here . But neither of these two institutions have been able to do so . '' 2349 The BBC 's Laura Trevelyan in New York spoke to Haitians living in the Brooklyn district of Haiti Town : `` Haitians here are in shock . Their community has suffered so much - political violence , hurricanes , and now this . Rico Dupuis of Radio Soleil says Haiti is more in need of help than ever before . ` Of all the calamities we 've faced over the years , this is the mother of all of them . Port-au-Prince will never be the same again . I do n't see how Haiti can recover from all of this , ' he says . Vigils are being organised , money is being collected , food is being parcelled up , as Haitians here respond to this tragedy . What makes it all the harder to bear , is that for once people felt their country was entering a period of relative stability . '' 2332 Haiti 's neighbors in the Caribbean reacted swiftly to news of the earthquake , with first response coming overnight from the Bahamas and the Dominican Republic which sent in medical supplies and search and a rescue response teams . The new chairman of Caricom , Dominica Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit , called the quake gut-wrenching . Regional leaders pledged immediate assistance and a contingent from the Caribbean Disasters Emergency Management Agency was expected to arrive in Haiti on Wednesday evening . Grenada 's Prime Minister , Tillman Thomas , told the BBC natural disasters like hurricanes meant the region was best placed to understand Haiti 's immediate needs . 2313 US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has decided to cancel the remainder of her trip to the Pacific and return to Washington because of the earthquake in Haiti . She had been scheduled to visit Papua New Guinea , New Zealand and Australia . 2309 The BBC 's Andy Gallacher says : `` I 've just arrived at Port-au-Prince airport and aid is now coming in , but very slowly indeed . There are just a few US Coast Guard and a couple of military planes here . But help is desperately needed . It is difficult to tell if the reports of tens of thousands of casualties are accurate at the moment . There is no power here , and very poor infrastructure . '' Jovenel Presume , Massachusetts , US , emails : Since the quake , I have lost all communication with my family . My mum is there . She was due to fly back today . I have a few friends , and family members who are willing to go out there in the rubble to search for people that are still alive . 2244 Canada 's Governor General , Michaelle Jean , urges her former compatriots in Haiti to `` stand firm '' . `` Like me , Haitian communities across Canada are heartbroken and overwhelmed by the magnitude of this catastrophe , '' said Ms Jean , who was born in Port-au-Prince , but who fled Haiti with her family when she was 11 . `` The images and news reports are unbearable to watch . So much distress , suffering and loss . We are also , of course , imagining the worst , situations no image can capture that only increase our feeling of helplessness . '' 2231 The BBC 's Matthew Price at Port-au-Prince 's airport says : `` We have just touched down . Airport workers said the situation was very serious indeed . They did tell me that there had been no sign of government help , or of international help . As we landed , we did see large numbers of people huddled together in makeshift shelters .

They show the aftermath of the earthquake and thousands of people on the capital 's streets , but no cars . Aerial footage of the destruction in Haiti 2207 The Wall Street Journal says the earthquake will devastate Haiti 's $ 7bn economy , which was already struggling to emerge from several natural disasters and decades of political instability . The country , where 80 % of the population lives below the poverty line , has yet to recover from four hurricanes in 2008 which wiped out roughly 15 % of its GDP . `` If the hurricanes were a blow , for this I would have to invent some other word , '' Ludovic Comeau , a native of Haiti and economics professor at DePaul University , tells the paper . 2200 The commander of the first US ship to reach Port-au-Prince has described a scene of extraordinary devastation , with collapsed buildings reaching from the coast into the hills above . Cmdr Diane Durham of the Coast Guard cutter , Forward , told the New York Times : `` It is hard to look out in this harbor and see a building that has not been affected ... Everybody in this city has been hit . '' 2155 The World Bank says it will provide an additional $ 100m in emergency funds to Haiti and is considering a special reconstruction trust fund so donors can co-ordinate aid . `` This is a shocking event and it is crucial that the international community supports the Haitian people at this critical time , '' says the bank 's president , Robert Zoellick . `` The World Bank is mobilising significant financial assistance and sending a team to help assess damage and reconstruction needs . '' 2143 The FBI warns potential donors of earthquake relief funds to `` apply a critical eye and do their due diligence before responding to those requests '' . `` Past tragedies and natural disasters have prompted individuals with criminal intent to solicit contributions purportedly for a charitable organization and\\/or a good cause , '' it says . 2120 The BBC 's Barbara Plett at the UN in New York says : `` The UN is being extremely cautious about casualty figures because information is still sketchy . The head of mission remains unaccounted for and the Secretary General , Ban Ki-moon , is sending the deputy chief of peacekeeping operations , Edmond Mulet , to oversee rescue and relief efforts . An emergency response team is also expected on the ground shortly and a flash appeal for funds will be launched in the next few days . '' 2112 Susana Malcorra , the head of the UN department of field support , confirms that at least 14 UN personnel have been killed - three Jordanian and 11 Brazilian peacekeepers , and one Haitian civilian . Fifty-six are injured , seven of whom have been evacuated . She tells reporters that there will likely be far more fatalities . 2057 In a moving report on its website , Haitian Radio Metropole describes the devastation : `` The streets of Port-au-Prince are nothing more than a gaping wound , where corpses are tangled with the remains of houses , shops ... Schools and hospitals crumble , people are buried under the tons of rubble , or are waiting for a charitable hand that will come to their aid , and while this is happening , the looters are at work in the shops . Some people have lost their children , others their parents . Haiti has new orphans . Today it is very difficult to maintain hope , but as the saying goes , hope makes us live , so let us all join hands and keep hope alive . '' Haiti 's Prime Minister says more than 100,000 people may have been killed 2050 Haiti 's President , Rene Preval , tells CNN he has heard that between 30,000 and 50,000 people were killed by the earthquake . He did not say where the estimates had come from . 2044 A company in Miami working with the Haitian singer , Wyclef Jean , to collect donations in the US via text message says that the Yele Haiti foundation `` has raised more than $ 250,000 in donations for the catastrophe in less than 12 hours of going live and aims to raise over $ 1 million a day '' , according to the New York Times . 2040 Officials at the US Department of Homeland Security says it has halted the deportation of Haitians living in the US illegally . Those who were due to be deported will remain in US detention centres . 2034 The US televangelist , Pat Robertson , claims the reason for Haiti 's misfortunes is that the nation `` swore a pact to the devil '' two centuries ago . `` They were under the heal of the French ... And they got together and swore a pact to the devil . They said , we will serve you if you will get us free from the French ... And they kicked the French out . You know , the Haitians revolted and got themselves free . But ever since they have been cursed by one thing after the other , '' he tells the Christian Broadcast Network . 2021 President Rene Preval says the head of the UN mission in Haiti , Hedi Annabi , was killed in the earthquake when its headquarters in Port-au-Prince collapsed . The UN has yet to confirm the death . 2005 Paris Hilton , Ben Stiller , Chris Martin and Lindsay Lohan are among the celebrities and artists urging support for victims of the earthquake in Haiti . Coldplay singer Martin says that when he visited Haiti with the charity Oxfam a few years ago he found a country `` of extreme poverty and brutal living conditions '' . The earthquake , he says , has probably turned Port-au-Prince `` into an unimaginable hell '' . 1959 The earthquake has brought devastation to other parts of Haiti besides Port-au-Prince . Guido Cornale , a Unicef representative in the southern city of Jacmel , says a lot of buildings that have collapsed completely or partially . `` We are still assessing the damage but we estimate that about 20 % of Jacmel , if not more ... has been destroyed '' he says , adding that city has a population of 50,000 . The BBC 's Mike Wooldridge says : There have been repeated tragedies of this kind in Haiti - the first state in the Caribbean to become independent back in the 19th Century but also one of the world 's most impoverished nations . It has a history of dictatorship , violent power struggles during the last decade , a notoriously high level of criminality - all this has compounded the vulnerability of women and children particularly . That is why there is there is already a substantial humanitarian operation in Haiti - facing its greatest test . 1920 Jean Marc Lafitte , Dominican Republic , emails : My family are all safe , but they are devastated . They said that all the buildings are down , a lot of people are hurt and everything 's covered in dust - they say the country is ruined . 1910 The British Red Cross in Haiti has set up a Flickr picture gallery , showing pictures taken around Haiti . 1901 US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says she will shorten her trip to Asia because of the earthquake . `` It is biblical , the tragedy that continues to stalk Haiti and the Haitian people , '' she tells reporters in Hawaii , according to the AFP news agency . 1858 Edwidge Danticat , an award-winning Haitian-American author based in Miami , tells the Associated Press she is unable to contact her relatives . `` You want to go there , but you just have to wait , '' she says . `` Life is already so fragile in Haiti , and to have this on such a massive scale , it 's unimaginable how the country will be able to recover from this . '' 1849 The Caribbean Community -LRB- Caricom -RRB- says its member states are `` ready to assist our brothers and sisters '' in Haiti . `` While we are very encouraged by the many expressions of international support that are already pouring in to Haiti , Caricom as a region also intends to play its part , '' it says , according to the Caribbean Media Corporation . Troy Livesay , Port-au-Prince , blogs : Thousands of people are currently trapped . To guess at a number would be like guessing at raindrops in the ocean . Precious lives hang in the balance .

This was a large tremor centred on an impoverished country with little recent experience or preparedness for such an event . The buildings in the quake zones of major industrialised nations sit on damping systems that allow them to ride out tremors that not only shake them back and forth but also twist them in the same movement . The simplest concrete structures in the capital of Port-au-Prince will have crumpled under the same strain . Seismometers recorded a preliminary magnitude of 7.0 at 1653 local time -LRB- 2153 GMT -RRB- . The epicentre 's proximity to Port-au-Prince - 15km -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- - and the focus -LRB- or depth -RRB- of just 8km -LRB- 5 miles -RRB- will have ensured the destructive forces were at their most intense . `` Closeness to the surface is a major factor contributing to the severity of ground shaking caused by an earthquake of any given magnitude , '' said Dr David Rothery , a planetary scientist with the Open University , UK . `` Furthermore , shaking tends to be greatest directly above the source . In this case the epicentre was only 15 km from the center of the capital , Port au Prince , which therefore suffered very heavily . '' A series of strong aftershocks - more than 10 larger than Magnitude 5.0 - will have compounded the devastation . In 1946 , a M8 .1 quake hit the Dominican Republic , which shares the island of Hispaniola , and produced a tsunami that killed almost 2,000 people . The last major earthquake in this part of Haiti was 150 years ago . The greater geological setting is the northern boundary between the Caribbean and North America tectonic plates where vast slabs of the Earth 's surface grind past each other in a horizontal motion . The Caribbean plate appears to shift eastward with respect to the North America plate by about 20mm per year . In the region where this quake occurred , this motion is accommodated across a number of strike-slip faults , the two main ones in Haiti being the Septentrional fault in the north and the Enriquillo-Plaintain Garden fault in the south . Seismic data suggests Tuesday 's quake was on the Enriquillo-Plaintain Garden fault . `` It 's been locked solid for about the last 250 years , '' said Dr Roger Musson from the British Geological Survey -LRB- BGS -RRB- . `` It 's been gathering stress all that time as the plates move past each other , and it was really just a matter of time before it released all that energy . The question was going to be whether it would release it all at once or in a series of smaller earthquakes , '' he told BBC News . The US Geological Survey says the Enriquillo-Plaintain Garden fault has been the likely source of historical large tremors in 1860 , 1770 , 1761 , 1751 , 1684 , 1673 , and 1618 . Reports suggest that in this latest event , the surface along the fault may have been offset in places by a metre or so . Haiti is used to weather-related disasters , of course . The Caribbean nation is often battered by hurricanes . Haiti can at least call on the expertise and response systems put in place to deal with those emergencies , although the people who normally co-ordinate that effort will be reeling with the rest of the population .

So why has this quake been so destructive ? A quake of this power would cause lots of damage wherever it hit , but Haiti was especially vulnerable . Haiti is the poorest country in the western half of the world , meaning it has n't been able to prepare for big earthquakes . Rich countries in areas where quakes happen can afford to make buildings which can handle quakes better . But in Haiti , there are lots of badly built structures , which fell over easily . The epicentre of the quake , which is where it was strongest , was just 10 miles from the capital , Port-au-Prince . On top of that , the epicentre was five miles underground . That is quite shallow for a quake , and the closer to the surface the epicentre is , the more shaking it causes at ground level . After large quakes , there are often smaller quakes called aftershocks . The Haiti quake reached 7.0 on the Richter scale , which measures the strength of tremors . Following that , there were more than 10 aftershocks measuring more than 5.0 on the Richeter scale , each causing more damage . Haiti is regularly hit by hurricanes , which means people there have experience in dealing with large natural disasters .

The capital had `` always looked a little rough around the edges , so driving around at night it seems hard to see the damage , then you come upon huge piles of rubble where a supermarket used to be '' , he said . Several people spoke of hearing people screaming across the city following the quake followed by singing and prayers later on . Mr Livesay said it was `` a beautiful sound in the middle of a horrible tragedy '' . A user of the social networking website Twitter , identifying himself as RAMhaiti , said the singing had become `` louder and more emotional '' before subsiding . He said he could hear no ambulances or helicopters and that aftershocks were still causing panic . `` People are screaming and freaking out down towards the stadium , '' he said . Valerie Moliere , 15 , had to be helped out of her family 's home by her father and said the scene was one of confusion and anguish . She said people were in the streets `` hugging and crying '' and the damage was substantial . `` I see broken houses and many people are walking in front of me and they have blood all over them , '' she said . The passengers of a flight from Haiti to Miami , which left shortly after the quake hit , said the airport building had been severely damaged . `` The whole outside had deteriorated , from top to bottom it was cracked up totally , '' one man told reporters . `` We thought it was something that hit the building , but it turned out it was an earthquake . '' Other passengers spoke of their fears for family members left behind in Haiti . Carel Pedre , a TV and radio presenter in Port-au-Prince , told the BBC he had witnessed extensive damage on his five-mile walk through the city to reach his daughter . There 's no way that people can get in touch with their family and friends `` I saw a lot of people crying for help , a lot of buildings collapsed , a lot of car damage , a lot of people without help , people bleeding . '' He said he had seen a cinema , a supermarket , a cybercafe and an apartment building , all of which had crumbled in the quake . Mr Pedre said he could feel aftershocks every 15 to 20 minutes , lasting from three to five seconds each . The darkness , he said , was compounding the fear and worry people were feeling . `` There is no electricity , all the phone networks are down , so there 's no way that people can get in touch with their family and friends , '' he said . He said he had not seen any emergency services , adding that while people in the neighborhood were trying to help each other , they did not know `` where to go or where to start '' . Within minutes of the quake , a huge plume of dust and smoke was seen rising from the capital . Mike Godfrey , a contractor for the US Agency for International Development , told CNN it looked like `` a blanket that completely covered the city and obscured it for about 20 minutes '' .

The 7.0-magnitude quake , Haiti 's worst in two centuries , struck on Tuesday . Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive told US network CNN he believed more than 100,000 people had died . The Red Cross says up to three million people are affected . The capital 's Catholic archbishop , Monsignor Joseph Serge Miot , is also among those killed . In his first interview since the earthquake , President Preval told the Miami Herald newspaper in the US he feared thousands of his people had died . Describing the scene in the capital as `` unimaginable '' , he said : `` Parliament has collapsed . The tax office has collapsed . The tax office has collapsed . Hospitals have collapsed `` There are a lot of schools that have a lot of dead people in them . '' Mr Preval later said that Hedi Annabi , the Tunisian head of the UN stabilisation mission in Haiti -LRB- Minustah -RRB- , had died after the UN HQ building was destroyed . The UN said it could not confirm the news but that Mr Annabi had been in the building at the time and was likely to be under the rubble , along with many others . The main prison in Port-au-Prince has also collapsed , with a UN humanitarian spokeswoman saying there had been reports of escaped inmates . A number of nations , including the US , UK and Venezuela , are gearing up to send aid . Speaking in Washington , US President Barack Obama vowed `` unwavering support '' for Haiti after what he called a `` cruel and incomprehensible '' disaster . He said he had ordered `` a swift , co-ordinated and aggressive effort to save lives '' and that the first US rescue teams would arrive later on Wednesday . US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced that she was cutting short a trip to the Pacific in order to return to Washington because of the earthquake .

Rajiv Shah , of the US Agency for International Development -LRB- USAID -RRB- , said US teams were on their way to Haiti with specialised rescue equipment and that some efforts were already under way on the ground . The quake , which struck about 15km -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- south-west of Port-au-Prince , was quickly followed by two aftershocks of 5.9 and 5.5 magnitude . The first tremor had hit at 1653 local time -LRB- 2153 GMT -RRB- on Tuesday , the US Geological Survey said . Phone lines to the country failed shortly afterwards . Ban Ki-moon : ` We are facing a major humanitarian emergency ' UN officials said at least 14 people had died when the UN 's five-storey headquarters and two smaller buildings in Port-au-Prince collapsed . Around 100 were still thought to be missing , many feared to be under the rubble . Ten Brazilians , three Jordanians and one Haitian had been confirmed killed , a senior UN official said , adding that the number was likely to rise . Stressing a major international relief effort would be needed , UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said the UN would immediately release $ 10m -LRB- # 6.15 m -RRB- from its emergency response fund . He said aerial reconnaissance showed Port-au-Prince had been `` devastated '' by the quake , although other areas were largely unaffected . The airport in Port-au-Prince is operational despite the collapse of the control tower , the UN said , allowing aid to start arriving soon . The Brazilian army , which has the biggest UN contingent in Haiti , has said a large number of its peacekeepers are missing . China has indicated in reports in state media that eight of its peacekeepers are dead , with another 10 unaccounted for . Objects were falling from shelves , there was debris crashing all around .

With communications destroyed by the earthquake , it is not yet possible to confirm the extent of the destruction , although there were reports on Wednesday of many bodies piled in the streets . People in the capital were lifting sheets on bodies to try to identify loved ones . Gary Duffy , BBC News , Sao Paulo Given Brazil 's central role in leading the military side of the UN peacekeeping mission in Haiti the earthquake has caused a lot of concern and shock here . The authorities here say 11 soldiers have died and there have been several injuries , and there are fears this number could rise . It has also been confirmed that Zilda Arns , a prominent Brazilian aid worker and paediatrician , has been killed . She was a sister of the retired Cardinal Paulo Arns , a major figure in the Catholic Church here . Some soldiers have managed to make contact to reassure relatives , but given the damage to infrastructure at Brazilian bases , communication is proving difficult , even for the government . Damage has also been reported in the towns of Jacmel and Carrefour , near Port-au-Prince . Guido Cornale , a representative of the UN children 's agency Unicef , in Jacmel , said it estimated more than a fifth of buildings there had been destroyed . The Red Cross is dispatching a relief team from Geneva and the UN 's World Food Programme is flying in two planes with emergency food aid .

Pope Benedict XVI has called for a generous response to the `` tragic situation '' in Haiti . Emmet Murphy , who works for a non-governmental organization in Haiti , told the BBC : `` I was driving through the mountains on my way home to Jacmel when the car started to shake . It was like a very strong wind was blowing and I nearly lost control of the car . `` I drove further and found the road totally blocked by a massive landslide on the road . I just knew that if I had reached that spot five minutes earlier , I would have been killed . '' Blogger Troy Livesay , in Port-au-Prince , wrote : `` Thousands of people are currently trapped . To guess at a number would be like guessing at raindrops in the ocean . Precious lives hang in the balance . `` When pulled from the rubble there is no place to take them for care .

Many are the bodies of adults , but here to the right , a baby on her back , her belly bloated and pronounced . She is wearing a silvery blue top , just lying by the curb , abandoned . A man stirs to the left . He unfurls a blanket that covers the ground and lies back down . The living are sleeping among the dead . Nearby , still outside , a woman lies on a hospital bed . Like many she is too scared of aftershocks to stay inside . That is why they are here , out under the dark , star-filled sky . A man with wide eyes stares at a passing stranger . The site of the MSF aid agency has become a makeshift hospital A relative moves to lift the sheet covering his two broken legs , as if there was any need to emphasise the suffering here . A woman lies on an unfolded cardboard box . There is a pool of her blood slowly collecting below her waist . She needs help - so does everyone . The screams and whimpers of those in pain echo down the corridors . There are few doctors , little medicine . One woman , a German it seems , says she has just stopped by to help . Her house , she says , was also damaged . A doctor gives her a small vial and she works her way gingerly over the other injured people to a man she has been trying to help . It is clear many brought to the hospital with injuries have since died here . One man with tears in his eyes pointed to his young daughter lying on the dirty tiled floor . She has two broken legs and a large gash in her head . Her sister is already dead . `` Ca va ? '' `` Oui , '' she replies softly - but she is not okay . In pockets there is barely anything left of this city , and so far the people are largely having to cope on their own . Hundreds of corpses are lying in the streets of Port-au-Prince Overnight a rumor went round of an approaching tsunami . Hundreds , it seemed , rushed from the coast and they came along dark , unlit streets carrying a few possessions . There was no tsunami of course , but it showed how scared and alone the people feel . Many are thought to remain trapped underneath the larger buildings that collapsed and Haiti has little in the way of heavy lifting equipment to reach them . The leadership here says tens of thousands of people have been killed . Some of the UN peacekeepers stationed here are among the dead . This country , so often in the past forgotten by the world , now needs its help more than ever . So , too , does another little girl lying on a table at the hospital .

The UK rescue team 's leader , Lincolnshire fire chief Mike Thomas , said the rescuers ' first priority was to start to identify where people were still trapped . `` We 're hoping to get our dogs out there quite quickly as they will be invaluable in helping to target those areas , '' he said . The Red Cross has said three million people - up to a third of the population - might need emergency aid .

Haitian President Rene Preval could not give an official estimate of the dead but said he had heard of figures of up to 50,000 people . The DEC , an umbrella organization which co-ordinates responses to major disasters overseas , has already started to accept donations for its Haiti Earthquake Appeal . A spokesman for the committee said emergency supplies would be bought in areas of Haiti which had not been affected by the earthquake and would be sent directly to those in need . Aid agencies would bring in supplies from the Dominican Republic and then the US only if that option was not possible . Mr Alexander said the UK was working in co-ordination with the US , the EU and the UN to provide relief to those affected . He said the rescue workers would prioritise rescuing people trapped in buildings and beneath rubble . `` But immediately after the rescue phase comes the recovery phase , providing the basic food , the basic shelter , the basic water , the basic healthcare that people so desperately need after an incident such as this , '' he said . Barbara Stocking , the chief executive of Oxfam , said the situation on the ground for aid workers was difficult . She said the charity had had a base in Haiti for many years . `` We did have prepositioned stocks - we work mainly in water and sanitation and shelter - but unfortunately , that was all destroyed in the earthquake itself , as was our office . '' Save the Children 's emergencies director Gareth Owen said the biggest challenge for aid workers was going to be logistics , adding that only half of the charity 's staff in the country had been accounted for . He said up to two million children could be scarred for life by what had happened and that many could be having to deal with the aftermath on their own . UK charity Plan International said people were attempting to recover bodies from buildings and huge numbers of people were living on the streets . People in the UK have said they have had trouble contacting their relatives in Haiti . Barbara Jones from Milton Keynes said she had not been able to contact her family since the earthquake struck . She said : `` It is heartbreaking to see those images . I am trying to get in touch with my family for two days , and I can not reach them . I do not know if they -LRB- are -RRB- well , if they survived , where they are in this moment . '' Ruth Norbury from Bristol said that although her husband Charlie 's family was safe in Carrefour , she was worried about how they would manage to survive the aftermath of the earthquake . She said : `` It was impossible to get hold of them at first . I even went on social networking websites and watched the news in case they were on any video footage . `` When we finally found out all 11 of them had been in one house when it happened and were safe , we were so relieved . `` But Haiti has no infrastructure , no sanitation and I 'm worrying about how they will get food .

Elisabeth Byrs , of the UN 's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs , said : `` The priority is to find survivors . We are working against the clock . '' The head of Medecins du Monde , Olivier Bernard , told AFP news agency that aid had to arrive by Thursday evening . We just do n't know what to do . You can see how terrible the damage is . We have not been able to get into all the areas `` To save lives , surgery must be available ideally within the first 48 hours , '' he said . Doctor 's assistant Jimitre Coquillon told Associated Press : `` This is much worse than a hurricane . There 's no water . Thirsty people are going to die . '' The BBC 's Matthew Price in Port-au-Prince says Haiti is in massive need of food , water and medicine , as well as bulldozers and heavy lifting equipment . But perhaps more than anything it needs someone to take charge here , our correspondent says . The government is fragile at the best of times and there is no sense it is able to do anything for now . Meanwhile , the US Federal Aviation Authority said it had stopped civilian flights to Haiti at the Haitian government 's request because there was not enough space on the ground for more planes and only limited fuel for them to leave . Flights were later resumed , reports said . The director of Port-au-Prince 's general hospital said that by 1100 -LRB- 1600 GMT -RRB- at least 1,500 bodies were already stacked inside and outside the morgue , with police continuing to bring more corpses on pick-up trucks , Reuters reports . UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said it could be days before even an estimate of the death toll from the earthquake could be made , but said he feared it would be `` very high '' . Ban Ki-moon : `` Haiti will need every ounce of help we can offer '' Up to 150 UN staff remain unaccounted for following the collapse of the UN headquarters building in Port-au-Prince and 36 UN military and police personnel are now confirmed dead . On a note of hope , he recounted the survival of an Estonian UN official who was detected under 4m -LRB- 13ft -RRB- of rubble after scratching noises were heard . He was dug out and is now in hospital . A few US aid planes and a 50-strong Chinese rescue team with sniffer dogs have landed at the airport serving the capital , Port-au-Prince . Cuba already had more than 300 doctors in Haiti before the earthquake and they have been treating the injured in field hospitals . Other plane-loads of rescuers and relief supplies are on the way from the EU , Canada , Russia and Latin American nations . A British rescue team with heavy lifting gear and dogs has now arrived in Haiti . UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said : `` The last 24 hours have been truly horrific for the people of Haiti . It 's a catastrophe that 's still unravelling , it 's a tragedy beyond imagination . '' US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton canceled a trip to Asia to deal with the crisis . She said there were tens of thousands of casualties in Haiti and that tens of thousands of buildings had collapsed . `` This is going to be a long-term effort , '' she said . Her husband , Bill Clinton , the UN special envoy for Haiti , told the Washington Post the quake was `` one of the great humanitarian emergencies in the history of the Americas '' . Meanwhile , French President Nicolas Sarkozy called for an international conference on rebuilding Haiti to be held with the help of nations including the US , Brazil and Canada . `` Haiti must not remain a battered country , '' he said . The World Bank is funding $ 100m of emergency aid . The World Food Programme is working on supplying 15,000 tonnes of food and the Red Cross has begun a $ 10m appeal .

This is not only a US effort - we have to work with the United Nations , NGOs and the world community to help Haiti in this desperate time of need . '' 2211 The BBC 's Barbara Plett at the United Nations says : `` The UN says 36 of its personnel were killed in the Haiti earthquake , and 188 staff members are still unaccounted for . UN officials acknowledged that in coming days careful rescue efforts will switch to recovering bodies , and dozens more UN staff could be confirmed dead .

In the heat , the smell in places is becoming too strong to stomach . Haiti 's needs are massive , as ever in an earthquake - food , water and medicine . It also needs bulldozers and heavy lifting equipment , but perhaps more than anything it needs someone to take charge here .

'' 1710 Joel Achenbach in the Washington Post says rebuilding with reinforced concrete would literally create a more stable country . `` Obviously the US will send aid and relief workers , but we should do more than that : for a small fraction of what the United States is spending to bail out banks and auto firms we could help Haiti rebuild with reinforced concrete ...

Waterborne diseases spread like wildfire in temporary camps and dumping sub-standard materials not only is dangerous but undermines an existing yet fragile construction industry . '' 1651 The BBC 's Paul Adams in Washington says : `` For the second time in two days , President Obama went before the cameras to outline what his administration is doing . He was flanked by half a dozen senior members of his administration and it 's been reported that former presidents Bill Clinton and George W Bush have agreed to lend their support - a clear sign the president wants this to be a national effort which transcends all partisan politics .

Now it 's all go . Dog teams and lightsearch first with heavy rescue to follow this afternoon . Reports from the ground sound bad . Think it will be a long day . '' 1540 The BBC 's David Loyn in Dominican Republic says : `` The UK is one of the few countries whose search teams are classified at the highest level by the UN to do so called heavy rescues - the ability to burrow deep into collapsed buildings and bring out survivors . The most valued members of the party are two Labradors who will go in first . Holly and Echo are trained to sniff out the faintest traces of life amid the chaos and smell of death which will confront them in the devastation of Haiti . '' 1535 UK-based aid agency Save the Children says many children in Haiti will be `` petrified and in danger '' . Spokesman Gareth Owen tells Reuters : `` Many will have been orphaned or be badly injured themselves and in urgent need of medical help .

President Barack Obama is expected to make a statement shortly . 1440 Ruth Norbury , in Bristol , UK , writes in an email : `` My husband is from Haiti and has a large family that live in Carrefour , which is on the edge of the city . It must be a miracle because although the houses around them are broken , all 11 members of the family are still alive and uninjured and the house is ok too . All I can say to people is do n't give up hope just yet because among the darkness sometimes there is a small glimmer of light .

Normally the Haitian capital twinkles as night falls , the lights only dimmed by the regular power outages - but after the quake , the whole place lies in darkness apart from the few homes fortunate enough to be both still standing and equipped with a generator . At the airport , it is clear the relief operation has begun . A C130 military transport plane taxis before unloading its cargo . The airport is now a staging post for the international aid starting to arrive . The scenes outside the terminal , however , are chaotic - a shock to the senses , especially when an armored UN vehicle rolls through the car park as I struggle through a group of people demanding access to the airport . International aid has started arriving to Haiti As we begin the drive towards the center of the city , the devastating effects of the tremors can be fully seen - collapsed walls , a building that looks as if it has just been pulled apart from the middle , its flat roof laying on top of the foundations , a new hospital lying in ruins - a hole on the fourth floor where the operating rooms used to be . I had seen the pictures of the devastation - but they do not come close to the reality , it is much worse . Everywhere you look you see people on the street - walking about , sitting about , because there is nothing else to do . Scared of the aftershocks that have continued to shake the city , they stay outside because it is the safest place to be in case of more building collapses , and in many cases they do not have homes to which they can return . The night air is filled with the sound of singing and clapping as people gather to try and keep their spirits up , and from all across the city , voices can be heard . Next to living are the dead . Covered in blankets , their ash-covered limbs poke from beneath makeshift shrouds . Many city residents are spending the night outside , scared of new tremors There is no mortuary big enough for the numbers who have died . The only sign of anything being done is a commercial flat-bed van onto which police officers are stacking bodies . After winding our way through the hills in a 4x4 , past fallen trees and abandoned vehicles , we get close to where we are staying . It is in an upmarket part of Port-au-Prince , but the walls that kept Haiti 's poor out of the gated communities are no more . The razor wire is lying in the building debris alongside the steel supposed to keep it there . We eventually have to get out and walk . Someone warns me to look up and keep to the left - good advice , as the high wall next to me has concrete blocks hanging loose . The road is completely destroyed as we get closer to the house . Using my cellphone as a torch - its only use since nearly all communication is out , we clamber over tarmac ripped open by the quake . On this solitary road we find yet another body before making it to the safety of the compound , with its armed security guards . So I have light from a generator , even an internet connection , but I am spending the night outside . The building is too unsafe to sleep in because of the risk of further aftershocks .

BBC correspondents say the situation is increasingly desperate , with no coordinated rescue plan so far and aid only trickling in . The search for survivors continues but rescuers have little lifting equipment and are often using their bare hands . Tens of thousands are feared dead and up to three million affected . US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said the disaster is `` unimaginable '' and pledged long-term American assistance . Matthew Price , BBC News , Haiti It is clear that many who were brought to L'Hopital de la Paix in Port-au-Prince with injuries have since died here . One man with tears in his eyes pointed to his young daughter lying on the dirty tiled floor . She has two broken legs and a large gash in her head . Her sister is already dead . `` Ca va ? '' `` Oui , '' she replies softly , but she is not okay . In pockets , there is barely anything left of this city and so far the people are largely having to cope on their own . Aid groups say there is a race against time to find survivors under the rubble of the collapsed buildings - the first priority of the rescue effort . Heavy lifting gear and sniffer dogs are desperately needed to seek out trapped victims , with medicine , food and water also in short supply . Elisabeth Byrs of the UN 's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs , said : `` The priority is to find survivors . We are working against the clock . '' The head of Medecins du Monde , Olivier Bernard , told AFP news agency that aid had to arrive by Thursday evening . `` To save lives , surgery must be available ideally within the first 48 hours . '' A few US aid planes and a 50-strong Chinese rescue team with sniffer dogs have landed at the airport serving the capital , Port-au-Prince . Other plane-loads of rescuers and relief supplies are said to be on the way from the EU , Canada , Russia and Latin American nations . A British rescue team with heavy lifting gear and dogs has landed in the Dominican Republic and will be in Haiti later on Thursday . We just do n't know what to do . You can see how terrible the damage is . We have not been able to get into all the areas International Development Secretary Douglas Alexander said : `` This is a tragedy on a massive scale . Britain is playing its part in the huge international response . '' US President Barack Obama said the `` people of Haiti will have the full support of the United States '' in an `` aggressive '' aid campaign . Mrs Clinton canceled a trip to Asia to deal with the crisis . She said there were tens of thousands of casualties in Haiti and that tens of thousands of buildings had collapsed . `` This is going to be a long-term effort , '' she said . Her husband , Bill Clinton , the UN special envoy for Haiti , told the Washington Post the quake was `` one of the great humanitarian emergencies in the history of the Americas '' . The USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier will arrive on Thursday . The USS Bataan , carrying a Marine expeditionary unit , is also on its way . The Pentagon said it was `` seriously considering '' sending thousands of marines . The World Bank is funding $ 100m of emergency aid . Whole areas of the Haitian capital have been flattened The World Food Programme is working on supplying 15,000 tonnes of food and the Red Cross has begun a $ 10m appeal . The help is desperately needed as there is no coordinated rescue at present . Doctor 's assistant Jimitre Coquillon told Associated Press : `` This is much worse than a hurricane . There 's no water . Thirsty people are going to die . '' Haitian President Rene Preval could not give an official estimate of the dead , saying : `` I do n't know ... up to now , I heard 50,000 ... 30,000 . '' He spoke of how he stepped over dead bodies and heard cries of those trapped in the parliament building . Haiti is the poorest country in the western hemisphere and correspondents say it simply does not have the infrastructure to manage a rescue operation . A rescue team prepares to depart from Mexico City One Chilean UN peacekeeper told Reuters : `` We just do n't know what to do . You can see how terrible the damage is . We have not been able to get into all the areas . '' The UN peacekeepers , who played a key role in maintaining public order in Haiti even before the quake , have been deployed to control any outbreaks of unrest as reports come in of looting . The UN says 16 personnel are confirmed dead and more than 100 staff are still unaccounted for . They include UN mission head Hedi Annabi . Brazil says the death toll of its peacekeepers has risen from 11 to 14 . Medical aid agency Medecins sans Frontieres reported a `` massive influx '' of casualties at its makeshift clinics , many of them with severe injuries . Patients with `` severe traumas , head wounds , crushed limbs '' have been streaming into MSF 's temporary structures but the agency is only able to offer them basic medical care , spokesman Paul McPhun told reporters . Thousands of Haitians spent a second night in the open on Wednesday , too scared to sleep inside damaged buildings . Many sang hymns to keep up their spirits . The BBC 's Matthew Price visited the grounds of one hospital and spoke of seeing about 100 bodies - but there were many people bedding down for the night to sleep among the dead .

While the full scale of the disaster has yet to emerge , it is clear it represents a huge challenge . Haiti , the poorest country in the western hemisphere , is still struggling to recover from devastating hurricanes in 2008 . So far , only a trickle of aid flights have arrived in Haiti , which needs all kinds of help - from search and rescue teams and medical aid , to food aid and then longer-term rebuilding of infrastructure . The US is mobilising a huge military and civilian aid effort as President Barack Obama pledged a `` swift , co-ordinated and aggressive '' to save lives . He put the US international development agency - USAID in charge of co-ordinating the country 's aid effort . Military overflights have been assessing damage and civilian disaster assistance teams have begun arriving . The US military had ordered an aircraft carrier and three ships , including one which can carry up to 2,000 US Marines , to head for Haiti , officials said . The Americans are playing a key role in central co-ordination on the ground in Haiti - largely because they have more functioning infrastructure than anyone else . The US embassy in the capital Port-au-Prince is intact ; communications equipment for rescue teams has been flown in . Haitian communities in the US itself - including south Florida where an estimated 275,000 Haitians live - are also organising donations and relief efforts . Several international aid agencies have offices and staff in Haiti , usually working on long-term aid and reconstruction . It is already evident that this is an extremely serious situation , the long-term effects of which are going to need substantial support They began mobilising emergency teams in response to the quake . Oxfam says it has staff ready , including a public health , water and sanitation team in the capital , Port-au-Prince . The organization also had emergency supplies in Panama which could be taken in , a spokesman said . The International Red Cross says it is releasing emergency funds to help deal with the disaster . Red Cross warehouses in Port-au-Prince which survived the earthquake had basic aid for about 10,000 families and a further 20,000 aid kits are being transported from Panama , a spokesman said . The British Red Cross has launched an appeal in the UK and has released # 200,000 -LRB- $ 325,000 -RRB- from its disaster fund to ensure money is immediately available . The international humanitarian group , Medecins Sans Frontieres -LRB- MSF -RRB- , said many people in Port-au-Prince had sought medical help , and that it had set up makeshift clinics offering basic care as its buildings had been seriously damaged . MSF plans to send dozens more staff to Haiti to help workers based there . UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said $ 10m would be released immediately from the world body 's central emergency response fund to assist aid efforts . He said an emergency appeal for additional funds from member states would follow . Bill Clinton : '' What we need now is food , water , supplies '' The UN World Food Programme - which already runs extensive feeding operations in the country - said it would begin distributing high energy biscuits , which require no preparation before being consumed . The WFP also said it would airlift 86 metric tons of food from its emergency hub in El Salvador , enough for 30,000 people in urgent need to be fed for up to seven days . `` In a normal day the World Food Programme will be feeding one or two million people in Haiti - and now we need to do even more , because the people have lost everything , '' a spokeswoman said . The UN stabilisation force in Haiti , Minustah , has said about 100 or more of its staff are still unaccounted for after buildings collapsed . The Minustah mission has more than 9,000 police and troops stationed in Haiti , as well as 488 international civilian staff and local staff . Its forces are drawn from more than 40 countries , including Brazil , China and Pakistan . Several Minustah nations have said they are preparing to send aid . The UN has set up a logistics center at Haiti 's main airport . France , which has historic links with Haiti and some 1,400 nationals living there , is sending two planes with rescuers and humanitarian aid , one from the Caribbean island of Martinique and a second one with aid experts from Marseille . It also plans to evacuate about 60 injured people . French civil safety authorities said a total of 130 rescuers , doctors and nurses as well as trained rescue dogs were due to arrive in Haiti , with 12 tonnes of aid and rescue material .

Experts say the region is a seismically active area . The Seismic Research Unit of the University of the West Indies says hundreds of earthquakes occur each year , in and around the Eastern Caribbean , the area it monitors . Not all are felt , however , but they are recorded by scientists . The first earthquake in the sub-region this year was recorded on 4 January at 11:36 p.m. local time north of Paria Peninsula in northern Venezuela - an area that separates the Gulf of Paria and Caribbean Sea . The earthquake was reported as felt in Glencoe , Westmoorings in Trinidad . No damage was reported . Tuesday 's huge magnitude 7.0 tremor in Haiti in the western Caribbean was the largest ever known to hit Haiti , according to the US Geological Survey . It was also the worst for 200 years and among the largest ever in the region . The death toll is still unknown but could run into the tens of thousands . That would dwarf the figures for other major quakes in the Caribbean , mostly from the distant past . For instance , in 1692 in Jamaica , a quake of an unspecified magnitude killed 2,000 ; in Leeward Islands in 1843 , an 8.3-magnitude quake killed 5,000 ; and another in Jamaica in 1907 , a 6.5-magnitude quake killed 1,000 . The Haiti quake occurred along a vertical fault line that runs from Montego Bay , Jamaica , to the southern part of Hispaniola , the island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic . Paul Mann of the University of Texas at Austin says the plates have been pushing against that particular fault since a major quake in 1760 . Earthquakes have not been a priority in the Caribbean when it comes to disaster planning . But that could change , according to Simon Young , supervisor of the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility . `` Coming off a slow hurricane season , there will be a lot more talk about earthquake exposure in the Caribbean , '' he told Business News Americas news service . `` This needs to be on the agenda all the time , but unfortunately it takes big events to bring it back to the forefront . '' Seismologist Joan Latchman told the Trinidad Express newspaper : `` We need to be prepared because it is better to prepare and it does n't happen , than we do n't prepare and it does .

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon listed 16 peacekeeping soldiers and police who are known to have died . The UN said it urgently needed medical support and rescue teams with heavy lifting equipment . The head of UN peacekeeping , Alain Le Roy , said UN police and troops in Haiti had secured the port and airport . They were also patrolling and helping clear roads , he added . Among those missing are UN mission head Hedi Annabi of Tunisia and his chief deputy , Luis Carlos da Costa . Hedi Annabi is a Tunisian diplomat Edmond Mulet , Mr Annabi 's predecessor , is on his way to Port-au-Prince to take charge of the peacekeeping mission in an interim capacity . Ten Brazilian peacekeepers , three from Jordan and a Haitian staff member are among those confirmed to have died . China 's state media said eight Chinese were dead and 10 more missing . The UN said earlier that at least 56 of its staff had been injured in the earthquake . The Minustah mission has been in Haiti since 2004 , following the ousting of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide . Its mandate is to maintain law and order in the impoverished and often violent state and to administer security during election periods . Minustah , an acronym from the French Mission Nations Unies de Stabilisation en Haiti , has about 9,000 multinational peacekeepers . Brazil is the biggest contributor and is in charge . A UN logistical base near the airport is functioning and the UN expects to get an emergency response team on the ground shortly . Brazil took charge of the Minustah operation in 2004 . The BBC 's Gary Duffy in Sao Paulo says that given Brazil 's central role the earthquake has caused a lot of concern and shock . He says it has been a desperately worrying time for the families of the more than 1,200 Brazilian soldiers in the UN mission . Some soldiers have managed to make contact to reassure relatives , but given the damage to infrastructure at Brazilian bases , communication is proving difficult , even for the government , our correspondent says . Brazil 's leadership of the UN mission has been difficult , amid continuing gang violence . Minustah has been criticised by business leaders for being too lenient and by rights groups for using excessive force .

Medical aid agency Medecins sans Frontieres reported a `` massive influx '' of casualties at its makeshift clinics , many of them with severe injuries . The search for survivors under the rubble went on after darkness . Substantial foreign aid for the three million people said to be in need is due to begin arriving within hours . Matthew Price , BBC News , Haiti Twenty-four hours after the earthquake , and we flew into Port-au-Prince . Just along the tarmac we found some aid trickling in . The airport buildings here have been damaged but not , it seems , the runway . Many of those who can , are leaving . Millions , though , are left behind in a country that can barely function , even without a disaster . Many of the UN peacekeepers stationed here are among the dead . This country - so often forgotten by the world - now needs its help more than ever . The first US aid planes have already landed at the airport serving the capital , Port-au-Prince , and US naval ships are on the way . EU states , Russia and China are among those sending rescue and medical teams by plane while pledges of aid have been made by countries around Latin America . UN peacekeepers , who played a key role in maintaining public order in Haiti even before the quake , have been deployed to control any outbreaks of unrest as reports come in of looting . The BBC 's Andy Gallacher in Port-au-Prince says the situation in the capital is increasingly desperate with no sense of a coordinated rescue effort , scant medical supplies and aid only trickling in . Haitian President Rene Preval could not give an official estimate of the dead , saying : `` I do n't know ... up to now , I heard 50,000 ... 30,000 . '' He spoke of how he stepped over dead bodies and heard cries of those trapped in the parliament building . The 7.0-magnitude quake , Haiti 's worst in two centuries , struck at 1653 local time -LRB- 2153 GMT -RRB- on Tuesday , just 15km -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- south-west of Port-au-Prince and close to the surface . We just do n't know what to do . You can see how terrible the damage is . We have not been able to get into all the areas Thousands of Haitians gathered in open spaces overnight in the capital on Wednesday , too scared to sleep inside damaged buildings . Many sang hymns to keep up their spirits . The BBC 's Matthew Price visited the grounds of one hospital and spoke of seeing about 100 bodies - but there were many people bedding down for the night to sleep among the dead . Efforts to rescue survivors trapped in rubble have been hampered by the lack of heavy lifting equipment and much of the work is being done by individuals with simple tools or their hands . One Chilean UN peacekeeper told Reuters : `` We just do n't know what to do . You can see how terrible the damage is . We have not been able to get into all the areas . '' The luckier survivors have been treated by UN and MSF medics Haiti is the poorest country in the western hemisphere and our correspondent says it simply does not have the infrastructure to manage a rescue operation . He says that there have also been a number of aftershocks and people are very frightened - a number of Haitians were panicked overnight by a false rumor that a tsunami was approaching the island . Patients with `` severe traumas , head wounds , crushed limbs '' have been streaming into MSF 's temporary structures but the agency is only able to offer them basic medical care , spokesman Paul McPhun told reporters in Toronto . One of MSF 's emergency medical facilities collapsed during the quake while the other two were so badly damaged they became unusable , he said . At least 1,000 people have sought help at three temporary MSF sites , including some 50 people who were treated for burns caused by domestic gas containers exploding in collapsing buildings . With many of Haiti 's communication lines down , Haitians living abroad have been battling to get through to relatives . In the main Haitian community in the US , Miami 's Little Haiti , people have been meeting to pray and to raise money for relief efforts .

Rescue workers need to be swift to assess where they are most likely to find survivors inside collapsed buildings . Stairwells or the spaces under large concrete beams can provide what rescue workers call ` voids ' . It is in places like these that the living can be found . Local people often know the best locations to begin the search for survivors . After speaking to them rescue workers can quickly select the most promising place to begin their work . Diggers -LRB- here pictured in India -RRB- and hydraulic jacks are among the heavy machinery that rescue workers employ to shift rubble . Large concrete slabs on the outside of buildings can be pulled aside by diggers , enabling rescuers to get a view of any people still trapped inside . Specialist sound equipment can detect the faintest of noises to within a few metres . Silence on the site is needed while a member of the rescue team bangs three times and hopes to hear a response . Carbon dioxide detectors can be used to find survivors rendered unconscious . They work best in confined spaces where they detect the greater CO2 concentration in the air exhaled by those still breathing . Video cameras placed on the end of flexible poles can be squeezed through gaps in the rubble to help locate survivors . Using this technique means time is saved as less rubble is shifted unnecessarily . Thermal imaging equipment can be used to locate people not directly in a rescuer 's line of sight as their body heat can warm the rubble around them . Many of the buildings in Haiti are made of flimsy materials . Buildings like these are quick to collapse in an earthquake but their light weight and low height can give people a relatively good chance of getting out . Dogs are extremely effective at using their sense of smell to pick up on signs of life that human rescuers can not . They are also able to cover large areas quickly , speeding up the search and rescue process . Heavy-lifting equipment is in short supply in Haiti , leaving some rescuers little option but to shift rubble by hand or with pick-axes and shovels . Other tools used by rescuers include chainsaws , disc-cutters and rebar cutters - which can be used to tackle the metal bars in reinforced concrete . How long can search and rescue last ? The co-ordinating agency , usually the UN , and the host country , have to take the difficult decision of when to stop looking for a few remaining trapped people and concentrate resources on looking after the thousands of other survivors . The average time for this switch is between five and seven days , but individuals have been known to survive as long as 13 days trapped if they have access to water .

But the scale of the disaster has shed new light on the problem in the impoverished Caribbean nation . Tens of thousands are feared dead after being crushed by buildings that collapsed . Scores more remain trapped under the rubble . `` It 's sub-standard construction , '' says London-based architect John McAslan , who has been working on a project linked to the Clinton Global Initiative in the country . `` There are n't any building codes as we would recognize them , '' he added . Mr McAslan says most buildings are made of masonry - bricks or construction blocks - which tend to perform badly in an earthquake . Concrete blocks are being made in people 's backyards and dried out in the sun There are also significant problems with the quality of building materials used , says Peter Haas , head of the Appropriate Infrastructure Development Group , a US-based non-profit group that has been working in Haiti since 2006 . `` People are skimping on cement to try to cut costs , putting a lot of water in , building too thin , and you end up with a structure that 's innately weaker , '' said Mr Haas , who was on his way to Haiti to help assess the safety of damaged buildings . `` Concrete blocks are being made in people 's backyards and dried out in the sun , '' he said . Mr Haas said there were also `` serious problems '' with the enforcement of building codes in Haiti . He said the government did not function at all in several parts of the country , and many communities lacked basic services such as electricity , sanitation services or access to clean water . `` So the problem of code enforcement is low down on the list , '' he said . Even before the quake , Haiti 's building safety record was poor . Almost 100 people - mostly children - died when two schools collapsed within days of each other in November 2008 . At the time , Haitian authorities blamed poor construction for the accidents . Roger Musson , head of seismic hazard at the British Geological Survey , said he was `` not at all '' surprised at the level of destruction in Haiti . Some homes on hillsides collapsed on to the ones below -LRB- Photo : American Red Cross -RRB- He said Haiti , the poorest country in the western hemisphere , was not used to dealing with earthquakes of this magnitude . Tuesday 's quake was the worst in two centuries . The country is more used to dealing with hurricanes , which have been getting more frequent in recent years , according to Mr Musson . `` Most buildings are like a house of cards , '' he said . `` They can stand up to the forces of gravity , but if you have a sideways movement , it all comes tumbling down . '' Ironically , people living in the shanty towns might have had a better chance of survival than those trapped under concrete buildings , many of which `` pancaked '' . `` A simple shack 's collapse is likely to cause less damage to human safety than a multi-floor building that collapses , '' Mr McAslan said . Mr McAslan says it is more complex and expensive to earthquake-proof a building than equip it for hurricane damage . `` The priorities have inevitably been elsewhere , but I 'm absolutely certain that the attention of the government will be to build back better . '' He said the main task for the authorities now was to save as many lives as possible , then to stabilise damaged buildings so they could withstand any aftershocks , and finally , to assess how to create buildings that could reasonably withstand another earthquake . According to Mr McAslan , the extent of deforestation in Haiti also contributed to devastation . He said that on the hillsides of Petionville , a suburb east of Port-au-Prince , buildings simply `` collapsed and collapsed and collapsed '' on to each other as there was no forest to protect them . According to the US Geological Survey , the loss of life from earthquakes is typically 10 times higher in developing countries than the West and the damage can be up to 100 times worse .

The earthquake had a magnitude of seven , and there were a number of aftershocks . BBC News website readers have been describing how the earthquake has affected them . SUSAN WESTWOOD , PORT AU PRINCE , HAITI I am a paediatric nurse working for an orphanage just outside Port-au-Prince . I was in the intensive care room looking after a nine-month-old baby girl when the earthquake hit . The floor started shaking violently and the whole building shook from side to side . It lasted about 45 seconds . After that , there was a constant shuddering . The babies were really frightened and started to cry . Other staff and carers were screaming , they were so terrified . It was very upsetting . A collapsed apartment in Cabaret , Haiti . Picture : Michael Gill I could n't stand upright so I dropped to my knees . I was able to keep hold of the baby girl and I grabbed hold of another baby . Objects were falling from shelves , there was debris crashing all around . I clung on to the babies and shielded them as best I could . Then came the aftershocks . It was impossible to even move . After a while we managed to take all the children out onto the driveway . We spent the whole night outside . It was chilly but we were OK . Some children are dehydrated now though because we could n't get any medical supplies out of the building . Thank goodness our building is alright as is our other home up the road . I ca n't believe there 's no damage and that we are all safe . I clung on to the babies and shielded them as best I could We have 85 children under two-years-old here at the God 's Littlest Angels home . We also run another orphanage up the road . The age group there is from two to 11 . There are 65 children there . All the children in our care are incredibly vulnerable . Most of them are n't orphans but they are here because their families ca n't afford to look after them . Haiti is very , very poor . I see a lot of children who are malnourished . Often , it is too late by the time they come to us . Others are here because they are premature babies and we can look after them . When I look around the area and see that other buildings have just crumbled to the ground , I know that soon we will have lots more babies and young children to care for . I was driving through the mountains on my way home to Jacmel when the car started to shake . It was like a very strong wind was blowing and I nearly lost control of the car . Rocks started falling on the road . I continued driving slowly and I saw people in the road screaming . The mountain was collapsing and a building to one side had already fallen down . A huge dust plume raised from the valley floor . I just knew that if I had reached that spot five minutes earlier , I would have been killed I drove further and found the road totally blocked by a massive landslide on the road . I just knew that if I had reached that spot five minutes earlier , I would have been killed . I had to abandon the car and continue on foot . I run a food security project in Haiti which focuses on improved agriculture , mother and child health nutrition and early warning systems . I prepare for natural disasters but mainly for hurricanes not earthquakes ! We have offices across Haiti . Our office in Jacmel seems to be intact , but there is major destruction here . My staff in Jacmel are all safe but I ca n't reach my people in Port au Prince . Last night they asked all Jacmel residents to sleep on the airstrip as the aftershocks continued and there was major damage to houses in Jacmel . CHRISTINE BLANCHARD , NEW JERSEY , USA My family is still missing . The phone lines are down and I have n't been able to get in touch with them . I was born and raised in Haiti . My parents and I came to America a few years ago but the rest of my family , my grandparents , aunts , uncles , cousins and friends are still there . It 's just so awful . I feel sick with worry . I am devastated I am using social network sites to try to track them down . I know this is how a lot of my friends have got in touch with each other . I 've heard that a lot of people are at the Hotel Oloffson because it 's one of the few hotels still standing . I 'm in touch with people there and they will let me know if any of my family arrive . I have been up all night trying to get in touch with people . Haiti is very small so everybody knows everybody else , I hope this will help . It 's just so awful . I feel sick with worry . I know every building that has collapsed . I know how long those buildings took to build and now they are just rubble .

Glenis Willmott said fellow MEP Mr Griffin was trying to `` stir up racial hatred '' in his comments , made on social media websites on Thursday . She said : `` How can anyone not look at those horrific pictures from Haiti and not feel compassion ? '' In response Mr Griffin described UK aid to Haiti as `` stinking elite hypocrisy '' . Mr Griffin 's original postings , on Facebook and Twitter , said : `` While the Haiti earthquake is terrible , the winter death toll in Britain will be similar . No aid here though . '' About 45,000-50 ,000 people have died since Tuesday 's 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit Haiti 's capital , Port-au-Prince and 300,000 have been made homeless , according to UN estimates . The Pan American Health Organization has estimated that the death toll could be as high as 100,000 . Ms Willmott , Labor MEP for the East Midlands , said : `` Yes , people will die here this winter , even though the Labor government set up a welfare state that spends billions to help prevent too many deaths . '' She added : `` Our government and local councils are quite rightly funded to do all they can to help everyone suffering from the cold . `` But I am also proud that our government will do all it can to help the people in Haiti and I totally support all the work done by the charities to get supplies out there as soon as possible .

There is little sign of aid supplies beyond the airport , and correspondents cite increasing anger among survivors . Many are spending another day without food and shelter in the ruined capital . The US defense secretary said the Haiti relief effort was the main US priority in the western hemisphere , as an aircraft carrier arrived off the coast . And the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Adm Mike Mullen , said a hospital ship and more helicopters would be sent in the coming days , and 9-10 ,000 troops would be in or off Haiti by Monday . On Friday , the UN said a total of about $ 270m -LRB- # 165m -RRB- in international aid had been pledged so far for the relief effort . It will launch an emergency appeal for $ 550m later on Friday , UN spokeswoman Corinne Momal-Vanian said . People are doing what they can to survive here in Port-au-Prince . Every morning the first jobs of the day involve getting the very basics . Loaded with old plastic bottles or anything else that can hold water , they fill up where they can . Some from broken pipes from collapsed buildings , that still have a supply . The relief effort is under way , the near constant buzz of planes landing with supplies can be heard overhead . On the ground the aid is materialising slowly . There are still bodies on the streets , but for those who can afford it , those who can be identified , a decent burial . I saw six men carrying a roughly carved casket , singing as they walked toward the cemetery . But for others , a less dignified burial , as mass graves have started to be used across the city . On the ground , correspondents say there is little immediate sign of a co-ordinated relief effort . The UN 's World Food Programme -LRB- WFP -RRB- says that in total two million people will need food aid , but that it has so far managed to feed just 4,000 . Meanwhile the head of the charity Medecins Sans Frontieres -LRB- Doctors Without Borders -RRB- said thousands of people were waiting for surgical treatment in Haiti 's hospitals , AFP news agency reported . Port-au-Prince 's small airport is filled to capacity and US air traffic controllers have taken charge of air traffic control to help manage the influx of planes . However because of fuel shortages , some aircraft are clogging up the tarmac . Meanwhile the port is too damaged to use and roads are blocked by debris . The BBC 's Andy Gallacher in Port-au-Prince says survivors are dying in huge numbers , and clean water , food and medical supplies are desperately needed . `` We hear on the radio that rescue teams are coming from the outside , but nothing is coming , '' said one man , Jean-Baptiste Lafontin Wilfried . They want us to provide them with help , which is , of course , what we want to do `` Our biggest problem is insecurity , '' Delfin Antonio Rodriguez , the rescue commander from the neighbouring Dominican Republic , told AFP news agency on Friday . `` Yesterday they tried to hijack some of our trucks . Today we were barely able to work in some places because of that . '' The WFP initially said its warehouses in Port-au-Prince been looted , but this was later denied . `` We do still have that 6,000 tonnes of food , '' spokeswoman Caroline Hurford told the BBC . `` Apparently there were unconfirmed reports of looting taking place but once our teams got down to the dockside they were able to see that there was some mistake . '' Shaul Schwarz , a photographer for Time magazine , told the BBC he had seen a roadblock formed with bodies of quake victims on a main road , south of the capital . He said he believed this was an `` act of anger '' on the part of people who are not getting help . About 45,000-50 ,000 people have died since Tuesday 's 7.0 magnitude earthquake and 300,000 have been made homeless , the UN estimates . US President Barack Obama said some US rescuers were already on the ground in Haiti and more were on their way . Speaking on Thursday , he promised the country `` every element of our national capacity , our diplomacy , and development assistance '' . US defense secretary Robert Gates said the relief effort was the `` highest priority for US military assets in this hemisphere '' , and all necessary resources would be made available . The USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier has arrived in Haiti and the USS Bataan , carrying a marine expeditionary unit , is on its way .

It was the worst earthquake to hit the Caribbean nation in over a century and flattened entire neighborhoods in some places . Science in Action speaks to Mike Kendall , Professor of Seismology at the Department of Earth Sciences at Bristol University in the UK to look into the reasons why this earthquake caused as much damage as it did . GENE MAP OF PLANT MAY PROVIDE CHEAPER MALARIA DRUGS Artemisia annua is a plant used to create highly effective drugs to fight Malaria . These drugs are expensive , and despite an increase in demand , production and planting areas are reducing . However , the publication of the genetic map of the plant has given new hope scientists looking to make cheaper drugs in larger quantities . The genetic map will help scientists determine which of the plants will give high yields and will help develop variants suitable for growing in diverse conditions . Professor Ian Graham of the Centre for Novel Agricultural Products at the University of York tells Jon Stewart all about these breakthroughs . PUBLIC CONSULTATIONS OVER INTRODUCTION OF GM CROPS IN INDIA Proposals to introduce GM crops in India have faced many protests in the past . Now , a government-appointed committee has given the go-ahead for the introduction of Bt brinjal , a genetically modified variety with the ability to produce its own pesticide . Many organic activists and farmers are worried by this step and the government plans to hold a series of public consultations until mid-February before taking a final decision . Science in Action 's Tinku Ray visits the state of Karnataka to find out more . SOLAR-POWERED IRRIGATION BENEFICIAL IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA Irrigation has been said to be a good way to help people out of poverty , by allowing them to grow crops all year long , instead of just when it rains . It can also help in adapting to potential changes in the climate . A recent study that analyzed the effectiveness of solar-powered irrigation in Benin has concluded that it improves both the diet of the people as well as their household income . Dr Jennifer Burney from Stanford University studied the solar-powered systems installed by an organization called the Solar Electric Light Fund in two villages in Benin and tells Science in Action what she found . Galaxies are clusters of billions and trillions of stars , each unique in some way color , shape or orientation . But why did each galaxy not end up identical to all others ? Jon Stewart visited Dr Andrew Benson at the California Institute of Technology , hoping to find an answer .

The US is sending up to 3,500 troops and 2,200 marines but correspondents say aid is so far only trickling in . President Barack Obama pledged one of the biggest relief efforts in recent US history and said Haiti would `` not be forgotten '' in its hour of need . Aid groups say they need food , water , medical supplies and lifting equipment . President Obama and French President Nicolas Sarkozy , working with Brazil , Canada and other countries , will organise a conference on reconstruction in Haiti , the French presidency has announced . The Red Cross estimates that up to three million people in Haiti have been affected by Tuesday 's earthquake . Haitian president speaks of sadness Many are spending another night without shelter or in makeshift camps in the ruined capital , Port-au-Prince . Correspondents there say bodies are piling up in the streets and there is still no sign of a co-ordinated relief effort . Speaking in Washington on Thursday , Mr Obama said some US rescuers were already on the ground in Haiti and more were on their way . He promised the country `` every element of our national capacity , our diplomacy , and development assistance , the power of our military and most importantly , the compassion of our country '' following the disaster . `` To the people of Haiti , we say clearly and with conviction , you will not be forsaken , you will not be forgotten , '' he said . Haiti is at a critical juncture at the moment . I 've come across two schools that have completely collapsed , you could see the bodies trapped inside - but there were no rescue teams on the ground . I have n't seen anyone in the two days I 've been here . Haitians are still digging through the rubble with their hands . The bodies are beginning to build up , both on the streets and in public spaces . There are no coffins here , no arrangements for burials . There is no sense that the promised relief efforts have begun in earnest . The US Federal Aviation Authority earlier temporarily stopped civilian relief flights to Haiti at the Haitian government 's request because there was not enough space on the ground for more planes . Aid groups say it is a race against time to find people trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings . We just do n't know what to do . You can see how terrible the damage is . We have not been able to get into all the areas UN emergency relief co-ordinator John Holmes said search and rescue teams were the first priority and had begun to arrive in Haiti . `` They 're now beginning , I hope , to make a difference . Every hour counts for this , as you know , '' he said . `` And of course we 're trying to get the medical aid in as fast as possible but it 's clear that the local facilities are overwhelmed . We need to get more doctors , field hospitals and supplies on the ground . '' The BBC 's Matthew Price in Port-au-Prince says Haiti is in massive need of food , water and medicine , as well as bulldozers and heavy lifting equipment . But perhaps more than anything it needs someone to take charge here , our correspondent says . The government is fragile at the best of times and there is no sense it is able to do anything for now . The director of Port-au-Prince 's general hospital said that by 1100 -LRB- 1600 GMT -RRB- at least 1,500 bodies were already stacked inside and outside the mortuary , with police continuing to bring more corpses on pick-up trucks , Reuters reports . Ban Ki-moon : `` Haiti will need every ounce of help we can offer '' A United Nations spokesman in Haiti , David Wimhurst , said 188 UN staff remained unaccounted for following the collapse of the organization 's HQ in Port-au-Prince and that 36 UN military and police personnel were confirmed dead . UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said it could be days before even an estimate of the overall death toll from the earthquake could be made , but said he feared it would be `` very high '' . On a note of hope , he recounted the survival of an Estonian UN official who was detected under 4m -LRB- 13ft -RRB- of rubble after scratching noises were heard . He was dug out and is now in hospital . Mr Ban also praised the readiness of the international community to help . A British rescue team with heavy lifting gear and dogs has reached Haiti . Other plane-loads of rescuers and relief supplies are being sent from China , the EU , Canada , Russia and Latin American nations . Cuba had more than 300 doctors in Haiti before the earthquake and they have been treating the injured in field hospitals . US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , who canceled a trip to Asia to deal with the crisis , said Haiti 's recovery was `` going to be a long-term effort '' . The World Bank is funding $ 100m of emergency aid . The World Food Programme is working on supplying 15,000 tonnes of food and the Red Cross has begun a $ 10m appeal .

For many of Britain 's estimated 1,000 Haitian emigres , it will be the first time they have met other Haitians in the UK . Up to 50,000 people on the Caribbean island are feared dead and millions more are known to be homeless . But the crippled communications network means very little information is getting out to the outside world . It is a problem Shelane Chapman , who has been pacing the floors of her home for the past few days sick with worry , knows much about . Shelane , from Downham in Kent , said : `` We 're sick with worry because we ca n't get through at all . We keep redialling my mother 's mobile number but it just wo n't work . If the house has gone , where could she be ? Where could they all be ? '' Her mother , Gisele Augustine-Senatuy , 62 , a pregnant sister and 11 other relatives , are missing . Shelane Chapman still does not know the whereabouts of her mother Although she has heard rumors that her mother 's house collapsed in the earthquake , killing her six-year-old cousin , she has been unable to verify the news . The expectant mother has even opened an account on the social networking site Twitter specifically to help her try to contact her family and friends but it has not yet helped . `` My seven-year-old daughter Genevive is scared about what has happened to her gran . She said she wished she was a magician so she could make the bad thing that happened to Haiti go away , '' she said . Another worried Haitian , Jean-Marc Flambert has taken a stoic approach to news of deaths in his family . He has 50 family members still in Haiti , but is already aware of his uncle 's death . He said : `` My uncle who was recovering from cancer , was lying in bed with his wife when the concrete ceiling fell on him . `` He died immediately but his wife was there for three hours before she could be rescued . She is in pain but is relying on home remedies . There is just no point going to the hospital . '' He is aware of other family members trapped in their homes but said he feels they are in a worse position as they are waiting to die . `` When I heard about my uncle , I thought it was better for him that he was dead than have to wait when rescuers probably would not be able to make it . '' Jean-Marc Flambert wants to help the relief effort The father-of-one said that part of him just wanted to jump on a plane and go out there and help . `` But I 'm not a doctor , I ca n't drive a truck - I 'd be draining resources . It is far better for me to be here and do what I can . `` I 've got in touch with other Haitians and we 're meeting on Saturday . `` When I first came here I was convinced there were very few of us around but now more of us are getting in contact and meeting up because of what has happened . '' This is something Judith Craig of United Haitians in the UK -LRB- UHUK -RRB- can verify . She said the charity has seen its membership jump since the earthquake hit . She attributed the increase to people wanting to find out more and seek solidarity with others . She said Haitians in the UK were pulling together as `` people 's lives are dependent on this '' . The charity supports a primary school in Port-au-Prince but they do not know what has happened to the pupils or the staff as they simply can not get in touch with anyone linked to it . Ms Craig said : `` We are only a small charity but we want to do something to help in the long-term . Everybody has friends or family out there and we all want to help . We are trying to mobilise people and organise a fundraising concert in London on 23 January . We have to do something . '' Barbara Jones , from Milton Keynes , feels she is one of the more lucky ones as she has finally been able to verify that most of her family are safe . She said : `` I had not heard from my mother , my cousins or my aunt , since the earthquake hit , but a relative in the US managed to get through to them and find out how they were . `` My mother is still missing but nobody else is hurt and their house in Petionville is just one of two or three buildings still standing in a street where there used to be many . `` I still have to speak to them but I feel relieved . '' She plans to return home later this year and present her four-month-old baby Megan to her family - something at one point she feared would never happen .

For the latest developments , please go to our main news page . 2259 The BBC 's Andy Gallagher in Port-au-Prince says : `` The airport is now busier than ever . But even as the plans land , and the supplies are unloaded , there are major problems distributing the aid . Much of it remains on the runway - tents , blankets and medical supplies sitting unused . Military personnel told me the logistical complexity of working out of such a tiny airport is a major stumbling block . But the fact remains that very little aid has reached those who need it . In the city itself , I have seen the UN handing out supplies . But it is the injured and dying who require most help . Haiti has now handed over control of the airport to the US , a move that could finally speed up the relief effort . '' 2255 Lord Malloch Brown , the former UN deputy secretary general , tells the BBC that the rescue effort has been damaged by the loss of much of the UN team in Haiti , but that it is well-placed to recover quickly . `` Obviously any organization which so tragically has its leadership decapitated is in chaos for a bit . But in fact the UN is much bigger in Port-au-Prince than it is in most places in the world because of the big peacekeeping operation there . The UN is in a better place to regroup and recover than would be the case in many parts of the world where natural disasters strike and the UN has almost no presence . But I think the really big factor here is the proximity to the US , which is able to project by far the most capable logistics operations in crises like this , '' he says . 2237 US Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano says undocumented Haitians in the United States will be granted `` temporary protected status '' , which will allow those eligible to continue living and working there for the next 18 months . There are an estimated 30,000 Haitians living illegally in the US . TPS is granted to foreigners who may not be able to return safely to their country because of a natural disaster , armed conflict or other reasons . 2228 UK International Development Secretary Douglas Alexander tells the BBC those involved in the aid operation are working against the clock . `` We are acutely aware that at this stage in the crisis every hour matters - that 's why we have our British firefighters on the ground already , trying to save lives . We 'll be working round the clock to make sure not just that we save lives , but we tend to the needs of those who have been left devastated by this terrible earthquake . '' 2224 US pop star Madonna announces she will donate $ 250,000 to to assist Haiti 's earthquake victims through the charity , Partners in Health . `` My prayers are with the people of Haiti . I ca n't imagine the terrible pain and suffering they are experiencing , '' she says . 2219 The BBC 's Matthew Price in Port-au-Prince says : `` I have been standing outside a nursing college in the capital for several hours . One desperate woman , who is part of the management team , has told me that inside the remains of the college , which used to be five storeys high , there are 260 dead bodies and 25 people still alive , even after three days . She says the principal has received a text message from inside to that effect . A Brazilian rescue team has been trying to get access to them , but progress has been very slow . The several hundred locals gathered nearby are getting increasing alarmed . '' 2208The BBC 's Nick Davis in Port-au-Prince says : `` On one of the main roads from the airport into the city , you would expect to see convoys of trucks carrying aid . But there are n't any . A logjam at the airport caused by the logistical nightmare of the earthquake , and the poor infrastructure that existed before Tuesday , makes getting the help where it is needed almost impossible . At one cemetery nearby , bodies have been turning up all day . The hope is the urgent supplies will arrive before more die . '' 2202 The commander of the USS Carl Vinson , Adm Ted Branch , tells the BBC that more food supplies are expected in Haiti on Saturday as they arrive from the US military base at Guantanamo Bay . A shorter flying time has been made possible by an agreement with Cuba allowing US relief flights to use Cuban air space . `` When the supplies do start to rolling in , we 'll have our procedures in order , and we 'll be able to more efficiently deliver the relief , '' he says . 2156 Apparent delays in aid reaching survivors have prompted anger across Haiti , and there have been reports of looting . But Ian Rodgers of Save the Children says its teams in Port-au-Prince have not seen any evidence of crime . `` As we move through areas , people are desperately expressing what their needs are , and calling for assistance . But the population is still at this point being very , very supportive , '' he tells the BBC . People ran from police when they tried to stop supplies being taken from shops 2149 Mrs Clinton says they will remain at Port-au-Prince 's airport during the visit and will not be using any valuable resources needed for the relief effort . She said she had been asked to come by Haiti . 2142 US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says at a news conference that she will go to Haiti on Saturday with USAID administrator Rajiv Shah . `` We will be meeting President -LRB- Rene -RRB- Preval and other members of the Haitian government along with the members of the US government team on the ground , '' she says . 2130 UN humanitarian chief John Holmes launches a flash appeal for $ 562m , saying the aid is needed for three million people affected by the earthquake for a period of six months . 2056 Reuters news agency quotes secretary of state for public safety Aramick Louis as saying the authorities have buried 40,000 bodies and believe another 100,000 probably died . 2045 Haiti 's Prime Minister , Jean-Max Bellerive , says more than 15,000 bodies have been collected by the authorities since Tuesday , according to the AFP news agency . Earlier it reported that Haitian Public Health Minister Alex Larsen had told a news conference that 50,000 people had been killed and 250,000 injured 2032 Gen Douglas Fraser , the commander of US SOUTHCOM , says around 90 aid flights a day are landing at Port-au-Prince 's airport . At present , there are 4,200 US military personnel in Haiti , or are involved in the relief effort , and thousands more will arrive next week , he says . In the meantime , the US is looking at the possibility of establishing a support base in the Dominican Republic , so supplies can be brought in by land , he adds . `` If the citizens of Haiti will just remain in place and remain calm , help is on the way , '' Gen Fraser pledges . 2012 Thomas Ewald , the leader of a special US rescue unit that arrived in Haiti on Thursday , tells the Miami Herald that it is likely most of the victims will be buried in mass graves . Following lessons learned from the 2004 Asian tsunami , recovery teams will only be able to take snapshots of the dead before the bodies decay and snip pieces of clothing to show relatives . DNA sampling and medical records can not be used in Haiti , where many people are destitute and have never received adequate medical care . 1948 The authorities in Haiti have counted 9,000 to 10,000 dead since Tuesday 's earthquake , French Secretary of State for Co-operation Alain Joyandet tells the AFP news agency . The minister also says eight French citizens have been identified among the victims . 1925 Mobile phone users in the US have now contributed more than $ 10m to Haitian earthquake relief through text messages , which the Mobile Giving Foundation says is a record for a single cause . Its chief executive , Jim Manis , told the Reuters news agency it was receiving up to 10,000 messages a second , many donating as much as $ 10 . 1912 Haiti 's permanent representative to the UN , Leo Merores , tells the BBC that the government is able to function . `` Of course , as you have seen on TV , the national palace and , as well as a number of technical ministries have been completely destroyed or severely damaged , but that does n't mean that the government is not functioning , '' he says . `` We can understand that the population is getting a little bit impatient but I would like to assure you that the government is doing its best to come to their assistance . '' 1901 The BBC 's Matt Frei in Port-au-Prince says : The evidence so far suggests that Port-au-Prince is a city left to its very own meager resources . The patients of the general hospital have spilled into the open spaces around it . Dozens of people are slowly dying while their relatives try to keep them alive with water or aspirin , or anything else they can get their hands on . Shade is their only luxury here . During our one hour visit , we saw not a single doctor or nurse . And all the time you can hear the US military helicopters overhead and aid planes landing . The airport is slowly filling up , the city needs all the help it can get and time could not be more scarce . 1858 Around a dozen US television networks will team up for an all-star telethon for Haitian earthquake relief next Friday . 1851 Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernandez met his Haitian counterpart , Rene Preval , in Port-au-Prince on Friday and pledged to help the rescue effort and re-establish communications , electricity and water supplies , the Dominican Today newspaper reports . 1838 The BBC 's Matthew Price in Port-au-Prince says : `` On Liberty Street , not far from the epicentre , I found people digging with their bare hands , but not for the dead . ` We 're looking for drinks and food - we do n't have any , ' one man told me . In places , some help is beginning to appear . But elsewhere the desperation is beginning to show . Some fought as they searched for food at one supermarket . On the ground , people are just not seeing any of the aid . People are having to help themselves , getting any belongings they can out of their houses . This is a resourceful country , used to dealing with disaster , but it can not cope alone . '' Survivors dig with their bare hands , looking for food and water 1828 US Agency for International Development -LRB- USAID -RRB- administrator Rajiv Shah says there is still an important `` rescue element '' to the relief operation in Haiti . `` Our belief is now that there is a significant urban search and rescue effort underway and it is still attempting to save lives . There is still an important open window of time today , tonight and perhaps even parts of tomorrow when we have ability to save lives ; Haitian lives , American lives and the lives of partner governments and people that are there on the ground , '' he says . 1815 Mr Obama says he will meet former US presidents Bill Clinton and George W Bush at the White House on Saturday `` to discuss how to enlist and help the American people in this recovery effort '' . 1813 US President Barack Obama says the scale of the devastation in Haiti is extraordinary , and it will take time to establish distribution points so food and water can be delivered safely and effectively . `` I want the people of Haiti to know that we will do what it takes to save lives and to help them get back on their feet , '' he adds . 1809 The BBC 's George Alagiah in Port-au-Prince says : `` I 've been out on the streets this morning and I sense a change in mood . The resignation and fear that was there in the immediate hours after the tragedy is now changing into frustration and even anger . The aid is beginning to get through , but it is not yet reaching those who need it most . So many of the injured remain untreated , and many of the dead remain unburied . '' 1758 European Union development ministers will hold talks in Brussels on Monday to discuss the bloc 's response to the earthquake . `` While we are making sure that Haiti receives the immediate and urgent support it needs , we also have to get ready for the very important next step in helping Haiti to rebuild the country , '' says the EU 's foreign affairs chief , Lady Ashton , in a statement . 1746 UN humanitarian chief John Holmes says it will launch a flash appeal for around $ 560m to help victims at 2100 GMT . `` Almost half of that , as is usual in these situations , will be for food , emergency food aid . And there will be amounts of between $ 20m and $ 50m for health , water and sanitation , nutrition , emergency shelter , early recovery and agriculture . Some 3 million people are believed to have been badly affected by the earthquake , and we will be looking for relief to keep them going for six months , '' he tells reporters . 1743 The US military has begun distributing aid in Haiti , the Associated Press reports . A rapid response unit from the U.S. Army 's 82nd Airborne Division is handing out food , water and medical supplies to Haitians outside the airport in Port-au-Prince .

He pointed to a spot under the rubble and asked me if I could see the boy 's hand . There were three little fingers in the middle of the concrete and the metal . I said I could n't help . '' 1717 The UN 's Chief Humanitarian Aid Co-ordinator , John Holmes , says $ 360m -LRB- # 221m -RRB- has been pledged to help Haiti and that aid agencies are working hard to distribute supplies . `` People are passing many sleepless nights trying to get this aid there , '' he says . 1707 The BBC 's Matt Frei in Port-au-Prince says : `` The streets are absolutely packed with people . Every available space in the shade - and it is about 40C -LRB- 105F -RRB- in the sun - has got people living in it .

Why must the people of Haiti endure such pain , over and over again ? '' 1701The BBC 's Nick Davis in Port-au-Prince says : `` The only convoys going through the streets are full of Haitians in the back of pick-up trucks and lorries , carrying what little belongings they have left . Many are leaving because the water , food and medicine they so desperately need has not reached them yet . Much of it is here , but is stuck at the airport . '' 1654 The Pan-American Health Organization , the Americas arm of the World Health Organization , estimates the death toll may be as high as between 50,000 and 100,000 . `` It 's just a huge guess . I just want to be clear that we really do n't know , '' Dr Jon Kim Andrus , deputy director of the PAHO , tells a news conference , according to the Reuters news agency . `` We just do n't have the information . '' 1643 The BBC 's Andy Gallagher at Port-au-Prince airport says : `` It is a very different scene from how it looks a couple of days ago . There are people here from nations across the world but overwhelmingly it is the Americans that are here in force . The search and rescue operations is well and truly underway . But the picture on the ground may be very different . '' 1635 Mr Ban says as many as 50 % of the buildings in worst-hit areas either damaged or destroyed . `` A high proportion of the 3 million people in the capital area are without access to food , water , shelter and electricity . We are still in the search-and-rescue phase , and we are trying to save as many lives as possible . A major humanitarian effort is now well under way . Although this is inevitably slow and more difficult than any of us would wish . We are mobilising all resources as fast as we possibly can , '' he adds . 1630 UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon describes the search-and-rescue operation in Haiti as a `` monumental '' task . As for sheltering the homeless survivors , he says the UN needs `` tents and more tents '' . 1628 Canada 's Foreign Minister , Lawrence Cannon , says some 1,415 Canadians are missing in Haiti . Four are confirmed to have died . About 6,000 Canadian citizens live in Haiti , but Mr Cannon said earlier this week that only 700 were registered with the embassy in Port-au-Prince . The Globe and Mail has information on some of the victims . 1624 Roger Hilaire has posted pictures of the destruction in Pitchon Ville and Delmas on his Flickr account . 1616 UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says it will launch a flash appeal for $ 550m -LRB- # 338m -RRB- later on Friday .

Mr Ban plans to visit Haiti `` very soon '' 1612 President Preval asked Mr Obama to pass on a message to the American people : `` From the bottom of my heart and on behalf of the Haitian people , thank you , thank you , thank you , '' he said , according to the White House . 1611 US President Barack Obama has offered his Haitian counterpart , Rene Preval , his `` full support '' during a telephone conversation . 1610 US Defense Secretary Robert Gates says the primary goal is to distribute aid as quickly as possible `` so that people do n't , in their desperation , turn to violence '' . He says military planners have been reluctant to drop food and water packages from the air because it could lead to rioting . At present , security is `` pretty good '' , he adds . 1606 Dozens of US citizens are gathered at Port-au-Prince 's airport , waving their passports in the hope of being evacuated , according to the Associated Press . `` I do n't know how much longer we can stand , '' says Beatrice Aristide , waiting with her 19-month-old baby .

So , while there is a tremendous amount of effort to complete a port survey and to open a port to allow a greater amount of supplies to come across the pier to the effort , initially much of the work will be done by air , '' he says . 1553 Medecins Sans Frontieres says thousands of people are waiting in Haiti for surgical treatment . Speaking from Brussels , MSF Operations Director Jerome Oberreit tells the BBC the charity has had to construct makeshift hospital outside the structures that we were using before the earthquake . `` This means that the way they can operate is extremely difficult . They do n't have the infrastructure that they would have had ? The priority is to be able to set up surgical facilities that can answer to the acute needs of this population , '' he says . Extra medical workers have had to come in overland , because Port-au-Prince 's airport is only accepting cargo planes , he adds . 1541 The BBC 's Nick Davis , Port-au-Prince says : `` People have been hearing on their portable radios that the international community has pledged a great deal of aid and they can see the planes landing , but they can not get to it . They can not get to the water , which is so vital as the days get hotter . Some people have gone three days without food or water .

Everyone 's in a frenzy trying to find their family . I have a charitable foundation in Port-au-Prince and we disperse supplies and food , but the building has been crushed . I have the biggest fight of my life coming up , but Haiti is my life . We will continue trying to bring awareness to Haiti and let it be known that we are fighting to get this country where it needs to be , '' he says . 1534 The BBC 's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says : `` Tonnes of aid may by heading towards Haiti but little seems to have reached those in need so far . Aid co-ordinators here say there are now enough large items such as field hospitals and search and rescue teams , but there remains an urgent need for food , clean water , doctors , nurses , medical supplies and body bags . '' 1531 Only a handful of stories have emerged so far of people being pulled alive from the rubble of buildings . Rescue workers say that the first 48 hours are crucial for such rescue efforts . The BBC has published an info-graphic showing how they go about their vital work . 1528 UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown says there has been an `` extraordinary '' response to the disaster from the British public . `` We are determined to make sure that the generosity of the British people is matched by the delivery of aid to the people of Haiti , '' he says . 1525 A spokeswoman for the UN World Food Programme , Emilia Casella , rejects criticism from those watching the suffering in Haiti that the aid operation is too slow . `` Pictures can get out instantly , and so everybody can see and hear the pictures , and that 's important because the world needs to know . But getting physically tonnes and tonnes of equipment , and food , and water is not as instant as Twitter or Skype or 24-hour television news , '' she says . A security guard warns people queueing for fuel in Port-au-Prince 1521 Former Cuban president Fidel Castro says Haiti 's extreme poverty is `` an embarrassment for our times , in a world in which most people still are victims of exploitation and abuse '' , according to the AFP news agency .

It 's going to be difficult , but we do have a lot of teams which have been mobilised - many of them are in the air , others are already on the ground and we are seeing this operation gear up very quickly .

All 7,000 soldiers are working hard to support the people and it 's tough work . They have to have the motivation to start again . That 's the history of Haiti . And they are ready to re-start , '' he says . 1454 Troy Livesay has posted pictures of rubble and make-shift hospitals in Port-au-Prince today on his Flickr account . Barbara Jones from Milton Keynes , UK emails : One of my family in the US has spoken to a member of my family in Haiti . She got through by chance on the phone , we had all been trying . My aunt and my cousins are OK - they are living in the street in Port-au-Prince so they wo n't get hurt by falling buildings . We still do n't know about my mother . 1443 Former US president Bill Clinton , the UN Special Envoy for Haiti , urges Americans to make donations to help provide basic supplies for Haitians affected by the earthquake . `` You 've got unprecedented numbers of the people roaming the streets at night with no place to sleep . They have n't had any sleep in two days , they do n't have water , they do n't have food , '' he tells CNN . 1437 Lt Cmdr Ron Flanders , a spokesman for the US 4th Fleet in Florida , tells the BBC that the USS Carl Vinson has arrived off Haiti and begun ferrying emergency aid ashore . `` We have sent two helicopters ashore into Port-au-Prince that were loaded with pallets of food and medical supplies . Those helicopters also contained the maritime commanders , '' he says . A young French citizen evacuated from Haiti arrives at an airport in Paris 1426 US journalist Andres Oppenheimer , writing in the Miami Herald , says a monitoring commission should formed right away to prevent aid `` being squandered in a country with a history of massive corruption '' . `` In a country where the state is so weak that it ca n't run virtually any public services and corruption is rampant , many fear that once the story fades from the headlines , the flow of international aid will diminish , and that much of what gets to Haiti will be stolen , '' he writes . A report last year by FRIDE , a Spain-based think tank , stated that `` foreign co-operation has contributed over $ 2.6 bn to Haiti since 1984 , with little to show for it '' , he adds . 1413 Raymond Joseph , Haiti 's ambassador to the United States , tells the BBC World Service that he is still hearing reports about strong aftershocks in his country . `` I am from the south-west peninsular , from the city of Aux Cayes .

Charles Gomila , London , UK emails : I ca n't believe the most powerful nation in the world can not get aid to the people in Haiti quickly enough . No excuses , just do it ! 1404 Jan Egeland , the former UN emergency relief co-ordinator , tells the BBC he believes that the situation will improve in the next 24 hours when the US military arrives . `` The biggest logistical capacity on Earth is in the hands of the US military . The military will come , and I think today and tomorrow you will see great logistical change - chains being established by them . And what is good to hear is that the US government and its military will work very closely with the UN , which is also working very closely with the Red Cross .

He 's out there searching , waiting for some kind of food and if anybody could give it to him . He has no money , no resources to get any aid of any kind , and that 's just the case for so many children and families that are basically stranded out in Port-au-Prince . There 's not a massive visible relief effort that I can see on the streets , '' he says . 1352 Jimmy Felter , a film-maker based in the US and founder of the charity , Voice of Haiti , tells the BBC World Service that Haiti 's already poor infrastructure will hamper the rescue effort . `` Haiti was hanging on by a string before this - there was starvation before this , '' he says . `` There is no infrastructure there , so if you start trying to have an operation where everything starts pouring in it can cause much trouble and confusion . It 's been too little , for too late , for too long . But the spirit of the Haitian people can not be underestimated . I 'm not giving an optimistic outlook but I would never give up hope . '' 1350 The UN World Food Programme earlier said its warehouses in Port-au-Prince had been looted , but this has now been denied . `` We do still have that 6,000 tonnes of food , '' WFP spokeswoman Caroline Hurford tells the BBC . `` Apparently there were unconfirmed reports of looting taking place , but once our teams got down to the dockside they were able to see that there was some mistake . '' 1341 Penny Lawrence of the charity , Oxfam , tells the BBC that the breakdown in communications in Haiti is causing many problems on the ground . `` All of our systems rely on mobile phones , telephones , sat-phones , email , and the internet . And we are struggling very , very much without those . We understand people are getting impatient , but I do think there are extraordinary levels of devastation , '' she says . 1335 The BBC 's Nick Davis in Port-au-Prince says : `` People are doing what they can to survive . Every morning the first jobs of the day involve getting the very basics . Loaded with old plastic bottles or anything else that can hold water , they fill up where they can . Some from broken pipes from collapsed buildings , that still have a supply . '' 1327 Olafor Rotsson , a spokesman for the Icelandic Volunteer rescue organization , tells the BBC power shortages and security concerns are slowing the search down at night . `` When people get tired , hungry , and thirsty - and maybe lose hope - it gets more difficult . Up to now all the locals have welcomed us and we have n't had any problems at all , but the UN says ` security stage three ' , which means you are not allowed to work in the night .

We also hope to be able to assist the surrounding community with clothing , medical supplies , household items , hygiene items such as soap , toothbrushes , toothpaste , blankets and towels .

Initially he was reported to be safe , but it now appears that he is trapped under rubble . Two other cousins have been found safe . Phone lines are still down but we are able to communicate via satellite internet . '' 1257 Oxfam says ensuring access to clean water for survivors is `` probably the most immediate problem to resolve now '' . 1249 Haiti 's sea , land and air entry points have all suffered damage in the quake - as well as government and aid agency buildings - which is hampering efforts to distribute aid .

'' 1201 World Food Programme spokeswoman Emilia Casella says looting is `` not unusual '' in disaster situations and that aid distribution takes time . `` Getting physically tonnes and tonnes of equipments , of food and water is not as instant as Twitter or Skype or 24-hour satellite news , '' AFP quotes her as saying . 1150 Anjali Kwatra of UK-based charity Action Aid , tells the BBC World Service : `` In the first 48 hours after a disaster , it is n't international aid that makes a difference - that usually comes in after two or three days . It 's the local people who go in , who rescue people , who provide what food , water and shelter that they can . What we 're seeing in Haiti is that there is n't the ability to do that , because so many people have been affected . '' 1146 A spokesman for UN peacekeepers in Haiti says people are `` slowly getting more angry and impatient '' with the lack of aid . `` We 're all aware that the situation is getting more tense as the poorest people who need so much are waiting for deliveries .

Under-18s make up almost half of Haiti 's 10-million population and aid agencies are warning they are at great risk from ongoing physical and psychological trauma . Already the country faces the highest rates of infant and child mortality in the Western hemisphere with diarrhoea , respiratory infections , tuberculosis among the leading causes of death . Many will have been orphaned or are badly injured themselves and in urgent need of medical help Gareth Owen , Save the Children It is also estimated there are 19,000 children with HIV\\/Aids with few drugs available to treat them . Unicef , which suffered heavy damage to its own offices in Port-au-Prince , says children are `` tremendously vulnerable '' . Gareth Owen , Save the Children 's director of emergencies , said petrified children were sleeping amongst dead bodies and were in grave danger . He estimates up to two million children could be affected by the disaster . `` Many will have been orphaned or are badly injured themselves and in urgent need of medical help . '' `` Thousands more will have lost all contact with their families and friends and are now struggling to survive alone in the rubble . `` They are sleeping on their own , trying to cope with the trauma of seeing dead bodies , and will have no idea where to go for help . Bev Collin , a paediatric nurse with Mdecins Sans Frontires -LRB- MSF -RRB- , provided care in Indonesia after the tsunami . She says childhood diseases already prevalent in the country will be greatly exacerbated by the devastation left by the earthquake . `` There will be a lot of dust around so the air quality will be poor which can aggravate things which are already high risk in children , such as pneumonia . `` The other things that are high risk are hepatitis A and E , typhoid fever and diarrhoeal diseases , which are made worse by lack of water . These are kids who are already sick and you want to be able to continue their care Bev Collin , Mdecins Sans Frontires `` And food or water borne diseases will be a major problem because there is probably no drainage and sewage system . '' The initial days after the earthquake will all be about survival , digging people out of the rubble and dealing with crush injuries but there are also ongoing dangers of injury from collapsing and broken buildings , she says . `` But in three or four weeks the wet season will be starting and that is really going to cause problems because then you are looking at malaria . `` Also Japanese encephalitis is endemic and is a particular problem for children . '' She says aid agencies will be trying to co-ordinate who is responsible for what and getting children to a place of safety is paramount . Those who have lost parents will usually be cared for by older siblings , other family members and the wider community , she says . But it is absolutely vital that they can access medical facilities in the coming months . `` The thing is these are kids who are already sick and you want to be able to continue their care . '' Physical wounds are of course not the only issue , there will also be psychological scars . Professor Richard Williams , lead officer for disaster management at the Royal College of Psychiatrists , said most people , children and adults , will experience fear , anxiety , guilt , disorientation , hopelessness and other related feelings within the first few days of a disaster . But that is usually temporary and 80 % will not have lasting mental health problems . For a small group there is a longer term risk of depression and anxiety as well as post-traumatic stress disorder . `` Children are particularly vulnerable because they depend on adults to care for them . `` If they have lost contact with familiar adults there will be the additional burden of grief and bereavement . `` It is right to focus on children but the good news is they are just as resilient as adults . '' He says the psychological `` first aid '' that is needed is practical help and that includes food , water and shelter . `` After that it is about re-establishing normality and relationships and routine - reconnecting children with their families and getting them back to school . `` All these things are incredibly protective of mental health .

The Foreign Office is checking on Britons and will start repatriations from the Caribbean island , but concern is growing for Ann Barnes , a personal assistant to the UN police commissioner in Haiti . Ann Barnes , 59 , is originally from Leigh-on-Sea , Essex Ms Barnes 's sister Irene Marquet said the family feared the worst . `` There 's been absolutely no trace , which is horrendous , '' she said . `` One wants to remain hopeful but it gets more and more difficult as time goes on . '' The former British Airways stewardess has worked for the UN for more than 20 years and has been in Haiti for about two years . The UK ambassador to the Dominican Republic and other consular staff have gone to neighbouring Haiti . A British search and rescue team - made up of 71 people , mostly from the fire services , and including two search dogs - flew to the region on Thursday . Forty of them are working alongside Chinese rescuers in the Carrefour district on the edge of the capital , Port-au-Prince . The Department for International Development said they had UN protection . Another group was searching a ruined church in the city center where a child was thought to be trapped . The DEC , an umbrella organization that co-ordinates responses to major disasters overseas , thanked the British public for their contribution to its quake appeal so far . David Loyn , BBC correspondent , with a rescue team in Haiti Food , water , medical supplies and shelter are needed on a huge scale for several months to come . Rescue teams from a dozen countries are doing what they can in the capital , which was the epicentre of the earthquake . A Spanish team that arrived on Thursday morning had pulled out five people by nightfall including a two-year-old boy . Although the team did not have any of their heavy equipment , which is still stuck in the gridlock at the airport , they dug with simple tools . Annika Coll , the head of the team , said that `` goosepimples went up on my arm '' when the boy answered when she called out . He was unharmed after 50 hours without food or water . The rescue teams know that there could be many more people like that under the rubble and are frustrated by being unable to get out to work . There are also security concerns . Some 9,000 UN military and police personnel have been trying to keep order , and all rescue teams have had armed guards . But it appealed for more financial aid in a BBC One TV appeal presented by Kirsty Young . She said the small Caribbean nation had suffered devastation `` beyond measure '' and added : `` Aid agencies are worried if they do n't deal with problems like sanitation immediately , disease will break out and many more people will die . '' Mariella Frostrup also presented an appeal on BBC Radio 4 . The Queen donated an undisclosed amount to the DEC and the Prince of Wales gave a private sum to a Red Cross fund . DEC chief executive Brendan Gormley said : `` Efforts on the ground have been hampered by a lack of power and communications problems after the devastating quake but aid is starting to get through and DEC members are working hard in the field . `` It is vitally important that people continue to donate . '' The # 2m figure for online giving was hit at around 0800 GMT on Friday , and donations by other means are not included . Money donated to the DEC - which brings together 13 major British-based charities - is being spent on search and rescue , medical care , food , clean water , temporary shelter and clothes . The prime minister , who visited DEC staff at their north London headquarters on Friday , reassured the public their money would get through . Shelane Chapman , from Downham in Kent , is one of the 1,000-strong Haitian community in the UK . She has no idea what has happened to her family . She heard rumors that her mother 's house collapsed in the earthquake , killing her six-year-old cousin , but has been unable to verify the news . Sanitation equipment on its way to Haiti Mrs Chapman said : `` We 're sick with worry because we ca n't get through at all . We keep redialling my mother 's mobile number but it just wo n't work . If the house has gone , where could she be ? Where could they all be ? '' Judith Craig of United Haitians in the UK , says the charity has seen its membership jump since the earthquake hit . She attributes the increase to people wanting to find out more and seek solidarity with others . The Red Cross has set up a website to help people abroad to try to contact their relatives . A similar site has been created by two Haitians in the US . The Disasters Emergency Committee is co-ordinating an appeal to help the people of Haiti There are 13 charities involved including the British Red Cross , Islamic Relief and World Vision Donate via the DEC website or by telephoning 0370 60 60 900 He said it was mainly water and sanitation equipment . `` There was also plastic sheeting , '' he said . `` And sadly - we very rarely send this - there were body bags as well . '' Muslim Aid , which launched a # 250,000 aid campaign and donated # 75,000 , said its teams were installing purification units to provide clean drinking water and setting up a mobile field hospital . It also made provisions for emergency shelter and food aid . British Airways said it had a Boeing 747 standing by to fly to Haiti with supplies on Saturday , crewed by volunteer BA pilots and cabin crew . Virgin Atlantic said it was flying supplies , along with key medical personnel , aid agency workers and rescue teams to the region . The quake , Haiti 's worst in two centuries , has flattened whole areas in the country 's capital .

It is feared thousands of people have died in the earthquake . BBC News website readers have been describing how the earthquake has affected them . We run a home for sick and malnourished children and we 're based in La Pointe , a small town outside the city of Port-de-Paix on the North Coast of Haiti . Many of our children study in Port-au-Prince which is 150km away . We have been spending the day trying to find out if they are still alive and if they are we are trying to get them back here . We have good friends and family around us but it has been incredibly stressful trying to get information . Many families , if they have the money , will send their children to school in Port-au-Prince . There were five children that we were specifically trying to get hold of and I have also been trying to find out information on a further 50 children from local families . I found out today that thankfully they are all still alive . They are all in their 20s and studying at university . Every single one has lost their accommodation in Port-au-Prince . They have been living on the streets , trying to find food and water to survive . From the other 50 local children we have been trying to trace , some have made it back . They have had terrible experiences ; watching their friends die in front of their eyes . Others have made it back . The whole town is going through mourning . Every couple of hours we hear of someone who has n't survived . Even though we are 150km far from Port-au-Prince , in a country like Haiti we depend on the main supplies lines from there . That line has now been cut and I think we can expect to see food , fuel and basic supplies dwindle over the coming days . BARBARA JONES , MILTON KEYNES , UK Update from Barbara , a Haitian who has been in the UK for eight months One of my relatives in the US managed to speak to a member of our family in Haiti . She got through by chance on the phone , we had all been trying since the earthquake happened . She said my aunt and my cousins are OK . They are now living in the street in Port-au-Prince so they wo n't get hurt by falling buildings , but at least they 're OK . We still do n't know about my mother . She lives outside the capital , in Gonaives which was badly affected by hurricanes in 2008 . It 's even hard to get hold of her at the best of times . My wife , Mimi , is stuck under the rubble of a supermarket in the Delmas area of Port-au-Prince . On Wednesday we heard that Mimi had managed to use a blackberry phone to text her cousin in Haiti . I have n't been able to talk to her to confirm this . I 've also heard that someone managed to speak to Mimi on Thursday , at the time she was stuck with another 25 people . But I just I do n't know whether this is true . What I do know is that her car is still parked at the supermarket . From talking to rescue teams , I 'm hearing that there are possibly 50 people in the rubble there . It 's difficult to get to them because of the lack of heavy equipment - the ceiling of the supermarket is just too hard to break through , and there are n't enough rescue dogs in the area either so the rescue teams do n't know exactly where to dig . I 'm hearing many conflicting reports from Haiti and we 're powerless to do anything . People have been sleeping in the street . I live in the Dominican Republic but came here soon after the earthquake to look for my relatives . I am in Petionville . It is probably one of the least affected areas of the city . I have been driving in the streets all day , trying to find friends , relatives , looking for food , water , fuel , taking pictures . The streets of Port-au-Prince are filled with dead bodies covered in sheets . It looks like the entire city structure is collapsed . There is still no phone communication , no electricity , no public transportation . People stay and sleep right in the streets . Some have no houses to go back to , some are afraid of another quake . There is no kind of rescue from the public services nor the humanitarian aid . People are trapped under the rubble and slowly dying . He said he had managed to pull out his three daughters , but not his son The air is starting to smell like dead bodies . People are wearing masks as they walk the street . The population is extraordinarily calm and quiet . Still stunned by the magnitude of the blow . A lot of people are going up and down the street . I imagine they are looking for resources , looking for their relatives . At around 10pm last night , a neighbor of a relative we went looking for asked us if we could help him get his 13-year-old son from under the rubble . He said he had managed to pull out his three daughters , but not his son . He pointed to a spot under the rubble and asked me if I could see the boy 's hand . There were three little fingers in the middle of the concrete and the metal . I said I could n't help . He asked if I could broadcast the news that his son was dead on the radio , so that the boy 's mother could know , as she he was not at Port-au-Prince at the time I live in Haiti but was on a business trip to the United States . I am trying to go back to Port-au-Prince to reunite with my parents . I am flying to the Dominican Republic and will then go to Haiti by taxi . It will take me from eight to nine hours . My parents live very near to the Caribbean Supermarket which fell down in Petionville . I managed to talk to them after hundreds of attempts over the phone . They told me there is no water or food . They took around 200 neighbors into the house and they are sleeping by the swimming pool . They can take water from it and boil it and use tablets , but there is almost no food . My mother says she can still hear people crying for help . We are bringing 200 pounds of dried food with us , but that can not possibly feed 200 people .

Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive said more than 15,000 bodies had already been recovered and buried , French news agency AFP reported . The UN has launched a flash appeal for $ 562m -LRB- # 346m -RRB- , saying three million people would need help for six months . Humanitarian chief John Holmes said a massive effort was being mounted and officials were `` straining every nerve '' to help . US President Barack Obama described the scale of the devastation as extraordinary and the losses suffered as `` heartbreaking '' . No-one is in charge . The president is sleeping at the airport with quite a few journalists and aid workers . Earlier this morning , I stood on top of the rubble of the Supreme Court , the Foreign Ministry , the Interior Ministry and the Senate - where a few senators had been killed when the quake hit . Their bodies have been dragged out and put in body bags . The representatives of state are literally lying on the pavement slowly rotting away . This is a citizenry left to its own extremely meager resources . You 've got ordinary people trying to administer IV drips to their family members who are slowly dying , but not a single doctor or nurse at the general hospital . In a statement at the White House , he said the US would `` do what it takes to save lives and help people get back on their feet '' . Correspondents say survivors seem increasingly desperate and angry as bottlenecks and infrastructure damage delay relief efforts . Many are spending another day without food and shelter in the ruined capital . Mr Holmes earlier told reporters that 30 % of buildings throughout Port-au-Prince had been damaged , with the figure at 50 % in some areas . The Pan American Health Organization has estimated that the death toll could be as high as 100,000 . The US has already sent an aircraft carrier , the USS Carl Vinson , to Haiti and the USS Bataan , carrying a marine expeditionary unit , is on its way . President Obama : `` The scale of devastation is extraordinary ... the losses heartbreaking '' The chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , Adm Mike Mullen , said a hospital ship and more helicopters would be sent in the coming days , carrying more troops and marines . He said the total number of US troops would rise to between 9,000 and 10,000 . `` Right now , I mean , literally as we speak , the Vinson -LRB- aircraft carrier -RRB- and the company from the 82nd Airborne who got there last night are focusing on delivering water from the helicopters offshore to the people of Haiti .

The announcements came after Mr Obama pledged full American support in a phone call to his Haitian counterpart Rene Preval . The US president also said he would meet former Presidents George W Bush and Bill Clinton on Saturday to discuss Haiti . US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will meanwhile travel to Haiti to see for herself the scale of the damage . The UN said a total of about $ 310m -LRB- # 190m -RRB- in international aid had been pledged so far for the relief effort . UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon : `` Food and water are in critically short supply '' UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said that distribution of food and medicine was under way , but correspondents say there is little immediate sign of a co-ordinated relief effort on the ground . The UN 's World Food Programme says two million people will need food aid , but it has so far managed to feed just a few thousand . Meanwhile , the head of the charity Medecins Sans Frontieres -LRB- Doctors Without Borders -RRB- said thousands of people were waiting for surgery in Haiti 's hospitals , AFP news agency reported . Port-au-Prince 's small airport is filled to capacity and US air traffic controllers have taken charge to help manage the influx of planes . Mr Holmes said everyone was `` working desperately '' to resolve the problems and the capacity to deal with flights was rising . The port is too damaged to use and roads are blocked by debris , although the main route from the Dominican Republic is now clear . The BBC 's Nick Davis in Port-au-Prince says the only convoys he has seen are people leaving the city , in search of food , water and medicine . `` We hear on the radio that rescue teams are coming from the outside , but nothing is coming , '' said one man , Jean-Baptiste Lafontin Wilfried . David Wimhurst , a spokesman for the Brazilian-led UN peacekeeping mission in Haiti , said : `` Unfortunately , they 're slowly getting more angry and impatient . '' The UN headquarters has collapsed and correspondents say there is little official presence in Port-au-Prince despite incidents of looting . About 45,000-50 ,000 people have died since Tuesday 's 7.0 magnitude earthquake and 300,000 have been made homeless , the UN estimates .

Twitter is being used as a prime channel for communications , while sites such as Ushahidi are providing maps detailing aid and damage . Both Google and Facebook are producing missing persons lists . Satellite networks are also diverting resources to provide communications to aid agencies and the military . The very first images to escape from the region after Tuesday 's earthquake came from citizens , capturing video with mobile phones . But landlines near the epicentre have been wiped out , and mobile phone service has been at best intermittent - a fact that has already hampered rescue efforts . The UN body Telecoms Sans Frontieres , which maintains a network of telecommunications engineers and mobile equipment worldwide , has deployed two teams in the region . The World Food Programme operates a similar service . `` When we arrive in the country , we establish a telecoms center for the humanitarian community , for them to be able to communicate and have access to internet and phone , '' said Telecoms Sans Frontiere 's Catherine Sang . I am starting to run - literally , run - every time an aftershock hits . Seen far too many bodies . Do n't wanna add to that number `` We also operate a humanitarian calling operation for the population , so they can call their family and friends in the country or abroad , '' she told BBC News . Ms Sang said that the teams have as yet been unable to set up the network for the general populace due to security concerns . Inmarsat , a UK-based firm that operates a network of satellites , received word from the UN just an hour after the initial quake , and has begun re-allocating satellite time to the region . For those with satellite-enabled equipment - namely aid agencies and the military - such extra capacity is vital when traditional communication channels have been damaged or cut off altogether . However , for the ordinary people in the worst-affected areas of Haiti , as well as loved ones desperate for information about them , the most relevant sources of information are civilians on the ground with some familiar technological tools at their disposal . Just seconds after the earthquake , people began to send messages from Haiti through Twitter . Since then , the Twitter group tagged '' #relativesinhaiti '' has been flooded with traffic from relatives trying to find out about their loved ones from abroad , while '' #rescumehaiti '' is being used to direct rescue efforts where trapped survivors have been located . The Red Cross , CNN and the New York Times are compiling missing persons databases , but the Facebook group `` Earthquake Haiti '' has more than 160,000 members . Tweets are directing search and rescue efforts complete with addresses Pierre Cote is a journalist based in Haiti who has been contacted by a number of news organizations in the wake of the disaster , and who is broadcasting from a studio over the web . He conducted an interview with the BBC via the service Skype , popular for making voice and video calls over the internet , and spoke about his role in communicating about the disaster . `` If I 'm not doing it , no one will do it - the traditional media wo n't do it , '' he said . `` The community need it so for me it 's a service to the community to bring it all together . '' Another web-based tool that has recently become crucial in disaster relief and information dissemination is Ushahidi . Initially the service made its name following the disputed Kenyan elections of 2007 . It provides an open-source , free service which can overlay maps of affected regions with data gathered from a raft of sources . Detailed maps can show , for instance , where aid will be delivered , where running water has been cut off or restored , or - as in the case of Haiti - where aftershocks have been reported . However , recent experience with the unpoliced nature of these vast streams of data has made clear that not all information can be trusted . Among the pictures circulating around the internet in the wake of the Haiti disaster , one claiming to be of a Haitian bridge was actually taken in Japan following an earthquake in 2006 . The risks of such misinformation in the aftermath of a disaster - in particular for those cases that involve divisive politics or propaganda - have already been identified in a report compiled by the UN Foundation\\/Vodafone Foundation technology partnership in December . The open-source Ushahidi is again proving a valuable information tool The founders of Ushahidi are working on a verification system that can independently assure that information coming in is corroborated and accurate . Taken together , the flow of information via these tools , alongside compiled by services that make sense of it , means that dealing with the aftermath of disaster is quicker , more integrated , and more visible to those inside and outside the affected area . However , no such efforts can fully replace a functioning , full-scale infrastructure , and that will leave many people both inside and outside Haiti anxious for answers . There are initial reports that some of the local phone networks have managed to restore some capacity . Ken Banks , founder of FrontlineSMS and a specialist in mobile telecoms in emergency situations , said that once people realize the networks are back up they are likely to become very congested . `` It will be like New Year 's Eve as everyone tries to get through , '' he told BBC News . `` SMS is more likely to get through , even if it is delayed .

The promise of aid has not yet materialised and many locals are still digging through the rubble with their hands . Most of the bodies are covered in white bed sheets or rolled inside carpets , but others have been left exposed to the hot sun and the stench of rotting bodies has begun to fill the air . Some bodies have been cleared , but others are piling up in the streets Families who are desperately searching for their loved ones are gingerly uncovering the sheets that cover the corpses in the hope they can at least identify family members . But even if bodies are identified there is nowhere for them to be laid to rest . Mass graves are now appearing across the city . The mood for the past 24 hours has been one of patience and solidarity , but there is now a sense of anger and frustration that could change the atmosphere here drastically . `` This is not the time to blame anybody .

'' Louinel is one of the lucky ones , he has now found all his family members alive and well . Haitians can only depend on international help because the infrastructure here is decimated The rescue effort and the promises of help are now desperately needed , but so far the fresh supplies of water , food and medical equipment are still in short supply . Some of the worst hit buildings were schools . Several had more than 1,000 pupils inside when the massive earthquake hit , and there is little left but concrete blocks piled one on top of another . The bodies of children and adults can clearly be seen , and most will remain that way until the rescue teams get on the ground . At night Port-au-Prince grows eerily quiet . Most people are still too afraid to take shelter inside the buildings . Tremors are still being felt here and even the hospitals are treating their patients in the grounds . The airport , rapidly becoming the center of this rescue effort , is in full working order . The building was damaged but there is power and the runway , despite some reports , is in good shape . Military planes are landing more regularly than they were last night , but there is no sense that the operation has begun in earnest . People can now only hope and pray that help will arrive . Haitians can only depend on international help because the infrastructure here is decimated . Time is not on the side of the Haitian people ; help is needed and for many it has already arrived too late .

BBC News website readers around the world have been talking to the BBC about their search for missing friends and relatives . Here are some of their stories . We are desperately worried because my uncle Pierre Celestin and six of his children are missing in Port-au-Prince . The area is devastated . The church and graveyard where my grandfather is buried has been destroyed and I am stuck here thousands of miles away . I feel so frustrated , all I want to do is to jump on a plane and go to help I feel so frustrated , all I want to do is to jump on a plane and go to help . I have several family members in New York , and they are not coping well . My aunt is going out with the Red Cross to help , and hopefully find them . We have to believe that my uncle and as his sons are still alive . I 've been constantly trying to phone through to Haiti . I am doing everything I can to try to gather information - I 'm on Facebook and Twitter all the time . Someone , somewhere must know something about them . When the earthquake struck I felt so alone as there are so few Haitians here in Britain . I have joined the group United Haitians in the UK . We hope to raise funds and help in any way we can . I just want to appeal to anyone in this country to give any help you can . My husband is from Haiti and has a large family that live in Carrefour , on the edge of the capital Port-au-Prince . It must be a miracle because although the houses around them are broken , all eleven of his relatives are still alive and uninjured and their house is ok too . We feared the worst when we saw the pictures on the news . It was 3am yesterday when we heard . We did n't get much sleep after that . All the reports from Carrefour were of houses that had been flattened . The place had been `` levelled '' . All I can say to people is do n't give up hope just yet We tried to get through to the family . The phone lines were down , the internet was down . It was just a case of constantly trying , but we could n't get through at all . Getting through the day was difficult . All we could do was watch TV and look out for people we knew . When I got home at nine o'clock last night I finally heard the good news . My husband got through to his younger brother on the phone . He said : `` We 're fine - in fact none of us have a scratch . '' Eleven members of the family were in the house at the time of the earthquake . But they all survived . And the house is intact . Even though everything was in tatters around them . All I can say to people is do n't give up hope just yet because among the darkness sometimes there is a small glimmer of light . I hope more families will have good fortune like we have . Earthquake damage in Haiti . Picture : Eric Lotz , Operation Blessing My partner and I are US citizens who have been helping in the triage areas of the main UN base near the Toussaint L'Ouverture airport since the night of the quake . We are civilians and are still waiting to hear word back from officials in the US Embassy about evacuations . Until then , we 're here comforting families and children and doing whatever we can to help the incoming victims . The UN is supposed to begin building a new mobile hospital today . Around 2,000 US marines are supposed to land as well . The UN has already sent out wounded foreign nationals to hospitals in Miami , along with very badly wounded Haitians . Two Haitian girls are waiting for foot amputations sometime today . Our passports , computers , clothes and medicine are all buried in the house we were staying at in Port-au-Prince . All that we have with us now are the clothes on our backs . We were talking with friends in an adjacent neighborhood when the quake hit . We immediately walked back to our friends ' house to find that that everyone was mercifully OK . Afterwards , we began rounding up all the wounded from the surrounding neighborhoods and put them all in one area . We gathered together more than 200 wounded and the message kept spreading . Tremors still shake everyone in the compound and make it especially difficult to get any sleep at night . These past two days have been a nightmare , especially for the countless Haitians who have lost everything . BARBARA JONES , MILTON KEYNES , UK I am Haitian and have lived in the UK for just eight months . I was working and living in the Dominican Republic before then and if I was there now , I would have run across the border to find out what has happened to my family . To see how the whole world is responding is amazing I have not heard from my mother or my cousins . My aunt is also missing . She gave me my education and I owe her so much , she was a huge part of my childhood . My family live in Port-au-Prince , right at the epicentre of the earthquake . I have n't heard from any of them . I have been calling all my other relatives and friends in Haiti . The phone lines are down a lot of the time and I ca n't get through . I am relying on family in America as well . I am recently married and my husband has been wonderful . He has been supporting me otherwise I would be feeling very alone . Haitians , we are used to disaster but this is the worse thing that has ever happened . It is so upsetting . Haiti 's government can not respond to something on this scale . To see how the whole world is responding is amazing . I am close to tears when I see how everyone is coming to help us . Sebastien Barrau and Marvin Chery I am from Haiti and I moved to Miami four years ago . My family is still there . I got a call from my sister asking me to call her back straight away , she mentioned something about an earthquake . I did n't think it was that bad . When I got off the phone to her , I checked Twitter and I could see everybody posting information on there . I started to get really worried for friends and family but it was my first day at a new job so I felt I could n't just get up and leave . It was so terrible seeing the images on the television and online . Places I know and have visited were just destroyed . Haiti has had a lot of problems but nothing like this . It 's so shocking to see how everything has been destroyed and I just want to go back and help . I ca n't though and so I decided to create a website to help . I had a lot of people on Twitter contacting me , asking for information about loved ones . I thought it would make sense to get a website together where people can put up pictures and appeal for information about missing people . Everybody is worried and the list makes it easier . My school friend from Haiti , Marvin Chery , and I put the website together and it 's now live . I 'm really disappointed . There are so few survivors . I spoke to a friend who helped get five people out of a collapsed supermarket , just five people . I 've heard about people being alive one day and stuck under the rubble but who do n't make it .

Type `` Haiti '' into Twitter , Facebook or Youtube and you soon encounter a message from @redcross sent at 05:38 GMT on Jan 13 . In less than 48 hours , the American Red Cross had received more than $ 35m in donations - including $ 8m directly from texts . `` This breaks all world records for a mobile giving campaign , '' says their spokeswoman , Gloria Huang . `` It 's been incredible . People have donated more to Haiti than to Hurricane Katrina or the tsunami in Asia . `` And Twitter has played an extremely significant part . '' In the race to fundraise , social network sites have given aid agencies the power to bypass TV and radio and appeal directly to the public . The Haitian musician Wyclef Jean , for example , has raised $ 1m for earthquake victims through his Yele Haiti foundation , after appealing for help through Twitter . We tweeted ... celebrities re-tweeted ... and after that , the appeal spread like wildfire In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake , he tweeted , asking for donations through his foundation . His 1.3 million followers answered his call - and passed on his appeal with a message : `` Spread the word '' . Meanwhile on Facebook , hundreds of thousands of people signed up to awareness groups , such as Earthquake Haiti , which offers a link to Oxfam 's Haiti relief fund . On Youtube , the video sharing site , bloggers began posting their own personal appeals , calling for donations . So , how was this mass mobilisation achieved ? After all , the American Red Cross had only a modest number of followers on Twitter when their appeal was launched . Their trick was to alert popular celebrities - and let their fans on Twitter do the rest . `` Our plan worked exactly like it was supposed to , '' says Wendy Harman , social media manager , at the American Red Cross . My worry was - are people just re-tweeting ? Or are they actually donating ? `` We have a ` cabinet ' of 30 celebrities , who have agreed to ask their Twitter followers to spread the word . `` Within three hours of the earthquake , we had our text number ready . And then others quickly followed . People like Michelle Obama , Jane Seymour and Craig Newmark -LRB- of Craigslist -RRB- got on board . And after that , the appeal spread like wildfire . '' Twitter users across the globe began using the RT -LRB- re-tweet -RRB- function to pass the message on to their friends and followers . Within hours , the number for the text appeal : `` 90999 '' was ranked among Twitter 's top 10 `` trending topics '' - which in turn drove more and more people to donate and spread the word . Wyclef Jean raised $ 1m through his Yele Hait Foundation appeal `` We hit that magical viral sweet spot , '' says Ms Harman . `` Everybody out there seems to know that if you text 90999 you donate $ 10 to the Haiti appeal . `` My worry was - are people just re-tweeting ? Or are they actually donating ? It soon became clear that they really were texting and calling . '' Using an online map tool , hosted by Mgive.com , she and her colleagues were able to watch as donations flooded in from every US state . They did not even have to re-send their appeal . The online community were busy spreading the word for them . `` People have been sceptical over the power of the RT -LRB- re-tweet -RRB- and of Twitter generally , '' says Ms Harman . `` For example , during the Iran election there was a viral campaign to change your avatar color to green . `` But this time , people seemed to be saying : ` Let 's not do anything cute - let 's just donate ' . `` I think we have crossed the threshold of novelty with Twitter . People now want to use it to get something good done . '' But of course , as with any appeal for charity , people 's good will can easily be exploited . The avalanche of tweets , emails and Facebook groups urging web users to donate carries with it an opportunity for internet fraudsters to profit . Any money sent using the instructions in this email would end up in the pockets of a cyber criminal Would-be donors have stumbled on some suspicious websites . On Facebook , a group has been founded with a pledge to donate $ 1 for every person who joins . The group has gathered more than 500,000 members . But since it has no administrators , it is not clear who , if anyone , will actually donate the promised money . Meanwhile , the security firm Symantec alerted web users to an email scam , soliciting donations for Haiti victims , which purports to come from the British Red Cross -LRB- BRC -RRB- . `` The scammers have used the correct postal address , but the BRC does not use Western Union for donations , '' said Con Mallon , a Symantec spokesman . `` Also , the email address supplied as a contact is not one belonging to the BRC and any money sent using the instructions in this email would end up in the pockets of a cyber criminal . '' This `` appeal '' email was identified as a scam by Symantec security firm The US Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a warning on Wednesday calling on internet users `` to apply a critical eye and do their due diligence '' before responding to online requests for aid to Haiti . `` Make contributions directly to known organizations rather than relying on others to make the donation on your behalf to ensure contributions are received and used for intended purposes , '' the FBI said in its advisory . Amid the mass of appeals for help sent round on Twitter , even some very expert Tweeters have fallen victim to rumor and misinformation . Jennifer Preston , social media editor of the New York Times , passed on a tweet to her followers , stating : `` American Airlines is taking doctors and nurses to #Haiti for free . Spread the word '' . However , not long afterwards , she sent her fans a follow up message . `` We are now hearing that it might not be true ... '' she tweeted . `` LESSON LEARNED : do not RT offers to help ... unless you confirm .

Hundreds of buildings collapsed and over three million people have been displaced in the quake which measured 7.0 on the Richter Scale . Aid has been sent from around the world , although infrastructure damage has been holding up aid efforts . Members of the Mid and West Wales Fire Service will help to search for people . Their immediate responsibilities will be to scour the debris for those trapped underneath , though , as the window of opportunity for survival closes , their attention will soon turn towards helping to make safe damaged buildings and erecting temporary structures to provide badly-needed shelter . Douglas Alexander , International Development Secretary , said : `` The people of Wales can be proud of the efforts of the search and rescue professionals from Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service . `` They are helping the people of Haiti at a time of dire need and their skills and experience are vital to the ongoing search for survivors in the rubble in Port-au-Prince . `` I would like to thank them on behalf of the British government for their commitment and bravery as part of this international mission . '' I have heard nothing from my friends in Haiti since the earthquake Unfortunately the familiar sight around disaster zones of Anglesey 's International Dog Rescue service have n't been able to join the mission . The veterans of the 1999 Turkey earthquake and the 2004 boxing day tsunami in south east Asia have been thwarted , not by the conditions on the ground , but by the adverse weather back here in Britain . `` The irony is bitter to say the very least , '' said Russell Vaughan of International Dog Rescue . `` With all the disruption in Port-au-Prince , it 's the British weather which has hamstrung us . `` As soon as news came through on Tuesday night , we were booked on a British Airways flight to Jamaica on Wednesday , in time to meet a Royal Navy ship carrying aid to Haiti . Firefighters from around the UK have flown out to the quake zone `` Unfortunately the snow meant that all flights from Gatwick were grounded yesterday , and the next service which could have accommodated all the dogs is n't until this evening . `` Sadly that would have meant that we 'd have arrived in Port-au-Prince on Saturday , which realistically is getting towards the end of the viable window for survival in the very hot conditions in Haiti . `` By Saturday we 'd have been of limited use , and we 'd have simply been taking up time , space and resources needed by other aid workers , and holding up the transition from a search and rescue mission to a humanitarian and clean-up one . '' Gareth Owen from Dolanog near Welshpool , Powys , who is director of emergencies at Save the Children , is heading up the operation to protect the estimated two million children caught up in the disaster . As the quake hit during school time on Tuesday , many more children than usual have become separated from their parents and are having to fend for themselves on the ruined streets . Over three million were displaced in the quake `` As well as getting basic supplies in , it 's crucial that children struggling on their own are protected from being crushed by more debris and are kept safe from abuse on the streets . This is not a safe place for children , '' Mr Owen said . `` They are sleeping on their own , trying to cope with the trauma of seeing dead bodies , and will have no idea where to go for help . `` Children mimic adults in these sorts of crises . They see grown-ups scrabbling through the debris looking for bodies , and will try to follow suit . `` Aside from the damage this is doing to their mental health , it 's putting their safety in danger as buildings will be very unstable and may still collapse . '' He added that rescuers are still searching for 20 members of the Save the Children team who have n't been seen since the quake on Tuesday . Welsh artist Cherry Pickles spent most of last year in Haiti , from where she drew inspiration for her collection currently on display at the Dylan Thomas center in Swansea . After hearing about the crisis , she 's decided to offer all proceeds from the exhibition , valued at around # 20,000 , to help the victims . `` I have heard nothing from my friends in Haiti since the earthquake , '' she said . `` When I confided to my mum that the idea of me talking about Haiti in the current situation makes me feel very uneasy , she suggested that I try to arrange a sale or auction of the work , all of the proceeds of which would go specifically to help Haiti . `` That is what I am going to do . I would want this money to go to support education in Haiti as that is the area my Haitian friends think will make the most significant long term difference there .

The BBC 's Robin Markwell in Heathrow : A vast draughty warehouse next to Heathrow is a world apart from the scorched devastation in Haiti . But it is here that large green boxes from the charity ShelterBox are being assembled that could change the lives of some of the countless displaced . Not much bigger than suitcases , they contain potentially life-saving supplies - blankets ; mosquito nets ; a pad with crayons to distract children from the horrors of everyday life ; and , most crucially of all , a tent that can provide up to 10 people with somewhere to call home for a year . Some 2,000 are being flown to Florida over the coming fortnight . But with an inoperable port and a log-jammed airport , no-one knows when they will make that final leg to Haiti . Mounting security concerns in Haiti 's capital , Port-au-Prince , as well as distribution problems have hampered the task of getting aid to survivors . Mr Fisher told the BBC News channel there were believed to have been 80 to 90 Britons in the country before the earthquake . On Friday , a two-year-old girl was rescued from a collapsed kindergarten in the capital Port-au-Prince by a UK rescue team , prompting them to say it was a `` bonus '' . Some of the UK rescue team that found the girl on the first full day of the international rescue effort were from the Greater Manchester and Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Services . It is thought the child , who rescuers have named Mia , was trapped for three days . She was rescued five hours after being detected by sensor equipment and a rescue dog . Fire and rescue team chief officer Mike Thomas described the operation as `` gruelling '' . He added : `` This is what we do the job for . The conditions we are working in are pretty dire . `` The local people have no food or water and are suffering in more ways than one .

Concern is growing for Ann Barnes , a personal assistant to the UN police commissioner in Haiti . The 59-year-old , originally from Leigh-on-Sea , Essex , has been unaccounted for since the UN headquarters collapsed on Tuesday . The former British Airways stewardess has worked for the UN for more than 20 years and has been in Haiti for about two years . The UK ambassador to the Dominican Republic and other consular staff have gone to neighbouring Haiti . It is vitally important that people continue to donate A British search and rescue team - made up of 71 people , mostly from the fire services , and including two search dogs - flew to the region on Thursday . Forty of them are working alongside Chinese rescuers in the Carrefour district on the edge of the capital , Port-au-Prince . The Department for International Development said they had UN protection . The DEC , an umbrella organization that co-ordinates responses to major disasters overseas , thanked the British public for their contribution to its quake appeal so far . A special televised appeal for the DEC was shown on Friday night on BBC One and ITV1 . The Queen donated an undisclosed amount to the DEC and the Prince of Wales gave a private sum to a Red Cross fund .

'' Money donated to the DEC - which brings together 13 major British-based charities - is being spent on search and rescue , medical care , food , clean water , temporary shelter and clothes . The government has also allocated # 2m to deal with `` logistical problems '' on the ground , such as the provision of cars and lorries to distribute aid , and to improve communications links . Meanwhile , the UK 's 1,000-strong Haitian community is awaiting news of loved ones , while a group called United Haitians UK is planning to launch a fundraising appeal . The Red Cross has set up a website to help people abroad to try to contact their relatives . A similar site has been created by two Haitians in the US . Muslim Aid , which launched a # 250,000 aid campaign and donated # 75,000 , said its teams were installing purification units to provide clean drinking water and setting up a mobile field hospital .

Some card thieves use charity donations to check if a stolen card will work before using it to illegally buy goods . But banks ' automated systems can block unusual first-time payments to charities , leaving donors frustrated . Banks say the majority of donations are authorised and customers can contact them to clear any blocked payments . Estella Baker , an HSBC customer , told BBC Radio 4 's Money Box program her donation was blocked . It is really pressing with the Haiti appeal that the charities get the money as fast as possible with no difficulties Estella Baker , Money Box listener `` They told me they had done this because I had n't used that website before . `` But recently I have used a lot of websites and made credit card payments some for larger sums than that and none has been blocked . '' Andrew Goodwill , from fraud screening firm 3rd Man , said criminals use charity donations to test whether a card has been stopped . `` When a credit card fraudster compromises your card he will want to test that card to see if it works . `` So he will make a small donation through a charity website because there are no goods to be delivered and if it does works he can then go on and use it on other sites . '' `` Banks are blocking donations to charities and it is absolutely ridiculous because at this time that is what people want to do to show their support . `` Ring your card company and tell them that you are really annoyed and make sure they take the block off so you can use the card . '' The scale of the problem is not clear but the Red Cross has confirmed that it does occur with a small proportion of online donations . the vast majority of our customers ' donations to charities are made successfully Other listeners have also contacted Money Box to say their online donations to a number of charities with various cards have been blocked . Ms Baker thinks the banks need to sort out their systems . `` It is really pressing with the Haiti appeal that the charities get the money as fast as possible with no difficulties , '' she said . HSBC told Money Box : `` The vast majority of our customers ' donations to charities are made successfully , and it is only cards following a suspicious pattern of transactions that may be declined .

'' He said there was evidence of aid reaching people but `` clearly not as much as everyone would like '' . `` It 's a huge , huge challenge for the international community to marshal all this aid , '' he told BBC News . `` The question is how to deliver it . '' It was unclear exactly how many Britons remained unaccounted for in Haiti . The Foreign Office said 30 had been found safe and well , although one UK woman - Ann Barnes , originally from Leigh-on-Sea in Essex - is known to be missing . The 59-year-old personal assistant to the UN police commissioner in Haiti has not been heard of since the UN 's headquarters collapsed on Tuesday . The Disasters Emergency Committee is co-ordinating an appeal to help the people of Haiti There are 13 charities involved including the British Red Cross , Islamic Relief and World Vision Donate via the DEC website or by telephoning 0370 60 60 900 A 71-strong British search-and-rescue team has flown to the region , and includes a number of firefighters and two search dogs . They found a two-year-old girl alive in the rubble of a nursery . And they rescued a man aged 55 from a collapsed supermarket and a 39-year-old woman who had been in a block of flats . Meanwhile the organization United Haitians in the UK asked for donations of clothes , medicine and money . It held a meeting in London attended by some of those whose relatives were missing or displaced . `` I 've been calling , trying to call on the internet and in e-mails , and I 've got nowhere , '' said Nadege Attis , whose boyfriend is missing . `` I 've decided it 's better for me to go there , and find any ways I can to go there , '' she told BBC News . `` I ca n't keep waiting . '' She said she had been regularly sending messages to relatives and friends in Haiti but `` obviously they do n't have electricity so there 's no way they 're going to have access to e-mails '' . The Red Cross has set up a website to help people abroad to try to contact their relatives . A similar site has been created by two Haitians in the US .

UN humanitarian chief John Holmes said the funds were intended to help three million people for six months . The earthquake has left tens of thousands of people dead , and rescuers are continuing an increasingly desperate search for survivors . Meanwhile , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she would travel to Haiti on Saturday . The BBC 's Matthew Price , outside the ruins of a nursing college in the capital Port-au-Prince , says he has been told by a female member of staff that there could be 260 dead bodies and up to 25 people still alive under the rubble . Behind me is what remains of a five-storey building , a college of nursing that is now the size of a one-storey building . According to one of the members of management here , inside there were believed to have been more than 200 people who were crushed when that building came down . It is also believed that there are possibly 25 people alive in there . The reason for believing that is that last night a text message was received from someone who said they were inside , that they were very hungry , that they were very hot indeed and that they needed someone to come and rescue them . In the last few hours a Brazilian search and rescue team has been very , very slowly trying to get access inside . Their truck has now started moving away . A team of Brazilian rescuers is trying to gain access to the victims but progress is painfully slow , our correspondent adds . Haitian Interior Minister Paul Antoine Bien-Aime told Reuters news agency that 50,000 bodies had already been collected . `` We anticipate there will be between 100,000 and 200,000 dead in total , although we will never know the exact number , '' he said . The Pan American Health Organization has estimated that the death toll could be as high as 100,000 , while the UN said about 300,000 had been made homeless . The US has announced it will grant leave to remain to thousands of illegal Haitian migrants living there due to the humanitarian crisis in their country . The chief of the homeland security department , Janet Napolitano , said they would be allowed to stay and work , initially for 18 months . Aid workers have been grappling with logistical problems as they attempt to distribute aid . The port is too damaged to use and roads are blocked by debris , although the main route from the Dominican Republic is now clear . This is a huge and a horrifying catastrophe , the full consequences of which we do not know Correspondents say survivors seem increasingly desperate and angry as bottlenecks and infrastructure damage delay relief efforts . Mr Holmes , who heads the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs -LRB- Ocha -RRB- , said a massive effort was being mounted and officials were `` straining every nerve '' to help . `` This is a huge and a horrifying catastrophe , the full consequences of which we do not know , '' he said . He said almost half of the appeal money would be for emergency food aid , with amounts of between $ 20m and $ 50m for health , water and sanitation , nutrition , emergency shelter , early recovery and agriculture . Mr Holmes earlier told reporters that 30 % of buildings throughout Port-au-Prince had been damaged , with the figure at 50 % in some areas . Many there have spent a third day without food and shelter in the ruined capital , though UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon , who is due to visit Haiti on Sunday , said distribution of food and medicine was under way . The BBC 's Nick Davis in Port-au-Prince says the only convoys he has seen are people leaving the city , in search of food , water and medicine . Correspondents say there is little official presence in Port-au-Prince despite incidents of looting . Mrs Clinton said she would visit Haiti on Saturday to assess the damage , meet government officials and convey to the Haitian people `` our long term , unwavering support , solidarity and sympathies '' . Earlier US President Barack Obama described the scale of the devastation as extraordinary and the losses suffered as `` heartbreaking '' . In a statement at the White House , he said the US would `` do what it takes to save lives and help people get back on their feet '' . The US has already sent an aircraft carrier , the USS Carl Vinson , to Haiti and the USS Bataan , carrying a marine expeditionary unit , is on its way . A hospital ship and more helicopters are due to be sent in the coming days , carrying more troops and marines , with the total number of US troops to rise to between 9,000 and 10,000 . Aid groups say it is a race against time to find trapped survivors . Plane-loads of rescuers and relief supplies have arrived or are due from the UK , China , the EU , Canada , Russia and Latin American nations . Gen Douglas Fraser , the commander of US Southcom , says around 90 aid flights a day are landing . Have you or your family been affected by the earthquake ? Are you taking part in the relief effort ?

Days after the quake devastated Port-au-Prince , killing tens of thousands , there are some reports of gangs preying on residents and looting . Officials say thousands of prisoners are unaccounted for after the main prison was destroyed . Relief has been arriving , but little has moved beyond the jammed airport . Damage to the seaport , roads and other infrastructure has prevented the speedy distribution of food , water and medical supplies . Matt Frei , BBC News , Port-au-Prince There are quite a few diggers in town moving debris , sometimes even bodies . But if you reach a pile of rubble , and there 's any evidence of life , what you have to do is pick that pile of rubble brick by brick , glass shard by glass shard . The story that we 've heard time and time again is that of lack of bright lights to continue working through the night . A part of the tarmac looked like a hospital ward on Friday with patients on drips waiting to be moved out . But that is a tiny proportion . At an outdoor hospital in town there was not a single doctor or nurse , and people were dying in front of our eyes unnecessarily . If you have lost a leg or foot and you are lying out in the open at these extraordinary temperatures without water , and medicine , often without any shade for four days , you are not going to live very long . There is no reason why some of the dozens of doctors who have arrived in the past two days should not go there to treat these people . The roads are clear and it 's only a 20-minute drive from the airport . On Saturday morning , a magnitude-4 .5 aftershock struck close to Haiti 's capital , the US Geological Survey said , forcing people to flee buildings . US President Barack Obama met two of his predecessors in the White House , George W Bush and Bill Clinton , to seek their support . After the talks , Mr Obama said the two men would lead the US ' fundraising efforts through the Bush-Clinton Haiti Fund . `` America is moving forward with one of the largest relief efforts in its history , '' Mr Obama said , warning that recovery would take a long time . President Bush urged Americans to send `` cash '' , and President Clinton said Haitians `` can escape their history and built a better future if we do our part '' . US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is traveling to Haiti on Saturday to assess the damage and convey to the Haitian people `` our long term , unwavering support , solidarity and sympathies '' . A spokeswoman for the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said aid workers were dealing with a disaster `` like no other '' in UN memory because the country had been `` decapitated '' . `` Government buildings have collapsed and we do not even have the support of the local infrastructure , '' Elisabeth Byrs said in Geneva . Ms Byrs said the situation was even worse than the devastation wrought by the 2004 tsunami in Indonesia 's Aceh province . `` It 's worse than the Indonesian earthquake where at least we could get the support of some local authorities , '' she said . `` Men suddenly appeared with machetes to steal money , '' resident Evelyne Buino told AFP news agency . Up to 4,000 prisoners are unaccounted for , with many believed to have escaped from the central prison . `` There are thieves coming out , '' Haitian police inspector-general Jean-Yonel Trecile told Reuters news agency . `` To make sure this does not spread , we have taken a number of these people off the streets . We have arrested about 50 people . '' There is little police presence in the capital , although some Brazilian UN peacekeepers are patrolling the streets . UN Undersecretary General for Peacekeeping Alain Le Roy told the US Public Broadcasting Service -LRB- PBS -RRB- network on Friday : `` There have been some incidents where people were looting or fighting for food . They are desperate . '' But he added that overall the situation remained under control so far . The BBC 's Nick Davis in Port-au-Prince says the only convoys he has seen are people leaving the city , in search of food , water and medicine . ` Historic effort needed in Haiti ' The UN is reporting a rise in the number of people trying to cross into the neighbouring Dominican Republic , and an influx into Haiti 's northern cities . Overnight the crippled port received its first supply ship since the earthquake , a boat carrying bananas and coal , AFP reports . Interior Minister Paul Antoine Bien-Aime said 50,000 bodies had been collected , but the total number of dead could be `` between 100,000 and 200,000 '' . The UN said about 300,000 people had been made homeless . US authorities have taken temporary control of the airport to help distribute aid more quickly . Meanwhile , details are emerging about the extent of the damage beyond Port-au-Prince . Up to 90 % of the buildings have been damaged in Leogane , a town about 19km -LRB- 18 miles -RRB- to the west , the UN said . `` According to the local police , between 5,000 to 10,000 people have been killed and most bodies are still in the collapsed buildings , '' Elisabeth Byrs said . The UN has launched an appeal for $ 562m -LRB- # 346m -RRB- intended to help three million people for six months . A total of about $ 360m has been pledged so far for the relief effort , but only part of this sum will be included in the emergency appeal . UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon , who is due to visit Haiti on Sunday , said distribution of food and medicine was under way . The US has already sent an aircraft carrier , the USS Carl Vinson , to Haiti and the USS Bataan , carrying a marine expeditionary unit , is on its way .

The UN has launched an appeal for $ 562m -LRB- # 346m -RRB- , which it hopes will fund a six-month relief effort to help the injured and those who have lost loved ones , homes and livelihoods . Because of Haiti 's status as the poorest country in the western hemisphere , and owing to past disasters including several hurricanes in 2008 , many international charities already had teams on the ground working on aid and reconstruction . These agencies have mobilised emergency teams in response to the quake . Medical aid to help treat the many thousands injured has been a priority , with the International Committee of the Red Cross reporting that most hospitals in Port-au-Prince are full or degraded . The scale of the damage and the fact that it struck the capital city - the center of resources - was handicapping the relief effort , Medecins Sans Frontieres ' Marc Dubois told the BBC . MSF says it has treated and stabilised more than 1,500 people in the capital since Tuesday 's earthquake . But after all three of its medical facilities in the city were damaged in the earthquake , it has been doing limited work mostly in tented clinics . People are going to die from infections , not from their injuries `` We 've got a full inflatable surgical hospital sitting , basically , at the airport , waiting to get on-line and working again , '' Mr Dubois said . `` This is a race against time - people are injured and need immediate first aid and they need surgery , and we 've just now been able to get that going . `` But things like broken bones , real fractures , trauma wounds to the head require a specialised service . `` And to watch your children slowly get infected ; if things do n't happen right now ... then people are going to die from infections , not from their injuries . '' MSF has begun some emergency surgery at Choscal Hospital in Cite Soleil , a slum area where tin-roofed shacks survived better in the quake than the concrete structures in other parts of the city . The `` Doctors Without Borders '' charity has also found another site that it hopes to have up and running as an operating block this weekend . The ICRC and Save the Children , both of which have worked in Haiti for many years , have been distributing medical supplies to hospitals and clinics . Difficulties getting aid in and out of the capital 's overwhelmed airport prompted a Red Cross medical convoy delivery by road on Saturday from the Dominican Republic . The convoy transported a 50-bed field hospital , surgical teams and an emergency telecoms unit , and the Red Cross says it is planning the delivery of two larger field hospitals . An ICRC flight carrying 40 tonnes of medical supplies that had been due to arrive on Friday was diverted to the Dominican Republic , and is due to reach Port-au-Prince overland on Sunday . Many are wearing facemasks to protect themselves from the smell of decaying bodies International Committee of the Red Cross Care International , whose work in Haiti dates back to the aftermath of Hurricane Hazel in 1954 , has identified water and food provision as its top priority in the earthquake 's aftermath . It has shipped 600,000 water purification sachets to Haiti from Panama and plans distribution of 60,000 meals of high-energy biscuits . Another immediate need is supply of body bags , according to project manager Joseph Francoeur Jean in the nearby city of Gonaives , who called the disaster `` Haiti 's darkest day '' . The Haitian government says it has collected 50,000 bodies , although there are fears the death toll could rise to between 100,000 and 200,000 . The day after the earthquake , the ICRC activated a special website to enable people affected by the disaster to get in touch with loved ones . Of almost 20,000 registered on the site by Saturday , only about 1,400 of those were people inside Haiti letting others know they were safe and well . The ICRC 's Simon Schorno , in Port-au-Prince , said there were about 40 makeshift camps covering every open public space in the city . `` It 's utter chaos - there is destruction in every neighborhood , '' he said . `` People are walking around , looking for food , for help . Many are wearing facemasks to protect themselves from the smell of decaying bodies . There are no tents , no plastic sheeting , no place to cook and no toilets . '' Tens of thousands are in camps , afraid to return to damaged buildings Save the Children said it had been assessing health needs in the temporary camps set up in the worst-hit neighborhoods . On the charity 's website , emergency team leader Annie Foster described `` dazed , dehydrated parents walking the streets with their children , searching for clean water , food , and shelter '' . She said the charity was establishing '' ` safe space ' areas for children in these camps , and also beginning child tracing programs to reconnect children who were separated from their families during the emergency '' . Save the Children 's other work includes : Mounting a staging ground in the Dominican Republic , from where overland delivery has begun of household and hygiene supplies including blankets , soap and jerrycans Sending additional emergency staff to Port-au-Prince , including specialist support on education , livelihoods and child protection needs Eleven ICRC emergency experts have already flown from Geneva , Switzerland , and are on the ground in Port-au-Prince assessing humanitarian needs . Another specialist team is due to fly out on Sunday , ahead of 14 Emergency Response Units -LRB- ERUs -RRB- from Red Cross Societies around the world due to arrive in the coming days . These ERUs will offer medical care , water and sanitation services , as well as setting up two `` base camps '' to provide logistical and technical support to the relief effort .

The Haitian government has handed over control of the entire facility to the American military , who are here in large numbers . US soldiers have started the tricky operation of controlling the massive amount of air traffic that is now flooding in , and aid agencies from across the globe are arriving minute by minute . It is though still incredibly disorganised . `` The situation is what it is , '' says Capt Justin Doyle , who is normally based in New Jersey . `` It 's great to see so many organizations and countries coming together to deliver aid at this time . `` Obviously it 's chaotic , but when people come together and they got a good purpose you can make some good things happen out of chaos , and I think that 's what 's happening right now . '' But the fact remains that much of the aid - tents , blankets and medical supplies - is still sitting on the runway in Port-Au-Prince . A short distance from the airport in one of the city 's poor neighborhoods the scenario is all too familiar . There are few facilities to treat those injured in the earthquake The people , hiding from the hot sun under makeshift shelters , can hear the planes coming in and they spend much of the day gathered around radio sets listening to the promises of aid from wealthy nations across the world . `` We need help , we have seen nothing so far , nobody comes , '' says a local resident who goes by the name of Herbie . `` We have a lot of death right here . We scared to stay inside the houses because we do n't know when something 's going to happen , where is the help ? '' Despite concerns about security Haitians are showing incredible patience but it is now being severely tested as the hours pass . Many of those who have received horrific injuries are being treated by their friends and family . The equipment they have is rudimentary at best , and in many cases the treatment fails and yet more people die . The stench of corpses across Port-Au-Prince is everywhere , in some places the bodies are being piled onto bonfires that emit an even more putrid odour . Haitians are now leaving this devastated city by the thousand . By car , moped and on foot they are getting out with no real destination , just away from what has become a mass grave .

But what do agencies do when disaster strikes ? There is no doubt that Haiti 's 7.0-magnitude earthquake has been a humanitarian disaster . Over three million people are thought to have been displaced in the poorest nation in the Americas , and the death toll keeps rising . Charities have been quick to send supplies and emergency response teams . The Disasters Emergency Committee -LRB- DEC -RRB- - the umbrella organization which co-ordinates responses to major disasters overseas - launched an emergency appeal within days . Britons donated more than # 2m in the space of 36 hours . But how do charities and the DEC assess what to do first when a disaster devastates ? Richard North , acting head of logistics for the British Red Cross , said the first line of response was to see if a disaster could be handled on a local level . `` The Haitian Red Cross was overwhelmed , warehouse buildings damaged , there was a clear requirement for international assistance . `` Emergency stocks were distributed pretty much straight away . Then we looked at our emergency response unit , we have teams which are on 24\\/7 standby , and specialist areas like medicine , '' he said . Oxfam is among the charities sending shelter equipment for Haiti 's displaced In Haiti , easing the gridlock at the airport which has blocking aid getting to the victims was now a priority . The British Red Cross would dispatch a logistics team from the UK to create another entry point to Haiti , he said . `` Port-au-Prince airport is subject to restrictions on fuel and handling equipment , the port is badly damaged , we need some kind of trucking system to transfer goods into Haiti from the -LRB- neighbouring -RRB- Dominican Republic . '' The Red Cross was also mobilising stocks of plastic sheets , tarpaulins , hygiene kits , mosquito nets and buckets from Panama , he said . Looking further ahead , he said : `` Emergency relief typically takes 6-8 weeks , with recovery 2-4 years . `` Normally the response moves from search and rescue and medical needs , to helping those who have lost homes with shelter , to water sanitation and food . Then comes more longer-term recovery programs , like re-building homes and offering families micro-loans . '' Oxfam , which had a member of staff killed in the earthquake , said its priority was `` always '' water and sanitation . The charity is preparing to send up to 10 tonnes of water , sanitation , health and shelter equipment - valued at around # 70,000 - from its Oxford UK warehouse on Saturday afternoon . Equipment includes emergency sheeting for shelter and latrines , water tubing to create pipes , water purification chemicals and tablets and buckets to enable people to carry and store water . Large parts of the Haitian capital have been devastated The charity said staff already based in Haiti had been providing shovels to clear rubble and search for trapped victims , and 17 international humanitarian experts had arrived in Haiti on Friday . Kate Akhtar , senior emergency program officer for Care International , agreed that water and sanitation were `` key '' . She said Care was sending 600,000 water purification tablets and it had enough stocks of high protein biscuits to feed 60,000 families . But she said assessments needed to be `` ongoing '' . Haiti was `` well versed '' in disaster , having had four hurricanes in 2008 , but was in `` urgent need '' of more aid , she said . `` Urban areas are always difficult , but there is so much deforestation in Haiti - which has caused landslide problems in the past - that it will be difficult to source items to create shelter . '' Communication was also a problem , with text messaging the only way to communicate with their staff , she said . ActionAid said aid was `` trickling in '' but the situation was `` chaotic '' . It said it had 25 staff in the country , but 20 were `` still trying to dig their families out of the rubble '' . A team of international staff from ActionAid , including some from the UK and Brazil , were traveling to Haiti and should be in the country by Sunday . As well as delivering shelter , food and sanitary kits for women , the charity would provide psycho-social support , a spokeswoman said . Peter Grant , International Director of Tearfund , said the DEC considered three factors when it decided whether to launch an appeal : firstly , the need ; secondly , members ' capacity to respond ; and thirdly , evidence the UK public wanted to help . He said the disaster in Haiti was `` clear cut '' because `` all lights were green '' - whereas in other scenarios , like the droughts in east Africa , it was much harder because `` there was little media interest '' . He said Tearfund - which works with a range of churches and organizations in 35 countries - was sending a disaster assessment team to Haiti over the weekend with a view to helping in the medium - to long-term , but was already working with partners on the ground . `` By appealing in consortium , the DEC is flexible . Different agencies have different skills , so we work in a complementary way . Some agencies are geared up to send immediate relief - we anticipate a two-year response , '' he said .

BBC News website readers have been describing how the earthquake has affected them . Survivors say not enough aid is reaching them . Photo : Frederic Dupoux I was in the mountains , in a suburb of Port-au-Prince when the earthquake happened . Once I realized what the magnitude is , I went straight down to the city . The further I got , the worst things got . Right now everyone is waiting for help , looking for fuel , food and water . We did not expect such a tragedy , so nobody has got any supplies . There are no shops open and people do n't know what to do . The security situation is becoming a problem too . Streets can get very violent and you have to be careful . I have n't witnessed any violence , but I have seen people looting houses and shops in their struggle to find food . I would like to say to people around world : please bring help , bring hands , send food and water Here 's an example to illustrate the situation - my uncle has a water distribution business . Right now he is distributing the water for free , but he ca n't do that on his own , he has a military escort . Everybody is looking for food and water . Aid is coming through , but you do n't see it everywhere , it 's not on a big scale . People are asking for help and they are wondering why so little has arrived . Yesterday I witnessed something that shows how desperate people are . A rescue team asked a crowd of people to guide them towards places where people might be trapped . The crowd insisted that they are the ones who needed the help . I spend my days out in the streets , taking photographs of the destruction and people 's struggle to survive . Everybody is like me - out in the streets , not by choice , but because there 's no place to go . People are camping outside , setting up tents on every little green they can find . I would like to say to people around world : please bring help , send food and water . The whole city is destroyed and has to be rebuilt . It 's really difficult to describe . We need to know what to do after that and right now we do n't even know what tomorrow will be like . Dixie Bickell , director `` God 's Littlest Angels '' orphanage , Haiti Hospitals in Haiti are ill-equipped to deal with the injured We look after 147 children , ranging from newborns to 12-year-olds . We are running low on supplies : I have enough rice to feed the children for a week but we are low on water , sugar , basic foods , diesel and cooking fuel . I know there will be many more children coming to the orphanage soon , so we need as many beds as we can get . My house is full at the moment but I would like to take on more orphans . Even though many have lost their parents , we are praying that their families will come forward for them . The atmosphere here is still very tense . We had a large aftershock at 1100 which lasted five minutes and we have had several smaller ones since then . It 's incredibly unnerving . Many of the children are outside , too scared to come in . We have seen aid at the airport but it will take some time to get to us We have seen some aid at the airport but I have not seen it being distributed to the people yet . In any case it will take some time to get to us . As we are 12 miles from the center of Port-au-Prince I do n't think we will get much help . Today I have sent two children to their new families in Luxembourg and three children to families in the Netherlands . I 'm also hoping we can evacuate more children on Tuesday but that is yet to be confirmed . I really have to applaud the Dutch government for putting the needs of the children first and speeding up the adoption process . These children were going through the process before the earthquake happened and they have already been approved for adoption by the Haitian authorities .

Men with the physique of rugby players are as agile as ballet dancers when it comes to crawling through narrow holes in ruined buildings ; and gentle too when it comes to carrying survivors out through unlikely tunnels that they dig through the rubble , sometimes with their bare hands . Rudy Parkes , two years off retirement , says that the Haiti earthquake was the worst he has seen in more than 20 years of responding to international disasters . But , along with the worst , came the best moment in all that time in the rescue of two-year old Mia , found in a space in the basement of a nursery school on Friday night . `` She was under that rubble when we left England in the snow , '' he said , emotional as he remembered the moment Mia was pulled out unhurt and reunited with her mother Cormelle . Because of a logistical bottleneck at Port-au-Prince airport , the heavy equipment that the fire officers rely on was not available until after Mia was pulled out , so they had to improvise with a locally-bought shovel and a pickaxe to force their way through the rubble to the void where she was sitting . They might have water or food - there is always a chance The following day , the fourth since the earthquake , the fire officers set out more in hope than expectation , as the statistical brutality was that most of those who survived the initial earthquake would now have died through lack of water , food , air or willpower . But the rescuers , who are all volunteers with the expenses of their work here paid for by the UK Department for International Development , continued their work anyway . Rudy Parkes saw the statistics as defeatism . `` They might have water or food . There is always a chance , '' he said as the teams , including two dogs , Holly and Echo , were called to site after site where people said there had been voices since the earthquake . But each time they found no sign of life . The decision to leave and move on was a harsh one for families who still hoped beyond hope . In other places people called desperately to the fire officers for people to come and take away bodies as the smell of death and threat of disease have become intolerable . But on Saturday afternoon , another British team , from the charity Action UK , were called to a house where a woman was calling out . Fire officers joined them and soon made contact with the woman . When they had dug in through the side of her house , working from the top of a pile of rubble , pictures from a camera sent down the tunnel showed that she was lying flat on her back in a space not much deeper than herself , with her toes touching the roof . A BBC cameraman at the scene , Rob Magee , who speaks fluent French , was called on to help translate and helped to console the woman , Sonia Delmas , 39 , as fire officers inched closer towards her . Her daughter was lying dead beside her , but Sonia was pulled out alive and in one piece , crying out thanks to Jesus as she blinked in the open air after almost 100 hours confined with little hope of rescue . There is enormous emotion among all those at the scene of a successful rescue . It rises up , catching some unawares , and few of these tough men would would deny that a tear comes to their eyes at some point . When I asked Martin Fisher , from the Greater Manchester Service , why he does this work , hazardous and uncomfortable as it is , he said : `` Because it makes me feel better '' . And he spoke for many in that . This has been the largest ever international response to a disaster , with 1,700 rescue workers from more than 40 countries involved . They have an extraordinary skill in being able to go deep into damaged buildings and save lives , and they do it in the interests of a common humanity . Among 100,000 dead , the 50 or so survivors that have been pulled out by the international rescue teams are a sign of hope for Haiti .

The world number one was joined by Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams on Sunday at a packed Rod Laver Arena . `` I was following it on TV and saw the devastation and I thought we should do something , '' the Swiss star said . `` It was a lot of fun . It 's a great thing and I 'm happy the players were also in such good spirits . '' Haiti was devastated by Tuesday 's earthquake , measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale , and the Red Cross has estimated the death toll at between 45,000 and 50,000 , with millions more injured , orphaned or made homeless . National Football League , Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association in the United States also pledged sums of money . Greg McLaughlin , president of the Tiger Woods Foundation , said the foundation staff were evaluating `` the most appropriate role '' to help the Haitian people . Just 24 hours before the start of the first major tournament of the season , many of the world 's top tennis players sacrificed last-minute training to help provide some funds for the victims of the tragedy . Spectators were charged A$ 10 -LRB- # 5.60 -RRB- to see a number of doubles matches , which also included Belgium 's US Open champion Kim Clijsters , Australian Lleyton Hewitt , American Andy Roddick and world number three Novak Djokovic . More than A$ 200,000 -LRB- # 114,000 -RRB- was raised in the event called ` Hit for Haiti ' . With players wearing microphones , Federer , who lost to Spain 's world number two Nadal in last year 's Australian Open final , teamed up with reigning Australian Open champion Serena Williams , along with Hewitt and Samantha Stosur . `` It was a fun afternoon for all of us .

BBC News website readers have been describing how the earthquake has affected them . Many people are sleeping on the streets . Photo : Thomas Oronti The huge problem about this awful situation is that no-one in Haiti realizes how big this thing is . This is because we have too much to worry about and guess what the future is going to be . There must be only one or two schools left in my hometown , the hospital is totally destroyed and many houses too . There are corpses all over Port-au-Prince , refugee camps with no resources . There are thousands of people sleeping in the streets and many criminals were let free . I 've seen more horror in the last four days than in my entire life We wo n't be able to live like that for more than a month . The situation is disgusting . There are people who want to take advantage of this tragedy by selling water and gas at much higher prices . That 's so selfish . Many of my friends and their parents have already left for the US or the Dominican Republic . It took us 200 years to get here , do we have to wait another 200 years now ? And who 's going to help rebuild all this if we all chicken out ? I wish it could just be a bad dream . I 've seen more horror in the last four days than in my entire life . Thomas Oronti , Santo Domingo , Dominican Republic I and my fellow co-workers took relief food and water to Port-au-Prince on Saturday . We filled two SUVs -LRB- Sports Utility Vehicles -RRB- and one closed-door truck with food and water . Survivors urgently need food and water . Photo : Thomas Oronti We had heard lots of rumors suggesting the border is closed , roads are impassable and there are riots . From our experience this just was n't the case . It took us only three-and-a-half hours to get to the Haitian border and an hour to get into Port-Au-Prince . The roads were mostly clear and travel was very straightforward . We went to a refugee camp and the local police helped organise a queue . At first it was fine but as our supplies got low , the people queuing became restless . I am surprised there were n't more people handing out aid This was the scariest part of the trip . I was so glad we had followed advice and brought a closed door truck rather than an open pick-up . We gave the rest of the supplies to some families who were living by the side of a pile of rubble that used to be their apartment . People have nowhere to go and are just staying by the ruins that were once their homes , salvaging whatever they can . Apart from the slight unrest when handing out our aid , we did n't see any violence or looting . The people we saw were very grateful and I am just surprised that there were n't more people handing out aid . The NGOs will eventually distribute their aid but they are taking too long and a direct response is needed now . The Haitian people need to know someone cares and at the moment no way near enough is being done to give out that message .

I and a French lady colleague had left our office . The Pan American Health Organization put the death toll at 50,000-100 ,000 . Photo : Thomas Oronti I was intending to go back to my apartment in the hotel . So we left the office early , but we had a last-minute meeting outside the office , which went on longer than expected and we were delayed . Had we been in the office or in the hotel , we would have been dead . We were in the car when the earthquake happened . We were tossed around incredibly violently , buildings were falling down around us . Initially I thought it was an explosion , all you could see was dust . It was like a giant was shaking the car ; we were jerked up , down and sideways . Natural disasters are tragic events but Haiti had the advantage of a huge number of UN personnel in position . They could have started to distribute food and water , but they did nothing . I suspect that losing their administrative HQ may account for their lack of action but I find it hard to believe that senior officers at the many well-established bases could not have acted on their own and shown a little initiative .

Mark Doyle , BBC News , Haiti The scene an hour 's drive west of Port-au-Prince is apocalyptic . Almost every single building on the road I 'm driving on now has been flattened .

The US military is also beginning to use a container port in Cap Haitian , in northern Haiti , which will greatly increase the volume of aid flowing into the country . Port-au-Prince 's dock remains inoperable . Reports coming out of Port-au-Prince had earlier indicated that a crowd of about 1,000 people was involved in a violent fight over goods in one of the city 's central commercial streets . A photographer for the Reuters news agency said that a group of men armed with knives , ice-picks , and hammers fought one another over clothing , toys and any other items they could find in destroyed houses and shops . `` It 's anarchy there now , total chaos , the police have gone away , '' Chris Barria said . `` They are fighting , hitting each other , throwing stones at each other . '' But the UN Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs , John Holmes , played down the incidents of violence . He told the BBC that the security situation in Haiti was calm , minor incidents apart . Estimates of how many people died following the 7.0 magnitude earthquake on Tuesday have varied . The Pan American Health Organization put the death toll at 50,000-100 ,000 , while Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive said 100,000 `` would seem a minimum '' . He said more than 25,000 bodies had been collected and buried . Rescue workers have been racing against time to find survivors still trapped under the rubble . It 's worse than the Indonesian earthquake where at least we could get the support of some local authorities On Saturday morning , a magnitude-4 .5 aftershock struck close to the capital , forcing people to once again flee buildings . Damage to the seaport , roads and other infrastructure has prevented the speedy distribution of supplies . US authorities have taken temporary control of the airport to help distribute aid more quickly . US President Barack Obama met two of his predecessors in the White House - George W Bush and Bill Clinton - to seek their support . After the talks , Mr Obama said the two men would lead the US fundraising efforts through the Bush-Clinton Haiti Fund . Presidents Obama , Bush and Clinton appeal for cash donations `` America is moving forward with one of the largest relief efforts in its history , '' Mr Obama said , while warning that recovery would take a long time . President Bush urged Americans to send `` cash '' , and President Clinton said Haitians `` can escape their history and built a better future if we do our part '' . A spokeswoman for the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said aid workers were dealing with a disaster `` like no other '' in UN memory because the country had been `` decapitated '' . `` Government buildings have collapsed and we do not even have the support of the local infrastructure , '' Elisabeth Byrs said in Geneva . Ms Byrs said the situation was even worse than the devastation wrought by the 2004 tsunami in Indonesia 's Aceh province . `` It 's worse than the Indonesian earthquake where at least we could get the support of some local authorities , '' she said . The UN has launched an appeal for $ 562m -LRB- # 346m -RRB- intended to help three million people for six months . But while aid may be arriving in huge quantities but there is little of sign of a co-ordinated aid effort on the ground , correspondents say . Many people continue to leave the city , in search of food , water and medicine . The UN is reporting a rise in the number of people trying to cross into the neighbouring Dominican Republic , and an influx into Haiti 's northern cities . Meanwhile , details are emerging about the extent of the damage beyond Port-au-Prince . Up to 90 % of the buildings have been damaged in Leogane , a town about 19km -LRB- 18 miles -RRB- to the west , the UN said . `` According to the local police , between 5,000 to 10,000 people have been killed and most bodies are still in the collapsed buildings , '' Ms Byrs said .

The first Briton confirmed dead in the disaster `` was a much-loved member of a close family '' , the relatives ' statement said . `` He leaves behind his wife , his parents , brother and sister , grandmother and extended family . '' The prime minister is hugely grateful for the work that Frederick and others were doing to build a stronger Haiti , and giving people hope where they had none Mr Wooldridge was a senior political affairs and planning officer at the UN , for which he had worked in Geneva and Liberia before moving to Haiti in 2007 . A Downing Street spokesman said : `` The prime minister is hugely grateful for the work that Frederick and others were doing in the UN Stabilisation Mission : helping to build a stronger Haiti , and giving people hope where they had none . '' He added that Gordon Brown 's thoughts were also with the loved ones of UK nationals whose whereabouts were yet to be confirmed . It is unclear how many Britons remain unaccounted for in Haiti , after the earthquake which killed tens of thousands . Steven Fisher , the UK 's ambassador to Haiti and the Dominican Republic , said the Foreign Office 's rapid deployment team was `` doing quite well '' in their efforts to account for expatriate Britons . Relatives say hope is fading for missing UN worker Ann Barnes But he added : `` Even getting out and visiting a few sites in the city takes an awful lot of effort . '' The Foreign Office said it was beginning to repatriate UK nationals , and had `` located and checked on over 30 other Brits , who have confirmed they are safe and well '' . Another UN worker , Ann Barnes , 59 , of Leigh-on-Sea , Essex , is feared to have been killed in the collapse of the headquarters in the capital . The UN has lost at least 40 workers , including the head of the local mission , Hedi Annabi , who has been found dead in the rubble . Ms Barnes 's sister , Irene Marquet , said : `` She must be still there in the rubble which is an awful thing to know . '' British search-and-rescue workers are to begin hunting for survivors in a town near the epicentre of the earthquake five days ago . A 71-strong British search-and-rescue team , which includes a number of firefighters and two search dogs , have been deployed the region . The workers were due to travel to Leogane , about 19km -LRB- 12 miles -RRB- west of Port-au-Prince , at 0900 local time -LRB- 1400 GMT -RRB- on Sunday . UK airlines have flown aid to Haiti In Port-au-Prince , the British rescuers have pulled several survivors from collapsed buildings , including a two-year-old girl removed from the rubble of a nursery on Friday . But Wiltshire firefighter Dan Cooke , who is part of the rescue team , warned : `` The people are very tough as a nation and the weather conditions help to keep people alive but as the days go on the chances of people surviving fall massively . '' On Sunday , the Bishop of St Albans held a service dedicated to victims of the Haiti earthquake . In the service in New Barnet , Hertfordshire , the Rt Rev Alan Smith asked `` parishes , church schools and chaplaincies throughout the diocese to pray fervently and to give generously '' . Britons have so far donated # 15m to the Disasters and Emergency Committee , an umbrella group of 13 major British-based charities which has broadcast appeals on TV and radio . The group says a # 25 donation buys a kit of household essentials , # 50 is enough to feed a family for a fortnight and # 100 funds temporary shelter for two families . The DEC appeal for victims of the earthquake in Haiti Separately , the government has allocated # 2m to deal with `` logistical problems '' on the ground in Haiti , such as the provision of cars and lorries to distribute aid , and to improve communications links . A British Airways plane carrying aid has landed in the neighbouring Dominican Republic , while Virgin Atlantic has sent an airliner carrying aid and medical personnel to Miami , with further flights to Orlando and Jamaica due in the coming days . Among DEC members ' initial responses to the disaster , an Action Aid emergency team is delivering clean water , shelter and blankets to 20,000 people . Oxfam has 10 tonnes of aid arriving over the weekend , including plastic sheeting , chlorine for drinking water as well as body bags . The Disasters Emergency Committee is co-ordinating an appeal to help the people of Haiti There are 13 charities involved including the British Red Cross , Islamic Relief and World Vision Donate via the DEC website or by telephoning 0370 60 60 900 British Red Cross staff and volunteers have distributed kitchen and personal hygiene kits , blankets , tarpaulins and water containers . The UK 's ambassador said there was `` concern '' about the safety of aid workers . Search-and-rescue worker Dan Cooke said : `` You hear gunfire , you see gangs of youths carrying machetes but to some extent that is part of the culture here . `` We are doing quite well . The UN security forces are attaching themselves to us and some teams have brought their own armed security . `` We have been working with other teams and local people and they have been fantastic . '' The organization United Haitians in the UK has asked for donations of clothes , medicine and money . The Red Cross has set up a website to help people abroad to try to contact their relatives . A similar site has been created by two Haitians in the US .

Professor John McCloskey said that governments must prepare for quakes , rather than act after the event . The University of Ulster expert led the analysis of the quake that started the Indian Ocean 2004 tsunami . `` It is an international disgrace that we appear not to have made the smallest progress in preparation , '' he said . `` The ` international community ' is very good at preparing for war but has failed completely to prepare to help the poor , who are always the ones to suffer in these events . `` If we want to claim to be civilised we need to ensure that we never see these scenes again . '' In a letter to the journal Nature Geoscience he and his team warn that a huge wave-generating quake capable of killing as many people as in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami could strike off the Indonesian island of Sumatra , with the city of Padang in the path of destruction . The danger comes from a relentless increase in pressure over the last 200 years on a section of the Sunda Trench , one of the world 's most notorious earthquake zones , which runs parallel to the western Sumatra coast . This section , named after the Mentawai islands , `` is near failure , '' the letter warned . Professor McCloskey said that governments were `` refusing the accept the inevitable '' . `` Earthquakes happen , they kill people , they will kill more and more people if we do n't organise ourselves properly , '' he said . He said the earthquake which rocked Padang , western Sumatra in September last year killing more than 1,000 people was not the `` great earthquake '' scientists were waiting for but it may have made the next massive earthquake more likely . Professor McCloskey is the head of the Geophysics Research Group at the UoU 's Environmental Sciences Research Institute . He said that while earthquake prediction was `` as far off as ever '' all the indicators are pointed to western Sumatra as a massive quake location . `` Scientists can not forecast the exact size of the earthquake but in this case there is complete agreement that it will be very strong , probably bigger than magnitude 8.5 , dwarfing the energy release in the Haitian quake , '' he said . `` We also can not say for sure what size the tsunami will be but it has the potential to be very destructive - maybe even worse than 2004 . `` But the future need not look like Haiti . We know this earthquake is coming and we might have years or even decades to prepare . `` Given the unfolding scenes of carnage following the Haiti earthquake and the completely inadequate speed of the international response , the responsibility on the Indonesian government , the international community and the international NGOs is enormous . `` We must work urgently to prepare for this earthquake if we are not to witness again the awful scenes of children dying for want of a few stitches or a cast for a broken leg .

UN and Oxfam staff are finally bringing food and water to some parts of the capital Port-au-Prince , but the airport remains clogged with loaded planes . Many survivors of Tuesday 's quake have become desperate as they wait for aid , and many are trying to leave the city . UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon , who has arrived in Haiti , said it was the worst humanitarian crisis for decades . Mr Ban visited the ruins of the UN mission , where several staff including Special Representative Hedi Annabi were killed , and meet President Rene Preval . On Sunday afternoon , a Danish UN worker was pulled alive from the rubble of the building . Four other people were rescued during the day . The UN has launched an appeal for $ 562m -LRB- # 346m -RRB- intended to help three million people for six months , while some two million people are thought to need emergency relief . Nick Davis , BBC News , Haiti In this highly Christian country , there are still songs of praise being sung , but also prayers for the dead and dying . Relief has started trickling through , with NGOs , the UN and the US military getting food and water to those who need it . But demand has so far outstripped supply , as the distribution points become quickly overwhelmed by the numbers of people clamouring for supplies . Bottlenecks still exist between getting the aid , which is arriving in large amounts , to the people who desperately need it . Meanwhile first reports from the epicentre of the earthquake suggest the damage is even more dramatic than in the capital . The BBC 's Mark Doyle in Leogane , west of Port-au-Prince , described the scene as `` apocalyptic '' , with thousands left homeless and almost every building destroyed . There are also security concerns amid reports of looting . The US Southern Command 's Lt-Gen Ken Keen said that while streets were largely calm there had been an increase in violence . `` We are going to have to address the situation of security , '' he said , quoted by the Associated Press . `` We 've had incidents of violence that impede our ability to support the government of Haiti and answer the challenges that this country faces . '' AFP news agency quoted one of its photographers as saying police had opened fire on looters in a Port-au-Prince market , killing at least one of them . Correspondents say although the amount of supplies getting through is still small , there is a sense of movement at last . 37 UN staff confirmed dead , more than 300 missing Includes Special Representative Hedi Annabi , deputy Luiz Carlos da Costa and acting police commissioner Doug Coates UN HQ in the Christopher Hotel and other buildings collapsed in the quake Believed to be the biggest single loss of life in the UN 's history The UN World Food Programme has been handing out aid packages containing food , while UK charity Oxfam has been distributing water . US troops said they had set up their first foothold outside the airport to deliver aid carried in by helicopters . But many victims are still not receiving any aid , as the airport remains a bottleneck . UN Humanitarian Coordinator Kim Bolduc says getting supplies out to them from the planes is still a major hurdle . `` The Haitian airport now is overwhelmed , '' said UN Assistant Secretary General for Peacekeeping Operations , Edmond Mulet . The port is badly damaged , and many roads still blocked by corpses and debris . David Wimhurst , a spokesman for the UN peacekeeping force in Haiti , said aid was being delivered as quickly as possible . `` Aid is going out but it 's simply impossible in 24 hours to bring in enough aid to instantly feed all these people , many of whom are in places that are inaccessible , '' he said . We need fuel to bring in supplies and carry the wounded The Haitian and Dominican Republic governments are planning an alternative 130km -LRB- 80 miles -RRB- humanitarian road corridor to deliver relief supplies from the southern Dominican town of Barahona , the UN reports . The UN has warned about fuel shortages , which it says could affect humanitarian operations . `` Fuel is the key issue , '' Elisabeth Byrs , a spokeswoman for the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs , told the BBC . `` We need fuel to bring in supplies and carry the wounded . '' The UN says up to 80-90 % of buildings in Leogane , about 19km west of Port-au-Prince , have been destroyed . One survivor in the town said he had come to Haiti from America for his mother 's funeral , only for his wife to be killed in the earthquake . He said that so far people in the area had received no help of any kind . `` We do n't have any aid , nothing at all , '' he said . `` No food , no water , no medical , no doctors . '' Estimates of how many people died following the 7.0 magnitude earthquake on Tuesday have varied . The Pan American Health Organization put the death toll at 50,000-100 ,000 , while Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive said 100,000 `` would seem a minimum '' . A UN official has said aid workers are dealing with a disaster `` like no other '' in UN memory because the country had been `` decapitated '' . Three ministers and several senators are reported to have been killed . The US has launched what President Barack Obama called `` one of the largest relief efforts in its history '' following the quake . US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was the first senior Western official to arrive in Haiti , on Saturday . She told Haitians that the US would be `` here today , tomorrow and for the time ahead '' , asserting that `` Haiti can come back even better and stronger in the future '' .

Charl van der Merwe is a project manager for Oxfam , which has sent 200 staff into Haiti and has set up a logistics base in the neighbouring Dominican Republic . He outlines the scale of the relief operation ahead . The infrastructure in Haiti is , more or less , zero . We are , for all practical purposes , planning on the basis that we 're starting from scratch . Our staff can be fairly resourceful . When you 're in that situation , you think a little bit more outside the box than you 'd normally do . Most of them went out with cash floats so they have some access to money . Aid has been flown from the UK to the neighbouring Dominican Republic We 've made sure that we have enough money in Santo Domingo . Most of our staff there have UK mobiles - it 's not a cheap form of communication but it 's all we have at the moment . They get by and people who are traveling into Haiti have been buying stuff in Santo Domingo before they left , bringing water , food and supplies to take to the team in Haiti . The team can understand why it 's difficult to get aid out to people because there 's literally nothing there . The things you 'd expect , like roads , are very , very difficult to access . Being able to move food in a truck is just not working ; people move by foot in most cases . Some areas are more or less flattened . We 're making sure we have secure distribution points where we can give out supplies in an orderly fashion . The 2004 tsunami was `` slightly easier '' to deal with , Mr van der Merwe said People have been heavily affected by this ; they are traumatised , they are hungry , they are tired . Security only really becomes an issue when people start finding distribution points are not organised well enough , with people standing in queues for days in the sun . We 're putting security in place to make sure this is done in an orderly fashion and people actually get things - so women and children get things first , because you do n't particularly want them to stand in the sun all day . I do n't think anyone knows how long it 'll take . The tsunami was slightly easier in a sense . You had more infrastructure in major cities that were not close to the coastal areas . You had a lot more options open , whereas your options are a lot more restricted in this case . Tens of thousands are feared to have been buried in the rubble of buildings There 's the rebuilding , the clearing of all the dangerous rubble , and making sure buildings which were not demolished are actually safe and are not going to collapse in the aftermath or with aftershocks . That 's probably going to be the priority for the next couple of weeks , and then responding with massive amounts of distributions . The scale of this one is just so complex . I used to be a town planner and thinking of rebuilding a place that 's more-or-less destroyed because of an earthquake is difficult to get your mind around . Initially we 'll make sure we get the right life-saving materials to people in Haiti . From then on , we 'll start a massive rebuilding process , co-ordinated by all of the people on the ground .

If Haiti was on the continent like Rwanda , Somalia , Ethiopia , Sudan , Liberia , etc. , the concerns about Africa 's role would be mute . Haiti has stood up for Africa . The best help Africa can logistically give now -LRB- since Haitians ca n't simply walk over -RRB- is by putting pressure on UN , EU , etc. and keeping Haiti visible internationally . Also establish long-term exchanges,business-ties , etc. .

In reality , africa no no better than Haiti . If a 7.0 mag EQ can cripple Haiti what will it do to Africa ? considering the fact that help will not get to Africa as fast as it got to Haiti .

By 0300 on Monday this was interpreted to mean an earthquake was imminent . A government minister then sought to calm nationwide fears , telling local radio stations it was all a hoax . Ghana last experienced a major earthquake 70 years ago . But the BBC 's David Amanor in the capital , Accra , says awareness of last week 's devastating earthquake in Haiti may have made people more nervous .

He said his neighbors were standing outside their homes at 0400 fearing that buildings would collapse . Phone networks were also congested as people sought to warn each other , he said . It is not known whether the hoax was a result of deliberate mischief , a simple innocuous message , or a joke between friends . But our reporter says the implications are being taken seriously and the incident has reopened a controversial call by Ghana 's National Security Authority for phone operators to register names and details for every mobile phone number in the country .

The following people have been sending us their diaries . Stuart Coles , Plan International I see dawn rise and hear the sound of singing as I stand on the terrace roof . For this devout Catholic country , today is a traditional day of worship , contemplation - and many funerals . Help is here but it 's still woefully inadequate in this battered city - everyone is stretched to capacity The people of Port-au-Prince pause to remember their loved ones , but with no shortage of the living in desperate need of help , this rare moment of reflection is gone all too soon . Thousands upon thousands of homeless Haitians still walk the streets in a desperate search for those vital services - water and shelter - that will keep them safe and alive . Help is here but it 's still woefully inadequate in this battered city - everyone is stretched to capacity . Yesterday we visited one of Plan 's partner organizations - a local clinic . Staff have been swamped with hundreds of casualties , all with typical quake injuries : head , upper and lower limb fractures and wounds . In a desperate bid to help the most at risk the clinic refers some cases to the specialists at Medicins Sans Frontiers , but they tell us they too are at full stretch . And so it goes on . Our communications team , myself and video journalist Shona , head south . The quake has turned the usual two-hour drive to Jacmel into a savage , bone-jarring 12-hour mountain slog . Plan 's relief boat from the Domican Republic is on its way to isolated Jacmel with trucks bearing 1,000 family-sized tents and hundreds of emergency kits containing essentials of water , dried food , sugar soap , plastic sheeting , cups and plates . A seemingly mundane grocery list , but here these goods take on a new , priceless value . We hope to reach the coast by nightfall and see what challenges and future the people of Jacmel face . The situation remains critical , few aid agencies are in place , still hundreds of bodies are stuck in buildings . In the entire city , I 've only seen about four or five trucks and cranes trying to remove buildings to get people out . At night we must be careful not to run over people who are sleeping on the roads The smell can be overwhelming in some areas , where corpses are rotting in the heat , and near Internal Displaced Persons gatherings , because there is no sanitation , no showers , no latrines , and people are gathering in the hundreds anywhere where there is open space in the city . At night , we must be careful not to run over people who are sleeping on the roads . I saw one person sleep in the middle of an intersection , just to avoid any buildings that may fall if there is another earthquake . On my way back from an assessment in Legoane -LRB- about one hour from Port au Prince -RRB- in the dark around 1800 yesterday , we crossed some check points set up by civilians . They were jumping on a pick-up truck , that was carrying a load of corpses . They were very angry because the driver was going to dump the corpses in their town . People were angry about this but I would be too , if someone was dumping corpses in my town ! When we crossed the checkpoints , they let us through no problem and showed respect for us . Last night we could smell that horrible smell , because the windows are open in the house . That team is under a lot of stress because they have extremely limited surgical capabilities . I spoke to a surgeon yesterday , and he was so frustrated and stressed about the fact that five patients he saw yesterday needed immediate surgery . It 's getting worse because the patients who were not critical only three days ago are now in critical phases But he ca n't save their lives because they do n't have a proper operational theater . We need more space to perform surgeries , which the inflatable hospital will provide - if it ever arrives ! So , it 's getting worse because the patients who were not critical only three days ago , are now in critical phases . This means that people will die from preventable infections . It 's horrible , it 's really so terrible that people are begging for help and we ca n't help them all to save their lives . It 's the night shift here at the operations base and it is finally quiet . The MapAction team is still up preparing directions and maps for the morning 's missions . The window is fast closing and the urban search and rescue team are going for a final push to find and extract people . We in the back-office are also pushing to get what they need to maximize the time left . The camaraderie among all in the operation is great and there is the feeling that every life saved is a tribute to all . SUNDAY 17 JANUARY - CARWYN HILL This morning I arrived back from my first trip to Port-au-Prince . I can barely believe what I have seen . It is as if I entered a different world . Yesterday 's mission was to seek out appropriate places for us to send aid . The water we handed out was an incredible blessing , and today we are planning a large truck to take down thousands of water sachets . We will also be transporting some very important medical supplies to an Orthopaedic Surgery team in Port-au-Prince who we work with . It took us over 4 hours to get from one side of the city to the other . People walked through the streets aimlessly with nowhere to go , carrying the few bags and possessions they had left . Many crammed onto any vehicle available desperate to leave . The mass exodus of Port-au-Prince has begun , and on our way out we followed cars full of the injured , and in some cases even the dead . As we drove through the city the scale of the atrocity sunk in further . Human bodies were used beside burning tires and rocks for road blocks . Some roads had been closed whilst one of the few remaining hospitals discharged the mass of patients they could n't help any more . Those hospitals that did survive are dangerously low on medication and most , from my understanding are completely out of supplies . People are turned away , even a child I saw carried in desperately by his mother . Tragically the doctors just had to say , ` we ca n't do anything , you must look elsewhere . ' At the moment though there simply is n't really anywhere to go . On the way back our car was full of refugees . It was strange hearing their conversations as they listed the dead . We had just a small number of the many thousands leaving . Many already filling hospitals up North . Our ` unfinished ' wards are now being prepared for action . We 've bought mattresses , cleaned beds , and got the ward as finished as possible with what we have . Our staff have worked tirelessly on this . We do n't know when we will start receiving patients as we will be acting as an overflow facility for the government hospital which struggles on a normal day without the predicted large influx of people . `` Broken bones are the most common injuries '' I 've been living in Ecuador for four years . I 'm originally from Yorkshire . I 'm with a team of seven medical staff working at the Baptist Haiti Mission hospital on a mountain above Port-au-Prince . It 's a 100-bed hospital and we have at least 300 people here . When we got here there was only one doctor , he was almost falling asleep on his feet from exhaustion and was absolutely delighted to see us . Injured people are lining the corridors of the hospital and about 50 are outside the gate waiting . We have some security to try and control things and if somebody comes in who is close to death we 'll take them in and treat them , otherwise , we 've worked out a system where we treat priority cases first . We 're getting a lot of people coming here because they 've heard that this hospital is still standing . There are people coming down from the villages . We 've heard of three villages that were completely flattened not far from here . One of these was a community of 2,000 people and every single house was destroyed . And people are coming up the mountain from the city too . Yesterday a truck full of injured people arrived . Broken bones are the most common injuries The problem is that we 're beginning to run out of materials to treat broken bones , which is the most common injury we 're seeing . We 're trying to ask some of the organizations at the airfield for help with supplies . There 's no electricity either - we 're using a generator that works on diesel but this will last two days only . In terms of injuries , we 're seeing lots of people with gangrene too - it 's not a pretty sight . It 's the dry season now and there 's no supply of drinking water . I 'm a water engineer and I 'm meant to be setting up a filtering system today to create a more secure water supply . Our water will be for the hospital initially , and if we have more , we 'll hopefully be able to release some to the community . David Darg -LRB- left -RRB- with Eric Lotz from Operation Blessing Our emergency paramedic team arrived this morning from Israel . We immediately coupled them with medicines and transported them into the heart of the quake zone and to the National hospital . Since that moment , the hospital has been inundated with patients with too few doctors to keep up with the influx of emergency cases . The halls are filled with the groans of the untreated , the screams of those undergoing treatment and the stench of those who did n't make it . The Israeli doctors were incredible ; they worked tirelessly and were extremely reluctant to leave with so many patients still waiting to be seen . But we had to pull them back to the airport before nightfall because of the lack of security in downtown Port-au-Prince . The National hospital in Port-au-Prince . Photo : Tony Cece The airport is filling with more and more relief teams every day . The relief camp looks like an Olympic village with national flags flying from nations all over the world . We came across a soccer field with 2000 people camping in it , many of them sick or injured . They only have one doctor between them , so we have agreed to visit the camp tomorrow and set up a clinic , provide some food and give out hygiene supplies .

Lt Gen Ken Keen said the disaster was of `` epic proportions '' , but it was `` too early to know '' the full human cost . Rescuers pulled more people alive from the rubble at the weekend , but at least 70,000 people have already had burials . Relief efforts are being slowed by bottlenecks , and many thousands of survivors are fending for themselves . Many Haitians are trying to leave the devastated capital city , Port-au-Prince , and there are security concerns amid reports of looting and violence . Clearly , this is a disaster of epic proportions , and we 've got a lot of work ahead of us More than 2,000 US marines were expected to arrive in the region on Monday to bolster US troops and UN peacekeepers already on the ground . In Brussels , European Union nations pledged more than 420m euros -LRB- $ 604m ; # 320m -RRB- from the EU budget to assist Haiti , with about half the sum dedicated to emergency and short-term aid . At least 200m euros will be dedicated to funding medium - to long-term rebuilding efforts . `` We recognize that more aid and support is needed , and more has been agreed , '' EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton told reporters , adding that the EU was working closely with the United Nations , the US and others . European ministers were also discussing deploying a security mission to help maintain law and order . On Monday , UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he would recommend that the UN Security Council boost police and troop numbers in Haiti by 3,500 . It came a day after he appealed to frustrated Haitians to be patient over efforts to bring them relief . Gen Keen , running the US military relief effort , when asked about death toll estimates of between 150,000 and 200,000 people , said : `` I think the international community is looking at those figures , and I think that 's a start point . `` Clearly , this is a disaster of epic proportions , and we 've got a lot of work ahead of us . '' Amid the chaos and destruction , a number of people were rescued from collapsed buildings at the weekend . Among the lucky ones was a seven-year-old girl pulled alive from the ruins of a supermarket . Nick Davis , BBC News , Port-au-Prince I 'm standing on what would have been the roof of the city bank building . There 's steel everywhere , the steel that was supposed to keep it upright . Right now the front of it 's just completely collapsed . The rear of the building is still intact . The job now is to see whether or not there are any more bodies still inside . You 've got to bear in mind that this earthquake struck at a time when this place would have been full of people , full of staff members , full of cleaning crews , full of security and customers too . Forensic teams who have flown in are using mitochondrial DNA samples to hopefully identify the bodies which they 've found . But until this steel is cut , until the earth-moving equipment which is just to the other side of me can remove the tonnes of concrete I 'm standing on , not much can be done . At the UN headquarters destroyed in the earthquake , rescuers lifted a Danish staff member alive from the ruins , just 15 minutes after the secretary general visited the site . And US teams with search dogs also rescued a 16-year-old Dominican girl trapped for five days in a small , three-storey hotel . The US Agency for International Development -LRB- USAID -RRB- said on Monday that American teams had pulled 10 people alive from the rubble the day before . `` According to rescue officials , this is the largest number of rescues in a single day in decades of earthquake search and rescue efforts , '' it said in a statement . While hopes dim with every passing day , a South African rescue official , Colin Diner , told the BBC he hoped there would be more people found alive . `` What we are seeing is that the buildings have a whole lot of openings , collapsed voids and things , and that always gives you a better opportunity , '' he said . UN humanitarian chief John Holmes told reporters on Monday that there were now 43 search and rescue teams on the ground , with 1,700 people involved in the effort . `` More than 70 people have been pulled from the wreckage in the last few days , '' he said , saying that efforts to find those trapped in the rubble would carry on until there was no longer hope of finding anyone alive . He played down worries over security , saying that despite incidents of violence , the overall situation was one of calm . Correspondents say there is a sense of movement at last with the relief effort , although the amount of supplies getting through is still small . EU - $ 604m -LRB- 420m euros ; # 371m -RRB- US - $ 100m pledged in immediate aid , with promise of more later The BBC 's Mark Doyle says that in a slum community in the hills above Port-au-Prince , people have yet to see any government officials or aid workers . They have camped out on waste ground and are fending for themselves , he says , pulling together to survive . Meanwhile , our correspondent says , perhaps 5,000 people are lined up in the baking sun outside the US embassy , desperate to get visas to join relatives among the large Haitian-American community in the US . Several agencies have complained about not being able to get aid through the airport in Port-au-Prince , which is heavily congested and has been taken over by the US military . Medecins Sans Frontieres urged commanders to speed up the landing of planes carrying medical supplies , after one carrying an inflatable field hospital was turned away on Saturday night . But Mr Holmes said that initial issues were now being resolved with the introduction through the World Food program of a slot system to prioritise humanitarian flights . The head of the US operation at the airport , Col Buck Elton , said on Sunday there had been 600 take-offs and landings since the US took control on Wednesday , and 50 flights had been diverted . About 60 % of the flights coming in were civilian and 40 % military , he said . US troops also said they had set up their first foothold outside the airport to deliver aid carried in by helicopters . Port-au-Prince 's port is badly damaged , and many roads are still blocked by corpses and debris , hampering the delivery of fuel and other supplies . The Haitian and Dominican Republic governments are planning an alternative 130km -LRB- 80 mile -RRB- humanitarian road corridor to deliver relief from the southern Dominican town of Barahona , the UN said . Mr Holmes said the UN expected to resolve problems with bringing in fuel from the Dominican Republic in the next day or two . The UN has launched an appeal for $ 562m -LRB- # 346m -RRB- intended to help three million people for six months , most of whom are thought to need emergency relief . The British government has said it will treble its aid to Haiti to # 20m -LRB- $ 32m -RRB- .

In the Pakistani earthquake I flew in a German helicopter . The Swiss arrived early . I found the same covering the tsunami in Asia . The Italian teams , as always , proved they have some of the best rescue workers in the world . So again this time in Haiti . There are Welsh firefighters rescuing a two-year old girl . Spanish and French teams have been tearing at the rubble at the Hotel Montana . In a disaster the secret to early success is small mobile teams that arrive quickly and save lives . Initially it is difficult co-ordinating these teams . National search and rescue squads have to deploy at once . They go into neighborhoods and , like with the Israeli team yesterday , they pull survivors from the rubble where they find them . It is always chaotic . At every disaster I have reported on the same complaints are heard . Chaos is at the heart of disaster . In Phuket in Thailand they said that bodies were not disposed of quickly enough . In Kashmir I flew into villages that had not received any help ten days after the earthquake had struck . In Turkey it was said there were too many rescue teams and I saw some trying to find a building where there were not dog teams working already . Even in the United States , after Hurricane Katrina , we found ourselves rescuing families from the water . Of course the aim is to establish co-ordination . It is much harder in Haiti because there is not a functioning government . Delivery of aid is difficult without security . That lies at the heart of the tension between France and the United States . The Americans control the airport and they are setting up a military operation in Haiti so some of their military planes have landed first . That has infuriated the French . A plane carrying an inflatable hospital from France was diverted . The French Foreign Minister , Bernard Kouchner , complained the airport had become a `` US annexe '' . Such tensions , in my experience , are inevitable . The lesson of every disaster I have covered is that co-ordination is best done on the ground . It is not a role for ministers or bureaucrats hundreds or thousands of miles away . It does n't work like that . Now the EU 's response is complicated by the fact that it is learning to live with new structures . It has a foreign policy chief in Catherine Ashton . She has said that `` rebuilding Haiti is now a priority for the EU '' There was also , in her public statements , the suggestion that she was `` co-ordinating '' the different activities of the European Union with the member states . Now there clearly is a role for the EU in planning for the long-term development of Haiti and that will be discussed at a meeting of development ministers today . But there is a question as to what role the EU should play in coordinating emergency search and rescue and relief operations . Certainly the EU , as an institution , is not essential for rescue work to be effective . Nations have acted decisively and quickly without referring to international institutions . Iceland despatched 35 members of its search and rescue team . Canada has its Sea King helicopters in action . Brazilian rescue workers are in place . The Chinese had people in Port-au-Prince by 0200 on 14 January . I suspect a dilemma here for the EU . There is a current obsession to be seen as a `` player '' on the world stage . This need , in part , lay behind the Lisbon Treaty . It is often easy for that desire to translate into wanting to act as if the EU were a state . It has no military capacity . Even if the EU 's military was under one command it would be hard to match the US with its aircraft-carrier , hospital ship , logistical power and its ability to deploy thousands of troops while it is fighting two campaigns overseas . The fact that Europe can not do that does not make it somehow weak or ineffective , as some have suggested . The question is more where the EU should best put its energy . The EU may be most effective at coordinating medium and long-term development . Today it is set to announce 100m euros -LRB- # 88m -RRB- in reconstruction aid . I just donated # 100 to the Red Cross , which my employer doubled up with a matching contribution . It would be nice to think the EU institutions were encouraging their employees to make similar practical contributions , rather than seeking to exploit tragedy as part of their never-ending campaign of self-aggrandizement . Bernard Kouchner is a co-founder of M decins Sans Fronti res , so it is particularly disappointing to read that he is indulging in anti-American rants at a time like this .

Now , I think we all agree that we do n't have a huge capability to do so , especially if you compare ourselves to the US . But the objective is to develop some capability . We still need to find the way . Limiting ourselves to just offering AID while others are operating on the field is not exactly an ambitious role for us . Maybe for the British it would be more than enough if the EU was seen as a kind of international AID agency but I do n't think a lot of other EU states share this view .

What exactly is at the heart of its weakness and ineffectiveness then ? `` The question is more where the EU should best put its energy . The EU may be most effective at coordinating medium and long-term development .

Good that you did as there was absolutely no one else willing as I understand , and someone had to clearly , but I do have a feeling since you took care of the landing Haiti was getting US troops in preference of other countries ' individual airplanes . We got flying hospital routed away to Dominican , French had flying hospital routed away the day after - and as I said - if flying hospitals are n't allowed to land - who is ? BBC said your soldiers `` made it out to the city , beyond the airport '' only on Saturday , for the first time . I do n't know of the great plan behind , must be it is existing , but resque teams and doctors are crucial in the first days , not soldiers , and they should get first landing opportunity , not soldiers . After the first 5 crucial days you can pour in soldiers as much as , not as you like , but as much as it it needed there to provide security from gangs and institute an order in the help process , but if it were you there you 'd also want hospitals and resquers and not soldiers in the first week . Who can you dig out alive a week later - nobody ; who can last long with wounds in that heat - nobody , first week is a must to give preference to one type of `` salavation '' over all other types , even if all other types are food and water . Gavin by his biography was in everywhere disaster places , has a first hand on this , and one can only agree on the notion of quick mobile small resque units arriving in the first day as a priority .

It is a horrible tradegy but it also heps to remind us that no matter how much money and stregth a country , there some situations that very little can be achieved . Even if the EU had an aircraft carrier available to send there , I still fail to see how it would help pull people out of the collapsed buildings or how it would had be able to distribute water , food and medicine .

Just getting heavy equipment on the ground and past the blocked streets to the collapsed buildings took several days . The Hatians evidently had little or no heavy equipment of their own to remove the concrete rubble . The reaction needed to be fast but not so fast that it was haphazard and ineffective , a dissipation of resources before they were adequate to make a real impact . As I understand it , there were problems just getting ships into the harbor which I think had to be dredged . Thank you France ... for doing nothing again and letting it get that way during two centuries of neglect . Insofar as control over the airport is concerned , the expression is `` ready , willing , and able . '' Where was everyone else ? If the US had done nothing except waited for France and the E-Who ? to act the airport would still be jammed ... likewise giving the Hatians equipment they did n't know how to use as a substitute for what was damaged in the earthquake would have been useless .

In a way parallel to our current support for Harmid Karzai . That level of interference has cost us a great deal of goodwill , especially in South America and certainly in the Middle East -LRB- and Iran -RRB- . It may have been worse off if we had n't , or it may have been better . Unfortunately the choice to act is the burden of a global power , as all the old European powers learned from oh , say 1300-1945 AD . As a global superpower we are expected to interfere when crisis happen . Europe in its current state is NOT expected to solve anyone 's problems . Europe is not expected to broker peace between Israel and Palestine , or to singlehandedly diffuse the potential nuclear war in the Mid East , or to help bring India and Pakistan back to the table . That does n't mean Europe does n't help in those situations , but it does mean that they can effectively ignore the hard , nearly unsolvable challenges without being blamed for letting the situation devolve into chaos -LRB- as we would be -RRB- . Nor are they blamed for failure of those hard , nearly unattainable goals when they are jointly pursuing them with the US -LRB- Afghanistan ... -RRB- . If the EU wants to be a global power -LRB- which would be a good thing -RRB- they need to have the courage to accept the responsibilities that they have n't had since 1945 and be prepared to take action when they know that there might not be a good solution , and they must be prepared to accept the damage that will do to their very good reputation around the world if they were to make the unpopular , or even wrong , choice . As we often have . `` Europe in its current state is NOT expected to solve anyone 's problems . '' That is exactly correct , and that includes any of its own myriad problems . If it ca n't lead , that it is helpful when it follows . If it ca n't follow as in Iraq , then the least we can expect from it is for it to stand out of the way . The problems in Iraq were only made worse by the interference of France and Germany . While we expect nothing from China or Russia , at least we could have gotten abstentions from F & G if they did n't like the invasion . There have been many credible insinuations that Europeans in high places of power were paid a lot of money to stand in America 's way . It did n't work . We have n't made a big issue of it because we try to preserve the illusion they are our friends . F & G never do anything unless there is something profitable in it for them . Katrina is an example of what happens when there is more than one manager and nobody knows which one is in charge . It took 60 heartbreaking hours until noon on Thursday before the White House took control as it should have that Tuesday morning . That is the real reason the Republicans lost control of Congress in 2006 . It had nothing to do with Iraq . President Bush was re-elected in 2004 AFTER the invasion of Iraq which most Americans including all those Democrats who swore they did n't actually also supported . That included Secretary of State Clinton . It may also have been a contributing factor to the Obama 's win in 2008 .

Also , someone brought up the possibility that a large number of Haitians could be allowed to immigrate to the French department of South America in French Guiana . What are the chances that these considerations and others like them might seed the thoughts of world leaders as they try to help Haiti from the cruel situation it finds itself in today ? Clearly there is enough unused area to create a free Haitian state in French Guiana being that most of French Guiana is beautiful lush jungle . All France would have to do is keep the French Foreign Legion there to make sure over deforestation does n't occur . I 'm part Haitian and still have family in Haiti ; God-blessed they are all well . While the current situation is urgent , I would like to propose that the long-term option should include the nation of France making amends for their historical raping and pillaging of the people and nation of Haiti by offering a third of the department of Guiana in South America for a New Haiti to emerge . The African slaves that fought the French Army for liberation and won their War of Liberation in 1804 were later ostracized and required to pay-back huge sums in reparations to France in order to be recognized by the international Community in the 1800s . It took Abraham Lincoln and the American Civil War to finally establish diplomatic relations with Haiti . France gives Haiti a part of what you stole !

Even though they are free to enter and leave the United States freely where many have relatives and there are often jobs available to them in normal times , most Puerto Ricans prefer to live on their tropical island . Not so Cubans who risk the shark infested waters of the Straits of Florida in rickety little boats to escape Castro 's worker 's paradise to get to the USA .

That 's not to say that there have been many Haitians who also bear responsibility for Haiti 's plight . But please consider the following points : Barbados has a population of about 281,968 Haiti has almost 10,000,000 people . Haiti witnessed the greatest exploitative slave-based system in all of the Caribbean region . No people experienced the degradation and debasement as much as the Haitian slaves . Their output was so productive that for a period of time this small piece of land out produced all the other islands in the Caribbean , and provided France with some 40 % of its empire 's coffers . Also , read the following article : When it came to Haiti , France was first a brutal colonizer , and then a usurious bully . Tunku Varadarajan on why it s time for reparations . As Haitians lurch destitute in the rubble , and as governments , churches , and NGOs do the best they can to bring succor to Haiti 's hell , a vivid solution to the country 's needs presents itself , one so obvious and irrefutable so resonantly just that it must be advocated with the greatest of energy : France must repay its colonialist debt to Haiti by paying for much of the island country s reconstruction . Haiti 's chronic impoverishment began at its birth in 1804 , when , having overthrown its French rulers in a bloody , 12-year slave revolt , the newborn nation was subjected to crippling blockades and embargoes . This economic strangulation continued until 1825 , when France offered to lift embargoes and recognize the Haitian Republic if the latter would pay restitution to France for loss of property in Haiti , including slaves of 150 million gold francs . The sum , about five times Haiti 's export revenue for 1825 , was brutal , but Haiti had no choice : Pay up or perish over many more years of economic embargo , not to mention face French threats of invasion and reconquest . To pay , Haiti borrowed money at usurious rates from France , and did not finish paying off its debt until 1947 , by which time its fate as the Western Hemisphere 's poorest country had been well and truly sealed . In this era of multibillion-dollar bailouts of private banking institutions , $ 22 billion should scarcely raise a Gallic eyebrow . But to Haiti , the sum would be a godsend . France must now return every last cent of this money to Haiti . In 2004 , at the time of the 200th anniversary of Haiti 's independence , the Haitian government put together a legal brief in support of a formal demand for `` restitution '' from France . The sum sought was nearly $ 22 billion , a number arrived at by calculations that included a notionally equitable annual interest rate . -LRB- For a full account of the calculation , read Jose de Cordoba 's excellent news story in The Wall Street Journal , published on Jan. 2 , 2004 . -RRB- The demand was made by President Jean-Bertrand Aristide , a firebrand ex-preacher who was forced out of office by a violent uprising that February . His successors , Boniface Alexandre and Gerard Latortue , controversially chose to renounce Haiti 's claim for restitution\\/reparations . -LRB- There was , of course , much pressure exerted on them by France , which had found Aristide 's demand politically disconcerting . -RRB- cents Plus : Mark Leon Goldberg on Haiti s recent history , and why the country deserves our support . This last act of renunciation weakens Haiti 's legal case against France , notwithstanding the fact that the treaty under which France gouged 150 million gold francs from Haiti was clearly unconscionable and executed under duress . But this story is not one of law and legality alone , nor even one of wealth and poverty . -LRB- France 's GDP is $ 2.85 trillion , while Haiti 's is a mere $ 6.95 billion . -RRB- It is , rather , one of historical justice and political morality : No one can dispute that an extortionate and bullying treaty , concluded at a time when France was an imperial hyper-puissance and Haiti a friendless fledgling , is an ugly stain on France 's national conscience . The money involved is not a sum that will give sleepless nights to Christine Lagarde -LRB- France 's finance minister -RRB- or Bernard Kouchner -LRB- its foreign minister -RRB- or President Nicolas Sarkozy . In this era of multibillion-dollar bailouts of private banking institutions , $ 22 billion should scarcely raise a Gallic eyebrow . But to Haiti , the sum would be a godsend . More than that , however , this is money that is Haiti 's own . As Haitians lie prostrate , buried under the rubble of their nation , France must do the moral thing , the just thing , the civilized thing : France must write Haiti a reparations check for $ 22 billion .

He is also a research fellow at Stanford s Hoover Institution and a professor at NYU s Stern Business School . -LRB- Follow him on Twitter here . -RRB- `` It also makes them -LRB- Americans -RCB- , on the whole , poor administrators on foreign soil . They find it almost impossible to believe that poorer peoples , far from the Statue of Liberty , should not want in their heart of hearts to become Americans . Actually what Americans find on foreign soil is that so many people in foreign countries whether rich or poor are so petty , so stupid . They will argue over the most meaningless trifles in life . For example Ireland was at war for 400 years with Britain over the fact that Henry VIII renounced Catholicism because a French politician through an influential friend convinced the pope not to grant him an anullment to his marriage in which he could not produce a male heir . So he quit Catholicism , formed his own church and Anglicans and Protestants fought to the death ever since . It ended in Ireland with that nation 's independence in the 20th century but not in Northern Ireland until about a decade ago . It is sobering to think that when America declared independence from Britain this war had been going on for nearly two hundred years already . It 's just one of countless examples you see around the world . BTW , a lot of people around the world do want to go to America , live in America , work in America , and become Americans . People from all over the world in a tide that has kept growing for over 400 years . Speaking of countless examples , the barbaric crimes France perpetrated against Haiti is only one of countless examples of European pettiness , stupidity and vindictiveness . It was the same mindset that penned the Treaty of Versailles that lead straight the rise of Hitler , to WWII , and to the occupation of France . Have the French ever learned their lesson ? Look at their anger over their plane being delayed landing in Port au Prince for a day or so . Just who the hell do they think they are ? Have other Europeans learned ? Not on your life . From the disaster which is the EU to most of its member states it has hardly altered its view of itself or the world . Racist , xenophobic , arrogant , and provincial they think they are the center of the world and of civilization when in fact they are a fading souvenir stuffed in the pages of an old history book .

They have only made peace with each other because each finally realized they could n't do it alone , especially France .

Their protests fall on deaf ears in Washington DC where President Obama has far more important issues to worry about ... such as who will win Senator Kennedy 's seat in the United State Senate in the special election tomorrow .

The third poster advertisement was for a telecommunications firm . And , you guessed it , there was a cut away diagram of some kind of wiring and circuit board , showing the internal workings of some commercial communications unit . Then after that there was a poster advertising tractors , and that also had the drawing of how it worked inside .

These included tax incentives in the US related to keeping profits from foreign investments and very favorable one way tarrifs that allowed goods produced in those countries to freely enter what was then by far the largest and richest single market in the world , the United States while keeping their own high protective tarrifs to protect their domestic markets from foreign competition . The rapid rebuilding of Western Europe and Japan after the devastating war is proof that this theory was correct . Europe and Japan ultimately owe their prosperity to the contribution made by the injection of American big business . The contrast between places where this investment is permitted and where it is discouraged by one reason or another such as widespread demands for bribes or outright nationalization of industry is telling . China benefitted from allowing it , Eastern Europe , Cuba , and Russia during the cold war did not and they remain poor to this day . India may be changing its mind , we 'll see . American corporations bring much more than money and jobs , they bring technology , managerial skills , and a culture that for many countries for the first time brings the reality of promotion for performance instead of just politics and nepotism , meritocracy and of respect for fellow workers at all levels who contribute to the profit of the corporation . The ridicule of the power of American big business is the ridicule of the one way out of poverty most nations have . And by rejecting it even after it has started to establish itself such as in Russia and Venezuela have demonstrated is a sure road backwards into widespread poverty . Haiti has not made itself attractive to investment by large American corporations and look at the result . If it continues to resist , no amount of government or NGO help will change it .

You ca n't formulate a single , sweeping ` development policy ' for the ` underdeveloped of the world ' because it 's not an equal situation in any of them . The Third World constitutes are wide variety of different historical , social , economical and cultural components that act together in varying degrees .

By the way , you mentioned those protection tariffs for American industry , now pray tell me , what has been the policy of the ` developed world ' vis vis protectionism of internal industrial growth in the developing world ? Economic development is not a teleological proces in which we all start from the same situation and will all end up at the same place . Which is precisely what I feel is wrong with liberal economics to begin with . We are not all rational , self-sufficient , individual atoms that only make decisions based on our economic self-interest . We are n't all where we are because of the ` work ' we did . The idea that society is self correcting and meriocratic enough to make sure the ` best ' are at the ` right place ' is in itself a pipedream . Hans Blokland wrote a couple of interesting articles on it recently .

I do not wish to reject every argument that has been made in favor of governments , or in favor of the nations whose governments are implicitly endorsed by ardent nationalism . I am just commenting in broad terms about how different folks see virtue and cost . Take the usual `` america invented freedom '' argument . America only goes to war for freedom , and freedom creates wealth , so American governments should be credited with every bit of wealth created after its wars . That is a great argument . As long as you ignore the evidence of the poverty American wars have created , it has a fantastic ring to it . It EXPLAINS the world , much like the story of god creating the earth . Then there is the pro EU argument , that the EU `` creates wealth '' by distributing it and enforcing its laws . Also a fantastic argument , as long as you ignore the masses of folks with no jobs who grind out an existence away from the view of the corporate mass media , and as long as you fail to give any credit for economic growth to anyone else . Again , this argument EXPLAINS how the current world came to be . `` The EU created it . '' But just like the belief in a creator , a belief in `` government\\/nation the creator of all goodness '' requires a massive leap of faith . To get involved in this sort of thinking , you need to have faith that governments drive human behavior , and reject the common observation that government employees and party members are parasites who feed from human behavior . Note the way Marcus cites Germany and Japan as economic miracles created by the largess of US big business . He does not mention central and south America , the Middle eastern or african countries , even though US foreign policy has been cultivating regimes in those places for just as long as it has in German and Japan . Furthermore , Marcus rejects the influence of the people of these nations . He rejects the idea that it was the germans who rebuilt germany with hard work and technical know how . He rejects the idea that a very highly ordered and productive Japanese culture was what drove the people of that culture to rebuild their country and living standards . He places all the credit for good things upon American business , and the policy of American governments . We see the same selective attribution of credit for good results with chris commenting on the EU . If Europe is wealthy , it is not because governments have merely refrained from going to war and let the people get on with living their lives , but rather it is because the EU government MADE THIS HAPPEN . Government receives the credit , and the people are the inert and grateful recipients of government actions . I find this thought process fascinating , and very much akin to the process of attributing good fortune and the hard work of others to god . Government is a classic rainmaker , just like the priesthood and the shamans before them : it promises rain , and when it rains the government takes all the credit . If it does n't rain , government actors blame the people , and promise rain again . Eventually , it rains . What fascinates me about this cycle of claiming credit and issuing blame is that most people seem to demand it . It is not a trick , a scheme set down from a conspiracy of exploiters . Instead , we see Marcus and AT2 and chris and Mathiasen all desperate to pin down a large group and make it holier than themselves . People WANT to worship , they create their gods out of nothing . It seems to be the human condition to pick a rain maker and sacrifice a sinner before the gods . Perhaps this is why democracy , real democracy , is such an effective form of government . When the people are sovereign , and when the common people are promoted in the culture as `` those responsible for laws '' , then the people are the rainmakers . Direct democracy is a neat trick indeed , if it can get folks to worship themselves instead of idols and shamans .

The petty strop of the France contingent against the USA should be seen in that light ; a minor structural-coordination blip in a massive international aid package .

All of that said I must comment on another portion of Mr Hewitt 's article : '' . . Certainly the EU , as an institution , is not essential for ` rescue work ' to be effective ... '' and '' . . The question is more where the EU should put its energy . . '' . The 2 sentences just about encapsulate the nonsense that is the European Union that has emerged since Maastricht as a supra-National organization . The EU is expending ` energy ' on issues that were never accepted by the Citizens as in its remit and the EU continues to develop these so-called areas of competence when at every turn it demonstrates incompetence on a grand international scale -LRB- see every Budget etc. - - including the few to have been passed -RRB- . Indeed , as Mr Hewitt suggests , maybe the best remit for the EU is '' . . most effective coordinating medium and longterm development . .

Quite why any individual sovereign State would want an over-arching supra-National entity like that imposed by the Lisbon Treaty on all the ` competence ' areas listed earlier eludes me and many other Citizens ? I can understand the fit of pique of the French ` aid ' workers in Haiti - - to be first in and seen to be the ones doing the business of saving lives must be very gratifying - - surely that is an area of pan-UK-European policy development the EU could also effectively manage at medium and longterm levels ?

As far as the role of the EU . Let a doctor practice medicine and a lawyer practice law . The EU simply is n't structured to be much help in this situation in the immediate need .

It is built upon the four freedeoms : the freedom of movement of goods , services , capital and persons . This is what it is and this is what it does . AND THIS IS HOW IT CREATES WEALTH : First , It has abolished all customs duties , direct and indirect , and created a single market between all its member states . And it has a single customs duty to all third countries . This had the effect of a rocketing trade within the block which has eventually lead to the creation of somewhere in the region of 100 million jobs over 50 years . A company in any member state can sell its products to all 500 million people without any duties . This internal trade is what built its industry and those who capitalized on it , France and Germany and now countries like CEE , have built up the some of the largest industrial sectors in the world . Secondly , it part finances `` investments . '' These investments are very well specified and must meet very strict criteria . It is this part financing that forces national governments to create `` investment cycles '' that will absorb this money whilst forcing nation states to provide the rest of the money for the investment ; i.e. governments must use their own internal tax revenue to set up investments to be able to get the remaining funds ; generally if they dont the government will be booted out by its citizens . The result of this policy is that Europe now has the best infrastructure in the world , much better than the USA . This has created probably about another 10 to 30 million jobs directly and indirectly . Thirdly , every expansion makes the EU internationally more competative on price , which in business is the most important factor . Because manufacturers set up their factories in low wage countries -LRB- such as Poland , Slovakia -RRB- instead of offshoring to China . This has created hundreds of thousands of jobs and kept industry `` within the EU '' rather than outsourcing to the third world . Fourt , you may dislike this but CAP -LRB- the much disputed and subsadised Common Agricultural Policy -RRB- has created millions of jobs in Europe because it blocks the import of dirt cheap food from third world countries . There are many other examples : Longest peace in Europe in history . Citizens can work live and study in any member state . It is EU regulations that have forced all member states to cut bureaucracy by 25 % with strict penalties if they dont . Giant companies that were created to keep Europe self sufficient in even the most technologically advanced sectors such as manufacture of Airplanes and satellites . And all this at a cost of 0.86 % of GDP , in comparison the Westminster parliament consumes 50 % of GDP . In fact , the EU is now so well developed that it is virtually completely self sufficient , has a much larger economy than the USA , and it makes everything . The USA on the other hand is different . What Europeans spend on healthcare , education , assisting the poor , pensions for the old and training for the unemployed , the USA goes out and spends all this on its military and then goes around telling everybody what to do . And this is the problem . WE , TRUE EUROPEANS , DONT WANT TO BE TOLD BY THEM WHAT TO DO OR HOW TO DO IT and certainly we are not going to suck up to them , why should we ? And this is really where all the roads end . We want complete independence of them . P.s just to illustrate : i am from Poland , grew up in the UK , my wife is Chinese and we live in the south of France . So dont try to tell me i dont know anything about the EU . `` All hands on deck ! '' Sounds like the ideal catch-phrase for my new EU with a purpose .

It is a bad beginning , if you wish - a political mistake , to start closing airport for 8 hrs daily `` only military flights '' . You began with that on Thursday - a very hot arrivals day . `` On the request of the Haitian government '' . But that governemnet as all understand will stay a government only if agreeing with the USA . They are on paper now , the `` government '' . And Haiti was heavily dependable on you before the quake , 25 % ? of their yearly budget US money support . France was n't the only one who complained , all media says `` several organizations '' . Must be the only country , but not the only NGO . That France has changed the tune - I do n't think it 's because they realized their mistake and wrong assessment of the situation , as one of the bloggers wrote above , simply - do n't want to quarrel with you and backed off . Also , may be they complained formally because they did n't want to be criticised as your TV criticised Russia , for `` un-sufficient help to Haiti '' . If you did n't visit this blog you might still wonder why Russia is so heartless does not help : o -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- I saw some CNN blogs , people echoed - `` Where is Russia ? Why we are doing it alone ? Where are all these emerging economies ? '' The legs grow from your Fox News , so rest assured , not only France can offend you - you yourself is quite able to offend anybody : o -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- Hillary Clinton I heard with own ears , and I am afraid several more Russians who understand English did as well , was asked when in Haiti , again - `` Where is Russia ? Why we are doing it alone ? '' Hillary must give her credit replied very diplomatically , type `` all help as they can '' and all . but I was n't very convinced : o -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- So may be France did n't want to be asked of later `` Where is France '' ? Because definietely that 'll be your Fox News next question : o -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- The correct answer to the joirnalist , by the way , would be - turn around - operating behind your back , for 2 days already , but Hillary did n't know . We are so `` insufficient '' , may be . I think not worse than others . And did n't burden anyone with worries about us , as min . , brought own vehicles and helicopter , to get the hospital out of airport to the site , and distribute help , autonomous energy sources for far ahead , own fuel , things . The only thing we diverted away were 20 peace-keepers , to guard distribution and hospital , both , but that 's out of 3,5000 UN peace-keepers on the ground . I think it is a wrong idea that US military are the only armed men on the ground there at the moment - USA brought in 3,500 , UN had already 3,500 peace-keepers plus 2,000 int ' l policemen - imported there back in spring 2004 to prevent civil war . So per today it 's 9,000 combined , and 10,000 more US men will arrive shortly , will make 19,000 - a substantial figure . Anyway the long-term Haiti will be American burden , you are there in far higher quantities , 100 times more than any other single country , and determined , by all looks of it , and facing an interesting task how to fix a country , not just an earth-quake , and resquers will cool down next week , nobody live to save left much , all will be leaving gradually . The decision to start clearing away rubble by bull-dozers is not taken yet , the hard decision , hoping for the live still , but in several days surely the heavy clean-up will begin . In this hard task nothing but good luck can be wished to the USA , I have a feeling that is when there is a good chance you will `` stay alone '' . But regarding the first week - this is simply not true . Yes , Tom Lehrer thanks to you , I 'm a quick learner : o -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- Classic `` Polundra !

Please help us '' car & local driver rental `` for the light day '' - 400 to 600 US dollars Mon morn 2,000 locals gathered by the airport gates and tried to storm as supplies are in . An armed jeep was driven by US from inside to the gates with machine-gun and positioned as a hint , but the locals did n't wink . Russian correspondent was on the storming crowd , as was negotiating a motoroller , and got carried in . UN `` blue helmets '' opened the gates from inside and began throwing eyes-weeping gas grenades at the storming gang and succeeded . On saw the white correspondents face the last sec . and luckily for the chap threw the grenade above his head not right into his face . Later on one of the locals dashed at the correspondent and began terrorising : o -RRB- him very aggressively with the speech and fists : I 've lost home family have n't eaten am thirsty why do you foreigners throw grenades at me where is the logic ? '' : o -RRB- The chap says he saved himself only by switching on the video-cam and asking `` Please say it all again - it 's very important for the international attention '' : o -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- The Haitian cooled down and repeated the speech but taking time and no fists and gestures . So they parted peacefully . US resquers refused to take Russian correspondent into their 10 cars but said if he 'll find own transport he can follow them up if he wishes . So he got himself a car and followed . Said had 2 dogs with charming girls-instructors , went to the places according to locals ' calls , who are dragging resquers of all countries to the houses `` where there are live '' , same as Russian resquers -LRB- all seem to follow locals to places -RRB- , that American resquers are very well equipped , they rely on tecniqal things entirely , install hearing devices and put under into the holes videocams to check if there is a movement or a sound . If not - leave the ruins , drawing on the side a circle , divided into 4 squares , two upper - date and time , below - L-O , D-20 . Correspondent says Americans technical reliance approach seems to work better as they fished out in 2 days 15 live people - twice more than Russian without listening device and cameras . Russian teams rely on German Shepherd dogs -LRB- proved to be better than labradors for us in Haiti -RRB- - in the morning , when they can still sniff something , and on `` chuika '' - gut feeling . German shepherd `` Fortune '' saved two women in the house marked all dead . Sat upon the pile and insisted there are live . American resque team called us `` crazy Russians '' : o -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- But overall it is friendly . Only locals do not respond when neither resque team pleads them for a 5 minute silence but continue shouting immensely standing around in agitated circle . On the coats of some un-identified from what country resque team it is written `` Where we pass - there is no second chance , no coming back '' . Cicterns with water appeared on the streets on the 4th day . There is a line of 300-400 people to each . When there passes a truck with bags of food , Haitians jump on the trcuk and throw bags off away on the go . To this react no local policemen , neither `` Blue helmets '' , got used to , and when that 's all it is not dangerous . The rest of commentary was how locals explained Russians `` wudu '' which seems to be official religion ? You and I are a lot alike in many ways . Heck we 're all alike in many ways . You are a Russian and proud of it . I 'm an American and proud of it . You , like myself , know that everything is n't perfect in our respective countries , never has been , never will be . Like a family , we might have a sibling who gets out of line from time to time and might even have some bad things to say about that person , but do n't let an outsider talk trash . The thing with Americans is that we are impatient and task oriented and maybe bull headed . If there 's something that needs to be done then by God we 're going to get it done . Back when your country launched the first Sputnik and put Yuri in space , JFK came out and told the nation `` By God we 're going to beat those Ruskies to the moon '' -LRB- loose translation -RRB- . To repeat MA it 's `` Lead , follow or get out of the way , but do something '' . This attitude is a good thing at times and a bad thing a other times . The Chinese on the other hand are patient very patient . I guess that comes with having a civilization that goes way back . They got the people , they got the time . They figure that eventually things will come to them . Like a constant dripping of water on a rock . Eventually it will eat it away . To be honest , I 'd just as soon we did n't try to be the world 's policeman . Since WWII it seems our mindset has been `` We can pay now , or we can pay a whole lot later '' . I wish the UN or somebody could solve all the world 's problems but it ai n't happening . I would like to say I take pride in the fact that America and\\/or Russia have n't destroyed the world ... ... . That 's a good thing . ps Regarding the Tom Lehrer clip . He did n't mention that you get a couple of chances to get it right . If not then we send in the Marines . Unless of course the decision is made that there 's no chance your going to get it right no matter how many times you try . Actually I 'm a bigger fan of Jim Lehrer . He does n't play the piano though . I think -LRB- for dt and leonaptha -RRB- `` gettin ' laid '' was so nice a suggestion from you , but ... well , you know ... Do n't worry , the US does n't have any troops to send to Russia . Those who are not in Afghanistan , Iraq , South Korea , Somalia , Germany , Okinawa , are already in or on their way to Haiti . There may be a cook or two left still in the US but you would n't want to deprive a two star general of his manservant would you ? Besides what do you need an American Army cook for anyway , you have MacDonalds we sent you : - -RRB- They get the potatoes already peeled and cut , all their cooks have to do is open the bag and drop them into the hot fat . When the timer rings they take the basket out , dump the fries into a pan , salt them and then you eat them . Here 's an interview with two top former US officials on how the military interacts with the relief organizations to keep order and facilitate the rescue and relief . I think you are spot on about the US\\/Russian relationship and accomplishments ... both peoples are peoples and are kind and both are generous : -RRB- I fear you are right on course with ` man the lifeboats ' and the prospects for the 27 Crew of the Sailing Ship European Union . It is a monument to the trust in faith and blind hunger for gold of epic Columbus proportions - - if they sail far enough they will reach far-off mythical , bounteous , fabled Cathay - - and so , the EU27 using full canvas of muddle-headed ideals , unreliable charts and wholly unsupported hearsay ploughs forth to oblivion on San Salvador ... Almost water-less , unyielding island of very limited resources : Thus we get the ` west ' Indies and Columbus sails home in triumph proclaiming the voyage to China was a success ! In fact it sounds so much like a Brussels-EU brochure of fanciful expectations further squadron of ships are even now bringing aboard stores for another look at the ` east ' !

Even the pictures say it all . Face it , it is a dump where most Cubans just scrape by where people are persecuted , imprisoned or murdered for simply expressing opinions . Even if it were as industrialized as China it would be , along with China , a horrible place to live in compared to a free and democratic country . `` I , by the way , also have family and friends in Latin America , so the anecdotal evidence wo n't fly .

'' How is that a valid and logical follow up question based on what I have said so far ?? Besides , I have no problem offering them food or medical aid , especially in emergencies . Beyond that , America is under no obligation to trade with such a country or to subsidize its development beyond that , nor should it . Besides , you Europeans are always harping on them having universal health care and everyone supposedly getting enough to eat so what else do they need in their utopia that requires America to trade with them ? `` I did n't know you knew me that intimately .

'' Is that a joke ? I 'll ask you again , you sure you want to go with that kind of logic ? My neighbor two doors down fled Cuba and came to America with his wife , two small children and ten cents to his name in 1958 . By the time I met him in 1985 he was the President of the Hispanic MacDonald owners of America , had several very successful MacDonalds restaurants , was retired , lead a very affluent life . He also had a home in Florida , always drove a brand new Lincoln Town car , ran all over the world such as to soccer matches in Mexico City and on shopping junkets in Italy , and spent a lot of his time on tennis courts and golf courses . His story is hardly unique . Now what do you suppose would have become of him had he stayed in Castro 's worker 's paradise . In one way Cuba is fortunate . When they finally get rid of their tyrannical Communist regime there are millions of wealthy Cuban ex-pats who have the money , skill , and desire to return to devote at least part of their lives to rebuild Cuba into a modern society and undo the horrific damage the Castro regime and the USSR did there .

During that time I was in high school . There were days we thought we would not live to the end of the day , any of us . Here 's the official trailer for a dramatization movie called `` The Missiles of October . '' It may seem fictional but it is proabably a fairly accurate account of what actually happened . You can look at the other links . I think there are some ways to see some excellent documentaries . One called just `` The Cuban Missile Crisis '' is in multiple parts . It appears to have been prepared by CBS News because the narrator is Mike Wallace who worked for them as a regular . Networks like CBS and NBC routinely produced documentaries of this type in those days , usually one hour long . The full movie for which I gave a link to the trailer in my previous posting is a dramatization of the events by actors . It is not necessarily 100 % accurate insofar as the drama is concerned but tries to be historically accurate in its major points . We call that a `` docu-drama . '' A more accurate documentary account that tries to be entirely factual is presented by a news organization . Here 's a link to part 1 of such an account .

Which is exactly what has happened . Then so you discovered got angry about a rocket base materialised up out of nowhere by your side , from which site you could be attacked , then put 2 and 2 together understood USSR still ca n't attack you from afar , then - what ? So , you were angry , understandable , Cuba is close to you , like we are angry when you position things around us now or intend to . But its should n't mean the end of the world necessarily ?

I am not trying to minimize at all the significance or very real trauma of the suffering of Haitians today . The outpouring of concern , compassion , horror , strikes me as altogether healthy : a sign of true intelligence . We can make the connection between `` that poor suffering person '' and `` myself '' : that is a step forward , out of cynicism , narcissism & indifference . But let us for one moment remember the great European wars of the 20th century . Our parents -- mine , certainly -- lived through every bit the same kind of horror as what now convulses Haiti .

The ones who survived to tell the tale were also the ones who exerted themselves to prevent any repetition of such madness ever again across the Eurasian supercontinent . We can not yet predict earthquakes with enough accuracy to implement preventive policies -- although the evidence is in that a clear warning , a Genuine Prediction , if you will , of this devastating earthquake , was provided in explicit terms by scientists just two years ago . That would have been enough time to take some steps that would have not only saved lives in 2010 , but also reduced the stress on resources in this frenzied rescue effort . But even while we can not yet predict or avert natural disasters , we should lose no further time in formulating better strategies for improving conditions in the most marginalised communities on the planet . We should not be waiting for a repeat of the tragedy in Haiti -- or the worst dramas of the African conflict of recent decades -- before we intervene with effective constructive support & encouragement for struggling governments overwhelmed by masses of destitute , undernourished , underemployed citizens who need more than slogans , hugs and music videos to advance . It should not have taken an earthquake of this magnitude to mobilise the powers of this world to lift up eight or nine million Haitians before their land had been reduced to rubble -- and even well before 97 % of their forest had been annihilated for cheap fuel . Of course , it is praiseworthy and appropriate of the EU to offer help , relief & expertise . But the superpower of the hemisphere -- that would be the USA -- also needs to face up to the fact that a resolute refusal to do the timely simple things that help the region -- simple things like lifting the ridiculously protracted , vindictive & ultimately petty embargo on US trade with Cuba -- have spread misery & reinforced dysfunctionality in this beautiful , fragile zone of the planet . Maybe the terrible , regrettable sacrifice that has been exacted of Haitians over the past week will actually force the issue at last , and lead to a lasting transformation not only of Haiti , but of all its neighbouring states as well , as the wealthy & powerful ones of this world are finally moved to rediscover their shared humanity with the destitute whose destinies they -LRB- unfortunately -RRB- do indeed control . Let us hope this earthquake was big enough to shatter even the hardest hearts of those that have it taken upon themselves to make decisions for all the world . Because we will not find a way out of any of the troubles that blight our lives , until the powerful wealthy ones unclench those fists , and let the needed funding finally trickle forth ... The longer they take to do so , the more money becomes necessary to do the repairs . Just ask Paul Krugman . He seems to know the score .

The library was a rich place , as you can guess : o -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- and all in oak , or anyway may be nut wood , do n't know , all wooden place , with those stairs running up , creaky old stairs , and the second layer , like a ballustrade running around the hall , with more books up abbove . And various creaky stairs to climb up to volumes high above . And all books in leather covers , I was deeply impressed and snifffed around . Funny to think now , nobody guarded it from kids , I think it was not posssible to take books home but on the place - read as much as you like . The other room was my favorite , nothing happened there , it was always dark , but not locked , simply very heavy large doors , to turn the knob and get in . It was lined in heavy carpets , high thick woolen carpets , old and very soft , and , like , 10cm high the brush . I was simply sitting there on the floor , in the darkness , on the carpet . That 's all : o -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- Or looking down at the street in snow and street lamps , through the large window .

Do n't know their puprose , just `` empresses ' frogs '' . do n't know what for . They were my companions , with their strange eyes , in that heavy carpet room . And what New Year parties were arranged in that palace aaah . You would go through do n't know how many seemed to me 30 rooms , and in every room there were some attractions for kids . Some games or Christmas trees or presents or games arranged live or competition , and you walked 50 rooms , one to another , until you dropped dead from happiness .

The generals favored a pre-emptive stike on Cuba and expected immediate escalation to WWIII . At the time the ICBM had not been perfected yet and both sides relied mainly on manned bombers . Both the US and USSR kept the Soviet Union 's weakness a secret from the public for entirely different reasons . The USSR wanted to appear to be America 's equal . The US government wanted to justify huge military expenditures `` to catch up to the Russians . '' During the presidential campaign of 1960 , the Democrats invented the myth of a `` missile gap '' in which the US was supposedly behind the USSR . I read one analysis that claimed that the USSR had only four nuclear weapons capable of being delivered on American targets and that two were expecte to get through . It was assumed New York City where I lived and Washington DC would be destroyed . It was estimated that about 200 American nuclear weapons would reach targets in Eastern Europe , the USSR , and China . Kennedy learned to his horror during the crisis that the US military had only one nuclear war fighting strategy , burn down everything from the Danube River to the Pacific Ocean . We are certain without doubt now that such a war would have brought about the extinction of the human race . Now you can enjoy Boris and Natasha our favorite cartoon nogoodnicks in the 1960s .

For one , de C rdoba correctly noted that the original amount of 150 million gold francs was subsequently reduced to a total of 90 million gold francs -LRB- still a considerable millstone upon generations of Haitians -RRB- about 840,000 ounces of gold , or # 575 million in today s money , excluding interest -LRB- as it was paid off by borrowing -RRB- . Mr de C rdoba also wrote that Haiti paid off this debt in 1883 , rather than in 1947 , according to Mr Varadarajan ; however , I ve seen several different dates in different sources for when the final payment was , so I m not sure which of them is correct .

I find it ironic that you doubt my Latin American experience , but it 's exactly there that I found that out . There 's a reason why Torijos is still revered in Panama , and there 's a reason while you can find a lot of people from the older generations that will claim that life was better under Noriega and Torijos -LRB- people that were not connected to the regime in a formal sense , by the way -RRB- . Ever heard of Brecht 's adagium ` First comes food , then morals ?

'' Try actually understanding what I 'm writing . Your language is not neutral . AT2 : `` No , but I grew up knowing many Cubans who have and I have some in my own family , something most Europeans would have no concept of , so it is n't too hard to be convinced of the realities of communist Cuba . Even the pictures say it all . '' There you go again , anecdotal evidence . Ever thought about the fact that your ` sample ' of Cubans , is not actually representative of ` Cuba ' but that you probably met a whole lot of very anti-Castro Cubans -LRB- what did they think of Batista , ever ask them that ? -RRB- I could respond that I know Cubans as well -LRB- actually , there are pro-Castro Cuban bars here , but shhh , that could n't possibly happen outside of Cuba ! -RRB- but apparently , I 'm supposed to accept your anecdotal evidence while you 'll dismiss mine as lies . AT2 : `` Face it , it is a dump where most Cubans just scrape by where people are persecuted , imprisoned or murdered for simply expressing opinions . Even if it were as industrialized as China it would be , along with China , a horrible place to live in compared to a free and democratic country . '' It 's time that you try to understand the argument I 'm making . I 'm not saying Cuba is perfect . I 'm not saying that the Castro regime is a love filled regime , I 'm not even saying I support it . I 'm saying that Cuba is not as badly off as Haiti . I 'm saying that the idea that Cuba went down the drain from 1958 is ridicilous . Castro 's done a lot of bad things , he 's also done some good things . There are people who prefer to live there .

I 'm saying I 've lived in Latin America . I ca n't prove this over the internet , so if you do n't feel like believing this , I can hardly make you . I do think it 's ironic that you expect me to believe you do have this ` first hand knowledge ' but do n't want to accept that I 've seen it too . You know , I 'll try , here 's some fun extra info , how 's this : In Panamanian dialect , ` fren ' means ` friend ' , ` que xopa ' is the inversion of ` que paso ' which obviously means ` what 's up ' . A gun is ` un ca on ' . They use ` guial ' for ` girl ' -LRB- from Jamaican English which is mainly spoken in Colon and some poorer neighborhoods in the Capital -RRB- , they also used ` man ' instead of ` hombre ' there . ` buco ' means a lot , and it comes from French . It entered the dialect , probably because of the first attempt at the construction of the Canal by the French company that also did the Suez canal . The current president is Martinelli -LRB- who took over from Martin Torijos , illegitimate son of former military dictator Omar Torijos -RRB- , he 's a millionaire and owns the local '99 supermarket store chain . The other big chain there is ` El Rey ' , who are open 24\\/24 . Seco with milk is touted by tourist guides as the local drink , but in reality it 's only drunk by old people while playing domino 's . A corner store is called a ` chino ' because they 're mainly run by chinese immigrants . Gang fights are common in the Capital and Colon , in San Miguelito , the gang for example , is called ` Los Perros the San Miguelito ' . I 'd say the worst neighborhood is Chorillo , who 's towers are called ` multis ' . The bus is cheaper , but are called ` diablos rojos ' , red devils , because they are known for the reckless behavior , which is why locals also refer to them as ` borradores ' , whipers , because they whipe you out . This being in the capital region , as bus colors actually different from province to province . You can see one of these busses in the latest James Bond movie , because the part where they are supposedly in Bolivia was actually filmed in Colon , which I noticed because at one point when it 's dark they pass a bus , which because of the exhorbitant decoration , are quite distinct to the country . The part in Prison Break where they get to Panama , does not actually even resemble Panama , and aside from the between cuts , was probably never even filmed there . Why should I believe anything anybody writes on here anyway ? Besides , do you think that people like Chavez , Morales , Correa , Lulu etc. came out of nowhere ? Do you think it might have had something to do with the IMF 's restructuring of Latin American economies in the 80s ? AT2 : `` Why would it be `` petty ? '' That remark has significance . Try thinking about it . '' There 's actually no real significance to it , but believe what you want to . AT2 : `` No , it is a valid question based on your response . Your emotive language and drama in regards to previous remarks of mine were not . '' No it 's not , it 's a low play on something I was n't refering to . AT2 `` How is that a valid and logical follow up question based on what I have said so far ?? '' It is n't is it ? So why do you insist on making such idiotic statements in reference to what I said ? That phrase was the inversion of what you said to me . AT2 : `` Besides , I have no problem offering them food or medical aid , especially in emergencies . Beyond that , America is under no obligation to trade with such a country or to subsidize its development beyond that , nor should it . Besides , you Europeans are always harping on them having universal health care and everyone supposedly getting enough to eat so what else do they need in their utopia that requires America to trade with them ? '' See , that 's the whole problem , you persist on doing this dialogue in some sort of a geographic\\/nationalist classification , it 'll get us nowhere . If you ca n't understand the interplay of economics in the global market , that statement would n't make sense I suppose . I 'll tell you what , try reading a book by Andr Gunder Frank , it 'll make more sense after that . AT2 : '' Because I disagree with your views on something I am now `` craving for dictatorships ?? '' You sure you want to go with that kind of logic ? '' Are you being daft on purpose there ? My point was that you apparently seem bent on placing me into a corner with ` dictators ' because I do n't agree with you , and then harp on about freedom of speech . You claim freedom of speech is so important , but when I contradict you , you take it to mean I want to silence you , which is ridicilous . AT2 : `` So because I say I am in an obviously much better position to know my country and fellow Americans better than you will ever even begin to that somehow means I am not in favor of other Americans speaking for themselves and that I am now acting like a `` Marxist ?? '' Is that a joke ? I 'll ask you again , you sure you want to go with that kind of logic ? '' Firstly , you do n't know what all your countrymen think , and I know there are quite a few who would disagree with your assesments of situations . You can only speak for yourself , so please keep it to that . This is exactly why this argument always devolves into caricatures debating eachother . Secondly , do you even know what I refer to when I say ` superstructure ' ? Look that up , then you 'll get what I mean , and maybe then you 'll figure out it was meant in jest . You know , in the way that apparently , if I say ` Cuba is slightly more nuanced ' some of you take it to mean ' I love Fidel ! ' Especially the materialist part , good show !

Aid is arriving , but many Haitians are still waiting There were still songs of praise being sung , but also prayers for the dead and dying . Relief has now started trickling through , with non-governmental organizations , the UN and the US military getting aid to some of those who need it . But demand far outstrips supply as the food distribution and water points , as they are being called , quickly become overwhelmed by people clamouring for supplies . Bottlenecks still exist between the large amounts of aid arriving and the people who so desperately need it . At last there are convoys of aid making their way through the city . But you have to search to find the limited foreign assistance on the street . The most common `` water points '' are run by local people with hose pipes who have tapped into the occasional mains supplies . Long and mostly patient queues of people with buckets and bottles wait their turn to fill up . The most common `` food distribution '' consists of families and neighbors sharing their meager resources with others . And while many Haitians continue to fend for themselves the delays have cost lives , with vital medical supplies not getting to the injured . `` We 're running out of supplies to treat serious injuries , '' said Martin Harrison , an engineer from the UK helping medical staff in a hospital above Port-au-Prince . `` The other complication is that we 're on a diesel generator and we only have two days of fuel left , '' he said . Ban Ki-moon visited the destroyed headquarters of the UN mission UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon came to see the full extent of what happened and why there have been delays in getting aid to the people of Haiti . For Mr Ban this visit to a disaster zone was personal . The headquarters of his organization in Port-au-Prince was destroyed - the chief of the mission killed along with nearly 40 other members of staff , with hundreds more still missing . Security is still a major concern for the aid agencies , with reports of looting and jostling at distribution points , and the fear is that if more people do not get food it could spread . At a supermarket where workers have been called in to clear up the mess they cover their noses as they wheel out rotten meat from inside the shop . As you enter there is food spilled across the aisles , shelves having been emptied by the force of the quake . I ask the owner if she is worried about looters and she says no , `` the people round here are n't like that '' . But she does acknowledge that if more food aid does not arrive , supermarkets like hers could be a target . The armed security guards with pump-action shotguns give some added reassurance .

But in the days since the quake struck , more and more information and images of the destruction have reached our shores and the Haitian earthquake has stolen our attentions . For two Wiltshire firefighters though , it will have been at the forefront of their minds since the first news of the quake was broadcast . Dan Cooke from Salisbury and Stuart Hillier from Pewsey may fight fires for a living , but they also volunteer for Gloucestershire-based Rapid UK . The search and rescue charity dispatches highly-trained volunteers to help in the aftermath of disasters around the world . By Wednesday , Dan Cooke was on a plane out to the island that Haiti shares with the Dominican Republic . Dan Cooke is in Haiti to help in the rescue effort His colleague Stuart Hillier followed on Thursday and by Thursday night the pair were reunited in Santa Domingo . By Friday they had made it into Haiti . There was no time to spare and their effort to rescue survivors of the quake got underway immediately . Friday saw the Rapid UK team pull a young police officer alive from the rubble . A similar success story followed on Saturday , when the team spent six hours using hammers and chisels to free a woman trapped beneath a collapsed concrete building . The 39-year-old had been buried under the ruins of her home . Dan Cooke said , `` There was a woman yesterday under three or four floors of concrete squashed in with dead members of her family . `` That was a hammer and chisel job and it took six hours before the doctor assigned to our team took her to hospital . `` It 's a great lift but people think it 's like scoring a point or scoring a goal and it 's not . `` The moment you 've done that you look around and see there is something else to do . `` It does n't change the fact this is a catastrophe . '' Mr Cooke said his team was one of 47 working across the capital in dangerous conditions . He said , `` You hear gunfire , you see gangs of youths carrying machetes but to some extent that is part of the culture here . Rapid UK spent six hours freeing one woman trapped under her home `` We are doing quite well . `` The UN security forces are attaching themselves to us and some teams have brought their own armed security . `` We have been working with other teams and local people and they have been fantastic . `` The conditions yesterday were very hot and dusty . `` There is always a smell of the dead and sometimes it is extremely potent . `` There are some very horrific scenes . '' Mr Cooke said his team rescued two people on Saturday and two the day before . He said , `` It is more than we would usually come across . `` The people are very tough as a nation , and the weather conditions help to keep people alive , but as the days go on the chances of people surviving fall massively . `` There are 1,700 rescue workers here and there is work for everyone which gives some sense of the scale of what has happened .

' Britons have donated # 23m to the Haiti earthquake appeal , the Disasters and Emergency Committee -LRB- DEC -RRB- has said . The UK government has trebled its funding for the humanitarian response from # 6.2 m to # 20m , to provide food , shelter , health and relief work . United Nations worker Frederick Wooldridge , 41 , from Kent , was the first confirmed British casualty . Downing Street said more than 60 Britons were safe and well after Tuesday 's 7.0-magnitude earthquake . But No 10 said there were still concerns over the safety of others . `` We do n't know how many British nationals were in the country , '' a spokesman said . The international community is dealing with an almost unprecedented level of devastation . Disaster Emergency Committee chief executive Brendan Gormley said the public response had been `` absolutely overwhelming '' . A grateful Prime Minister Gordon Brown sought to reassure donors that their `` money would get through '' to those in need . He also pledged the UK would not walk away from `` a country which has suffered so many disasters '' with only `` a week 's charity '' . Outlining the trebling in aid , International Development Secretary Douglas Alexander said : `` The international community is dealing with an almost unprecedented level of devastation '' . Money so far pledged by the Department for International Development -LRB- Dfid -RRB- has been used by the Haitian Red Cross to help 20,000 families . Frederick Wooldridge was a keen skier and mountaineer Funds have also been used to deploy UK search and rescue teams and by the World Food Programme to transport and organise relief . The DEC , an umbrella group of 13 major British-based charities , said charities were facing `` a huge challenge '' but water supplies and medical expertise were `` increasingly reaching '' people . It said Oxfam had installed four water tanks capable of holding 10,000 litres of water each since Sunday , and charity Merlin was sending a surgical team of 12 . A # 25 donation buys a kit of household essentials , # 50 is enough to feed a family for a fortnight and # 100 funds temporary shelter for two families , it said . The DEC appeal for victims of the earthquake in Haiti Relief efforts have been hampered by supply bottlenecks , leading to security concerns over looting and violence amid increasing desperation . There are concerns about the safety of aid workers - with reports of gunfire - and some charities have taken security guards . The DEC said it was monitoring the security situation , but based on the information it had , `` isolated incidents '' were not interfering with the arrival and distribution of aid . It is unclear how many Britons remain unaccounted for in Haiti after the earthquake . The leading US general in Haiti , Ken Keen , said it was a `` reasonable assumption '' that up to 200,000 people may have died . Steven Fisher , the UK 's ambassador to Haiti and the Dominican Republic , said the Foreign Office 's rapid deployment team was `` doing quite well '' in its efforts to account for expatriate Britons but visiting sites was taking `` an awful lot of effort '' . The Disasters Emergency Committee is co-ordinating an appeal to help the people of Haiti There are 13 charities involved including the British Red Cross , Islamic Relief and World Vision Donate via the DEC website or by telephoning 0370 60 60 900 However , one British survivor - bank worker Alistair Cameron , from Inverness - disputed reports access was such a problem . `` Where there was a blockage due to fallen trees or masonry from collapsed buildings , I always found , without too much difficulty , an alternative route , '' he said . The Foreign Office said it was beginning to repatriate UK nationals . Mr Wooldridge was a senior political affairs and planning officer at the UN , for which he had worked in Geneva and Liberia before moving to Haiti in 2007 . A family statement said he had `` loved '' his work and `` had many friends in the UN and beyond '' . Another UN worker , Ann Barnes , 59 , of Leigh-on-Sea , Essex , is feared to have been killed in the collapse of the headquarters in the capital .

Food and water are finally reaching some parts of the capital Port-au-Prince , but relief efforts are being slowed by bottlenecks . Large numbers of earthquake survivors are having to fend for themselves . Many are trying to leave the city , and there are security concerns amid reports of looting and violence . Haitian President Rene Preval said 3,500 US troops would help UN and Haitian forces restore order in Port-au-Prince . `` We have 2,000 police in Port-au-Prince who are severely affected -LRB- by the quake -RRB- . And 3,000 bandits escaped from prison , '' he said . `` This gives you an idea of how bad the situation is . '' Several looters were reported to have been lynched or shot dead . Estimates of the numbers killed by the earthquake range from 50,000 to at least 200,000 . Speaking in Port-au-Prince , Mr Ban called the situation in Haiti `` one of the worst humanitarian crises in decades '' . 37 UN staff confirmed dead , more than 300 missing Includes Special Representative Hedi Annabi , deputy Luiz Carlos da Costa and acting police commissioner Doug Coates UN HQ in the Christopher Hotel and other buildings collapsed in the quake Believed to be the biggest single loss of life in the UN 's history He visited the ruins of the UN mission , where several senior UN staff were killed . One Danish UN worker was pulled alive from the rubble of the building on Sunday afternoon - one of at least five people who were rescued in Port-au-Prince during the day . Mr Ban also went to an improvised settlement for survivors opposite the destroyed presidential palace , where people were shouting : `` Where is the food ? Where is the help ? '' Later Mr Ban said he understood people 's frustration , but that he did not want to see violence among desperate survivors . `` I appeal to the Haitian people to be more patient , '' Mr Ban said . He said providing daily food to two million people , as the UN has pledged , would be a `` huge challenge '' . `` We need to make sure our help is getting to people who need it as fast as possible , '' he added . The UN has launched an appeal for $ 562m -LRB- # 346m -RRB- intended to help three million people for six months , most of whom are thought to need emergency relief . The UN World Food Programme said it expected to reach about 60,000 people on Sunday , up from 40,000 a day before . A US aid official said he thought US authorities had handed out 130,000 meals , but many more were needed . The British government is to triple its aid to Haiti to # 20m -LRB- $ 37m -RRB- . The move is to be formally announced at an emergency meeting of EU development ministers in Brussels on Monday . Correspondents say there is a sense of movement at last with the relief effort , although the amount of supplies getting through is still small . The BBC 's David Loyn says the streets of the capital are thronged with homeless people , sleeping in the open and walking for hours for what food and water is available . Most of the food and water being given out is being distributed informally by local people , correspondents say . Several agencies or countries complained about not being able to get aid through at the airport , which is heavily congested and has been taken over by the US military . Medecins Sans Frontieres urged commanders to speed up the landing of aeroplanes carrying medical supplies , after one carrying an inflatable field hospital was turned away on Saturday night . The head of the US operation at the airport , Col Buck Elton , said there had been 600 take-offs and landings since the US took control on Wednesday , and 50 flights had been diverted . `` What we set up here would be similar to running a major airport ... without any communications , electricity or computers , '' he said . US troops also said they had set up their first foothold outside the airport to deliver aid carried in by helicopters . The city 's port is badly damaged , and many roads still blocked by corpses and debris . The Haitian and Dominican Republic governments are planning an alternative 130km -LRB- 80 mile -RRB- humanitarian road corridor to deliver relief supplies from the southern Dominican town of Barahona , the UN said . We need fuel to bring in supplies and carry the wounded The UN has warned about fuel shortages , which it says could affect humanitarian operations . It has also emerged that the US naval base at Guantanamo , Cuba - synonymous with the war on terror - is being used as a staging post for personnel and relief supplies heading to Haiti . The BBC 's Steve Kingstone , at the base , says it has capacity to house up to 10,000 people in tents . While there are no firm plans for that , US commanders say such an evacuation is feasible should it become necessary . The US and Dutch authorities have said they are speeding up the process of flying orphaned children away from Haiti to adoptive parents abroad . Six Haitian children adopted by Dutch families arrived in the Netherlands on Sunday and the justice ministry said it was expediting the adoption process and paperwork for about 100 others . Estimates of how many people died following the 7.0 magnitude earthquake on Tuesday have varied . The Pan American Health Organization put the death toll at 50,000-100 ,000 , while Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive said 100,000 `` would seem a minimum '' . A UN official has said aid workers are dealing with a disaster `` like no other '' in UN memory because the country had been `` decapitated '' .

Supplies of food and water have been slow getting on to the streets of Port-au-Prince Troops , doctors and aid workers are flowing into Haiti , while nations pledge millions of dollars in aid . But how do you handle a crisis of this magnitude ? Richard Gordon and Mike Evans of the Bournemouth University Disaster Management Centre , outline the planning and potential pitfalls of such an operation . A fundamental principle of disaster management and international assistance is that it is the stricken country 's responsibility to take the lead in inviting in international assistance -LRB- via the UN resident representative -RRB- , and then co-ordinating that assistance to best effect . In most cases , however , the host government to a greater or lesser extent , will have been incapacitated by the natural disaster , so the UN sends in Disaster and Assessment Coordination teams -LRB- UNDACS -RRB- to provide initial coordination of international assistance . UNDAC teams tend to deploy for no more than three weeks and then like to hand over once again to the host government . But this may not be long enough for the Haitian government to resume control of its own affairs . The request for international assistance for Haiti will have been speeded up by the presence of UN troops and other agencies already on the ground . The US has offered its assistance , in addition to the UN 's in-country co-ordination teams . This will provide a significant logistical and command and control element . However , there are likely to be incidents of disagreement between US military and international governments and aid agencies on the ground , as priorities and objectives are set and implemented on Haiti 's behalf . International assistance is co-ordinated in `` cluster groups '' to ensure that essential aspects of the disaster response are properly co-ordinated and monitored . In the past , there have been issues of who co-ordinates whom . The US is generally suspicious of UN personnel , and NGOs do n't generally like to be co-ordinated by military - or by other NGOs for that matter . The US lead will need to be sensitive in how it deals with these groups and , in particular , how it allows the dissemination of information between agencies . Too often , the military tendency to designate vital information as `` restricted '' or higher makes it impossible for troops and officers on the ground to share this information with local responders and aid agencies . Mobile communication is hampered by lack of signal and electricity A fundamental principle of disaster management is that communications -LRB- telephones , mobiles -RRB- will fail and , therefore , a back-up needs to be planned . This is very seldom carried out in practice , and in the case of Haiti will have been impossible . Aid agencies will come with their own satellite phones and internet uplinks ; the military will have their own comms . For Haiti 's people , there will be very little to use to communicate with one another -LRB- lack of electricity , land lines , mobiles systems -RRB- and their vital need to talk to each other to confirm who is alive or dead will be frustrated . Organisations such as Telephones without Frontiers will make a vital contribution in providing a limited access for users . According to Ian Hanson , Bournemouth University Centre for Forensics , a vital component of disaster management is identification of the dead and injured . There is a danger that with the use of mass graves to remove rotting corpses , many people will never be identified . On top of this , a significant number of people will never be found . Middle and long term psychological stress disorders will be prevalent . Governments will be demanding that their ambassadors in Haiti get out to find out where their own citizens are , says Mr Hanson . Disaster Victim Identification -LRB- DVI -RRB- requires the careful collection of post-mortem data from a body and then matching it to existing ante-mortem data . In the case of international citizens in Haiti such ante-mortem data will include dental records , X-rays , fingerprints , and possibly facial recognition . DVI activity after the Indonesian tsunami in 2005 revealed that some 80 % of positive IDs were from finger prints or odontology or a combination of the two . Kenyon International and other established organizations are deploying to Haiti to assist in this . A body lies among the debris For Haitians , there is likely to be an almost total lack of ante-mortem data because standard dental or fingerprint records may not exist . Visual records and identification will be their best chance , however this will become impossible if bodies are left too long before being recovered . The cost of excavating collapsed buildings for the Haitians with limited equipment is also prohibitive in the recovery of bodies , as is the cost of putting a body through an identification process . Many Haitians may never be identified but memorialised in some way . This is part of the reflection of the cost , political will , resources and technical skills available for poorer nations versus rich nations . As with other areas of disaster preparedness and response , there is a gap between who gets identified , if they can be , and where they are from . Security is always a big issue in managing disasters . The maintenance of public order is a national responsibility . If , or when , the problems exceed the police capacity to handle them - which is probably already the case in Haiti - then the military are normally called in . The Haitian police and military will both have suffered significant casualties - as has the already weak government . There is a very high risk that , unless aid gets through much faster to the needy , there will probably be a major breakdown in law and order . This could raise very serious issues with foreign national forces - the US in particular - who are armed and who may be forced to use arms to protect themselves . UN soldiers patrol the ruined streets of Port-au-Prince Security of routes is essential , as it is roads that become the essential lifelines for logistical support and the movement of essential relief to where it is needed . Roads are being blocked at present and it appears that the police are unable to deploy in sufficient strength to maintain route security . As a result , the development of a co-ordinated security plan that uses local police as well as US military and UN troops will need careful co-ordination and agreed rules of engagement for outbreaks of public disorder . Supply trucks from the Dominican Republic arrive in Haiti Haiti has a land border with the Dominican Republic . Disaster management planning includes the prior agreement of cross-border co-operation protocols to ensure that assistance is not stockpiled at the border unable to cross over owing to import\\/export regulations which have not been previously sorted . Two key lessons will apply - among others , but these are the two most important : Survivors want to stay close to where they lived - to be moved into camps is not a favored option for survivors but it is often the selected option for governments because control is much easier . A very difficult decision will be reached in the next few days - when to stop trying to find live bodies and to bring in heavy machinery to clear rubble . Trapped victims dehydrate and die after about four-to-seven days , sooner if seriously injured . Possibly also worth noting that studies into previous earthquakes indicate that epidemics are not the great threat that media often make them out to be . Good quality water is a key .

They say the total could eventually run into the thousands as more badly wounded survivors are rescued and those from isolated areas arrive at the emergency medical centres which have been set up in the capital , Port-au-Prince . `` There are so many people to treat and so many people needing amputations , '' said Dr Jacques Lorblanches , a surgeon who is part of a team sent by Medecins du Monde -LRB- MDM -RRB- . `` We expect to perform around 400 amputations over the coming days . '' The story is the same elsewhere in the city , with other medical organizations reporting that the majority of operations are ending with amputations . `` There is gangrene everywhere and you amputate on the go , '' said Hans Van Dillen of Medecins Sans Frontieres -LRB- MSF -RRB- . `` You conduct radical surgery . There 's nothing more you can do . '' In the immediate aftermath of an earthquake , it may be necessary for doctors to carry out a field amputation to extricate a victim from the rubble of a collapsed building or to remove a hopelessly mangled limb . There is an avalanche of patients and almost all of them come in with traumatic injuries The procedure is considered one of last resort , however , and the vast majority of amputations are carried out later in medical facilities after all attempts to spare a severely injured limb have failed , and to prevent loss of blood and infection . But in areas where destruction is severe , infrastructure is poor , or there is a widespread lack of available medical care - such as Haiti - even minor injuries to limbs can become life-threatening within days and require amputations . `` You always have a big wave of amputations from around the third day , for about a week afterwards . Then the demand for such surgery becomes less intense , '' Susan Wright , the director of Medecins du Monde UK , told the BBC . `` There is a hope that it will shift in the coming week . '' Ms Wright says the longer a person is trapped under rubble or does not receive treatment for their injuries , the more likely it is that they will suffer from crush syndrome - a serious condition resulting from damage to large areas of muscle - or shock , blood loss , dehydration , hypothermia and a weakened immune system . Doctors frequently amputate infected limbs to prevent the onset of sepsis All of these will reduce the body 's ability to cope with injuries to limbs and to maintain the blood supply . If starved of blood and oxygen , cells and tissues will die , become more vulnerable to infection and may require amputation . As time passes , the risk of developing a serious infection in a limb directly from even minor injuries such as cuts and grazes also becomes more acute . Without antibiotics , a person can develop gangrene or blood poisoning , which if untreated can eventually lead to sepsis , the body 's inflammatory response to an infection , and death . Doctors frequently amputate seriously infected limbs in a last-ditch effort to prevent the onset of sepsis - an all too frequent occurrence in Haiti at present . `` We have had to perform dozens of amputations , including many double amputations . The problem is people have n't gotten medical care soon enough , so wounds are very infected . Some of them are coming in with bones just sticking out from the rest of the leg , '' said Dr Diana Lardy of the International Medical Corps . Under normal circumstances , a patient undergoing an amputation would be anaesthetised , and the bone would be sawn through with an oscillating saw . The procedure would be carried out in a sterile theater to prevent infection . I did my first amputation with three forceps , five scissors and a scalpel , without water , and just a flashlight to illuminate the injury But surgeons in Haiti say they have had to carry out dozens of amputations in unsterile conditions , without electricity or even the correct equipment . Dr Lorblanches , who worked in Iran after a massive earthquake struck the city of Bam in late 2003 , said Haiti was the worst disaster he had ever seen . `` I have never seen anything like this - infected wounds full of larvae , '' he said . `` I did my first amputation with three forceps , five scissors and a scalpel , without water , and just a flashlight to illuminate the injury . '' Cuban medic Dr Olga Maria Delgado said she and her colleagues had performed more than 40 amputations on a tiled counter inside a tin-roofed building within the grounds of the Renaissance Hospital in Port-au-Prince . Sterility was less of an issue than normal , because most of the wounds were already infected , she added . `` There is an avalanche of patients and almost all of them come in with traumatic injuries , '' Dr Delgado said . Ms Wright said MDM 's clinics were also being inundated as more people were rescued and others found out where treatment was available , with more than a hundred people waiting for surgery . `` Every time we look out of the window , there 's a queue around the block , '' she said . But even once they have lost a limb , the lack of sterile equipment and antibiotics mean the new amputees face a struggle to stay alive .

But is that true ? Trying to disguise the smell of decay On the streets of Haiti , the living face a desperate struggle , for food , water , medicine and shelter . But the dead present a problem of their own . Estimates of the number killed in last Tuesday 's earthquake vary from 50,000 to at least 200,000 . Dead bodies are being left by roadsides , trapped under rubble , or cleared into pits . The underlying fear is that the bodies could spread disease and infection . But is that assumption correct ? `` There is this myth that bodies have to be disposed of incredibly quickly , which often leads to bodies being shoved into pits without any form of identification , '' Sir Nicholas Young , British Red Cross chief executive and a trustee of the main fundraising group , the Disasters Emergency Committee , told the BBC . '' -LRB- This makes it -RRB- impossible for the relatives to grieve . Impossible to know how many people died and impossible for people to identify their relatives . This is a terrible shame . No , bodies of people who died healthy do not spread disease People handling bodies run a slight risk , which can be reduced with basic hygiene `` The risk is absolutely minimal , unless there is disease in the population . This is a mistake and a waste of resources . '' The charity has its own guidelines on cadaver management for disaster zones and signs up to 2009 advice from the Pan American branch of the World Health Organisations - Management of Dead Bodies After Disasters : A Field Manual for First Responders . The guide was compiled after numerous disasters - the 2004 Asian Tsunami , Haiti 's 2004 floods , Hurricanes Katrina and Stan and the Northern Pakistan and Indian earthquakes - highlighted an absence of advice on what to do and why . It came after research by Oliver Morgan , at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , that found dead bodies in natural disasters do not pose a public health threat . The guide sets out how ordinary people helping on the ground can manage the recovery , identification , storage and disposal of the dead . And how to help families come to terms with it . If necessary , temporary burial is recommended , but the caustic chemicals used to try to `` disinfect '' bodies are not - they have no effect and make identification harder . Bodies pile up in the streets Indeed , the guide says it is the `` surviving population '' that is `` much more likely '' to be a source of infection than the dead . But care does need to be taken in handling dead bodies , says Dr Egbert Sondorp , senior lecturer in public health and humanitarian aid at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine . `` At the time of their death , people are likely to be healthy . You need to take care in handling them , precautions , as you do n't know . But they are not in themselves a risk . '' Those clearing dead bodies have to take basic safeguards like wearing gloves and hand-washing . These help protect against a range of diseases which can linger in the dead for two days - tuberculosis , Hepatitis B and C , diarrhoeal diseases . And HIV , which can last for six . There are also risks in drinking water contaminated with faeces from the living and the dead . A regular part of the BBC News Magazine , Who , What , Why ? aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines So why are people buried so quickly , if the official guidance suggests they should not be ? One reason is the smell , says Dr Sondorp . `` A body which is decaying smells . In most communities you try to get that away , as psychologically it 's awful to have them around . You want to stop dogs -LRB- and vermin -RRB- eating them , as that too is psychologically awful . '' Also , there has been no-one on the ground in Haiti to say otherwise . Governmental and non-governmental organization has been absent . Tradition also plays a part - religions including Islam and Judaism like to see their dead buried within 24 hours . The deep-seated fear of disease emanating from dead bodies could also stem from epidemics of the past , where people died in their droves from cholera . And mass burial plots are dug outside graveyards But earthquakes , floods and fires involve deaths from drowning , injury and burns , not disease . Despite the human instinct to get rid of the bodies quickly , a more considered approach can have long-term benefits for the mental health of the bereaved , says Ute Hofmeister , forensic adviser at the International Committee of the Red Cross . `` In all disasters , that 's the human instinct , because the bodies start to smell really bad , look bad and it 's not very dignified having them hanging around in the street . `` But experience shows for people , even in natural disasters , it 's important to know what 's happened to their dead . It helps them very much to know where they 're buried . '' There are also practical implications . Correct identification of the dead has legal significance for inheritance and insurance that can affect families for many years .

UN head Ban Ki-moon said he would recommend a 3,500 boost to police and troop numbers to the Security Council . People have been continuing to flee the capital , with many seeking US visas . The BBC 's Mark Doyle in Port-au-Prince , the capital , says perhaps 5,000 people have lined up outside the US embassy , desperate to join relatives among the large Haitian-American community in the US . But UN humanitarian chief John Holmes played down worries over security , saying that despite incidents of violence , the overall situation was calm . Matt Frei , BBC News , Port-au-Prince Looting is now the only industry here and this is the new rush hour of Port-au-Prince . Anything will do as a weapon : a hacksaw , a stick , and of course all the machetes and guns that you can not see . Patience is running out and all the ingredients for unrest now exit : a whole city of destitute hoping for help , and at the same time you have a substantial criminal element and a history of violence . None of this bodes well for Haiti . If the anarchy spreads , the US troops may soon find themselves patrolling the streets in what will look like a full-scale military operation . And the leading US general in Haiti , Lt Gen Ken Keen , said there was currently less violence in Port-au-Prince - already a troubled city - than there had been before the earthquake . Earlier , Gen Keen said up to 200,000 people might have died in the disaster , which he said was of `` epic proportions '' . More than 2,200 US Marines arrived off the coast of Haiti on Monday aboard the amphibious ship USS Bataan , US media reported . They are equipped with heavy-lifting and earth-moving equipment , a dozen helicopters and medical support facilities . Delivering aid to the center of the capital is getting much more difficult , as anger fuelled by hunger reaches boiling point , and military escorts are needed for lorries carrying supplies , the BBC 's David Loyn in Port-au-Prince says .

I called this hospital ... and we said tell us very specifically everything you need and that 's what we brought down .

He said : `` I think on the whole the community is trying to do its best , but they are getting very frustrated . `` A couple of days ago we went through the main market street - people were getting aggressive with each other and pillaging .

I think the criminal gangs , totalling some 3,000 , are going to exploit the current humanitarian crisis to the maximum degree , '' Stuart Page , the head of a security company operating in Port-au-Prince , told the BBC . The BBC 's Matt Frei , in Port-au-Prince , says looting is now the main industry in the city and is being run by rival gangs . Especially prized is toothpaste , which people smear under their noses to fend off the stench of decaying corpses , the Associated Press news agency says . Port-au-Prince 's port is badly damaged , and many roads are still blocked by corpses and debris , hampering the delivery of fuel and other supplies . More than 70 people have been pulled from the wreckage in the last few days UN humanitarian chief John Holmes Several agencies complained at the weekend about not being able to get aid through the heavily congested airport , which is being run by the US military . But Mr Holmes said that initial issues were being resolved , with the introduction through the WFP of a system to prioritise humanitarian flights . As hopes of finding survivors fade , Mr Holmes told reporters that there were now 43 search and rescue teams on the ground , with 1,700 people involved . `` More than 70 people have been pulled from the wreckage in the last few days , '' he said . At least 70,000 people who died in the earthquake have already been buried . Meanwhile , Haitian President Rene Preval has asked donors also to focus on Haiti 's long-term needs . `` We can not just cure the wounds of the earthquake . We must develop the economy , agriculture , education , health and reinforce democratic institutions , '' he said . Aid workers are starting to expand their efforts to earthquake-affected areas outside the capital , including Leogane , Gressier , Petit-Goave and the coastal town of Jacmel .

'' The UN has launched an appeal for $ 562m -LRB- # 346m -RRB- intended to help three million people for six months , most of whom are thought to need emergency relief . European Union nations have pledged more than 420m euros -LRB- $ 604m ; # 320m -RRB- from the EU budget to assist Haiti . At least 200m euros will be dedicated to funding medium - to long-term rebuilding efforts . The British government has said it will treble its aid to Haiti to # 20m -LRB- $ 32m -RRB- .

"}, {"uid": "174", "dct": "2010-01-19", "dates": [null, null], "text": "Why does God allow natural disasters ? At the heart of Haiti 's humanitarian crisis is an age old question for many religious people - how can God allow such terrible things to happen ? Philosopher David Bain examines the arguments . Evil has always been a thorn in the side of those - of whatever faith - who believe in an all-knowing , all-powerful , all-good God . As the philosopher David Hume -LRB- echoing Epicurus -RRB- put it in 1776 : `` Is God willing to prevent evil , but not able ? Then he is impotent . Is he able , but not willing ? Then he is malevolent . Is he both able and willing ? Whence then is evil ? '' Faced with this question , Archbishop of York John Sentamu said he had `` nothing to say to make sense of this horror '' , while another clergyman , Canon Giles Fraser , preferred to respond `` not with clever argument but with prayer '' . I have nothing to say that makes sense of this horror - all I know is that the message of the death and resurrection of Jesus is that he is with us Archbishop of York , John Sentamu Perhaps their stance is understandable . The Old Testament is also not clear to the layman on such matters . When Job complains about the injuries God has allowed him to suffer , and claims `` they are tricked that trusted '' , God says nothing to rebut the charges . Less reticent is the American evangelist Pat Robertson . He has suggested Haiti has been cursed ever since the population swore a pact with the Devil to gain their freedom from the French at the beginning of the 19th Century . Robertson 's claim will strike many as ludicrous , if not offensive . And even were it true , it would n't obviously meet the challenge . Why would a loving deity allow such a pact to seem necessary ? Why would n't he have freed the Haitians from slavery himself , or prevented them from being enslaved in the first place ? And why , in particular , would he punish today 's Haitians for something their forbears putatively did more than two centuries before ? So what should believers say ? To make progress , we might distinguish two kinds of evil : the awful things people do , such as murder , and the awful things that just happen , such as earthquakes Would those hailed as brave still exist in a Magical World ? St Augustine , author CS Lewis and others have argued God allows our bad actions since preventing them would undermine our free will , the value of which outweighs its ill effects . But there 's a counter-argument . Thoroughly good people are n't robots , so why could n't God have created only people like them , people who quite freely live good lives ? However that debate turns out , it 's quite unclear how free will is supposed to explain the other kind of evil - the death and suffering of the victims of natural disasters . Perhaps it would if all the victims - even the newborn - were so bad that they deserved their agonising deaths , but it 's impossible to believe that is the case . Or perhaps free will would be relevant if human negligence always played a role . There will be some who say the scale of the tragedy in natural disasters is partly attributable to humans . The world has the choice to help its poorer parts build earthquake-resistant structures and tsunami warning systems . A still smoking Krakatoa in 1883 , which caused a devastating tsunami But the technology has not always existed . Was prehistoric man , with his sticks and stones , somehow negligent in failing to build early warning systems for the tsunamis that were as deadly back then as they are today ? The second century saint , Irenaeus , and the 20th Century philosopher , John Hick , appeal instead to what is sometimes called soul-making . God created a universe in which disasters occur , they think , because goodness only develops in response to people 's suffering . To appreciate this idea , try to imagine a world containing people , but literally no suffering . Call it the Magical World . In that world , there are no earthquakes or tsunamis , or none that cause suffering . If people are hit by falling masonry , it somehow bounces off harmlessly . If I steal your money , God replaces it . If I try to hurt you , I fail . So why did n't God create the Magical World instead of ours ? Because , the soul-making view says , its denizens would n't be - could n't be - truly good people . It 's not that they would all be bad . It 's that they could n't be properly good . For goodness develops only where it 's needed , the idea goes , and it 's not needed in the Magical World . In that world , after all , there is no danger that requires people to be brave , so there would be no bravery . That world contains no one who needs comfort or kindness or sympathy , so none would be given . It 's a world without moral goodness , which is why God created ours instead . But there is wiggle room . Even in a world where nothing bad happens , could n't there be brave people - albeit without the opportunity to show it ? So moral goodness could exist even if it were never actually needed . And , anyway , suppose we agree moral goodness could indeed develop only in a world of suffering . Does n't our world contain a surplus of suffering ? People do truly awful things to each other . Is n't the suffering they create enough for soul-making ? Did God really need to throw in earthquakes and tsunamis as well ? Suffering 's distribution , not just its amount , can also cause problems . A central point of philosopher Immanuel Kant 's was that we must n't exploit people - we must n't use them as mere means to our ends . But it can seem that on the soul-making view God does precisely this . He inflicts horrible deaths on innocent earthquake victims so that the rest of us can be morally benefitted . It 's OK , some will insist , because God works in mysterious ways . But might n't someone defend a belief in fairies by telling us they do too ? Others say their talk of God is supposed to acknowledge not the existence of some all-powerful and all-good agent , who created and intervenes in the universe , but rather something more difficult to articulate - a thread of meaning or value running through the world , or perhaps something ineffable . But , as for those who believe in an all-good , all-powerful agent-God , we 've seen that they face a question that remains pressing after all these centuries , and which is now horribly underscored by the horrors in Haiti . If a deity exists , why did n't he prevent this ? David Bain is a lecturer in the philosophy department of the University of Glasgow . Below is a selection of your comments . As an Anglican , I always had presumed that God is too big , if you like , too omnipotent to even vaguely notice humanity , after all we are dust : `` from dust you are made and to dust you shall return '' . Though the thought of that kind of horror being suffered by many innocents - and an apparent loving God is contradicting . However at least I find comfort , and probably most Christians , in the world to come where everything would be good , If you like God repaying his debts for letting us suffer . The reason why good does not reduce suffering and evil in the world is simply because he does not exist ! Or if he does he does not care about humans at least on a individual basis , I am not sure he cares about them on a species basis . Why does he not look after all the animal species that are facing extinction ? Evolution explains must of human behavior and geology and physics explains most natural disasters . If God intervened , there would be evidence . He would have to thwart the laws of physics or\\/warn people . God made man as his greatest creation . In order for humans to be all they can be we must live in a world like this one . Moral courage ca n't just be a potentiality , it must be an actuality in all it 's complexity for it to mean anything . Also , in order for the world to be able to create and sustain the complexity of life that it has , the crust of the earth must move , must regenerate itself . Thus , earthquakes , tsunamis . All religious people can do in the face of a catastrophe is to do what we can to alleviate the suffering and possibly create a world where these sorts of things have much less impact . Is n't the real tragedy of Haiti the poverty that has blighted the island , that lead to substandard buildings and poor infrastructure ? This is as much a man-made disaster as divine . This is a transient life , the real life will come later . We as humans have got a warped sense about what this life means to us , we ignore the reality of the next world . So if your time is up and you die hopefully you were on the path of doing good . There is a story of Khizer & Moses , when the former kills a child and Moses is aghast . Khizer tells him that the child would have grown up and killed his parents for greed . So if Khizer knows that how can we question God when children pass away . As the article also points out , it 's a test for the rest of us to see how we respond to the suffering of others . Maybe we can learn to look after the old folks in the neighborhood when we are moved to help people as far away as Haiti ? Debating the intentions of a mythological character which allegedly has an interest in allowing ` bad ' things to happen on planet earth ? Are we living in the 21st century or the 12th century ? Natural disasters , disease , accidents and co-incidences are all things that occur naturally and not as the result of the will of any fantastical all powerful Monster . Maybe a comet will hit the earth one day and maybe all that will be left will be a copy of Dr. Dolittle . Just because somebody wrote it down does not make it true . Perhaps you should include non god-based religions to get out of this dilemma . Try Buddhism for example . Isabelle Clinton , Forest Row , United Kingdom God has put us in a ` crucible ' and he is very interested in how we cope by us invoking the law of love . No one is immune from tragedy , not least his own son Jesus . So , its more about loving our neighbors rather than puzzling why . We live in a dangerous world let no one doubt it . Some disasters are natural but many others are of our own making but throughout we must live the law of love . The Japanese -LRB- 90 % Buddhist -RRB- have a saying that pain is our best friend . Because for the most part we learn and grow the most from painful experiences . If we are not born new , but simply coming around for another shot at growth -LRB- reincarnation -RRB- , then the notion of a child being pure is put aside . If pain is our friend , then the notion of pain as cruel is put aside . If death is not the end , then the notion of unfair or untimely death being the worst thing imaginable is put aside . John Roberts , Tulsa , Oklahoma USA A thoughtful article on an enduring problem . God is perfectly good and perfectly powerful . Haiti was fully within his control . Why did it happen ? Because men 's deeds are evil . Not particularly - see Jesus on the Tower of Siloam - `` repent , or you too will perish '' . Because there are murderers and rapists in the world ? Not just them - there is no one good , not even one , all have turned away and fallen short of the glory of God . Jon Hall , Jacksonville , Florida , USA This is a very interesting article . It is a classic philosophy question that can never be convincingly answered . This article lists some interesting points . In one part , there is the argument that why ca n't god just create good people with free will ? If god just created good people with free will , it logically follows that all their actions will always be good since they are good people . Does n't this defeat the whole purpose of free will where you can choose your actions as opposed to being restricted only to good actions ? It almost feels like an oxymoron to say that we should only have good people with free will . Secondly , in vedic philosophy there is a belief in the continuum of the soul . Many scientific studies and real world experiences show that this could be true . To believe or not is a question for another day . However , if we allow for this continuum then we can easily explain natural disasters -LRB- where even innocent babies die -RRB- by attributing the punishment to their past lives ' actions , also known as Sanchita Karma in Sanskrit . The other answer to the question posed could just be that god 's ways are so intricate and complex that to comprehend the greater good out of seemingly painful punishments are just beyond human comprehension . This is one of those questions that we could argue about all day and yet arrive at no answer . KRL , Old Bridge , New Jersey Having lost a sister to a brain tumor aged 49 , and a close friend to cancer at the age of 30 , and being a C of E priest , you might imagine this kind of matter has been a part of my own , and many others ' formation . Archbishop Sentamu is right on one level ; for the sake of those caught up in this tragedy we need to pray and act now , and think later . But for many of us there has already been much thought . John Polkinghorne and others successfully argue that free will is not just about humanity , it is also about the freedom of the universe to be what it is . It has to ` work ' to make sense . In order for life to exist on this planet there simply has to be tectonic activity . Without the ` recycling ' processes involved there would be insufficient carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and earth would become a lifeless snowball . It has to be a dynamic system and given the freedom to be what it is . Likewise , without mutation there could be no progressive evolution . Most mutations are dead-ends , some are useful and retained if they provide breeding advantage , and some are deadly . But you can not have one without another , at least not if you want life . Could God have done it differently ? But then if his hand was that obvious , would we have the freedom to choose whether to seek him out ? But back to Archbishop Sentamu 's sentiments ; the importance of what needs to be done now far outweighs the philosophy of why it happened .

Some 14,000 ready-to-eat meals and 15,000 litres of water were dropped north-east of the capital , Port-au-Prince , the US said . It had earlier said airdrops were too risky but congestion at the airport has hampered aid distribution . The US is now considering airdrops across Haiti . More than 2,000 US Marines are set to join 1,000 US troops on the ground . Equipped with heavy-lifting and earth-moving equipment , a dozen helicopters and medical support facilities , they were waiting off shore after arriving by ship on Monday .

Aid workers are starting to expand their efforts to earthquake-affected areas outside the capital , including Leogane , Gressier , Petit-Goave and the coastal town of Jacmel . The US Air Force C-17 dropped the relief supplies on Monday into a secured area five miles -LRB- 8km -RRB- north-east of Port-au-Prince , US Army spokeswoman Maj Tanya Bradsher was quoted as saying by the Associated Press . Haitians flock under a US helicopter delivering aid supplies in Port-au-Prince She said the aircraft had flown out of Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina . Last week , US Defense Secretary Robert Gates said airdrops had been ruled out because they might do more harm than good . Mr Gates warned that they could trigger riots if there was no proper structure on the ground to distribute supplies . Adam Mynott , BBC News , Haiti The director of the main port in Haiti says the bulk of the aid should be arriving by sea but the earthquake devastated the harbor . It is an extraordinary sight - large sections of the main wharf have toppled into the sea . The whole length of the wharf is littered with 40ft steel containers leaning at angles . The access road is rent with 6in gaps and the main crane has toppled forward , leaning at a drunken angle , half submerged in the water . The director says it may take months , but they will get the port open again . However , it has become another symbol of an aid operation that has failed to deliver supplies quickly or to where they are needed . The BBC 's Nick Davies in Port-au-Prince says that with the delays in getting aid out from the airport , the US military are now securing the areas before the pallets of food and water are parachuted in . Meanwhile , thousands of extra UN police and peacekeepers are due to be deployed as a way of increasing security to stop the looting from spreading , our correspondent says . The Security Council is expected to vote later on a recommendation by Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to boost UN troop numbers in Haiti by 2,000 for six months , and UN police numbers by 1,500 . British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Tuesday that Haiti remained a major test for the international community . `` It is a test of our compassion . It is a test of our resolve . And it is also a test of our ability to co-ordinate our actions together . '' France 's co-operation minister , Alain Joyandet , had suggested on Monday that the US was `` occupying '' Haiti and urged the UN to `` clarify '' the US role . However , a statement from President Nicolas Sarkozy on Tuesday said France was `` very satisfied '' with the co-operation and praised the US for its `` exceptional mobilisation '' . As well as problems at the airport , there were also major problems at Port-au-Prince 's main seaport , which was badly damaged by last week 's earthquake . The port 's director told the BBC it could be months before it is fully operational , although one large shallow-draught US barge has been unloaded . On Tuesday , UN spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs said 90 people had been pulled out alive since the earthquake and rescue efforts were now concentrated outside of the capital . EU - $ 604m -LRB- 420m euros ; # 371m -RRB- US - $ 100m pledged in immediate aid , with promise of more later She insisted there was still hope for survivors . `` The climate is mild , there are significant air pockets . The problem is dehydration but for the moment there is still a chance , '' she said . At least 70,000 people who died in the earthquake have already been buried . On Tuesday , the Paris Club of creditor governments , including the US , UK , France and Germany , called on other nations to follow its lead in canceling debts to Haiti . Venezuela and Taiwan are the biggest other creditors .

After providing emergency aid to Haiti the EU should consider a `` humanitarian rapid reaction force '' , he said . He was speaking after talks in London with UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown .

The situation has not stopped the charity distributing emergency survival kits including food , water , blankets and tents as well as medical supplies to local hospitals and providing emergency health services to the injured . The charity 's director told the BBC : `` We are getting very distressing reports from our staff on the ground - this really is a heartbreaking situation . '' The agency 's staff in Haiti are increasingly concerned about the safety of children as they find more and more children separated from their parents . `` When this disaster happened , many children were separated from their parents because it was the end of the working day . So we now have a situation where there are children wandering the city streets , scared and alone , and very much in need . `` We 've found that many have actually walked to the border with the Dominican Republic and World Vision is now working with Unicef to help these children , '' said Kate . `` The key concerns for children are of course health and basic needs ; there is a great danger of epidemics developing now and children will of course be very vulnerable . But we also need to create safe places for them , because there is a real risk of child trafficking and this is something we are working with Unicef .

Here he keeps a diary of his journey along the road to Port-au-Prince . 19 JANUARY , 2200 GMT , PORT-AU-PRINCE We have finally arrived at the airport in Port-au-Prince , after 10 hours on the road . Among the biggest obstacles to the flow of aid from the Dominican Republic are the fears over security ; legitimate concerns given the desperation that is growing along the route . For the moment only two major convoys are leaving the border each day , always under military escort and never after dark . The plan is that over the next week the UN , with the help of the US military , will secure a humanitarian corridor from the border in preparation for stage two of the aid operation . And it will be needed . The markets en route to Port-au-Prince did have food , fruit and water , but supplies are precariously low and basic commodities are getting ever more expensive . A volunteer from the Red Cross , whom we met on our arrival at the airport , says its operation is growing by the day but the logistical problems should not be underestimated - it could get worse here , he says , before it begins to get better . 19 JANUARY , 1815 GMT , ENTERING HAITI Finally we 're in Haiti . Lined up along the road into Haiti are the diggers and the heavy-lifting equipment that were so badly needed in Port-au-Prince in the first 48 hours after the quake . At this stage , it is more likely they will be employed in clearing vital supply routes than in search and rescue . Travelling in the same direction is a bus full of worried relatives ; many of them have still not had any contact from loved ones . Motorbikes on Haiti 's roads are heavily laden and fuel is scarce in the capital `` We do n't know what we are going to find there , '' said Fernando , who flew into Santo Domingo on Tuesday from Miami . `` We are worried sick . I have been calling my mother for days . I came as soon as I found the money to travel . I just pray she is still alive . '' There are very few refugees coming from Port-au-Prince . Aid workers returning say there is no fuel in the capital and very few have the means to travel . Every motorbike that crosses into the Dominican Republic is loaded with jerry cans and suitcases . The border guards tell us this has been the quietest day so far . After the initial flow of aid , the bigger aid agencies are waiting until the logistics are in place to send more supplies overland . This is hugely frustrating for the workers of smaller agencies who say they are more mobile yet under-utilised . `` The corporate donors have to trust us , '' said one . `` We have the means and the intelligence on the ground to do more . '' 19 JANUARY , 1300 GMT , THREE HOURS FROM SANTO DOMINGO Three hours into our journey , the road to the border is practically deserted . The long aid convoys we had expected to meet are nowhere to be seen . 19 JANUARY , 1130 GMT , BANI At a service station in Bani , there are vehicles loaded with supplies and relief workers refuelling for the long journey ahead . Roberto Ronza is leading an Italian team of doctors from the region of Lombardy . The Italians are supporting two medical non-governmental organizations and 70 volunteers who are fast running out of medical supplies . Mr Ronza says they are sending scouts to assess what is needed along with 1.8 tonnes of desperately needed drugs and medical equipment . The delivery came into Santo Domingo on holiday charter flights . `` We ran out of patience today . The airport is full , we ca n't wait any longer , we 're heading into Haiti by road , '' he says . Is he worried about security ? `` We 're told it 's safe , we 're told it has been secured by the UN . People are getting desperate . '' 18 JANUARY , 2200 GMT , SANTO DOMINGO AIRPORT Even the most stoic Haitians are getting angry and impatient at the slow delivery of essential food and medicine , but some 500km -LRB- 300 miles -RRB- away in the neighbouring Dominican Republic , things are finally beginning to take shape . The apron at Santo Domingo airport is filled with aircraft from around the world . A search-and-rescue plane from South Africa made six refuelling stops just to get here . The UN reception center is crammed with teams of impatient volunteers , all of them waiting for relief flights into Haiti . Some , including a Swiss mountain rescue team , have been waiting since the weekend . In the cargo bay , the food , water and medicine is starting to arrive . They know they are working against the clock . Tonight they are loading 48 pallets of ready meals to send to the border . The road to Port-au-Prince is dangerous and there are growing fears over security . In the coming days , the UN is hoping that the military can secure a relief corridor to Port-au-Prince that will help speed up the process . Chris Weeks , a logistics officer for DHL , has requisitioned the only available warehouse at the airport in preparation for the biggest deliveries . The warehouse has no electricity and no key to open the main doors . They will sort it out , but it is a reminder that while the neighbouring Dominican Republic is a different world to Haiti , wealthy by comparison , it has limited infrastructure to help with this enormous relief effort that is gathering pace .

Two Oxfam members of staff were killed when the quake struck and I lost my own mother - but we are still here working There are an estimated three million people in Haiti in need of aid , according to the UN , but it has been slow to arrive due to supply bottlenecks , looting and violence amid increasing desperation . Now , however , the US has begun airdrops of relief goods and further aid is starting to flow into the airports . Oxfam said responding to the Haiti earthquake has been `` one of the toughest challenges ever '' .

But we are still here working . `` I told my staff that we have no choice , no other option but to work and to work harder since we have the privilege of still being here and we can help people to overcome their desperation . '' Speaking at a press conference at Downing Street , Mr Brown said : `` This is now a test of the international community . `` It is a test of our compassion . It is a test of our resolve . And it is also a test of our ability to co-ordinate our actions together . `` It must not be beyond our ability , working together , to make sure we can rescue as many people as possible , bring services back to the people of Haiti and begin the reconstruction of a country that for too long has been immersed in poverty and now in tragedy . It is a human tragedy of enormous proportions `` We will do everything we can to ensure that the compassion that has been shown by British people and people all over the world is matched by a coordinated international effort to help the people of Haiti . '' Later David Miliband said the UK was working with international partners to ensure aid was being delivered effectively to survivors . During Commons question time , he said : `` No-one in this House can fail to be moved by the plight of the Haitian people today . `` It is a human tragedy of enormous proportions . '' Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood asked why a frigate , HMS Iron Duke , in the Caribbean had not been deployed to help and military stabilisation and security teams had not yet been told whether they were needed .

Trucks delivering aid are being given military escorts . American defense officials say some 10,000 American military personnel could be in Haiti within a few days but the question is : will it work or will things get worse ? `` When you think about people who lost everything , except what they 're carrying on their backs , who have n't not only eaten , probably have n't slept in four days ... and when the sun goes down , it 's totally dark and they spend all night lying , wandering around tripping over bodies living and dead - I think they 've behaved quite well .

The international airport in Port-au-Prince already looks like it has been turned into an American military base , with GIs armed with automatic weapons at the entrance to arrivals , and servicemen and women unloading water and supplies . However , outside the airport they can barely be seen apart from the occasional Humvee caught in traffic near the runway gates .

We know the next days will bring many more and we are aware that this will create a new crisis . None of the aid agencies are distributing medical supplies to the north of Haiti and this is now urgent . We need antibiotics , anti-inflammatories , analgesics , IV fluids , antibiotics , casts , crutches ... plus volunteer doctors . We urge all agencies to be aware of this growing situation . We do n't want to see another crisis develop over refugees in the north . We can cope , provided we get the aid that everyone thinks they have given directed here , now . There have to be aid supplies right across Haiti . There were never any reserves in the hospitals before the earthquake . And there is nothing now . Sarah Gillam : `` People are selling fruit , clothes and shoes on the street '' People are still texting from under the rubble but there is little organised help to reach them . The US army believes there are 200,000 dead in the city and you can smell the stench as you pass the city cemeteries . I spoke to many families - all had lost someone and were living out in the open on the streets . All needed food , shelter , clothes , and chlorine to purify stream water . All had only the clothes they stood up in and spoke of having had lucky escapes . One of my colleagues , Mario Diaz , visited two large refugee camps in Mariani finding babies , children and pregnant women in improvised conditions , many with nothing to protect them from the blazing sun . Many were injured and there were still a lot of dead bodies rotting in the open air . The water nearby is contaminated with dead animals and there were no toilets . Food is a real problem with very few people able to afford the rising prices and many having no money at all . Several of the banks are now rubble . People are selling fruit , clothes and shoes on the street . Today in Mariani we are distributing 17 cases of reinforced protein peanut butter giving a meal to at least 2,550 people together with vital medicines . Our staff are caught up in this too . Jean Claude Fignole , our Haitian country director , is sleeping in a tent with his wife and small children as his house was damaged by the quake . Our finance manager Jude Jean Baptiste spent seven hours getting his wife out of the rubble and has thrown open his house for ActionAid to use as an office . The program manager has lost her brother in law . Looking to the future , when the hurricane season hits in May , if people are still living like this , the outcome will be catastrophic . This morning our team left the airport and headed to the soccer stadium but were stopped by a road block of tree branches manned by Haitians desperate for food . Our interpreter explained we had only medical supplies and the branches were pulled back and we were allowed to proceed . David Darg -LRB- left -RRB- with Eric Lotz from Operation Blessing Port-au-Prince 's maze of narrow streets made for difficult driving before the quake - now they are strewn with the wreckage of crushed cars and collapsed buildings . When we did stop crowds gathered around us . Some were banging on the window and gesturing they were hungry - a few tried to grab at the doctors ' clothing through the window . As we set up our clinic at the stadium , people began to bring injured relatives and friends and lay them on the ground in front of us . Our Israeli paramedics kicked into emergency mode and began to treat trauma cases immediately . Children with gaping head wounds lay screaming and confused . We were shocked that so few had received any kind of treatment . So many wounds had started to turn septic and the doctors had to create a section for people who needed emergency operations and amputations . Several men came running into the stadium carrying a teenage girl they had just pulled from the rubble . At first , we all thought she was dead but one of the doctors detected a pulse and we saw her take a few shallow gasps of air . She reeked of death having been buried next to other bodies that were killed instantly in the quake . We rushed her to the hospital where she underwent surgery and now she is in a stable condition . Seeing this miraculous recovery before my eyes was one of the most profound moments I have ever experienced . Just this one life saved has made all the lost sleep , the sweat , the struggle to get here and any other adversity seem more than worthwhile .

The earthquake that has wrought such devastation in Haiti is one such . The human suffering is unimaginable . What needs to be done , and done quickly , apparently almost impossible . And if you have a belief in an all powerful , all loving God , such disasters immediately raise the question of why He allows such things to happen . How is it possible to believe in a God of Love in the face of such devastating suffering ? This is a huge question . I spoke to the Revd . Chris Oxley of St. Anne 's , St. Paul 's and St. Augustine 's in Leicester . He said that this was not an armchair debating point , that it represented a real challenge to how we understand God . Creation involving stuff carries with it fragility and the potential for chaos `` Part of the challenge is to say that we are trying to avoid the idea of an all-powerful God who is a kind of Father Christmas who sits there waiting for our requests to come in and then acting or not . '' Chris 's main point was that God was there in the suffering - a real presence . `` When you talk to people in the front line -LRB- aid workers and so on -RRB- they often say that they are aware of the presence of God in the midst of all this brokenness and in this mess and chaos . `` Rather than being a remote being , He 's there with us ? God is in the pain and the brokenness . '' I asked Chris why creation is apparently imperfect , allowing disasters , like the earthquake to happen . Chris said , `` I 'm not a scientist but as I understand it , if there is to be a physical world with carbon and organic life forms , that world carries with it fire , earthquake , wind and viruses . `` It 's the only world that can exist . Creation involving stuff carries with it fragility and the potential for chaos . '' Interestingly , Chris said that in the face of such events only a silence , a prayerful silence , is the authentic response . Bishop Tim has asked churches in the diocese to use the prayer below for Haiti . we hold before you the nation and people of Haiti , and pray for healing in the midst of tragedy and devastation . Give comfort to the homeless , the bereaved and the suffering , wisdom to those who seek to help , and light to all who live in the shadow of death .

Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the move would allow children eligible for adoption in the US `` to receive the care they need '' . Other nations said they were speeding up the process to allow Haitian children to join adoptive families . Dutch adoption agencies sent a plane to pick up some 100 Haitian children who are being adopted by Dutch families . A number of Haitian children had adoptions pending before last Tuesday 's devastating earthquake . But there are fears that in many cases vital paperwork will have been lost because orphanages were among the many buildings wrecked or damaged by the quake . Children 's advocacy groups have warned against starting new adoption processes in the midst of an emergency . `` We are committed to doing everything we can to help reunite families in Haiti during this very difficult time , '' Ms Napolitano said in a statement . `` While we remain focused on family reunification in Haiti , authorising the use of humanitarian parole for orphans who are eligible for adoption in the United States will alow them to receive the care they need here . '' Ms Napolitano did not say how many Haitian children might be involved . US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earlier told CNN she was `` personally directing that we do everything we can to try to find and identify those children who are already adoptable ... and to try to expedite all the paperwork ... to get them to their new home '' . Canadian authorities have also indicated that priority consideration in granting immigration visas would be given to pending adoption cases . It is believed between 1,200 and 1,500 adoption cases are pending for French families , but the French government has said its priority is emergency aid rather than organising the transfer of the children . `` Adoptive families whose procedure in Haiti has been completed and whose child has a Haitian passport can rest assured that they will be brought to France as soon as possible , '' the French foreign ministry said . Spain 's foreign ministry said that it was `` taking all possible steps so that Haitian minors who have been adopted by Spanish families can travel to Spain given the special conditions affecting Haiti , '' according to the AFP news agency . The ministry said it was currently holding meeting with families which had completed adoptions . However , some adoptive parents are pressing for more urgent action given the humanitarian situation in Haiti . Bringing children into the US either by airlift or new adoption during a time of national emergency can open the door for fraud , abuse and trafficking Joint Council on International Children 's Services They are also concerned that many records , which will often have taken months to finalize , may have been lost amid the earthquake damage . The Roman Catholic archdiocese in Miami , which has a sizeable Haitian community , has proposed the airlift of hundreds of Haitian children to South Florida , in an echo of the exodus from Cuba in the early 1960 of some 14,000 Cuban youngsters . However , the Joint Council on International Children 's Services , a US advocacy group , says the immediate focus should be on the safety of children in Haiti and getting emergency help to them . `` While both airlifts and new adoptions are based on valid concerns and come from an obviously loving heart , neither option is considered viable by any credible child welfare organization , '' the group said . `` Bringing children into the US either by airlift or new adoption during a time of national emergency can open the door for fraud , abuse and trafficking . '' Haiti has some 380,000 orphans , the UN 's childrens ' agency Unicef says , but that number is expected to have increased in the wake of the earthquake .

RFA Largs Bay will spend several weeks ferrying United Nations supplies . The government has already pledged # 20m to the relief operation , while public donations to a Disasters Emergency Committee fund have reached # 31.5 m. Meanwhile , UK rescuers in Haiti have been redeployed to Petit Goave , west of the capital Port au Prince , which was hit by Wednesday 's severe aftershock . The firefighters will join German and Polish teams in searching for survivors of the magnitude 6.1 tremor , which struck eight days after the initial magnitude seven quake devastated the country . Haitian officials say up to 200,000 people have been killed , 250,000 injured and 1.5 million left homeless . Announcing the deployment of Largs Bay , International Development Secretary Douglas Alexander said : `` This ship will provide a lifeline of essential supplies to sustain the recovery effort over the coming weeks to keep Haiti running .

'' The ship is being sent at the request of the UN , and will be able to ferry supplies for the UN and non-governmental organizations -LRB- NGOs -RRB- involved in the aid effort . Mr Alexander said : `` Hundreds of thousands of people , many of them desperately poor to begin with , have been left with nothing . `` It will take many months for them to rebuild their lives and the international community stands ready to help .

'' Aid has been slow to reach survivors since the first tremor on 12 January , leaving hundreds of thousands of people still without food or water .

Aid workers involved in the operation have been sharing their accounts with the BBC News website . Esitima , aged 12 , is recovering in hospital It has been a frantic day at the Baptist Haiti Mission Hospital where I am part of a multi-skilled team who arrived last Friday . The hospital is one of the few which survived the earthquake . News continues to spread that the hospital is open and that foreign doctors and surgeons are attending to patients . The hospital remains extremely stretched and is having to make difficult decisions about both the living and the dead in terms of priorities . We have had to dig a mass grave for patients who died and who have no family to collect the body - presumably the rest of the family perished in the earthquake . The smell of death is in the air , something I have not ever really had to deal with before . In terms of the living , we are having to make patients wait with what would normally be high priority injuries because there are others who arrive without warning in a critical condition . People say they are still pulling bodies out of the rubble , even after six days . A lorry arrived laden with fresh medical supplies just as the final cast on a broken leg was being completed The hospital has come close to running out of medical supplies , diesel for the generator and water . However it can only be described as miraculous how these needs are met at the last moment . A lorry arrived laden with fresh medical supplies just as the final cast on a broken leg was being completed . Somebody sourced some diesel as we ran the generator to keep the hospital functioning on its last gallons . As the hospital was reporting that it was out of water , we got the emergency filtration unit running ! Despite all of this there are smiles of hope . A man grabbed me as I walked through the ward with my camera and insisted that I took a photo of his son who , after being operated on by the HCJB Global medical team , is going to live . Whilst still in the same ward a Haitian hospital chaplain led the patients in prayers and singing of hymns . It was quite overwhelming to experience the sense of peace that descended on this ward in the midst of such tremendous suffering . Estima Yonel is another person with a big smile on his face . A 12 year old shepherd boy , Estima was walking back down the mountain with his herd of goats when the earthquake struck . Boulders tumbled down the mountainside and his leg and arm were crushed . The surgeons worked late into the night to save him . His brother and sister sit by his bedside with equally big white grins on their faces . I have just returned from Haiti , where I was delivering medical supplies , food and support for Relief International , and other institutions . I am heading back there tomorrow with more supplies . I 'm an information and communications technical consultant based in the Dominican Republic . Last Wednesday , after the earthquake , I decided to go to Haiti . I do n't work for an aid agency but I wanted to help . My friends advised me against it , but I went ahead anyway . Once word got out I was contacted by a someone who was trying to get a large trauma kit to Relief International doctors . The kit includes basics such as bandages and dressings , something that was needed urgently in Haiti . Once I set the ball rolling , things started to move quickly . We managed to get the Infante Sano organization to pay for the kit , a group of students got a truck with driver for us , a friend bought supplies , tents and sleeping bags , and additional medical supplies , and a teacher offered his 4x4 Land Rover . We were soon ready to go and help . When we got to Port-au-Prince we handed out our supplies to the Relief International doctors working in a field hospital . They just used the bandages and dressing right in front of me . They had no spare supplies at all . I watched as one doctor dressed a huge , five-day-old wound on a man 's head . I fetched more supplies from our truck and they were all used there and then . Even the most basic medical supplies are desperately needed . I knew that the film star Vin Diesel had frequently visited the Dominican Republic and Haiti . I decided to try and contact him to see if he could help . To my surprise I got through and he wants to help . I am organising a meeting with him , meanwhile I 'm planning to go back to Haiti on Wednesday when I hope to take four doctors to Port-au-Prince . Aid workers set up medical clinics and install clean water units For the third day in a row we have worked to treat victims in the Port-au-Prince soccer stadium . What started as an impromptu clinic has grown to become a field hospital where injured are kept overnight in tents . Today a group of French doctors joined the team allowing us to open 14 separate treatment stations . A truck with a PA system has been touring the downtown area encouraging the injured to come to the stadium for treatment and we have made announcements on the radio . One of the Israeli doctors we are working with sighed in frustration today and told me he had never seen anything like this , none of us have . Patients that would normally be rushed to the emergency room were being turned away because there were others with more serious conditions . I saw a child with a broken back , she was paralysed and I could see her spine bulging outwards in one spot . She was motionless except for her screaming . Another little girl had lost her right ear and a considerable section of her scalp . While the doctors worked in the stadium I was in the national hospital . We were responding to an urgent call the hospital made for clean water . This is the largest hospital in Haiti and everywhere you look there are patients resting after treatment . A good proportion of the hospital was destroyed and now the patients are lying on old desks , blood-stained mattresses or even on the ground . We were installing a water purification unit which can output 10,000 gallons of clean water per day . Tomorrow we will be back at the hospital to finish the installation and get water pumping and our doctors will be back in action in the stadium . The biggest challenge we are facing at the moment is the shortage of fuel . We are having to ration the diesel we have and we are hoping this does n't restrict movement in the midst of great momentum on our relief effort . The great news is that I just found out that Operation Blessing has a fuel supply on board a US Navy ship and that should be here in a few days along with tons of relief goods for distribution and 10 more of the water purification units like the one we installed today . It 's raining quite hard now and the mosquitoes will be out soon , the rain will only worsen the already difficult living conditions for the scores of Haitians in tents across the quake zone . Sarah Gillam : `` More food supplies will be picked up tonight for distribution tomorrow '' Yesterday ActionAid started the first of its distribution of emergency goods , delivering special emergency high protein meals to 2,750 children and enough medical supplies for about 250 wounded people . Working with a local partner organization , the team took the supplies to four refugee camps , an impromptu field hospital and an ActionAid supported school in the Mariani district of Port-au-Prince . The largest camp has 7,253 residents - all accounted for by volunteers working with us . They 're living under makeshift tents made out of bedsheets and sticks but many have no covering at all . In all the camps , voluntary committees have been set up by residents themselves to deal with food and water . The risk of rape is very real for women in the camps - but thankfully at one camp I visited today volunteers have developed a system in which the most vulnerable women are guarded by volunteers at night . Every afternoon a Haitian police officer visits the camp and residents turn in whoever has been accused of rape . This has significantly lowered the risk and shows how the people of Haiti are taking their destiny into their own hands . More food supplies will be picked up tonight for distribution tomorrow , a secure warehouse has been found , orders have been sent out for supplies , and we 've located a new office as ActionAid 's is now unsafe . Staff are working round the clock on funding applications across the world . Internet connection has been very poor and phone contact with the outside world intermittent . ISABELLE JEANSON , MEDICINS SANS FRONTIERES Yesterday I visited Trinite Hospital . There was a small baby , about one-and-a-half months old , lying on her side in her bed because her right arm had been amputated and was covered in bandages . Isabelle Jeanson : inside a therapeutic feeding center for malourished children The auxiliary nurse told me her story - sad and miraculous . She was in the hospital when the earthquake partially destroyed it . Somehow this tiny little girl survived after falling through concrete floors and walls and was rescued from the rubble , though we have no idea where her mother is . Chances are she does n't have a family anymore . Some people are now selling food in makeshift markets , and there is more traffic in the streets . There 's also the regular sound of helicopters hovering . More and more aid organizations are showing up and trucks and some cranes are steadily working through buildings in the city , though who knows how long it will take to dig through all the rubble to find those missing . A man with a gunshot wound was carried in on a stretcher . Two doctors jumped into action , first checking to see if he was conscious , then seeing if he could feel his arms and legs . Even though the gunshot had punctured his neck they determined he was `` operable '' . The patients we are treating will end up leaving our hospital as different people . Many must undergo amputations because their limbs are so badly crushed there 's no way of saving them . A colleague , who is on his fourth mission , told me he was amazed because he had no idea MSF had the capability to implement the human resources , the logistics , the setup that is required for this kind of emergency . Most amazingly though , is that everyone here , including our Haitian staff , are so singly focused these days on the one common intention : to save as many people as we can .

One thousand of Michael Pritchard 's Lifesaver water bottles , which make dirty water suitable for drinking , have been sent to Haiti . `` The bottle holds nearly a litre of water , '' said Michael . `` You unscrew the base and fill with water from your surroundings - puddles , streams , ditches , any muddy water .

However , all filters need to be cleaned and replaced periodically . `` In these communities access to a source of water is often the problem .

Mr Guerrier said they still needed diesel to run their data center , and he has been using the web to ask aid organizations for help . But as many were e-mailing , Twittering and checking Facebook , thousands of volunteers joined forces to build a tool to help those in need - a combination of web and mobile phone technologies , traditional media and the voices of people on the ground . Project Ushahidi maps reports sent by people in Haiti . They can use mobile phones and the web to inform about structural risks , lack of water and food , and missing persons . `` We translate it , map it , and structure the data , '' said Ushahidi co-founder Erik Hersman . `` Then we pass it on to organizations on the ground which can then work with the specific needs reported by the people . '' People in Haiti can send their message to text number 4636 or through the website The message is translated and formatted by a volunteer The volunteer asks for more information and verifies it Aid agencies can take this message directly and act on it Ushahidi made an agreement with local mobile phone operator Digicel and created a short code to which people could text their message . That message is received by `` situation rooms '' set up in Boston and Washington . A third one will be set up in Geneva to provide 24-hour cover . About 10,000 Haitians have volunteered to translate messages from Creole to English and ask for more information if needed . Other volunteers and experts try to verify the information and put it into the map . This is crowdsourcing on a big scale . Patrick Meier , director of crisis mapping at Ushahidi , told the BBC : `` We had a Skype chat between a volunteer here in Boston and someone on the tarmac of Port-au-Prince airport asking for GPS co-ordinates for the most obscure addresses . '' But how do you get Haitians who do n't have access to the web to know about the map ? By the most traditional media : radio . Ushahidi worked with InSTEDD , an organization that helps humanitarian collaboration through technology innovation . They visited local radio stations and tried to get the word around that Haitians could use the text short code 4636 to send their reports . This is not the first crisis in which Ushahidi has operated . The first map was created in the violent aftermath of the Kenyan elections in 2007 . `` We saw that it worked and thought that , if it worked in Africa , it would work elsewhere , '' said Mr Hersman . Haitians can report on the lack of water Organisations in the field can use the information and redirect help to those in need . Internet access , though , is an obstacle . `` We are collaborating with the map and making sure that the information is correct , '' said Karina Brisby , head of digital campaigns at Oxfam . `` But the lack of good internet access has n't allowed us access to the map , so we are relying on more traditional forms of information like the UN cluster system and satellite phones . The map supplements that information . '' She believes that because internet access is not widespread in Haiti , many rely on their mobile phones . She thinks this is why mobile phones are crucial during a crisis and why some organizations worked around the clock to set up new mobile phone masts as soon as possible . `` We would n't get any help '' No one thought Jacmel was hit and , if we did n't do something for people to know , we simply would n't get any help at all Joel Dresse was in the US when the earthquake struck and traveled back to Haiti to rejoin his family and children .

SOS Children 's Villages runs a home near the capital , which is currently being used as an emergency hospital . The organization is working to reunite children with surviving family members . Describing themselves as `` orphan specialists '' , Andrew Cates , from the charity 's UK headquarters , said : `` We are , as it were , literally holding the babies . '' Do you remember what you were doing at 2153 GMT on the night of Tuesday 12 January , 2010 ? Perhaps you were getting ready for bed ? You probably brushed your teeth and checked that your clothes were ready for work the next morning . In fact , you probably did much the same as you would on any other evening . Seven thousand kilometres away on an island in the Caribbean it was still daylight . Not yet 5pm local time , you would still have been at work . Or preparing supper for your family . And this was the moment that the earthquake struck . With a magnitude of 7.0 , the quake is estimated to have killed over 200,000 people , with a further three million affected . Numerous aid agencies , charities and international troops have descended on the island to assist in the humanitarian relief effort . Among these is a Cambridge-based charity - SOS Children 's Villages -LRB- SOS CV -RRB- - an international organization supporting over 70,000 orphaned children in 124 countries . Andrew Cates , chief executive of SOS CV in Cambridge , explained why staff from the charity - which already has a base in Haiti - are well-placed to help the children affected by the earthquake . `` Our children 's village -LRB- in Santo , 16km from Port-au-Prince -RRB- is largely intact , '' he said . `` We have food , water and electricity , and the village playing field is now having an emergency hospital built on it because we are one of the very few places with a working infrastructure there . `` But our national office in Haiti has been destroyed , '' he continued . `` We had a social center in town which is completely gone and a vocational training center that no one 's even been able to get to because it 's in an area that 's been totally devastated . `` So , the village itself is totally serviceable and is now being used as a hub , to help in particular the children and the orphaned children around Port-au-Prince . '' `` The role that we 're given is to look after the unaccompanied children , the lone children . We trace the families , we do trauma therapy and at the end of 18 months of trying to find a family - and the best solution for every child - we typically end up with 500 or 600 children who live in family-based care in our children 's villages . Earthquake devastation near SOS Children 's Villages ' Santo home in Haiti `` We are orphan specialists . In Haiti we have trauma specialists who know how to deal with children who are traumatised . `` We have people with a lot of experience in tracing families and we have local staff - and that helps with understanding the local culture and with clues about local families or where they might come from . '' If a child ends up staying at one of SOS 's villages , they are cared for `` through to independence '' . Andrew is quick to point out that the definition of independence depends very much on local culture as well as the individual child . `` Quite a lot of the children who are more difficult to place have some degree of developmental problems and so some of them end up being supported by us , to a degree , for life . `` We take children on - and when we do , we take them on as a parent would - with a commitment that as long as they need us , we will be there for them . '' Two days after the earthquake , SOS staff from the neighbouring Dominican Republic hired a helicopter and flew to Haiti . They were unable to land but filmed the devastation .

The extent of the damage is not yet known . The magnitude 6.1 tremor struck west of Port-au-Prince at 0603 local time -LRB- 1103 GMT -RRB- . An estimated 200,000 people died in last Tuesday 's quake and another 1.5 million were made homeless . Despite an international aid operation , supplies are slow to reach survivors . However , international teams are still rescuing people alive from the rubble , including a 69-year-old woman pulled from the ruins of a church in the capital . The US military has defended its handling of the rescue operation , as aid groups complained of long delays in getting vital supplies of food , water and medicine . Haitian President Rene Preval said aid delivery was the main problem now . Help came `` very fast , '' Mr Preval told a French radio station . `` When it arrives , the question is : where are the trucks to transport it , where are the depots ? '' The US Geological Survey said Wednesday 's tremor was centred 35 miles -LRB- 56km -RRB- north-west of the capital . It struck at a depth of 6.2 miles -LRB- 9.9 km -RRB- , but was too far inland to generate any tsunamis in the Caribbean . We were forced to buy a saw in the market to continue amputations Although some aid has started to reach desperate survivors , hundreds of thousands are still without food or water , a full week after the disaster . Medecins Sans Frontieres -LRB- Doctors Without Borders -RRB- said its cargo plane with 12 tonnes of medical supplies had been turned away from the congested Port-au-Prince airport three times since Sunday . It said five patients died from lack of the supplies it carried . `` We were forced to buy a saw in the market to continue amputations , '' the group 's Loris de Filippi told the Reuters news agency in Cite Soleil . But the US military has defended its efforts in the face of vast logistical challenges . `` We 're doing everything in our power to speed aid to Haiti as fast as humanly possible , '' said Gen Douglas Fraser , head of US Southern Command . He said they plan to start using two other airports , at Jacmel in Haiti and San Isidro in the neighbouring Dominican Republic , in the coming days . One full week after the magnitude seven quake devastated the country , search-and-rescue teams were emerging from the ruins with unbelievable success stories . Ena Zizi , 69 , was rescued from the wreckage of the residence of Haiti 's Roman Catholic archbishop on Monday , a day before crews recovered the body of the archbishop himself , Monsignor Joseph Serge Miot . Another survivor , 25-year-old Lozama Hotteline , was rescued from beneath a collapsed supermarket with the help of teams from Turkey and France . Television pictures showed her smiling and singing as she was carried to safety . The United Nations said early on Wednesday that 121 people had been rescued by international teams since the 12 January earthquake - an extra 31 people on Tuesday . In a bid to speed up the delivery of aid and stem looting and violence , US troops have stepped up their presence in the quake-ravaged country . Mark Doyle , BBC News , Port-au-Prince Haiti was extremely poor even before the earthquake , and this disaster has now broken all the basic services , like phones and electricity . But Haitians are resilient . Everywhere there are volunteers filling some of the gaps created by the slow arrival of international aid . A company which sells drinking water is distributing it free to people living in a school compound . A Haitian Jesuit priest has mobilised local relief workers and international doctors to work together in a rural region just outside the capital . In a slum area , a volunteer first-aider dressed the wounds of a girl who had been trapped in rubble . These largely unsung heroes know they ca n't replace the big foreign aid agencies , but they 're doing what they can to fill the gaps . US Black Hawk helicopters swooped down on the grounds of Haiti 's wrecked presidential palace on Tuesday , dropping scores of US troops who moved to secure a nearby hospital and set up aid distribution points . US Army Maj Gen Daniel Allyn , the deputy commander for relief operations in Haiti , said the military had delivered 400,000 bottles of water and 300,000 food rations since last Tuesday 's earthquake . He said the number of US troops would grow to 10,000 in the coming weeks . Meanwhile , the UN Security Council voted to temporarily boost its peacekeeping forces by 3,500 personnel . UN officials said they would accompany US troops as they delivered supplies . While military escorts are still needed to deliver relief supplies , the United Nations said fears of violence and looting had eased . `` The overall security situation in Port-au-Prince remains stable , with limited , localized violence and looting occurring , '' the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said . So far , feared infectious diseases have not shown up , although many injured faced the immediate threats of tetanus and gangrene , and hospitals are overwhelmed . The UN says `` localized looting '' is occurring , but overall security is good The Pentagon said a navy hospital ship , the USNS Comfort , had received its first Haitian patients , even as it was still heading towards Haiti . US Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the military is sending additional ships to help with earthquake recovery in Haiti , including one that could remove debris blocking the main port . The World Food Programme said it was planning to bring in 10,000 gallons -LRB- 40,000 litres -RRB- of diesel a day from the neighbouring Dominican Republic as Haitian fuel supplies dried up . Haitian officials say the death toll from the quake was likely to be between 100,000 and 200,000 , and that 75,000 bodies had already been buried in mass graves .

But how best should Caribbean people assist ? And , what are you - and your organization - doing to help ? Also , what are your thoughts on the plight of Haiti and its people ? Have your say and let us know Editor 's note : Please refer offers to help Haiti to established and registered charities , and the UK 's Disasters Emergency Committee -LRB- DEC -RRB- appeal for Haiti May God be with the Haitian people , moreover the most vulnerable ones such as the children and the elderly . I would not call them looters since these people are very hungry and they are very much in need . What is the Government of Haiti doing and also Caricom ? Haiti is a member state of Caricom and I was so angry that our Caribbean Prime Ministers were prevented from landing at the airport ? I do not think the Americans should have full control of the airport . Caricom should protest this . No matter what the consequences are the Haitian Government ought to come out and talk to their people encouraging them that there is still hope for them but you are not seeing this in all the televised reports . The Government and people of my country , Guyana has made numerous donations and we are hoping to send off aid to Haiti in this week . May God be with the Haitian people ! Am not sure what the rest of the Caribbean is doing to help Haiti but Jamaica and Jamaicans are doing the best to help our neighbors , we here in Jamaica irrespective of the economic situation will open our homes to the Haitian refugees if and when they arrive . The generosity of the Jamaican people can be seen here in Jamaica as we mobilised to help our neighbors . Am asking the world to forget about the past and use this as an opportunity to rebuild Haiti . I was watching the BBC London TV morning program today and the news was broadcasting the relief efforts in Port-au-Prince . The BBC presenter was speaking to ex-President Bill Clinton who was giving out food and water to the Haitian survivors . The BBC presenter was concerned about the unrest and looting that was taking place amongst some survivors . May I say , Ex-President Clinton response to the BBC presenter warmed my heart he said ; they are survivors who have n't slept for four days with no food , no water , I think they 've behaved remarkably well ! To humanitarian Bill Clinton ; `` Kind words can be short and easy to speak but their echoes are truly endless '' ... As I watched the news on TV and the look of despair on the Haitians faces hair covered in white dust is heart wrenching . Every little helps and I immediately donated to Oxfam UK Haiti disaster appeal . May God give the Haitians renewed strength and especially the orphans . Caricom 's ability to assist is greatly constrained : first by its ability to provide massive amounts of tangible aid , or cash . Secondly , Caricom is itself stuck in several chronic quagmires-most of our own making -LRB- like the pathetic debacle of a Caribbean Court of Justice -RRB- . What our several Governments -LRB- as distinct from `` Caricom '' -RRB- can do , is to facilitate the loan\\/use of the well-spring of Christian goodness , and respect for law and order ; for edcational and other insitutional strengths , that rose - not in governents - but n each of us as caring individuals . And assign such people for a couple of years on `` loan '' to Haiti . In my capacity as a student , I 'll only plead to those who can to help the Haitians but above all , I pray to God for his divine aid on them . Haiti is the reason why black people in the west have enjoyed their freedom . Use this freedom to say thank you . Avoid joining the chorus of verbal abuse on the country , respect the people as fellow humans . When one country is in crisis the whole world is in problems . Today is Haiti , tomorrow might be another country . Caricom needs to genuinely invest in disaster preparedness as a matter of urgency . Sending a fact finding mission to Haiti was contributing to the already chaotic and uncoordinated activities present . However , there will be more disasters in the region ; Caricom ought to get there first ! It would help if Caricom prepares for other phases of helping the Haitians such as readying house building materials for transporting to Haiti . The Haitians will continue to need support for the next decade-not merely in this immediate aftermath of the earthquake . Life has always being an earthquake for the Haitians . Hopefully the Haitians will benefit from present intervention more than they have benefitted from the past . I am president of the Caribbean Students ' Society -LRB- CSS -RRB- at McGill University and we are working with other student groups in Montreal to raise funds for Haitians . For those that are in Montral and want to assist with our cause , please email the Caribbean Students ' Society at mcgillcss@yahoo.com Hi am from St Maarten .

St. John 's , Antigua & Barbuda I must extend sympathy to the Haitian victims and their families . May the world step forward and give them solace by providing them a safe place to ` exist ' . I find it noble of the AFC leader Mr. Trotman is calling for Guyana to accept some earth quake victims from Haiti . Guyana , should dispense it 's political bias and racial fear and become a stalwart and a humanitarian and make land available for farming to the victims . I support any relocation effort of the earth quake victims more so if the cost would be defrayed by the United Nations . A concerned Guyanese living in the US . Hi , I would like to know where I could donate clothes for the Haiti people . I can not seem to find any information on this . They are all talking about donating money but that is all well and good , but surely they will need some kind of clothing also . I would like to find a place specifically for the Haiti people only . Thank you for your help . I work for a US Foundation -LRB- Omidyar Network -RRB- . We 've supported Ushahidi - www.ushahidi.com - a crisis reporting platform which has been up and running in Haiti and has and 40,000 hits in last 3 days - providing information on missing people . The impact of the earthquake has been truly tragic . It is awful in such an earthquake prone area has such appalling building standards : one of the reasons why the loss of life and damage is so much worse in underdeveloped countries . Suggesting it 's a 1 in 200 year event lessens the realisation that it is Haiti 's political and development more than the size of natural disasters that has caused such a shocking loss of life . My construction friends and I , as a project construction manager , 30 years overseas experience would dearly love to get ` hands on ' assistance . We can donate sound sense to the infrastructure rebuilding -- voluntarily . Caricom needs to set up a body and ask its members -LRB- the Govt 's - not NGOs -RRB- to donate what they can to the body ; instead of having each country delivering on their own . -LRB- 2 -RRB- Submit a list with what 's required to each member state and ask them to provide the requirements ; doctors , social workers , artisans u name it . My niece , my sister-in-law and I will be donating some stuff through my niece 's school . I really and truly feel their pain . I was fortunate to be an observer in 1990 for the `` first '' democratic election and my heart went out then for the suffering of the poorer class . I can imagine what it is now . May God ever bless them in their sufferings . Haiti has been totally devastated . At Maya Island Air Maintenance we 're collecting funds from employees to donate to the local Red Cross Haiti Relief Fund . We encourage all Belizeans and Caricom nationals to contribute something . Haiti needs us more than ever now . I speak Creole , French and Spanish and know the country relatively well . Feel free to use my expertise in whatever way possible . Time is of the utmost urgency now . I work at a school and we are having a fundraiser and food drive in the next few days . Apart from that I am fluent in Creole and English and work well with people of all ages . If there 's ANYTHING I can do , translate , comfort , serve etc. .

The US Air Force C-17 planes involved in the first airdrop came from a base in North Carolina and dropped 14,000 meals and 15,000 litres of water in a secured area 5 miles north east of Port-au-Prince . The problem with airdrops is that without proper control on the ground there may be rioting as people fight over supplies . Port-au-Prince airport is small , damaged and congested and lacks the warehouses needed to store all the aid before it can be distributed . The US has been managing the airport and has established a slot system to maximize its capacity . About one hundred flights a day are landing there , but there have been reports of disputes between countries and agencies about who gets priority for landing their planes . It takes 18 hours to travel the 160 miles from Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic to Port au Prince . The route is very congested with people trying to leave Haiti and relief supplies trying to get into the country . Bottlenecks due to relief traffic have been causing delays of up to an hour at the border crossing point and disorganised relief efforts were further hampering operations . A field office has been set up at Jimani for the transfer of supplies into Haiti . A fleet of 30 long haul trucks was secured in Santo Domingo on Monday 18 January . Distribution points are being set up within Haiti to ensure aid reaches all the outlying population centres . Port-au-Prince harbor was badly damaged in the quake and it may be many months before it 's fully operational again . US divers have been surveying the harbor and and will begin a salvage operation to remove underwater debris . The aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson will serve as a `` floating airport '' for relief operations with 19 helicopters on board . Other US ships have been deployed carrying medical staff and equipment , as well as troops and relief supplies . Other supplies may be diverted to ports further north , such as Cap Haitien , Saint Marc and Gonaives . The USS Carl Vinson is moored off Port au Prince . It is carrying 19 helicopters and will act as a floating airport , ferrying supplies and troops to and from the island . Some of those injured in the earthquake have also been treated on board the ship . Other US ships are being deployed to Haiti , including the hospital ship USS Comfort . Others will bring helictopers capable of lifting heavy loads , trucks and other equipment needed to begin repairing the island 's infrastructure . Three million people are in need of aid , according to the Red Cross , and so far some 14,000 ready-to-eat meals and 15,000 litres of water have been dropped north-east of the capital , Port-au-Prince , by the US military . With the reported number of homeless people varying from 200,000 to 1.5 million , tents are in huge demand . UK-based ShelterBox is among those distributing non-food packs . The boxes , which cost # 490 , contain equipment to shelter 10 people and provide other basic living equipment . The World Food Programme -LRB- WFP -RRB- reports that water tanks are being set up across Port-au-Prince , with a further 120,000 bottles of water supplied to the city 's main hospital . High-energy biscuits , seen as the most effective way to feed people with no access to cooking facilities , have also arrived in Port-au-Prince . Ready-to-eat meals -LRB- MREs -RRB- , similar to those supplied to the US military , are being dropped in the region by the WFP . The packs contain main meals such as beef stew , chicken noodles or spaghetti , along with crackers , spread , biscuits , condiments and saline water . Each pack contains about 1,200 calories . As the name suggests , they are ready-to-eat but they can also be heated up by submerging in boiling water or using the flameless heater provided in the pack , which works by using a chemical reaction to create heat . The WFP hopes to have sent 10 million food packs to Haiti by 25 January .

Mr Ban said he was grateful to the UN Security Council for its swift action , calling it `` a clear signal that the world is with Haiti '' . He said the UN was in discussion with member states , and he hoped to have the extra troops and police to deploy soon . The UN mission in Haiti currently numbers about 9,000 . There have been reports of widespread violence and looting . But the UN has played down worries over security , saying that despite violent incidents , the overall situation is calm . US Army Maj Gen Daniel Allyn , deputy commander of the Joint Task Force on ongoing relief efforts , echoed that message , saying the security situation was `` relatively calm '' and that aid distribution points were orderly . He said there were `` pockets of instability '' , but that UN forces and the Haitian national police were addressing security needs with `` agility '' . Mark Doyle , BBC News , Haiti The Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital in Port-au-Prince was destroyed in the earthquake , so the local and international medical staff who survived set up a new treatment center across the road in their pharmacy . Using rough wooden sticks and a crude curtain they 've established an operating theater in the open air . The operating table is a wooden desk . The doctors say they treated several hundred people a day in the first few days after the earthquake , and that more are coming all the time as they hear medical aid is available . Most patients have broken or crushed limbs from falling concrete . There were more than 2,000 US personnel on the ground and 5,000 offshore on ships , he said , adding that 10,000 troops in total would be arriving in the coming weeks , half of whom would be directly involved in distributing humanitarian aid . Mr Ban said the UN 's goal was to increase the number of people receiving food to one million this week and at least two million in the following two weeks . Addressing concern that aid has been too slow to reach desperate Haitians , Mr Ban said the situation on the ground was `` overwhelming '' , but that UN efforts were `` gearing up quickly '' . `` For those who have lost everything , of course , help can not come soon enough , '' Mr Ban said . `` But we are working day and night . '' Last week , US Defense Secretary Robert Gates said airdrops had been ruled out because they might do more harm than good . Mr Gates warned that they could trigger riots if there was no proper structure on the ground to distribute supplies . The problem is dehydration but there is still a chance -LRB- of finding survivors -RRB- But the BBC 's Nick Davis in Port-au-Prince says that the US military is now securing areas on the ground before pallets of food and water are parachuted in . British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Tuesday Haiti was a `` test of resolve '' for the international community . France 's Co-operation Minister , Alain Joyandet , had suggested on Monday that the US was `` occupying '' Haiti and urged the UN to `` clarify '' the US role . However , a statement from President Nicolas Sarkozy on Tuesday said France was `` very satisfied '' with the co-operation and praised the US for its `` exceptional mobilisation '' . The UN says dozens of search and rescue teams are now on the ground . On Tuesday , UN spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs said 90 people had been pulled out alive since the earthquake , and rescue efforts were now concentrated outside the capital . She insisted there was still hope for survivors . `` The climate is mild , there are significant air pockets . The problem is dehydration but for the moment there is still a chance , '' she said . Haitian officials say the death toll in the quake has risen to at least 75,000 . Some 250,000 people were injured and about a million left homeless . At least 70,000 earthquake victims have already been buried . On Tuesday , the Paris Club of creditor governments , including the US , UK , France and Germany , called on other nations to follow its lead in canceling debts to Haiti . Venezuela and Taiwan are the other biggest creditors .

'' The BBC 's Mark Doyle , reporting from Leogane , said the village had been left looking worse than most war zones - as if it had been carpet-bombed , then pounded with a relentless artillery barrage . Haitian officials say the number who have died as a result of the quake is likely to be between 100,000 and 200,000 , and that 75,000 bodies had already been buried in mass graves . But UN officials say it is likely the actual number of people who have died will never be established . An estimated 1.5 million Haitians are homeless .

'' The first group of 2,000 marines on board vessels off Haiti 's coast went ashore on Tuesday to assist the relief effort . They have since landed heavy equipment , such as bulldozers , diggers and trucks , and other supplies near the epicentre of last week 's earthquake . Adam Mynott , BBC News , Port-au-Prince This , we are told by the international medics who have come here , is one of the better-organised hospitals in the city . We are standing by the entrance , which has in effect been turned into a ward . It is a quite extraordinary sight . There are people with injuries lying everywhere , some on beds , some on mattresses , some just lying on bits of cloth stretched out on the stone floor . The doctor says that one of the big risks now is that of secondary infection . Outside the hospital , what once was the car park has been turned into an outpatients ' department and there must be more than 100 patients here . Many of them have been treated and could go home but , of course , they have no homes to go to . The decision to redeploy assets by the US military came after it defended its handling of the rescue operation . Survivors and aid groups have complained of long delays in getting vital supplies of food , water and medicine . Medicins Sans Frontieres -LRB- Doctors Without Borders -RRB- said its cargo plane with 12 tonnes of medical supplies had been turned away from the congested Port-au-Prince airport three times since Sunday .

Within a few minutes the flow stops . On the telegraph pole that rises next to them is a makeshift sign that says : `` Help needed . Water , food , medicine . '' There are too many of these signs in Port-au-Prince - and too many people who are waiting for someone to do what they say . One week on , it is impossible to see how Haiti can recover from this earthquake . The fund-raising effort around the world has been truly incredible . In the middle of one of the worst recessions in living memory , people have been giving money as perhaps never before . That money , though , is mostly sitting on the tarmac at the capital 's airport at the moment - it is not getting to the people in need . This is in part because of the immense logistical difficulties facing the aid organizations . Communications are very , very difficult . Co-ordinating who gets help and when is made all the more difficult because of what was an already poor infrastructure . They treat us like dogs . Why do n't they feed us like humans ? On the ground , though , it seems that more should be possible . In every single one of the makeshift camps I visited , large and small , people asked where the help was . The UN World Food Programme says that one of the big problems of distributing aid is the risk of riots . There have been some chaotic scenes when UN staff have tried to hand out food , but I have never felt at risk . It may , however , explain why outside a camp the other day some sacks of rice were left in the middle of the night . There is no knowing who left the food there , but the homeless people living in the camp say it was an aid organization , that the food was dumped in the road , and that by the time the people found it much of the rice had spilt across the road itself . `` They treat us like dogs , '' one man said . `` Why do n't they feed us like humans ? '' It is an obvious question . Surely with the thousands of peacekeepers here , if the fear really is that the situation really could get out of control , the UN could cordon off an area of each camp , bring in food and water and carefully and safely hand it out ? In a bid to speed up aid deliveries , US troops have stepped up their presence Surely the aid agencies could work with the UN and the US to do the same ? Surely US troops - of which there are thousands on the ground already -LRB- though it has been hard to see any at all in Port-au-Prince itself so far , apart from those that fly overhead -RRB- - could also help secure areas so that crowd control is easier ? But these things are not happening , and the people of Haiti can not understand why . I have seen some tents that clearly have come from outside , and which now are sheltering the homeless , but only a tiny number . In the meantime , more than a million people are living out in the open , under a sheet , or a rectangle of tarpaulin . The question that urgently needs answering , is why is it taking so long ? Because unless the situation changes , Haiti 's crisis will deepen , and many more will die .

Aid workers involved in the operation have been sharing their accounts with the BBC News website . We get an unscheduled tectonic alarm call - a groaning , gut-shaking rumble is all around us . I am half-awake , thinking about the day 's plans . The earth is shifting under my feet . I leap up , alarm shouts of my colleagues in numerous languages around me , but they are only shapes in the half light , and I ca n't find my glasses . The roof groans and rattles , and things fall in the dark . Stuart Coles is in Haiti with children 's charity Plan International My heart has jump started , and my legs propel me forward . But my brain , says `` head under the desk . '' Two years of living in Japan and numerous drills have conditioned me that this is what to do . I shout my colleague Shona 's name , but she is up and running from the mattress next to me . Shapes flee towards the door , light and the open . I switch direction and follow them . Suddenly I fall and am slap down on the concrete , a stinging pain on both knees . I 'm up again , running barefoot across the concrete and into the yard where the cooks work . There is a circle of us now gathered , panting . We all check everyone is out . The roof groans and rattles , and things fall in the dark The shaking stops . Slowly my heart slows . I look down - I am in my underwear and for some unknown reason , still clutching a pillow . Shona seems to have dragged most her bedding with her , others the same . Deep breathing and some swearing switches to nervous giggling as we look around and realize we are all in our nightwear and holding random items . `` I 've seen loads of Plan staff in their boxers , '' says Shona casually . And then bizarrely laughter , relief and a touch of hysteria evident as the adrenalin works its way out . This passes , and then we come down . The reality of what has happened sinks in . I have experienced small quakes in southern Japan and an aftershock in Banda Aceh - but this was the worst yet . We are shaken , but not stirred . Media calls start , they are getting news that it is a 6.1 quake - the strongest since last week 's . The team steel themselves and we prepare for Port-au-Prince . MARTIN HARRISON , WATER ENGINEER , HCJB GLOBAL Dr Eckehart Wolfe tends to the patient he gave blood to during an operation . Photo : Martin Harrison A strong aftershock at 0605 local time this morning sent panic through the hospital . It is one week since the earthquake struck the Caribbean island of Haiti . If there are two words which summarise what I have seen and experienced since I arrived here last Friday , they are `` resilience '' and `` improvisation '' . I marvel at the Haitian people as they make life continue against all odds . At the Baptist Haiti Mission Hospital where I am based many staff have lost family members and close friends , yet they have not downed tools since the first day as they seek to help others live . Some patients are still waiting for essential operations one week after the earthquake The emergency response team demonstrates equally remarkable resilience and improvisation . One of the HCJB Global surgeons even gave his own blood during the middle of an operation he himself was performing to save the life of a woman with severe internal bleeding . We urgently require stocks of blood . The hospital does not have any at all . The woman died later because there was no blood for the transfusion . The hospital is home to two of only five hospital-based operating theaters that remain operational in Port-au-Prince . Since yesterday , we have started receiving emergency cases from refugee camps set up by the US military . Certain essential supplies have run out such as plates for mending fractures and crutches . We urgently await their arrival . Surgeons are improvising by cutting pins in half to make them go further as they operate on many fractured limbs . Some patients are still waiting for essential operations one week after the earthquake . There is growing concern about the spread of disease . Few of the patients have been vaccinated against tetanus and we desperately need vaccinations . Sarah Gillam : `` Water is plentiful in Mariani but it 's not potable '' I woke up this morning to hear people screaming outside and my bed shaking . Should I run outside naked or find my clothes ? I opted for the clothes but realized those vital seconds could be a matter of life and death . The earth seemed to settle and after hanging around for a while , we went back inside . In the Mariani neighborhood of Port-au-Prince where we work , primary needs identified so far are food , shelter , chlorine tablets for water and medical attention . We piloted our food distribution two days ago and it all went well thanks to a local donation of high protein food for children made by SCMS - an international NGO distributing pharmaceutical products for HIV patients . I woke up this morning to hear people screaming and my bed shaking We 're confident the local committees have the capacity to distribute large quantities of food and we 're taking measures to guard against any kind of hoarding and prejudice against women and children . We have bought several tonnes of food from the Dominican Republic for distribution tomorrow . We will also be exploring local food sources from small farmers ' cooperatives outside Port-au-Prince so that aid efforts do n't damage local prices over the coming months . In Mariani , water is plentiful but it 's not potable . Instead of giving out water bottles , we will be giving out chlorine tablets to prevent more rubbish accumulating in the capital . Although ActionAid does n't normally work in the field of medicine , lots of people are dying due to lack of medical care . Many are dying from simple wounds which have become septic or gangrenous and there is a lack of antibiotics , bandages , syringes and plaster for castes . Red Cross and ActionAid have begun talks on how they can work together through the voluntary committees which have sprung up inside the camps to guarantee medical attention . Women and children 's safety is also a serious concern . We have already started working with psychiatric professionals to develop a mid-term plan for treating post traumatic stress among women and children in the refugee camps . I have been spending my nights in an aircraft hangar for almost a full week now and have got used to the constant roar of engines from the huge cargo planes constantly taking-off and landing . But this morning I was jolted awake by the sound of the entire hangar rattling and groaning - it was an earthquake . Just as I made it outside the earth stopped shaking and there was quiet . The fear was evident when we arrived at the national hospital . Operation Blessing is installing 10 water purification units in Haiti During the quake all the patients were evacuated and none of them wanted to go back inside . So the narrow lanes in the hospital were crammed with patients and doctors under the blazing sun . We saw operations taking place in the open air while cars spewed exhaust fumes across the procedure . Dead bodies pulled from rubble near the hospital were wheeled to the morgue past lines of patients . Operation Blessing installed a large water purification unit in the hospital , put in a line with a tap and provided clean water to serve the 3,000 patients and medical staff on the compound . Tomorrow we will be installing another unit at the soccer stadium where we set up our field hospital . The hospital now has teams of French and US doctors working alongside our Israeli team . ISABELLE JEANSON , MEDECINS SANS FRONTIERES I had the scare of my life this morning . I had hoped I could sleep-in an extra 10 minutes because I 've been working on five hours sleep a night for the last week and am hitting the bottom of the barrel . I suddenly felt my sleeping bag on the bedroom floor rocking back and forth . For about a second I thought maybe I was dizzy from being tired . But that thought did n't last long when the rocking got stronger . I jumped up , scrambled to the door in the dim morning light in my pyjamas and ran downstairs . I was shaking and on the verge of crying , and so was my colleague . He had survived the quake last week , but he still had the courage to run back inside the house to get our two other colleagues out . Isabelle Jeanson : `` It hurts to see so many injured children and adults . '' My heart was racing . I finally understood the meaning of vulnerable , to be so exposed to this overwhelming force . That was the start to this day . This afternoon I spent a few hours at our field hospital in Carrefour . The entrance is through gray thick plastic sheeting , which is attached to two trees , spanning across a street in the middle of the town . This is the triage area , a wound-dressing area , and an inpatient ward . It hurts to see so many injured children and adults , some screaming in pain as their dressing gets changed by a nurse . They have serious burns , wounds that are infected , broken arms , deep cuts in the skull , gangrened limbs , and the list goes on . There are pregnant women who are giving birth , or who need c-sections and beds for more serious surgery , such as amputations . In the five hours I was there , the team did at least three amputations , two for young children . They removed necrotic tissue on a young woman 's thigh , and did a c-section . Our team is tired . They have been working long , long hours in the heat , in crowded , noisy , demanding and stressful conditions . Fortunately , we 've located a brand new spacious school building that was not affected by the earthquake , just down the street from our hospital . We hope to move to this new location in the coming days . The one shining light in all this physical and emotional suffering is the birth of healthy little babies . Eight healthy little new ones arrived today under the blue tarp of our hospital . We all need them to breathe new life and hope into this torn country .

The earthquake in Haiti has left an estimated 1.5 million people homeless and tens of thousands without access to food , water and medical supplies . The UN says the scale of the disaster is `` historic '' , with its staff confronting devastation and logistical problems on a scale never seen before . Here is a look at some of the issues agencies say have hampered the aid effort and how they are being dealt with . The devastation has been described as ` historic ' in scale Aid agencies say Haiti is quite simply one of the worst disasters they have ever handled . `` In every direction the task is huge , it is an historic challenge '' UN spokesman Elisabeth Byrs told the BBC . `` We are trying to run an operation for three million people , the task is huge and the coordination is immense . '' They say that while images of the misery in Haiti can spread rapidly around the world , aid supplies and skilled people can not travel so fast . `` Haiti is definitely the most complex emergency to date , '' said Jean Philippe Chauzy of the International Organization for Migration -LRB- IOM -RRB- . He said it was difficult for those not involved in emergency aid to understand how difficult the operations can be . `` The fact that the reporting is immediate might give the impression that aid can be sorted out in such a fashion , but you ca n't do that because of the scale of the operation and complexity . '' Aid groups say supplies have been stuck at the airport While the main airport in Port-au-Prince was not put out of action by the quake , it is not equipped to deal with the volume of flights arriving . There have been complaints of huge backlogs , with some aircraft circling for hours or being diverted to the Dominican Republic . Paul Peachy of Christian Aid said it had difficult even getting emergency staff to Haiti . The UN says 150 planes are now landing daily in Port-au-Prince but the US Army , which has taken over control of the airport , says 1,500 planes are still scheduled to arrive . To speed up the process , aid flights are also coming into and out of the neighbouring Dominican Republic and in smaller airports in Haiti . Port-au-Prince 's main port was also badly damaged by the quake and other ports in the area could only accept smaller vessels . One of the two piers in the capital 's docks reopened on Thursday , allowing bulkier shipments to be delivered by sea . But on Thursday , Haiti 's President Rene Preval joined several aid agencies in saying it is what happens when aid arrives in the country that is the problem . `` People say to us : Where are the trucks to transport the aid ? Where are the depots to store what arrives ? '' `` What 's important is coordination of the aid , so that we know what we receive , in what quantity , when and how it 's distributed . '' Damaged roads make it harder to move resources around the country Moving aid to where it is needed has been hampered by damage to roads , piles of rubble in the streets or by the sheer volume of people trying to move out of or around the capital . `` Road corridors are heavy with traffic , so traveling takes hours , '' said Ms Byrs of the UN . Aid agencies also report a lack of trucks and a lack of fuel but said supplies were now starting to arrive . They also hope to start employing local people soon in rubble clearing so reconstruction can begin . The fact that many roads were damaged also meant that survivors have tended to gather in small groups , rather than in larger camps , he said . `` It is very difficult to reach out systematically when you 've got hundreds of groups of people in Port-au-Prince and the vicinity , '' he said . `` If you manage to get tens of thousands of displaced people in one place you obviously streamline the distribution . '' The US has carried out air drops of basic supplies in some areas , but this is considered a last resort as it is considered inefficient and can lead to unrest on the ground as people compete for the few supplies . Aid groups were unable to broadcast information to camps Phones and internet links were down in many areas of Haiti for some time after the quake , making it harder for agencies to coordinate their efforts . Mr Peachy of Christian Aid said it had been impossible to contact his colleagues in Haiti for the first 48 hours after the quake . But Mr Chauzy of the IOM said the lack of communications also meant it was hard to tell people needing aid where they could go to collect it . `` Now the media is up and running , local radio station have started broadcasting and the UN 's Radio Minustah has started broadcasting in Creole , '' he said . Many NGOs based in Haiti lost staff and equipment in the disaster , which meant the systems they had in place could not be used . Christian Aid was one of many to lose its entire building . Aside from the practical losses , many aid workers are also dealing with grief as they carry out their work . `` For the moment we are concentrating - and I would say escaping - with the work . After , we will experience the emotions , '' said Ms Byrs at the UN . Armed police have been deployed to deter looting and violence There has been concern about the security situation in Haiti , with fears that people not receiving aid would turn to violence . John O'Shea of Irish charity Goal told the Guardian newspaper he could not allow aid workers to move into Haiti from the Dominican Republican because he had `` no guarantee that the people driving them are not going to be macheted to death on the way down '' . But while there have been reports of looting and some incidents of violence , other agencies say they have been impressed by how Haitians have responded to the disaster . Ms Byrs said the capital was `` tense but calm '' and that the few examples of violence were not representative of Haitian people . `` We are seeing a huge solidarity between Haitian people . They resilient , they taken their fate into own hands from the very beginning , '' she said . Jean Philippe Chauzy of French agency Acted said the security issues in Haiti should neither be over-played nor used as an excuse to prevent aid deliveries . `` The needs are there , people are desperate , if you do n't distribute the assistance , people will be even more desperate and ready to resort to anything . '' On Thursday , a truck run by the US-based Catholic Relief Service was reported to have been overrun by desperate people when it arrived at a makeshift camp in the town of Leogane . But Adrien Tomarchio of Acted says the main safety concern has been for those people receiving aid . `` The best process is not to start distribution at once and announce it so everyone comes , '' he says . `` We make sure we can set up a proper secured distribution point , where people can come one-by-one . The aim is to deliver to the most vulnerable people first , then we also can focus on other groups . '' The US Army has been deployed in vast numbers in Haiti , both to help with the aid effort and to help maintain law and order . The US has tens of thousands of troops in the country Medecins Sans Frontieres -LRB- MSF -RRB- has complained that the rush to get troops into the country has been at the expense of the delivery of humanitarian supplies . `` Everything has been mixed together and the urgent and vital attention to the people have been delayed while military logistics - which is useful but not on day three , not on day four , but maybe on day eight - has really jammed the airport and led to this mismanagement . '' MSF say one of its planes carrying 12 tonnes of medical supplies was repeatedly turned away from the airport despite having prior permission to land . John O'Shea of Goal said the failure of the UN and US to work together was leading to `` a situation of utter chaos '' . The UN has dismissed such criticism , saying it `` underestimated the logistical difficulties '' and that the US was the only country in the region capable of providing logistical support on the scale needed . `` We are not talking about politics , this is humanitarian . Our goal is to delivery assistance as soon as possible and co-ordination is vital - without it you ca n't get the right aid to the most vulnerable , '' said spokeswoman Ms Byrs . Aid agencies are keen to stress that the response to a disaster such as Haiti must be responsible and durable . The last thing they want is for the mechanisms they put in place to lead to long term harm for the people they are trying to help . Badly managed distributions can mean the most needy go without Adrien Tomarchio , of French agency Acted , told the BBC the aim when distributing food is to get it to the right people quickly , rather than just get it out quickly . `` If we distribute food all at once , some people will take more then they need and there is the risk of them selling food items , rather than it reaching the people that need it , '' he said . `` The aim is to deliver to the most vulnerable people , then we can focus on other groups . '' In the case of shelter , there is little point in building a camp for displaced people without confirming they will be able to stay there , possibly for many months . Agencies have had to work with the local authorities to determine whether the land is suitable , whether it can be properly equipped with shelter and sanitation . Land rights issues also do not disappear after a disaster , so agencies have to establish who owns the land on which they hope to build . `` You ca n't just go there and get land , level it and start building , '' says Jean Philippe Chauzy of IOM . Haiti 's rainy season begins in May or June , so camps can not be placed in areas which are likely to be flooded in the next few months . IOM , working with troops from Minustah , have started clearing a patch of land in a suburb about 10km out of Port-au-Prince , but say further camps will almost certainly be needed . As recovery begins , it is important that as many Haitians that can return to work do . A camp which is too far away from the capital for them to be able to travel in for work will benefit no one .

I have heard that aid is getting to Leogane and I do n't understand as you can not get to Leogane without going through Carrefour . We have posted so many messages on Facebook asking for aid to be sent to Carrefour to help people , because there are so many people who need help . People are dying ; the elderly , the children and whoever was sick before and these are people who survived the actual quake . My grandmother is not a strong woman . I have not slept since the earthquake and I am upset that I can not help my grandmother when she needs it the most .

They have set up a tent outside their house and are sleeping in the street . They were able to retrieve some supplies from inside the house which they are sharing with the neighbors but now food and water are running low . Aid is needed in the different parts of Haiti affected by the earthquake and not just the capital . My brother Mark did manage to travel from Leogane to Port-au-Prince in search of food and help for the women and children . While people have survived , if they do not get the help that they need they will die My mum has a nephew in Santo Domingo and she is trying to get in touch with him to see if my relatives in Leogane would be able to go and stay there for a while . I am not sure how possible this will be as from what I have been hearing the roads are completely devastated . While people have survived , if they do not get the help that they need they will die .

Over fifty acts , including The Answer , David Holmes , General Fiasco and the Beat Poets will perform at the Belfast gig in Katy Daly 's on 31st January . The `` Belfast 4 Haiti '' event has been promoted almost exclusively through the networking sites Facebook and Twitter . The campaign 's Facebook page has so far attracted over 4,500 members . One of the organisers , Aaron Abernethy , said they originally had a target of # 20,000 , but given the amount of interest he said they now hope to exceed that figure . He explained that the idea for the fundraiser came during a conversation with other musicians on the internet . `` It all started last week when all the Haiti news reports came out and a few of us , local musicians , were musing on a web board , ` should there be a benefit gig for this ? ' and it kind of snowballed from there . `` Two of us got elected , as it were , to try and run these things , '' he said . Mr Abernethy also said that as he had been made redundant two weeks ago , he had found plenty of spare time to get involved in the organization . He said David Holmes , the local DJ who received an Oscar nomination for his music in the Oceans 11 film , would play in the Stiff Kitten venue , close to the main event . `` We 've also got The Answer playing at our gig in the Limelight , who have just come back from a worldwide tour with AC\\/DC where they played to literally millions of people '' . `` Also , General Fiasco who are a young band who are getting lots of play on MTV at the minute ; In Case of Fire , from Portadown , who are always on all the music magazines at the minute . `` There are just so many of the biggest names in Northern Ireland basically who have all been very kind to offer to play , its just been fantastic , '' he said .

They said it would be an `` absolute miracle '' if anyone else were found alive among the ruined buildings . Rescuer Anthony Thomas , from Devon , said : `` It 's time for us to go home .

Doctors say they are already struggling to cope with the sheer numbers of people needing amputations after being trapped in rubble . Some surgeons estimate that as many as 200,000 Haitians will end up losing one or more limbs - in a country where the few rehabilitation facilities that existed before the earthquake have largely been destroyed . And in a country where an estimated 800,000 people were already living with disability before the disaster struck , meeting all the needs of the amputees may be impossible . Dominic Hannett , director of clinical services at Opcare , a private company that provides prosthetic services to the NHS , says many more amputations will be carried out over the coming days and weeks because of potentially fatal infections in people , who had initially fairly minor wounds or fractures . They will need to re-equip the rehabilitation center , find out who out of the staff is still alive and train more people and there are international guidelines on how to do that Sandra Sexton , University of Strathclyde And he warned infection will remain a major risk in those who have had surgery to remove parts of or whole limbs . He said : `` It 's fairly common sense but the more someone loses of their limb , the more complex the amputation and prosthesis is going to be - if someone loses a leg at the hip , that 's a massive problem . '' Prosthetic devices need to be fitted as soon as possible after healing to get people mobile and will need refitting in the first few weeks and after that at least once a year , he said . `` Amputation is a life-long rehabilitation - in the UK we still treat amputees from the Second World War because they need ongoing care . '' But limbs are easy to make and the sheet of plastic needed to remould and fit a socket joint on a prosthetic costs as little as # 15 . `` The requirements for a prosthetics team to set up are fairly simple and local people can be trained to manufacture and provide prosthetics , '' he said . Sandra Sexton , director of the National Centre for Prosthetics and Orthotics at the University of Strathclyde , said there were some rehabilitation services in Haiti , but like everything else they have been destroyed by the quake which killed 200,000 people , according to some estimates . Ms Sexton added survival was currently the top priority for medical teams , but once the focus shifted to reconstruction , a vital step would be getting the local rehabilitation services up and running once again . It is a gigantic and very serious problem and the post-amputation period will be critical in terms of post-operative support , physical therapy and the fitting of prostheses Eric Doubt , Healing Hands for Haiti `` What we saw after the Pakistan earthquake was the importance of having a co-ordinated approach - it 's about knowing who has had an amputation , and who is undergoing treatment . `` We know from places that have been in conflict , for example after the Ethiopian civil war , there was a very practical way forward . `` They -LRB- aid agencies -RRB- built rehab centres in five areas then they trained people up to do local provision but the local population there had not been as devastated as it has in Haiti and it 's going to be a lot more difficult . `` They will need to re-equip the rehabilitation center , find out who out of the staff is still alive and train more people . '' Ms Sexton stressed the disaster in Haiti was of an `` unprecedented '' scale . `` This is devastation in a very poor country , '' she said . `` They had rehabilitation services before but they were n't even touching the sides and it 's hard to comprehend how to help - they really will need sustained long-term support . '' Eric Doubt , executive director of Healing Hands for Haiti - a US-based charity set up 10 years ago to provide rehabilitation for people with disabilities - said three-quarters of their facilities in the country have been destroyed . The charity is now accelerating plans to open Haiti 's first Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Institute later this year . `` We have 150 medical specialists , construction crew , translators and volunteers flying out next week , '' said Mr Doubt . `` Following that we will be joined by a team of 30 professionals from Handicap International . `` Whether that addresses all of the previous and new needs is highly unlikely , but we 'll be working in conjunction with all the other physical medicine and rehabilitation organizations who will also be setting up operations .

The beeping , orange light of a fork-lift truck weaves around stacks of boxes , crates and rolls of plastic piping piled high in Oxfam 's warehouse in Bicester . It targets pallets and maneuvers them carefully , but speedily , to a waiting lorry outside . This operation goes on for several hours , filling five lorries and constituting a 50-tonne consignment of some of the vital tools that Haiti 's earthquake survivors will need if they are to live long-term in the open air . Loading up the lorries here in the UK is straightforward but once the consignment gets to Haiti , can Oxfam be sure it will reach the people who need it ? This could n't have happened in a worse place . A country which is already weak with poor infrustucture . It makes it difficult to reach the people as nothing works . Even to make a phone call is extremely difficult Martijn Blansjaar , Oxfam 's head of logistics , is certain it will get through . `` We are not using the airport in Port au Prince , we are using the airport in the Dominican Republic and then the road into Haiti , which is a route we have already used to take in 40 tonnes of aid which we are distributing in Port au Prince at the moment , '' he said . The emergency equipment includes tools like shovels , pick-axes and wheelbarrows to dig latrines as well as 1,000 latrine slabs , in order to improve sanitation for the homeless . In addition there are 1,000 pairs of surgical gloves and 20,000 bars of soap for those digging and clearing latrine areas . Also included in this delivery are 40 tap stands , each with 6 taps that can be rigged up to water towers using the plastic piping . Sorting out sanitation is a priority for Oxfam , which is working in seven sites across the Haitian capital targeting nearly 100,000 people . The charity has already sent out some equipment for latrines , water tanks and buckets with lids , as well as plastic sheeting , so that people have some semblance of a roof over their heads . In this consignment alone , equipment worth at least # 150,000 is leaving the depot for Haiti , paid for by public donations to the Disasters Emergency Committee fund . It is transported to Stansted airport in Essex where , along with aid from the Red Cross , it will be packed onto a flight donated free of charge by British Airways .

Despite his confidence that the aid will definitely reach those who need it , Mr Blansjaar admits that the logistics are extremely challenging . `` The situation is very difficult .

US navy and army divers are to start repairing the port 's pier on Friday . Re-opening Haiti 's seaport in the capital , Port-au-Prince , is seen as vital to the international aid effort . Millions of people remain in need after Haiti 's earthquake , and plans are being made to house 400,000 survivors in new tented villages outside the capital . The BBC 's Adam Mynott , in Port-au-Prince , says 50 % of the port was destroyed by the earthquake , but engineers have decided some parts of one pier are strong enough to handle limited amounts of cargo . The port will be running at 10 % capacity . But it will not be the answer in getting aid through to the quake-devastated country , our correspondent adds . Just four vessels had docked by Thursday evening . Dock workers have offloaded 124 containers of humanitarian aid from ships from the US , the Netherlands and France . However , correspondents say the aid that has so far arrived at the port is being driven for 45 minutes across the city to the airport , where it is piling up and not being distributed to those who need it . An estimated 1.5 million people were left homeless by the 7.0-magnitude quake , which some have estimated has killed as many as 200,000 people . Mark Doyle , BBC News , Port-au-Prince The police chief of a notoriously violent part of the capital , the slum area Cite Soleil , has appealed for help in countering criminal gangs that escaped from the main prison during last week 's earthquake . Several hundred of some 5,000 on the run are believed to be hardened criminals belonging to Haiti 's gangs . Inspector Aristide Rosemont says the gangs have been looting and stealing . Local people in the area confirm this - and women say they have been raped by gang members . The police chief would n't say who he was appealing to for help , but his plea is clearly aimed at , first , the US troops who have just arrived here , and , second , the UN forces that have been stationed in Haiti for several years . At least 75,000 bodies have so far been buried in mass graves , Haiti 's government has said . Many more remain uncollected in the streets . At least 122 people have been saved by international search-and-rescue teams , according to the US government , but hopes are now fading that anyone will be found alive underneath the rubble . A Florida-based team is reported to have left , along with others from Luxembourg and the UK . `` You have to be realistic and , after nine days , reality says it is more difficult to find people alive . But it 's not impossible , '' said Chilean Army Major Rodrigo Vasquez at the site of the collapsed Montana Hotel . Even as the aid operation remains the focus of events in Haiti , a leading UK medical journal has issued a sharp critique of the way aid agencies have been operating . In an editorial , The Lancet says many of the international aid agencies operating in Haiti might be doing more harm than good by promoting themselves rather than working for the common humanitarian goal . The Lancet says the aid industry has become too obsessed with media campaigns , despite past mistakes during the response to the Asian tsunami five years ago . Lancet editor , Dr Richard Horton , told the BBC there was no effective common leadership of humanitarian workers in Haiti , as many non-governmental organizations were competing against each other . At least 500,000 people are currently living outdoors in 447 improvised camps in Port-au-Prince , according to the International Organisation for Migration -LRB- IOM -RRB- . Tents will not work in May when the long rainy season begins and later when hurricane season starts , but at this point there is not much choice Vincent Houver , International Organisation for Migration Of the 350 settlements assessed by the IOM , its partners and the Haitian government , only 179 had improvised shelter material and tents , and only three had access to potable water , the IOM said . The Geneva-based UN body said it was distributing tents , blankets and plastic sheeting provided by the US , Japan and Turkey , but warned that more permanent shelter would soon be needed . `` Tents will not work in May when the long rainy season begins and later when hurricane season starts , but at this point there is not much choice , '' said IOM Chief of Mission Vincent Houver . `` Assessments must take place and best construction methods and durable materials need to be discussed , '' he added . In a bid to deliver greater quantities of aid , the US military is now operating at four airports in the area - Port-au-Prince and Jacmel in Haiti , and San Isidro and Barahona in the neighbouring Dominican Republic . Bill Clinton and Ban Ki-moon have spoken of their long-term commitment to Haiti The head of the US Southern Command , Gen Douglas Fraser , said 1,400 flights were on a waiting list for landing slots at Port-au-Prince 's airport , which can handle 120 to 140 flights a day . The airport , which is under US military control , has only one 2,900 m -LRB- 9,600 ft -RRB- runway . The US military is currently giving the `` highest priority '' to shipments of water donations to help meet the `` overwhelming '' need for water . Medecins Sans Frontieres -LRB- MSF -RRB- has said five of its planes carrying a total of 77 tonnes of medical and relief supplies have been turned away in the past week . Only one has been able to land . Security concerns are also limiting the delivery of aid by road from the Dominican Republic . The BBC 's Gary Duffy , who is at the border with Haiti , says only two convoys guarded by UN troops are entering Haiti each day .

The auction kicked off at 0900 GMT on Friday and will run for 10 days . Chris Martin added : `` I visited Haiti with Oxfam a few years ago . It 's a country of extreme poverty and brutal living conditions . Most people in Port-au-Prince live in tin shacks . `` The earthquake that has struck Haiti will have turned the city into an unimaginable hell . '' An estimated 1.5 million people were left homeless by the 7.0-magnitude quake , which is believed to killed as many as 200,000 . At least 75,000 bodies have so far been buried in mass graves , the government has said . Many more remain uncollected in the streets .

Citizens turned to a range of networking tools in a bid to share the news and personal stories from microblogging on Twitter and video-sharing on YouTube to the internet telephone application Skype , and the social media site Facebook . For over 24 hours after the quake , countless reports and images came not only from big , established news organizations but from ordinary people on the spot . New platforms feed traditional media Phone lines and the power supply are down regularly in Haiti Traditional news media , such as national TV channels and newspapers , accepted the mass of material as vital in delivering the story in its early stages in the context of a severely damaged communications and transport infrastructure , chronic power failure , and extensive damage to key buildings in the capital . Leading US news outlets such as CNN , the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times were busy aggregating , sorting and presenting citizen-generated content from an early stage to paint a picture of the start of a humanitarian catastrophe . However , aid agencies , charities and others pointed out that while news was being broken and getting out of the country via new and emerging media , such platforms were often unable to provide practical assistance to victims . As major news organizations published quotes from officials on what had happened , eyewitness accounts were being posted to Twitter News of the earthquake was broken by the US Geological Survey Department which said that a temblor measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale had hit Haiti at 16:53 local time . The report was picked up a few minutes later as an urgent item by international news agencies with the usual rider of no further details being `` immediately available '' . Australia 's Sydney Morning Herald reported : `` As phone lines went down and darkness fell over Haiti , the full impact of today 's massive earthquake was difficult to know . But as with many recent natural disasters and emergencies , the extent of the chaos in the impoverished Caribbean island emerged quickly online ... As major news organizations published quotes from officials on what had happened , eyewitness accounts were being posted to Twitter . '' Haitian Fredo Dupoux posted one of the first recorded tweets at 17:00 local time . `` Oh shiet -LRB- sic -RRB- heavy earthquake right now ! In Haiti '' , along with tweeter FutureHaiti who said `` Earthquake 7 Richter scale just happening #Haiti . '' hope all are ok Richard Morse - @RAMHaiti tweets from his hotel Foreign journalistic resources were thin on the ground when the quake struck in Haiti , often described as the poorest country in the Western hemisphere . The only full-time correspondent was a reporter for the US Associated Press news agency . The rest were local stringers and staff . Richard Morse , a musician who runs the Oloffson Hotel , an iconic building made famous as the Trianon in Graham Greene 's novel The Comedians , reported on 12 January that his hotel was still standing . `` We 're ok at the oloffson . hope all are ok . a lot of big buildings in PAP are down '' . Haitian radio and TV host Carel Pedre was among the more prominent voices tweeting in the early hours following the quake . He tweeted at 19:00 . `` If U need to To get in Touch with friends and family in Haiti . Send me a Private Message with names and phone numbers . I 'll get Back to U ! '' Troy Livesay , a US missionary , blogger and tweeter who lives in Haiti , posted some of the most moving tweets in a constantly updating flow of information . At 1209 a.m. on 13 January he tweeted `` Church groups are singing throughout the city all through the night in prayer . It is a beautiful sound in the middle of a horrible tragedy . '' The Twitter community in fact provided much of the early information on the crisis in the existence of what the Columbia Journalism Review called `` the Haitian news vacuum '' . The Los Angeles Times quickly created a list of Twitter users believed to be tweeting from Haiti and the New York Times blog The Lede began regularly updating a post with news about the quake . The Lede 's editor said that `` Any readers who are in Haiti or in touch with people there are encouraged to use the comment thread below to share first-hand accounts with us '' . We immediately moved someone supervising social media and our iReports to the Haiti desk Nick Wrenn , CNN International Digital Services Footage from YouTube , the hugely popular video-sharing site owned by Google , was used extensively by TV channels across the world in the immediate aftermath of the quake , in the absence of material from the main TV news agencies APTN and Reuters TV , and from individual broadcasters . A YouTube video at around 22:00 local time on 12 January from the American Red Cross appeared to be the first upload of news of the disaster . Night fell shortly after the quake struck , plunging Port-au-Prince into darkness , but after daybreak on 13 January hundreds of videos were being uploaded , some presenting harrowing pictures of dead and injured victims and others showing the extent of the devastation wreaked by the disaster . Broadcasters from around the world used this citizen-generated material in bulletins and rolling news programs , dramatically underlining the coming of age of new and emerging media as powerful news tools . The broadcaster with the most material on the quake from such sources appeared to be CNN . Video reports from citizen journalists come into the CNN iReport desk where they are vetted for verifiability by editorial staff . Around two years ago , the iReport section of CNN 's website , where people can upload video material and contact details , became a usable source for CNN when vetting procedures were put into place . Nick Wrenn , of CNN International Digital Services said `` We immediately moved someone supervising social media and our iReports to the Haiti desk '' . On 13 January , CNN 's iReport had 1.4 m page views , a 240 % increase over the last high recorded last year . Along with other tweeters , Carel Pedre was also sending digital citizen photos of the destruction caused by the quake . Many of the images were graphic and disturbing , and appeared in mainstream newspapers and on TV channels shortly afterwards . People in Haiti uploaded images to the Yahoo-owned Flickr photo-sharing site , for example employees of a US-based NGO in Haiti ; a missionary in Archaie , Haiti ; and an internet company operator in Haiti . However , difficulties exist and care must be taken in identifying user-generated content , as many users also upload agency images to their photo-streams . Ansel Herz , an independent journalist on Skype By 13 January , the day after the quake , international news media were still struggling to enter Port-au-Prince . But Skype , a software application that allows users to make voice calls over the internet , had by then been used to great effect to get urgent news out of Haiti . Via Skype , the BBC spoke to Ansel Herz , an independent journalist who had been in Petionville . He told the BBC that an aftershock was happening as he spoke , and that `` many multi-storey buildings had fallen '' . There was `` devastation everywhere , '' he said . `` People are coming together and helping others survive , '' he said , adding that `` not a lot in the way of help was coming from the authorities and the peacekeepers '' . He told how he witnessed rescue efforts with pickaxes at the partially collapsed cathedral building , and how for people who were already poor `` it was difficult to describe the problems facing them '' . Every minute , people have been posting more than 1,500 status updates on Facebook that contained the word ` Haiti ' Randi Zuckerberg , who manages non-profit initiatives for Facebook , on 14 January described in a post on the Facebook corporate blog how the Haiti quake had emphasised the internet 's critical role in `` connecting the world 's population in times of tragedy '' . The social media site quickly launched a `` Global Relief on Facebook '' page where the more than 350 million people who use the service can `` educate themselves and find out how to help not only in Haiti but wherever disaster and misfortune may strike '' . Zuckerberg added that moments after the quake struck , people around the world immediately sought to help with relief efforts and express their solidarity with the victims . `` Every minute , people have been posting more than 1,500 status updates on Facebook that contained the word ` Haiti ' . '' `` People have contributed thousands of dollars through the Causes application on Facebook , and groups including the American Red Cross , Oxfam America and Partners in Health have mobilised supporters through their Facebook pages and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in the last 24 hours alone , '' he said in the post . Along with its social networking functions , it is known that Facebook is also widely used as a primary news source by younger users . Videos were uploaded and shared and celebrities tweeted and spread the word While mainstream news organizations are now using social networking sites for news and information , technology and social media are being utilised more frequently in coping with the aftermath of natural disasters . Friends and relatives of victims searched for information using media tools like Twitter , Facebook , Skype , Flickr and YouTube for information and assistance . Texting , Facebook and Twitter campaigns kicked in to support the relief effort in the first hours of the crisis . The social networking sites played a key role in mass mobilisation and raising millions of dollars . Writing on the suite101 . com website , Jace Shoemaker-Galloway noted `` thousands of tweets , retweets and TwitPics were shared and viewed as the disaster unfolded . Videos were uploaded and shared and celebrities tweeted and spread the word '' . By 15 January , Haitian musician Wyclef Jean had raised over US$ 1m for quake victims through his Yele Haiti foundation . However , reports inevitably came in of cyber scammers preying on popular generosity and compassion with bogus appeals aimed at enriching only themselves . Text messaging campaigns facilitate the relief effort by enabling people to contribute financially in a simple way . For example , Text HAITI to 90999 is a mobile phone fundraising initiative supported by the US State Department . People can make a donation to the Red Cross by sending a simple text message Millions of dollars have now reached the Red Cross , breaking records for a mobile giving campaign . the world owes a measure of debt to new media platforms - which will undoubtedly continue to play an important role in Haiti in the days and months to come Curtis Barnard , Columbia Journalism Review blog Noting how mainstream media were relying on social networks to fill the gaps , US blog Gawker in the early stages of the crisis acknowledged the value of `` crowd sourcing '' in covering `` chaotic breaking news like this '' . But it added : `` the true extent of the damage will not likely be known until news organizations get reporters on the ground - and off Facebook '' . And the dangers of using instant unchecked information were illustrated by footage that appeared of an earlier earthquake in Japan that purported to be from Haiti but obviously was not . But Curtis Barnard , writing in the Columbia Journalism Review blog , said that nevertheless `` the world owes a measure of debt to new media platforms - which will undoubtedly continue to play an important role in Haiti in the days and months to come - for their assistance in facilitating the early response to this disaster '' .

Below are some of the main ongoing logistical challenges . Rescue teams from 17 countries , including France , are on the ground Port-au-Prince 's small international airport has struggled to cope with the number of aid flights arriving in response to the earthquake . Within days , the Haitian government formally put the airport 's operation in US hands and Washington has established a temporary air traffic management system for flights . The airport has only one runway and standing room for 18 aircraft at a time , so planes arriving with aid have been delayed while those on the ground are unloaded . However , the UN says some 150 aircraft are landing every day . The US and Canadian military recently contributed equipment to speed up the unloading process but lack of transport and fuel has made it difficult to move goods to other locations . The main airport in neighbouring Dominican Republic quickly became congested as it supported an alternative route for aid . But US Southern Command says aid flights have started landing at airfields in Jacmel , southern Haiti , and San Isidro and Barahona airports in the Dominican Republic . The port has suffered severe damage The main port in Port-au-Prince was closed after severe damage to the docks and the one major crane at the facility . Some initial aid shipments were diverted to Cap Haitien port . On 16 January , the first ship finally docked at Port-au-Prince , carrying a cargo of bananas and coal , and the port is now considered functional . US engineers and dive teams are restoring piers , cranes , and buildings , as well as clearing debris at the port . The UN says the port should be able to receive 350 containers a day as of 25 January , an increase from the present daily capacity of 250 containers . The port at Jacmel in the south of Haiti is operational for small ships . Saint Marc and Gonaives ports are reported to be open but their capacity is not yet clear , the UN says . The US aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson has arrived off Haiti carrying 19 helicopters . It will serve as a `` floating airport '' for relief operations . The US has also sent three amphibious assault ships and several Coast Guard cutters . Some roads are impassable - either as a direct result of earthquake damage , or because they are blocked by rubble or smashed vehicles . Some aid agencies have been unable to get to their warehouses . Roads to the neighbouring Dominican Republic , though damaged , are open and the best option for the majority of incoming cargo . The UN peacekeeping mission -LRB- Minustah -RRB- , which has around 3,000 troops and police in and around Port-au-Prince , is working to clear some of the major roads . Road access between Port-au-Prince and Leogane - two of the worst affected areas - is reported to be good . But key routes that are open are becoming congested with the movement of people and supplies . The UN says the security situation is stable with a few reports of scuffles , looting and gunshots . Some rescue crews said they were forced to stop work at nightfall because of security concerns . Responsibility for maintaining law and order in the capital now rests with the UN mission 's international troops and police . Haiti has no army and its police force has all but collapsed in the aftermath of the earthquake . UN troops are providing military escort for UN agencies delivering aid and international NGOs have been advised to travel with escorts . The US , which has sent thousands of troops to help the relief effort , is providing additional capacity at the request of the UN . Between 500,000 and 700,000 people are believed to have been left homeless as a result of the earthquake , according to the UN 's latest estimates . More than 500 makeshift camps have been identified by the Haitian government , which has requested large tents to set up reception centres for the homeless . Agencies have assessed 350 sites , which currently accommodate around 472,000 people . However , only six of these sites have access to water sources . The Haitian government has identified six sites for camps outside of the city , such as land near Croix des Bouquets , and has suggested that these camps should be for 20,000 people each . Even before the earthquake only half of Haitians had access to clean water . Now most of the remaining water supply been cut off . Agencies have been working to provide water and sanitation to as many people as possible . On 20 January , 755,000 litres of water were provided to 151,000 people as well as 7,000 bottles of water to hospitals , orphan centres and a police station . The ICRC is providing clean water for more than 12,000 homeless people living in three camps . The UN is particularly concerned about the situation in Cite Soleil , one of the capital 's poorest neighborhoods , where there is an acute shortage of water . Some bottled water is being brought from the Dominican Republic but far more supplies or purification kits are needed . The USS Carl Vinson , docked off Haiti , is fitted with water-purifying equipment that can make 400,000 US gallons -LRB- 1.5 m litres -RRB- of drinking water a day . Other countries have sent mobile water purification units , which can convert contaminated water from wells and streams into drinking water . The UN has set up a `` Food Aid Cluster '' to meet the needs of two million hungry people . The World Food Programme -LRB- WFP -RRB- has four fully operational distribution sites - in Champs de Mars , Petionville Club and two sites in Delmas and the number of sites is expected to increase . WFP has provided around three million meals to more than 200,000 people since the start of the emergency response - each person getting a five-day ration . Most were distributed in the Port-au-Prince area , but also in Jacmel , Leogane , Jeremie , Bainet and Gonaives . The UN says the aim is to distribute 10 million meals over the next week , reaching 100,000 people a day . One thousand metric tons of ready-to-eat meals will arrive in Port-au-Prince on 27 January . Seven US military helicopters are being used to support aid distributions in areas around the capital . The leading US general in Haiti has said it is a `` reasonable assumption '' that up to 200,000 people could have died in last Tuesday 's earthquake . Lt Gen Ken Keen said the disaster was of `` epic proportions '' , but it was `` too early to know '' the full human cost . The disposal of dead bodies has been a key priority for the relief effort . The bodies of thousands of victims have been piling up in the streets and outside hospitals . Many more remain trapped beneath rubble . More than 80,000 dead people are reported to have been buried , many of them in mass graves . The presidential palace , the parliament and many government buildings have collapsed , hampering an already weak central government . UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says the agency is co-ordinating relief work with Haitian President Rene Preval , and that government agencies , including the police services , are now regrouping . Mr Preval has increased the number of working groups and is designating official group leaders who will liaise with the UN . An information hub has also been set up at Judicial Police headquarters in Port-au-Prince . The UN mission has set up an operations center at the airport to co-ordinate the work of around 26 international search and rescue teams . It says no more urban rescue teams are appropriate at this stage . Several relief agencies ' offices , including the UN 's , are damaged and their staff dead or missing . Co-ordination efforts are also being hampered by frequent power cuts and communications outages . The US naval ship Comfort is a fully-equipped `` floating hospital '' UN health specialists say at least eight hospitals or health centres in the capital collapsed or suffered severe damage . Most public and private hospitals still standing were stretched to the limit in the immediate aftermath , with not enough staff to handle the hundreds of wounded waiting at their gates , the Red Cross said . Many of the injuries have been appalling . International surgeons have been carrying out an average of about 50 amputations a day . Field hospitals have been set up by teams from Russia , Israel , Colombia , Jordan and Brazil - including some with resources to perform neurological , orthopaedic , maxial-facial and general surgery . Helicopters have also been ferrying the wounded to hospitals in nearby countries . The US hospital ship , USNS Comfort , with 500 medical personnel and 250 beds onboard , arrived in Port-au-Prince harbor on 20 January and has treated more than 230 people .

Interior Minister Paul Antoine Bien-Aime said 100,000 people would initially be sent to 10 settlements near the suburb of Croix Des Bouquets . He gave no timeframe , but said the moves would start as soon as possible . An estimated 1.5 million people were left homeless by the 7.0-magnitude quake , which killed as many as 200,000 . At least 75,000 bodies have so far been buried in mass graves , the government has said . Many more remain uncollected in the streets . At least 122 people have been saved by international search-and-rescue teams , according to the US government , but hopes are now fading that anyone will be found alive underneath the rubble . A Florida-based team is reported to have left , along with others from Belgium , Luxembourg and the UK . `` You have to be realistic and after nine days , reality says it is more difficult to find people alive . But it 's not impossible , '' said Chilean Army Major Rodrigo Vasquez at the site of the collapsed Montana Hotel . On Thursday , Mr Bien-Aime said public buses had already been sent out to take survivors in Port-au-Prince to the south and north of the country , where tented settlements able to accommodate 10,000 people each would eventually be built . Tents will not work in May when the long rainy season begins and later when hurricane season starts , but at this point there is not much choice Vincent Houver , International Organisation for Migration `` The government has made available to people free transportation . A large operation is taking place , '' he told reporters . At least 500,000 people are currently living outdoors in 447 improvised camps in Port-au-Prince , according to the International Organisation for Migration -LRB- IOM -RRB- . Of the 350 settlements assessed by the IOM , its partners and the Haitian government , only 179 had improvised shelter material and tents , and only three had access to potable water , the IOM said . The Geneva-based UN body said it was distributing tents , blankets and plastic sheeting provided by the US , Japan and Turkey , but warned that more permanent shelter would soon be needed . `` Tents will not work in May when the long rainy season begins and later when hurricane season starts , but at this point there is not much choice , '' said IOM Chief of Mission Vincent Houver . `` Assessments must take place and best construction methods and durable materials need to be discussed , '' he added . In a bid to deliver greater quantities of aid , the US military is now operating at four airports in the area - Port-au-Prince and Jacmel in Haiti , and San Isidro and Barahona in the neighbouring Dominican Republic . Ban Ki-moon and Bill Clinton have spoken of their long-term commitment to Haiti The head of the US Southern Command , Gen Douglas Fraser , said 1,400 flights were on a waiting list for landing slots at Port-au-Prince 's airport , which can handle 120 to 140 flights a day . The airport , which is under US military control , has only one 2,900 m -LRB- 9,600 ft -RRB- runway . The US military is currently giving the `` highest priority '' to shipments of water donations to help meet the `` overwhelming '' need for water . Medecins Sans Frontieres -LRB- MSF -RRB- has said five of its planes carrying a total of 77 tonnes of medical and relief supplies have been turned away in the past week . Only one has been able to land . The US Coast Guard has meanwhile partially reopened the capital 's main sea port , which should improve the rate at which aid supplies get into Haiti . Four vessels had docked by Thursday evening . Mark Doyle , BBC News , Port-au-Prince Everywhere you go , you see people scrabbling in the rubble . Many are salvaging corrugated iron and curtains , which are being used to get a semblance of privacy as they live on the streets and also some shelter from the boiling sun . On the edge of the rubble , those with goods to sell are setting up tables with small stocks of tinned milk , matches and soap . A few shops have opened their doors again , and in the main market there are cabbages , carrots and charcoal for sale . But prices have rocketed because of the limited supplies . And since even the few people who have jobs have seen their workplaces destroyed , many can not afford to fill their stomachs . Much of the port was destroyed by the earthquake , but engineers have decided some parts of one pier are strong enough to handle limited amounts of cargo . However , correspondents say the aid that has so far arrived at the port is being driven for 45 minutes across the city to the airport , where it is piling up and not being distributed to those who need it . Security concerns are also limiting the delivery of aid by road from the Dominican Republic . The BBC 's Gary Duffy , who is at the border with Haiti , says only two convoys guarded by UN troops are entering Haiti each day . The US and the UN World Food Programme insist the distribution of food and water is well under way , but the BBC 's Adam Mynott in Port-au-Prince says many people have still seen no international relief at all . An official from the mayor 's office in the suburb of Petionville said he understood the logistics involved in distributing aid had slowed the process down , but warned that many people were now very hungry and increasingly angry . Some shops and markets have re-opened in the capital , although a BBC correspondent says food prices have risen sharply , so many people can not afford to buy anything . Eighteen hospitals and emergency medical facilities are now operating in Port-au-Prince , but doctors are warning that many survivors have wounds that have gone untreated for nine days , putting them at risk of infection and disease . Desperate Haitians battle to get sacks of food from an aid truck The World Bank has meanwhile announced that it is waiving any payments on Haiti 's debt for the next five years and trying to find a way to cancel it altogether . Haiti owes the institution $ 38m -LRB- # 23m -RRB- . A temporary branch of the Central Bank of Haiti -LRB- RBH -RRB- was opened on Thursday in the offices of a construction company in Port-au-Prince . Hundreds of people queued to withdraw cash for the first time since the earthquake , under extremely tight security .

With an estimated 200,000 dead , a million and half displaced and an entire infrastructure flattened , it 's not hard to see why the earthquake in Haiti earns that tragic description . But what has it been like for broadcasters like the BBC World Service attempting to provide a `` lifeline '' service for those in Haiti ? This is a situation where the normal principles of journalism are challenged because the role of broadcasters becomes more than just one of simply observing and documenting . This has certainly been the experience of the BBC Caribbean unit which is providing extra programming for audiences in Haiti , in different languages . This week the unit 's head , Debbie Ransome , tells Over To You how it has reacted to the events of the past ten days or so and how it has balanced the role of news gathering with a desire to ease the suffering . It has often been the case that a BBC reporter has reached a devastated area before the aid agencies - so what then is the first responsibility of that individual ? Listen if you can to this fascinating insight from Debbie on this week 's program . And still on Haiti , listener Francis Noel from Trinidad and Tobago contacted us to query the tone of some of the news reporting - in particular , references in the coverage to `` looting '' and `` lawlessness '' in the aftermath of the earthquake . He is not alone - the head of the UN mission in Haiti , Edmond Mulet has been critical of the concentration on relatively few looting incidents , and described coverage of these as `` exaggerated '' . It all reminds me of the comment from rapper and producer , Kanye West about the reporting of Hurricane Katrina , more than four years ago . `` I hate the way they portray us in the media , '' he said . `` If you see a black family , it says they 're looting . See a white family and they are looking for food . '' We are planning to discuss the BBC 's coverage of Haiti with a senior newsroom executive on a future program , so if you have any thoughts or comments , make sure you let us have them . And also in this week 's program , Over To You 's producer , Cathy Packe , goes to the British Museum and takes a look behind the scenes of the making of a major new World Service series entitled `` A History of the World in 100 Objects . '' She told me how JD Hill , one of the senior curators involved in the programs , gave her a piece of rock to hold . It turned out to be a stone chopping tool , and was nearly two million years old - and as she inspected it more closely she could make out its multi-functional , albeit basic , design .

'' That is the news from relief worker Sarah Dellor , who is stationed in Haiti providing aid after the earthquake which hit on 12 January . `` The critical needs are food , water and fuel . People are sleeping out in the open , '' she told BBC Radio Berkshire . Sarah is stationed in the capital Port-au-Prince with the charity Tearfund . `` Tents still need to come through . In a nearby church garden , 125 orphans from a orphanage nearby are staying on the grass , in cots still out in the open , although tents did arrive yesterday . '' Sarah is the East and Central Africa disaster management officer for Tearfund - a relief and development charity - which sent a team out to Haiti on 17 January . The Red Cross estimates that up to 50,000 people were killed and three million people affected by the earthquake , which hit 7.0 on the Richter Scale . Sarah was in Haiti on 20 January when an aftershock hit , measuring 6.1 on the Richter Scale . `` It was at 6am in the morning so most people were still asleep , '' Sarah said . `` We were sleeping in tents and it was pretty scary because it was our first night here . `` To get woken up , when you 're still asleep , it takes a couple of seconds to register what is happening . `` There was an awful lot of noise because people were screaming - we just tried to get out of our tents quick enough to be safe . `` Fortunately where we are staying , there are not many buildings around . We were fairly safe . Many people live in poorly constructed houses on hills in Haiti `` It was quite quick , about 10 seconds . You could see the trauma of people . You could see the panic . `` Obviously people who had experienced the big earthquake last week - all the trauma comes flooding back . There were real moments of panic . `` More buildings collapsed as well and I heard of an orphanage nearby where hundreds of children died yesterday . `` The structures which had become unsafe in the big earthquake were so fragile , now further damage has been done . '' Sarah , who is from the west Berkshire village of Woolhampton , has been in earthquakes in Indonesia during the Tsunami , but said the tremors in Haiti were still scary . `` I immediately knew what it was so I could quickly get out . But it was pretty scary . Last night there were several small tremors . `` I was awake quite a lot last night anyway because there were quite a lot of gun shots , the noise of the helicopters and planes going over and just because everyone is sleeping outside there is so much noise . '' Sarah explained that many people in Haiti were frightened and panicked . `` Fear is the big thing in terms of aftershocks . People are too scared to go back in the houses and because the houses are unstable anyway , it 's good they are not sleeping inside , but the trauma of the earthquake is there and the panic which so immediately sets in , is horrible . '' The lack of basic amenities is still a big problem and aid is still very much needed . `` Food and water are still a big priority and fuel is hampering all operations because they are trying to get it to the people , '' Sarah said . The Red Cross estimates that up to 50,000 have been killed `` Once we can get some fuel then that 's going to help the situation enormously . `` Tents are a big issue . It has n't rained here since the earthquake which is amazing because it normally does rain here . `` There are about one million to 1.5 million people sleeping outside at the moment , if it rains , the situation is just going to be another disaster because of the spread of disease . `` There 's so much rubbish on the streets and obviously there is no sanitation at all , so if it rains , the sanitation situation is going to deteriorate very quickly .

Insp Aristide Rosemont , of the Cite Soleil slum area , told the BBC a large number of gangs had begun robbing and looting since the prison escape . Correspondents say security fears have slowed aid distribution in some areas . But despite problems in Cite Soleil , UN officials say the capital is largely calm , with only sporadic violence . Christian Fraser , BBC News , Jacmel The aid operation is finally beginning to reach the more remote parts of Haiti . Until recent days , the town of Jacmel had been largely isolated , with roads impassable and the focus of the operation fixed mainly on Port-au-Prince . In Jacmel , the football stadium is home to some 6,000 people . The field is a sea of plastic sheeting . One in three buildings in this old colonial town is in ruins ; all will need to be demolished . At the hospital the injured are lying in the garden waiting for painkillers , doctors and some glimpse of salvation . But it is slow to come . In the past few days , though , the joint task force has opened the airfield and is flying continuous shuttles from Port-au-Prince , relieving the pressure . But the needs here are great , as indeed they are across the rest of the country . There was at least one further strong aftershock on Friday , but no reports of resulting damage , injury or panic . The US ambassador to Haiti , Kenneth Merten , told US broadcaster PBS that `` people should be aware that the vast majority of Haitians here are behaving in a calm and peaceful manner '' . However , an adviser for the UN children 's fund Unicef raised concerns about possible child trafficking , which he said had been a problem before the earthquake . `` We have documented let 's say around 15 cases of children disappearing from hospitals and not with their own family at the time , '' said Jean Luc Legrand . Unicef 's headquarters in Geneva has not confirmed this report . About 5,000 prisoners broke out of the capital 's main jail after the walls collapsed . The BBC 's Mark Doyle in Port-au-Prince says several hundred of those on the run are thought to be hardened offenders belonging to Haiti 's violent and sometimes powerful criminal gangs . Insp Rosemont said that since the mass escape , the gangs had been looting and stealing in Cite Soleil - historically a troubled area . Local people confirm this and women say they have been raped by gang members , our correspondent reports . `` They are armed - with M-14s , with 65s and hand-guns , '' Insp Rosemont said . `` We were expecting the arrival of equipment to reinforce us . I need all types of help from the international community . '' Our correspondent adds that his plea is clearly aimed at the US troops who have just arrived in Haiti and the UN forces that have been stationed in the country for several years . Efforts to get relief supplies to the millions in need in Haiti continue , as search and rescue operations are scaled back . An estimated 1.5 million people were left homeless by the 7.0-magnitude quake , which some have estimated has killed as many as 200,000 people . Elisabeth Byrs , spokeswoman for the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs , told AFP news agency that some search and rescue teams were now starting to leave , as hopes of finding survivors fade . Those that remain `` are concentrating more and more on humanitarian aid for those who need it '' , she said . Some 122 people have been saved by international search and rescue teams , according to the US government . International efforts to get aid to Haitians continue At least 75,000 bodies have so far been buried in mass graves , Haiti 's government has said . Many more remain uncollected in the streets . Normal life is showing some signs of returning , with small grocery shops , barbers ' and pharmacies reopening in Port-au-Prince . Some banks are expected to reopen over the weekend . Meanwhile , efforts to rebuild Haiti 's main seaport - seen as vital to the international aid effort - are being stepped up . Engineers have decided some parts of one pier are strong enough to handle limited amounts of cargo , but the port will be running at only 10 % capacity and distribution of supplies remains slow . Four vessels had docked by Thursday evening and US military divers were to start repair work to the pier on Friday . In a bid to deliver greater quantities of aid , the US military is now operating at four airports in the region . But even as the aid operation remains the focus of events in Haiti , a leading UK medical journal has issued a sharp critique of the way aid agencies have been operating . We do not recognize the picture of the aid response in Haiti painted by the Lancet But Brendan Gormley , chief executive of the UK Disasters Emergency Committee -LRB- DEC -RRB- , a UK-based umbrella group of 13 major aid agencies , rejected that view . `` We do not recognize the picture of the aid response in Haiti painted by the Lancet , '' he said . `` The Lancet editorial fails to take into account the huge efforts by dedicated staff and volunteers - both Haitians and international experts - who are working tirelessly to bring help to earthquake survivors . The US and the UN World Food Programme insist the distribution of food and water is well under way , but BBC correspondents in Port-au-Prince say many people have still seen no international aid at all . At least 500,000 people are currently living outdoors in 447 improvised camps in Port-au-Prince , according to the International Organisation for Migration -LRB- IOM -RRB- , with limited shelter and access to water . Western countries are hoping to boost donations for the aid effort with a multi-network telethon on Friday night and Saturday morning .

Some residents expressed fears that dropping food on the central reservation now used by those whose homes had been destroyed might kill people . Medical treatment is available in the neighborhood , and a hospital is treating those injured in the quake . As we try to get in we are followed by a couple of guys just trying to get past the crowds of people outside . People have been receiving medical treatment , but supplies are low Security stops them and there is a heated argument , but it is resolved quickly . As we enter , a hand painted sign with an AK-47 on a white background with a red `` X '' through it is a reminder of what life was like here before the quake . For now , doctors are treating wounds that should have already have begun healing . The lack of medical supplies means that as I walk round I see lots of amputations - crush injuries not treated , leading to infection and loss . A young woman lying on the ground next to her daughter asks me if I can help because she has no money for anything . The little girl 's lower leg is gone , cut off beneath the knee . She just stares out across a packed ward . I ask the receptionist how many people the hospital normally treats . She does not know , but she tells me they are seeing 400 patients a day . It is like a revolving door of pain in Cite Soleil . The sound of the latest humanitarian mission can be heard overhead as yet another chopper flies by , whilst on the ground `` Sun City '' remains in the dark .

It is also available on satellite and online , and via social media . Any radio station in Haiti also has free and unlimited access to the programs . The show focuses on practical information and public health advice . The aim is to provide a lifeline to the survivors of the tragedy and to try to bring information about missing people . This is the first time the BBC is broadcasting in Creole , Haiti 's national language . Preparations for the new BBC Creole service launch The earthquake has seriously disrupted the country 's communication system , leaving millions of Haitians without crucial information about aid efforts . Local radio stations have been doing their best to get news bulletins on air , report on the catastrophe and help families to locate relatives . Radio has always been the most popular form of media in Haiti , the poorest country in the Americas . Even stations that did not suffer serious earthquake damage are now having problems keeping their programs on air , because they ca n't get enough fuel for their generators . The lack of information is of serious concern to the UN , and the national government , and is a major obstacle for the aid operation in the country . A significant part of the population still lacks information about where to get help and support . The new BBC program is being produced in Miami by a multilingual team assembled especially for this task . The daily program is broadcast between 0910 and 0930 Haiti time -LRB- 1410 to 1430 GMT -RRB- on six FM relays on the island : Port-au-Prince 89.3 FM ; Cap-Hatien 105.5 FM ; Gonaves 90.5 FM ; Las Cayes 106.9 FM ; Jacmel 96.9 FM ; and Jrmie 92.7 FM .

Fireman William Howells said he pulled a woman out of the rubble who was clinging to her dead baby and also managed to save a two-year-old girl . He said : `` It was difficult to keep the tears from coming down the face , you were sort of biting your lip . '' As many as 200,000 people were killed and two million made homeless following the quake on 12 January . Mr Howells , from Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service , was one of about 60 UK firefighters who arrived at Gatwick airport early on Saturday morning along with other rescuers . He told the BBC : `` A two-year-old girl was crying for her mother in the rubble , and we tried several different entry points to gain access to her . Volunteer Andy Read had been on his first rescue mission `` In the end we managed to pinpoint where she was and eventually freed her . She came out with little tassels still in her hair and she was still fully clothed . `` It was quite an emotional moment . It was difficult to keep the tears from coming down the face , you were sort of biting your lip . We could have worked all night after that . '' Andy Read , from rescue charity Rapid-UK , said : `` It 's mixed emotions . We 've seen many , many sights , good and bad . I 'm just very pleased to be part of the UK response , it 's great to have made some sort of difference out there . '' The head of the charity , Clive Hodges , said his team was physically and mentally exhausted . He said : `` They rushed out there and have n't stopped working since . It 's taken them the best part of 24 hours to get back ... they were physically demanding conditions , the weather was hot and that in itself has taken its toll . The Disasters Emergency Committee is co-ordinating an appeal to help the people of Haiti There are 13 charities involved including the British Red Cross , Islamic Relief and World Vision Donate via the DEC website or by telephoning 0370 60 60 900 `` It was a hard deployment but they can be justifiably proud of what they have achieved . '' International Development Secretary Douglas Alexander said : `` We should all be proud of the brave UK firefighters who worked tirelessly to help the Haitians in difficult and dangerous conditions . '' A total of 132 people were pulled alive from the rubble , the United Nations -LRB- UN -RRB- has said . Officials said Thursday was the first day they had failed to pull anyone out alive and the operation had turned into a relief rather than a rescue mission . The rescuers from Gloucestershire-based Rapid-UK said they had done all they could to find survivors of the 7.0-magnitude quake during their deployment alongside other British and Haitian firefighters . Mr Howells described the painstaking rescue of a 39-year-old woman who was clinging to her dead two-year-old daughter . He said : `` It was a tough job for us because there was a massive slab of concrete which had steel reinforcing in it which was over her top . She was hanging on to her daughter who was alongside her , but sadly her daughter lost her life . British teams return home as the search and rescue phase in Haiti ends `` It was difficult for us to work in those conditions to free the mother from the hold she had on her daughter . '' He said it took two hours to make enough of an entry point to grab her feet and slowly pull her out of a very small opening . `` We got her on the stretcher , she had a couple of cuts and bruises and off she went to hospital . It was another good result , '' he said . The rescuers ' departure came as the Disasters Emergency Committee revealed that UK donations to its appeal for Haiti had so far reached more than # 42m . A charity single cover of REM 's Everybody Hurts featuring artists including Leona Lewis , Rod Stewart and the band JLS is also being released to raise money for the appeal . Relief workers are heading to the capital with water , food , drugs , telephones and clothing . Some supplies of aid from the UK have already been flown out to the country . One Briton is confirmed dead in the disaster , with another still missing . UN worker Frederick Wooldridge , 41 , from Kent , was the first Briton named among the dead , along with dozens of his colleagues . Another Briton , UN worker Ann Barnes , 59 and originally from Leigh-on-Sea , Essex , remains missing .

The BBC 's Anna Jones examines how people survive in the rubble - and what dictates the duration of search operations . The UN usually decides to call off search and rescue attempts between five and seven days after a disaster , once no-one has been saved for a day or two - but people have been known to survive for much longer . In 1995 , Park Seung Hyun was pulled from the wreckage of a collapsed supermarket in Seoul , South Korea , 16 days after it collapsed and in January 2004 , Shahr-Banu Mazandarani , an Iranian woman in her 90s was rescued after nine days buried in the rubble of her home after the Bam earthquake . In one extraordinary case in December 2005 , a 40-year-old woman was found buried in what had been her kitchen in Pakistan-administered Kashmir , more than two months after an earthquake hit the region . Doctors said it was a miracle that Naqsha Bibi had survived so long in a space so small she could not move . Julie Ryan , a co-ordinator with UK-based group International Rescue Committee -LRB- IRC -RRB- , says that survival largely depends on what happens the moment the quake first hits . `` The ideal situation is you have become trapped and entombed but have some sort of oxygen supply from the outside world , are not injured and also have some sort of access to water , '' she told the BBC . `` You have usually managed to get yourselves into some sort of void where you are enclosed by the building but it does n't injure you . '' She said an IRC team rescued three boys who had been buried in the ruins of their school for five days after the earthquake in Pakistan in 2005 . `` They were laid flat on backs next to each other , with the ceiling touching their noses but totally unhurt , '' she said . Another boy alongside them had died . After so long in the dark , rescue teams had to cover the boys ' eyes as they pulled them out , to protect them from the strong sunlight . Dr Tejsrhi Shah of Medecins Sans Frontieres says many of those injured in earthquakes are so badly hurt they would not reach medical care . But she says that if people are trapped , `` just the immobility will reduce your chance of survival '' . Being unable to move or having injuries to limbs can lead to crush syndrome , she says , where blood flow to the limbs is disrupted . When the crush is removed , a build-up of toxins floods the body and it is unable to cope . Mazandarani spent nine days in the rubble of her home `` It causes renal damage and shock , people are in agony with the pain and have a high risk of developing renal failure if do n't get urgent medical care , '' she said . Dr Shah says there are reports of people surviving in rubble even longer than two weeks , but such cases are `` incredibly rare '' . `` The chances of getting someone out alive decreases with each day , '' she says . Being trapped in a confined space also means a rising temperature and an increase in carbon dioxide , which , if it reaches too high a level , leads to suffocation . Search teams monitor for rising levels of CO2 in a building - a rise means someone is trapped inside and breathing . When CO2 levels stop rising , the search is no longer needed . Graham Payne , chairman and founder of rescue charity Rapid , told the BBC trapped people could go quiet for hours at a time if they passed out or fell asleep but teams never gave up on them . `` You think you 've lost them but you carry on . It might be another eight hours , then they start making noise again . `` But if they 're trapped and we can hear , then we get them out , we do n't give up . '' If you are uninjured , have an air supply and are in an adequate space - however small - the next priority is water . Dr Shah says estimating how long people can survive without water is the `` million dollar question '' , but that the average is between three and seven days . `` It depends on the ambient temperature , how much fluid you 're losing through sweat , if you have diarrhoea , how healthy you are , how old you are , '' she says . A few fortunate people may find themselves trapped with a clean supply but others will find a trickle of rainwater , condensation or even use water from inside radiators . Following the South Korean supermarket collapse , IRC rescued a man who had been trapped for 13 days - he had been drinking drops of rainwater and eating cardboard lying around him to stave off hunger . Some of those rescued in Haiti have spoken of being encouraged by hearing voices around them . But Ms Ryan says that as time goes on , knowing other people are trapped can be more upsetting than comforting . `` The man trapped in Korea was initially lying with quite a few people but one by one they all stopped talking . So psychologically , it does n't do any good . '' She says the best thing buried survivors can do is stay calm and listen , however hard that may be . `` We use sound location equipment to look for survivors , which picks up tapping . If you hear tapping , tap back , or shout , '' she says . But despite the best preparation and advice , rescuers say survival often comes down to `` sheer determination '' . `` It 's the will , '' says Mr Payne . `` Some people just accept they are trapped and it 's fate . Others just keep going .

It came hours after Haiti 's government declared a formal end to the search for survivors . Onlookers cheered as Wismond Exantus - smiling and apparently in a good condition - emerged on a stretcher from what remains of the Napoli Inn Hotel . He later told reporters that soft drinks and snacks had kept him going . It took two-and-a-half hours for the rescue of Wismond Exantus to take place . It might never have happened , had not a member of his family approached a Greek journalist on the street and said they had heard noises coming from underneath a building . The Greek journalist said he also heard the noises , and approached a Greek rescue team . They then went into operation in combination with French and American teams , and pulled the man free from the rubble . As he was gingerly put on a stretcher and carried towards a waiting ambulance , Wismond Exantus smiled . He did n't say anything but he was , if not totally unharmed , clearly in a very good state of health . `` I survived by drinking Coca-Cola and I ate some little tiny things , '' Mr Enso , who worked in the hotel 's grocery store , told news agency AFP from his bed in a French field hospital . `` Every night I thought about the revelation that I would survive , '' he was quoted as saying by the Associated Press agency . French medic Gilles Gueney said : `` It 's amazing but he has no fractures , no broken bones . He 's very dehydrated and is now on a drip . '' He added that Wismond Exantus was expected to be out of hospital `` in a day or two '' . Greek , French and US rescue teams were involved in the two-and-a-half-hour operation to bring him out of the remains of the hotel . A French rescue worker , Lt Col Christophe Renou , described his survival as `` a miracle '' . He said rescuers - who had been alerted by the man 's family - had managed to get water to him while they worked to dig him out . Lt Col Renou said the man had probably been helped by the fact that the 5-6m -LRB- 16-20ft -RRB- of debris above him was largely wood , rather than concrete . He said the man had told his rescuers that another four people were trapped with him but that they had stopped moving a couple of days earlier . The BBC 's Adam Mynott , in Port-au-Prince , says some Haitians have questioned the announcement that search-and-rescue operations are to end - and the discovery of Wismond Exantus will have lent weight to their argument . Speaking before Mr Enso 's rescue , UN spokeswoman Elizabeth Byrs in Geneva said the decision to end the search for survivors was `` heartbreaking '' but that it had been taken on the advice of experts . Emmannuel Buso , 21 - rescued after 10 days Marie Carida , 84 - saved after 10 days Mendji Bahina Sanon , 11 - trapped for eight days Lozama Hotteline , 25 - pulled out after seven days Elisabeth Joassaint , 15 days - buried for seven days , half her life Ena Zizi , 69 - rescued after seven days She said most search-and-rescue teams would now be leaving Haiti , although some with heavy lifting equipment might stay to help with the clean-up operation and with aid distribution . Two people , an 84-year-old woman and a 21-year-old man , were pulled alive from the rubble in Port-au-Prince on Friday . The woman , who was found in the wreckage of her home seriously injured and severely dehydrated , was taken to the main city hospital for treatment . The 21-year-old man , Emmannuel Buso , was rescued by an Israeli search team and is said to be in a stable condition . Speaking from his hospital bed , he described how he had had no food , and had drunk his own urine to keep thirst at bay . An estimated 1.5 million people were left homeless by the 7.0-magnitude quake , which some have estimated has killed as many as 200,000 people . At least 75,000 bodies have so far been buried in mass graves , Haiti 's government has said . Many more remain uncollected in the streets . The UN says 130,000 people have now been relocated out of Port-au-Prince , easing the pressure on overcrowded camps in the city .

Among the aid , which BA had carried free of charge , was 50 tonnes of supplies organised by Oxfam - emergency equipment paid for by the UK 's Disasters Emergency Committee 's Haiti Earthquake Appeal . The fundraising effort has already reached more than # 30m in one week . The aid , which the BBC has been tracking from Oxfordshire , was swiftly unloaded and then the process began of preparing the cargo to be transported by truck approximately 250 miles to the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince . The flight also carried supplies from the UN 's World Food Programme and Unicef . With the airport there heavily congested , road transport from the neighbouring Dominican Republic has been an important way to get aid to the Haitian people affected by the earthquake . This country is a popular tourist destination , but the airport at Santo Domingo is even busier than normal with up to 40 extra flights per day bringing aid into the country . Loading up the lorries here in the UK is straightforward but once the consignment gets to Haiti , can Oxfam be sure it will reach the people who need it ? Multiple aid agencies are involved , and around the edges of the main runway the work of loading and unloading aid is a continual process . Oxfam says that with the announcement that the search for survivors is over , the focus should be on helping the Haitian people . `` The end of search and rescue efforts does not mean we can slow down . Relief and recovery for the survivors is the priority now , '' says Mark Fried , spokesman for the relief agency . `` Hundreds of thousands who lost everything but their lives need water for drinking and washing . They need latrines to contain the spread of disease . They need shelter and simple household items like cooking pots . '' On Friday , respected medical journal The Lancet accused aid agencies and non-governmental organizations of competing against each other rather than working together . Without naming any organization , an editorial in the journal said : `` NGOs are rightly mobilising , but also jostling for position , each claiming that they are doing the most for earthquake survivors . '' However , aid workers on the ground say that claim is unjust . `` I think every organization wants to do its best to put in place the means that they need , '' says Florent Mayolle , a logistics manager with Oxfam International and who is working in the Dominican Republic . Florent Mayolle is working for Oxfam International in Dominican Republic `` That is why , maybe , you can feel a little bit of competition . But now we are forgetting about that and trying to organise ourselves in a way that there is good co-ordination . That is the most important thing for us now . '' Referring to the operation to bring in the British aid , as well as supplies from Denmark , Henrik Hansen of the World Food Programme agrees . `` In crises like this aid agencies do come together , '' he says . `` In this particular case , Oxfam requested the World Food Programme provide warehouse capacity and overland transport to Haiti - and we provided those services . '' While it was a complicated operation getting the aid organised and on a flight from Stansted to the Dominican Republic via Denmark , where it also picked up supplies , the hard part will be to ensure the aid gets to the people who need it most when it arrives in Haiti , where it was due to arrive on Sunday . This is another area where the overall relief effort in Haiti has been criticised - with claims of poor distribution and confusion - with some areas even getting too much supplies and others too little . But aid agencies point to the scale of the disaster in a country that was already lacking in infrastructure , and say the picture is slowly improving . `` People have to understand that we can not send goods if we are not able to receive it in Port-au-Prince , '' says Florent Mayolle . `` So we need first to prepare the goods in a good manner , and to send it with security and to be able to receive the goods and afterwards to distribute it properly . `` Until now we had some problem of security , we did n't have the warehouse for storage . We will not be able to send it to lie on the ground without security - it is not possible . '' The Disasters Emergency Committee is co-ordinating an appeal to help the people of Haiti There are 13 charities involved including the British Red Cross , Islamic Relief and World Vision Donate via the DEC website or by calling 0370 60 60 900 With the warehouse and transport arranged - the small convoy of trucks carrying British aid was able to set off on Saturday afternoon . Because convoys are only crossing the border twice a day due to security considerations , the drivers were waiting there overnight before completing their journey . The aid included a wide range of material , from tools that will be useful in improving sanitation to latrine slabs and water tanks . Oxfam says it is working in seven sites across the Haitian capital - trying to provide help to more than 90,000 people . For all the main agencies the process of getting supplies to Haiti has been fraught with difficulties , and in the weeks and months to come lessons may well have to be learned from the experience of the last few days . But among aid workers on the ground there also seems to be an endless amount of goodwill and determination - backed by the generosity of people in countries around the world .

This is how events unfolded after the quake - with a magnitude of 7.0 - struck at 1653 local time -LRB- 2153 GMT -RRB- on Tuesday , 12 January . International search teams continued their work to find survivors , despite the Haitian government calling an official end to the rescue phase , and were rewarded by pulling Wismond Exantus from the remains of the Napoli Inn Hotel 11 days after the quake . Greek , French and US rescue teams were involved in the two-and-a-half-hour operation to bring him out . Meanwhile , organisers of the Hope for Haiti telethon in the US said it had raised more than $ 57m -LRB- # 35m -RRB- for victims . They said Friday night 's event had set a new record for disaster relief telethons . Two people were rescued after spending 10 days under the rubble . An 84-year-old woman and 21-year-old man were pulled out alive in Port-au-Prince , but with no further signs of life reported the Haitian government declared the rescue effort over at 1600 local time -LRB- 2100 GMT -RRB- . Later a massive benefit concert was broadcast to try to raise money for victims . The two-hour Hope for Haiti telethon featured more than 100 Hollywood and music stars . The concert , which took place in New York , Los Angeles , London and Haiti , included Bono , Bruce Springsteen , Sting , Rihanna , Brad Pitt , Clint Eastwood , Julia Roberts and Leonardo DiCaprio . About 400,000 survivors will be moved to tented villages outside the capital , Port-au-Prince , with 100,000 people initially being sent to 10 settlements near the suburb of Croix Des Bouquets , Interior Minister Paul Antoine Bien-Aime announced . The International Organisation for Migration , distributing tents and plastic sheeting , warned that more permanent shelter would soon be needed by the 500,000 people living outdoors . In a bid to deliver greater quantities of aid , the US military was operating at four airports in the region - Port-au-Prince and Jacmel in Haiti , and San Isidro and Barahona in the neighbouring Dominican Republic . The US Coast Guard partially reopened the capital 's main sea port which was damaged in the quake . Four vessels had docked by Thursday evening . A strong aftershock rocked Haiti , sending screaming people running into the streets . Some buildings already weakened by last week 's quake collapsed . The magnitude 6.1 tremor struck west of Port-au-Prince at 0603 local time -LRB- 1103 GMT -RRB- . The aftershock hit as people were still being found alive in the rubble from the original quake . They included a five-year-old boy reportedly pulled from the ruins of his home by his uncle . Earlier a 10-year-old girl and her eight-year-old brother were found . More than 120 people altogether have been rescued by international teams . The US announced it was sending another 4,000 sailors and marines to Haiti for the earthquake relief effort , diverting them from deployments in the Gulf and Africa . Many victims unable to find treatment in Haiti , have crossed the border into the Dominican Republic . But the BBC 's Gary Duffy says the volume of patients is so great the hospitals there are struggling to cope . Haitian officials said the death toll from the quake was likely to be between 100,000 and 200,000 , and that 75,000 bodies had already been buried in mass graves . An estimated 1.5 million are homeless . The US presence in the country increased as Black Hawk helicopters dropped scores of troops into the grounds of the ruined presidential palace . Captain Steve McInerney : `` They do rush the aircraft which can be expected '' The UN Security Council also voted unanimously to send a further 3,500 UN troops and police to Haiti , to maintain law and order . Officials said the general security situation was stable , but the BBC 's Nick Davis in Port-au-Prince said there were concerns that looting and violence were a growing threat . Meanwhile , doctors said they were having to carry out hundreds of amputations , with only basic medical equipment , because of the large numbers of people suffering gangrene or traumatic injuries . Search and rescue teams received a boost when an apparently unharmed elderly woman , Ena Zizi , was pulled from the rubble of the capital 's Catholic cathedral , one of 90 people found alive in Haiti 's ruins so far . The BBC 's Christian Fraser said that while some markets on the road to Port-au-Prince were still open , their supplies were running low and becoming increasingly expensive . The leading US general in Haiti Lt Gen Ken Keen said it was a `` reasonable assumption '' that up to 200,000 people might have died in last Tuesday 's earthquake . UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he would recommend that the Security Council boost UN troop numbers in Haiti by 2,000 for six months , and UN police numbers by 1,500 . Bill Clinton : `` There 's no question it 's not enough , not quick enough '' Meanwhile , almost a week after the earthquake violence and looting have broken out in parts of Port-au-Prince . Police fired shots to disperse looters in parts of the capital . UN police fired baton rounds to force a crowd back from the gates of the airport . The former American President Bill Clinton , who is in Haiti as a special UN representative , said that given the circumstances , it was understandable that there had been some disorder . Thousands of people were fleeing the capital , Port-au-Prince , with many leaving for the countryside in the hope of finding food and water . The BBC 's Mark Doyle came across what is left of a poor community in the hills above the capital , to find a group of people - their homes destroyed - trying to heat up some food scraps in a pan of thin soup , their only meal of the day . First reports from the epicentre of Tuesday 's earthquake suggested the damage was even more dramatic than in the capital . BBC correspondents said the scene in Leogane was `` apocalyptic '' , with thousands left homeless and almost every building destroyed . The UN said up to 80-90 % of buildings in Leogane , about 19km -LRB- 12 miles -RRB- west of Port-au-Prince , had been destroyed . The extent of the damage in Haiti 's villages In the capital , survivors were becoming desperate as they waited for aid being handed out by international agencies . But in a sign of hope , rescuers pulled a woman alive from the rubble . `` It 's a little miracle , '' the woman 's husband , Reinhard Riedl , told the Associated Press news agency after she was rescued from a luxury hotel . The Pan American Health Organization put the death toll at 50,000-100 ,000 , while Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive said 100,000 `` would seem a minimum '' . US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , the first senior overseas politician to arrive in Haiti , said the US would be `` here today , tomorrow and for the time ahead '' , asserting that `` Haiti can come back even better and stronger in the future '' . Desperation among survivors of the earthquake led to rising fears over security in Port-au-Prince . There were some reports of gangs preying on residents and looting , and officials said thousands of prisoners were unaccounted for after the main prison was destroyed . Damage to the seaport , roads and other infrastructure still prevented the speedy distribution of food , water and medical supplies . Relief was arriving , but little had moved beyond the jammed airport . A spokeswoman for the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said aid workers were dealing with a disaster `` like no other '' in UN memory because the country had been `` decapitated '' . Interior Minister Paul Antoine Bien-Aime said 50,000 bodies had been collected , but the total number of dead could be `` between 100,000 and 200,000 '' . The UN launched an appeal for $ 562m -LRB- # 346m -RRB- intended to help three million people for six months . Many spent another day without food and shelter in the ruined capital . The BBC 's Andy Gallacher in Port-au-Prince said survivors were dying in huge numbers , and clean water , food and medical supplies were desperately needed . Shaul Schwarz , a photographer for Time magazine , told the BBC he had seen a roadblock formed with bodies of quake victims on a main road , south of the capital . He said he believed this was an `` act of anger '' on the part of people who were not getting help . Bottlenecks and infrastructure damage were said to be holding up aid efforts - with estimates of the number of dead put at as many as 45,000-50 ,000 . Dramatic stories of survival began to emerge . UK firefighters pulled two-year-old Haitian girl Mia from the rubble where she had been trapped for three days when her kindergarten totally collapsed . UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told of one UN staff member found alive beneath the rubble of the international body 's collapsed headquarters in Port-au-Prince . Estonian protection officer Tarmo Joveer , Mr Ban said , was only found after `` scratching sounds '' were heard and was kept alive by being `` given water through a rubber pipe '' . Thousands spent a second night in the open after the earthquake , as the search for survivors under the rubble went on after darkness . The first US aid planes landed at the airport serving the capital and US naval ships were on the way . EU states , Russia and China were among those sending rescue and medical teams by plane while pledges of aid were made by countries around Latin America . The BBC 's Andy Gallacher in Port-au-Prince said the situation in the capital was increasingly desperate with no sense of a co-ordinated rescue effort , scant medical supplies and aid only trickling in . Efforts to rescue survivors trapped in rubble were hampered by the lack of heavy-lifting equipment and much of the work was being done by individuals with simple tools or their hands . Officials at the UN said between 100 and 150 people from its 9,000-strong peacekeeping mission in Haiti were still missing after the earthquake . They included UN mission head Hedi Annabi of Tunisia and his chief deputy , Luis Carlos da Costa . Haitian President Rene Preval spoke of how he stepped over dead bodies and heard cries of those trapped in the parliament building . As dawn broke , the extent of the damage and the number of casualties started to become clearer . The Red Cross said up to three million people had been affected . Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive said he believed more than 100,000 people had died . Describing the earthquake as a `` catastrophe '' , Haiti 's envoy to the US said the cost of the damage could run into billions of dollars . Haitian President Rene Preval described the scene in the capital as `` unimaginable '' . `` Parliament has collapsed . The tax office has collapsed . Hospitals have collapsed , '' he said . Speaking in Washington , US President Barack Obama vowed `` unwavering support '' for Haiti after what he called a `` cruel and incomprehensible '' disaster . UN officials said at least 14 people had died when the UN 's five-storey headquarters and two smaller buildings in Port-au-Prince collapsed . Around 100 were still thought to be missing , many feared to be under the rubble . People in the capital were lifting sheets on bodies to try to identify loved ones . The quake - Haiti 's worst in two centuries - struck at 1653 -LRB- 2153 GMT -RRB- . Phone lines to the country failed shortly afterwards . The US Geological Survey said its epicentre was 15km -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- south-west of Port-au-Prince , and that it was quickly followed by two strong aftershocks of 5.9 and 5.5 magnitude . The extent of the devastation was initially unclear . In a statement issued in New York , the UN said that its local HQ in Haiti had `` sustained serious damage along with other UN installations '' and `` a large number '' of personnel were missing . Rachmani Domersant , an operations manager with the Food for the Poor charity , told Reuters : `` You have thousands of people sitting in the streets with nowhere to go . There are people running , crying , screaming . '' Bodies white with dust could be seen piled on the back of a pick-up truck as vehicles tried to ferry the injured to hospital . In the minutes after the quake , Henry Bahn , a visiting official from the US Department of Agriculture , said he had seen houses which had tumbled into a ravine . `` Everybody is just totally , totally freaked out and shaken , '' said Mr Bahn , who described the sky as `` just gray with dust '' .

I was in the fruit shop , on the ground floor . I felt that I had a very slim chance of being found . All those days I was down there knocking and yelling , and no-one heard me . As a stroke of luck from God , only yesterday my brother heard me knocking on the plywood and found me . I said , ` It 's me . I 'm under the store , ' and my brother and my friend went to get help . The rescuers came and brought tools and a saw , and that made me very happy . They were as tired as I was . They were shaking things to get me out . My mother loves me a lot , and if I had died she would have died right after me . I 'm very grateful to be alive . I pray to God to bless the rescuers . For all those days I was searching for my cellphone . I could n't move much . Then I found a case of cola , and potato chips . I stumbled across them and I said , ` OK , now I can live for one more day . ' If I 'm alive it 's because of those things . In my head I said to God , ` If you save me , I will be your servant . I will glorify your name ' . If I am alive , there are others alive . If they had given up on me , I would n't be here today . I did n't know how long I had been there . I did n't know if it was night or day . I thought I had been there for five or six days . Finally , I understood it had been 12 days . There were others trapped with me . There was the owner of the hotel , one of his sons and a cousin . There were two women on the first floor , one doing the cooking and the other doing the laundry . After the collapse I heard noise , but after a while it stopped . I was calling the people who were there , but none replied . I do n't know if they were alive . I hope that search operations will continue because a lot of people lost hope that I could survive after 12 days , and they found me . If I am alive , there are others alive . If they had given up on me , I would n't be here today . I would have been dead in two or three days . All the time I spent under the rubble , I had a splitting headache and I felt a bit stiff . The doctors gave me some pills for that , and now I feel great .

Transmission time is 9:10 to 9:30 local time -LRB- 14:10 to 14:30 GMT -RRB- . The program will be produced and edited by a BBC team in Miami . In a special post for the Over To You blog , the BBC 's Nick Miles describes the challenges he and his team have had to overcome to put out the lifeline program : It 's been an extremely swift launch of a new radio service to say the least . It was only about four days from the first ideas being jotted down on a piece of paper to the program , Connexion Haiti , going on air . But it had to be quick . The need for information in Haiti is acute and many of the local stations are still off air so Connexion Haiti is providing an important service for Haitians . When we arrived at the BBC offices here in Miami last Thursday we already knew we had two Haitian Americans living in Miami who would present the program . We also had a means of transmitting the program via six FM frequencies across Haiti . The frequencies are normally used by Radio France International for their broadcasts and they kindly stepped in to help the our program gone on air . Connexion Haiti now also goes out on short wave and can he heard via the BBC Caribbean service website . We broadcast a trial program on Friday morning to test the signal and tell people how they could listen across Haiti and what they could expect from the program . So , with some of the logistics sorted out , we then had to decide what to put in Connexion Haiti . A man listens to a radio at a refugee camp in Port-au-Prince , Haiti . Picture : Associated Press We knew this was would be a lifeline service for Haitians and we needed to provide as much up-to-the-minute information as possible about where people could find food aid , clean water , medical assistance and shelter . We pulled together that information from , among other sources , our BBC correspondents in Haiti along with the main aid organizations and the US military . We set about getting a list of people we could interview in the Haitian language , Creole . We wanted to speak to as many people as we could who were working for the relief program in Haiti to give an idea of where the new distribution points for aid were and where new field hospitals were situated . But we 've also used the interviews to broadcast appeals from the humanitarian organizations , specifically appeals for people to remain calm and to make sure they do n't block any of the the main roads that might prevent aid getting through . Connexion Haiti is also about hearing from ordinary Haitians caught up in the earthquake to find our how they 're coping and what they need . To make this happen we set up a dedicated email address for our listeners , along with a number they could text and another where they could leave recorded messages . So far the response has been encouraging . We 've received texts emails and calls from Haitians saying that they 're listening to the program . Some have told us how they survived the earthquake while sadly members of their family did not . Others have left telephone numbers so that loved ones can get in touch . Others have just emailed to say how important the service is for them because they know that the world cares about what 's happened in Haiti . We 've tried to broadcast as many of these messages as we can . The program 's only twenty minutes long , and in that short time we want to get as much crucial information to people as possible but we 've also tried to include items that show the people of Haiti that people around the world are thinking about them and taking concrete actions to help . In our first broadcast , for example , we ended the program with the music of Haitian pop star Wyclef Jean playing at an international charity concert for Haiti . He bellowed out his solidarity with his compatriots and perhaps that in some small way will give psychological boost to the people of Haiti who are living such desperate times .

'' The US effort in Haiti has also drawn criticism from some Latin American leaders . Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez criticised the US for sending too many soldiers but not enough medical supplies . John Caulfield , a US diplomat in Caracas , Venezuela , dismissed the allegations , saying Washington wanted to provide aid to the Haitian people `` and not be distracted by those political criticisms '' . Meanwhile , Haiti 's main creditors are due to meet on Monday in the Canadian city of Montreal to map out a plan for its reconstruction . UK-based charity Oxfam has urged donor countries and institutions to cancel Haiti 's foreign debts , put at about $ 900m -LRB- # 557m -RRB- .

Caroline Gluck , from Oxfam , told the BBC the move could be dangerous for the survivors . `` In the past , experience has told us establishing some huge camps can cause all kinds of security problems , for example , robberies , rapes and kind of gang activities if the camps are kept too big , '' she said . Oxfam was pressing for the camps to be smaller , she added . Earlier , Haitian communications minister Marie-Laurence Jocelyn Lassegue said authorities were still far from knowing the total number of those killed . She said the confirmed death toll had risen above 150,000 in the Port-au-Prince area alone . Haitian-born rapper Wyclef Jean , who set up the charity foundation Yele Haiti , arrived in the capital on Sunday . He was among a number of high-profile artists to take part in a `` Hope for Haiti Now '' telethon in the US on Friday which raised more than $ 57m -LRB- # 35m -RRB- for the aid effort .

Communications Minister Marie-Laurence Jocelyn Lassegue said the count was based on bodies collected in and around the capital by state company CNE . Many more bodies remain uncounted under rubble in the capital , including the towns of Jacmel and Leogane . The search for survivors has officially ended and the focus has shifted to aid . But there is disagreement about how well the aid operation is doing , with the head of Italy 's civil protection service making highly critical comments . Nobody knows how many bodies are buried in the rubble - 200,000 , 300,000 ? Guido Bertolaso , who is in Haiti to co-ordinate relief efforts , also criticised what he saw as the presence of too many American soldiers . He said they had no training in running a civilian relief operation . `` When there is an emergency , it triggers a vanity parade . Lots of people go there anxious to show that their country is big and important , showing solidarity '' , he said . He called on the United Nations to establish a procedure to follow when major natural disasters occur . As the death toll in Haiti has risen , it has become clear the 12 January quake is one of the worst natural disasters to have struck in recent years . Some say the 7.0-magnitude quake killed as many as 200,000 people , while an estimated 1.5 million people have been left homeless . Ms Lassegue said that the authorities were still far from knowing the total number of those killed . `` Nobody knows how many bodies are buried in the rubble - 200,000 , 300,000 ? Who knows the overall death toll ? '' the Associated Press quotes her as saying on Sunday . Speaking to reporters a day earlier , she said the general hospital had received about 10,000 corpses , which it had handed over to CNE for burial . At least 75,000 people have been buried in mass graves since the disaster . Relatives have also burnt the bodies of some of the victims . Thousands of people joined open-air church services in Port-au-Prince , Leogane - the epicentre of the earthquake - and elsewhere on Sunday . A day after the funeral of the capital 's Roman Catholic archbishop , Father Glanda Toussaint celebrated Mass at an altar improvised on a wooden table by the wrecked cathedral .

As a Haitian , it hurts . '' Haitian-born rapper Wyclef Jean , who set up the charity foundation Yele Haiti , arrived in the capital on Sunday . He was expected to meet officials and help distribute aid to people left homeless . He was among a number of high-profile artists to take part in a `` Hope for Haiti Now '' telethon in the US on Friday which raised more than $ 57m -LRB- # 35m -RRB- for the aid effort . Meanwhile , BBC correspondents in Port-au-Prince report a few signs of normal life returning to the city , with street stalls starting to sell fruit and vegetables and some shops and banks re-opening . Queues to withdraw cash have been long , as prices for what is now on sale have increased dramatically and many Haitians have been without access to money for days . The UN says more than 130,000 people have now been relocated out of Port-au-Prince by the authorities , easing the pressure on overcrowded camps in the city . Others have left independently .

He later told reporters that soft drinks and snacks had kept him going . A French medic said he could expect to leave hospital within a day or two . The BBC 's Orla Guerin in Port-au-Prince says doctors believe he will make a full recovery . Speaking to the BBC , Mr Exantus appealed for search and rescue efforts to continue so that others could share his chance of rescue .

The coastal town about 50km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- west of the capital Port-au-Prince was at the epicentre of the quake . In 45 seconds of shaking and rumbling , it was torn apart . The town 's large Catholic church was reduced to rubble Fewer than 20 % of buildings remain standing in the town ; power and telephone lines are strewn across the street , burst water mains have flooded parts of the town , and , at the center , the large Catholic church has crashed down in ruins . The bell which hung in the tower is lying half buried in bricks , and broken church pews and hymn books are scattered everywhere . The mayor , Alexis Santos , says he feels powerless to help his people . `` My hands are tied , the people are hungry , '' he says . `` There is food , but many are not getting any . '' He can not understand why food arrives on US Navy helicopters from the international donor operation , but little of it appears to have been given to people in the town . Leogane has a population of 200,000 ; few if any are sleeping under solid roofs . Thousands of people grabbed what possessions they could and moved to the largest open space in the town , the school football field . Here they have erected shelters . Ted Valcout had grabbed some house bricks and a dozen pieces of timber and was trying to reinforce the structure that he has built for the nine members of his family . `` We have some food , but we have to share it with these people , '' he said , gesturing to his neighbors in the makeshift camp . There had been one food distribution at the football ground since it became a camp for the displaced , he said . He is not sure where the food came from , and not everyone was able to get their hands on some , he said . `` People near the gate were OK , but those right at the back of the pitch did not get lined up in time and they missed out , '' he said . There is no apparent organization in the camp ; at one point a few days ago , registration forms were circulated and signed , but there has been no follow-up . Every open area in the town now has homeless people living on it , and families have put up shelters in the middle of many streets . Mr Santos says , even though it is very congested , people are better off in the stadium because they are more likely to get food and water . It is the only way we can exist , we have to borrow and rely on other people . We have nothing at all - nothing This is borne out by the experience of Francoise Casseus . She and her extended family have decided to shelter under a tree and a few sheets of cloth and plastic right next to their destroyed home . She does not want to move because the body of one of her daughters is still inside the building , and she fears that if they abandon the house , looters will come and take what they can from the rubble . Francoise and her relatives have got no food . They are surviving through the generosity of others and by spending what little money they had saved . `` It is the only way we can exist , we have to borrow and rely on other people . We have nothing at all - nothing .

British firefighters , returning to the UK after the Haitian government declared the search-and-rescue operation for survivors of the earthquake over , have been speaking about their experiences . Rudy Parkes helped to rescue a two-year-old girl called Mia who had been trapped in the rubble of her nursery school for three days . He told BBC News : `` In 20 years it 's probably been the most fulfilling rescue we 've had , the sense that when I left home on the Tuesday night she was underneath that building . `` I think her crying and the lad that alerted us to her , who we could n't find later , probably saved her life along with the three teams that were there .

I bent down and I could hear the little girl crying for her mother , her mother was on the scene during the whole four-hour operation and was quite calm and very useful to us . `` When she actually came out it was like she was being born again , if you like . `` Luckily for the two-year-old old she 'll never remember any of it hopefully , but we 'll never forget it . '' Mr Alexander will hold talks with religious organizations with links to aid agencies working in Haiti . He said : `` Faith groups are playing a crucial role in saving lives and helping Haiti rebuild itself . `` I will be working alongside , and listening to , faith leaders to hear how they think the people of Haiti can be helped . `` Uniting faith groups will help them have a stronger voice in the international effort . `` It is important that Haiti stays at the top of the international agenda in the weeks and months ahead , and this is one way to make sure this happens . '' Also , EU ministers have agreed that member states should provide 300-350 police to help maintain order in Haiti , mostly from an EU gendarmerie force established by France , Spain , Italy , Portugal , the Netherlands and Romania .

They have been talking about their 11-day mission to rescue people from buildings which collapsed after the earthquake . UK 's rapid response team swung into action when the 7.0 magnitude quake struck Haiti on Tuesday , 12 January . They were involved in painstaking operations in extraordinarily difficult circumstances . Nick Maskery is a consultant in emergency medicine at Southampton General Hospital as well as being a BASICS -LRB- British Association for Immediate Care -RRB- doctor with more intensive training in dealing with emergencies outside hospital . The BASICS doctors are affiliated to UK International Search and Rescue -LRB- UKISAR -RRB- and train with them to support the firefighters and deal with those pulled out of the rubble before they are taken to hospital . Nick Maskery is trained as a BASICS doctor Nick said : `` It was something you never experience anywhere else - the destruction , the sights , sounds , the mass of humanity on the streets wandering around looking for help , the conditions we were working in - I 've never , never seen anything like it . '' Nick and his two GP colleagues found themselves treating wounded and ill patients outside hospital and med-evacuating them , when it was possible , to field hospitals . He was involved in helping one women , Sonia , who 's rescue was captured by TV crews . She had survived in a collapsed building although her 19-year-old daughter was lying dead beside her . Nick said : `` She 's very lucky - the space she was trapped in allowed her to breathe lying flat on her back . It just was fate that some people had enough air to survive , other people did n't and died . '' The death toll following the earthquake is estimated at 150,000 John Taylor was part of Hampshire Fire and Rescue 's medical support team and is also a part-time retained firefighter . He explained : `` My role was providing medical care for casualties - there is a long period while the digging is going on and that can be quite frustrating . `` I did go underground during one rescue and that was pretty claustrophobic and pretty unpleasant inside the building - but once you get them out , it is hugely rewarding . But then we had to struggle to find somewhere to treat them when there were no hospitals in the first few days , but we did manage it . '' Medical workers faced a range of injuries to deal with , from dehydration to broken bones - with overwhelming numbers of people needing help . John said : `` You ca n't ignore people you come across . It is difficult - there are people everywhere with injuries or in desperate need . You 've only got what you can carry so you have limited resources so you just do what you can - it 's difficult . '' The team have experience of dealing with the immediate aftermath of other disasters including the Pakistan earthquake of 2005 . On this occasion they were initially hampered by transport delays and the organisational difficulties in the chaos of the immediate aftermath of the quake . When they did arrive in Haiti they set up their organisational base in the relative security of the airport . Keith Bellamy set up the support facilities for the rescue teams Hampshire Search and Rescue 's Keith Bellamy was in charge of setting up the logistics to support the 64-strong team of UK firefighters , providing them with food , drinking water , power and fuel to operate effectively . He explained : `` There was a lot of devastation and confusion initially when we first arrived , but when we find out what 's happened we bring our own controlled procedures into play . `` Our equipment was delayed by 24 hours , that did n't stop the teams going out searching . '' The Hampshire staff had to co-ordinate the work of colleagues from other UK fire brigades but also work with other international rescue teams , United Nations , military and civilian aid agencies on the ground in Haiti . The 11-day mission , co-ordinated from Hampshire 's Fire and Rescue 's Headquarters in Eastleigh was the UK team 's longest overseas deployment with a record number of rescues . Peter Crook , the national co-ordinator for UKISAR paid tribute to how the team reacted to the difficulties : `` They are some of the best firefighters in the world , they 're extremely resourceful . Things never go completely right , the team are fantastic at getting round things - they 'll find solutions .

The BBC 's International Development Correspondent David Loyn , who reported from both towns , looks at the differences in the international response . Within days of the tsunami hitting Aceh , on the northern tip of the island of Sumatra in Indonesia , an Australian army combat engineering battalion had landed with a large force of trucks , earth-moving equipment , and water purification systems . They were the most visible sign of an international response that swiftly brought ashore huge quantities of food , shelter , and basic sanitation . A fleet of vessels , including a Greenpeace ship in the area , was commandeered to move aid to where it was needed across a wide area . US army efforts in Haiti focused on water and basic meals In contrast , the most visible sign of aid in the same timeframe in Haiti was the sight of US Navy helicopters ferrying ready-to-eat meals and bottled water from the fleet anchored offshore . Aid professionals shook their heads at this approach - so good on TV , but so ineffective at delivering the quantities of relief necessary to help the three million people believed to have been affected by the Haiti earthquake . But at least the US forces were doing something . In the squalid makeshift camps that emerged on the streets and on any open ground in Port-au-Prince there was no sign of the shelter , sanitation nor packs of basic essentials like soap and buckets that usually characterise the first wave of aid donations . So what had gone wrong ? When there was such huge international generosity , both by governments and individuals , why has it taken so long for effective aid to reach those who need it ? Part of the answer lay in the security briefings that aid agencies received . The fear of insecurity can become a self-fulfilling prophecy Some isolated scenes of looting and the sound of occasional gunfire reinforced the view of security advisers that the streets of Port-au-Prince were a war zone , and it found itself re-categorised into the same bracket of cities that included Baghdad and Kabul . That kept many aid workers firmly behind the safety fence at the UN compound . Another problem came in the sheer scale of the US military deployment . An aid official from a major and reputable international organization told me last week that when he had tried to secure landing rights for a relief flight from Europe , he was told by the US authorities that the next available landing slot `` was on 9 February '' . The airstrip is filled instead with US transport planes bringing in troops and military equipment . The problem is that this bottleneck means that the threat of worsening security could become a self-fulfilling prophecy . If they do not deliver the aid fast , they will need all those troops . Despite the enormous loss of life , the Haitian response to the earthquake has been characterised by the patience and resolve of a people who have suffered much . But patience is not limitless . The most effective response has come from the World Food Programme -LRB- WFP -RRB- , which has succeeded in raising food distribution from a few thousand a day to hundreds of thousands . Haiti 's economy and infrastructure were struggling even before the quake But because of the enormous need and failures elsewhere in the system they need to spend far more time negotiating security issues than they otherwise might . The third major issue in Haiti was in the lack of coordination of aid . One reason for this was the huge loss of life in the UN system - more than 80 dead , including the head of mission . But there was similar dislocation to the staff of aid agencies in Aceh , and there the system recovered far more quickly , so that a new co-ordination network could deliver aid across a far wider area than was affected in Haiti . The biggest difference between the two countries was their starting point . Indonesia is a rapidly developing nation , while Haiti is the only country in the western hemisphere on that unenviable UN list of those defined as Least Developed Countries -LRB- LDCs -RRB- . Corruption and the legacy of colonial interference have conspired against good governance . At the best of times , water and power are unreliable , and the streets are filled with rotting refuse . So it was hard to expect the efficient disposal of more than 100,000 corpses , while broken water mains continue to flood streets that were not otherwise affected by the earthquake .

Orla Guerin reports on violence in Haiti 's slums We followed the sound down a warren of narrow alleyways and found a group of women holding an open-air service outside their damaged church . They have been here continuously since the earthquake struck , hoping their voices will make enough noise to keep the much-feared local gangs at bay . `` There is no water , no food , nothing , '' said Madame Elote Pierre , the pastor 's wife . `` When it 's night time , it 's even more scary . We have to band together for safety . We stay together , praying . We do n't sleep . '' Some of the congregation have lost their homes , others are too afraid to return to theirs - they fear being raped , if they are found alone . Madame Pierre has lived in Cite Soleil since 1969 , and says things have never been worse . The quake damaged many of the homes of those who live in Cite Soleil `` The situation has never been easy for us , '' she said . `` But this is the most difficult moment , and the most dangerous . We have had no aid from anyone , and there 's no-one to protect us . Our only protection is from God , '' she said , raising her arms to the sky . Since the earthquake there are new dangers in Haiti 's most notorious slum . The earthquake has created a security vacuum across the capital . And more than 4,000 prisoners escaped from the ruins of the capital 's main jail . They have come back home to Cite Soleil , according to the dapper local prosecutor , Evens Leveque - a man who often travels with armed guards . We found him rushing to a meeting with the Cite Soleil police chief , to discuss a shoot-out the night before . There is no death penalty in Haiti . When citizens catch one of those bandits they are supposed to hold them and call the police , not lynch them . As a judge I know it is unjust and illegal `` The situation is disastrous , '' he said . `` The prisoners came back here with guns in their hands to terrorise the population . But we , as the local authorities , are not going to let that happen . '' Having put the gangs behind bars once , he intends to do it again . `` We have received orders , '' he says . `` And we 'll do it , whether it takes one or two months , or one or two years , unless they have run off somewhere else , or escaped to the countryside . '' In the meantime , he says , some of the local population have taken matters into their own hands , lynching gang members in the streets . `` There is no death penalty in Haiti . When citizens catch one of those bandits they are supposed to hold them and call the police , not lynch them . As a judge I know it is unjust and illegal . '' But he also knows that many in the slum have lost faith in Haitian justice . `` When people are arrested , sometimes they are free weeks afterwards because the judicial system in Haiti is weak , and our prisons are not adequate , '' he says . Lying in his bed in a nearby hospital , Brine Cedernier knows only too well about the gun law on the streets . Half his stomach is covered by dressings applied to his bullet wounds . His nephew , Rony , sits by his bedside , gently wiped the perspiration from his brow . Until two days ago , Brine supported them both , by providing lifts on his motorbike . Then he was attacked in the neighbouring slum . `` I was on my motorbike and three guys came , '' he says . `` They told me to kneel down . They took the bike and shot me - twice . Since the earthquake , the gangs are stealing and looting and killing people . '' Eighteen-year-old Rony looks away , with tears streaming down his face . Having already lost his father in the earthquake , he can not bear the thought of losing his uncle . On the streets of the seaside slum , gun law is the only law `` He 's the only one I have left who loves me , '' he said . `` He 's all I have . '' Brine is being treated by staff from Medecins Sans Frontieres . They have returned to the local hospital in Cite Soleil , where they have been based in previous crises . MSF veterans here say they are not hearing as much gunfire as they did in the past . But they are treating two to three shooting victims a day , and they have been busy with births , amputations , and some machete wounds from looting . Some food aid is getting through to the slum . We saw people waiting patiently for aid in long orderly queues , under the watchful eye of United Nations troops . But we saw no sign of the police during our visit - except in the courtyard of their headquarters . Just across the road , there is a bullet-riddled ruin - a symbol of the slum . Back outside the Church of Saint Temple of Olivier , the faithful say they will continue their vigil . `` We have to stay here together , and keep praying , '' said Madame Pierre . `` We ca n't risk separating . We pray to God to see the next day , and we pray not to be a victim .

But what is the original song about , and why is it associated with suicide ? It started out as a song to comfort `` younger people '' , and the attempt to make it accessible to someone `` who has n't been to college '' has made it applicable in all kinds of situations . From 8th album Automatic For The People UK number seven -LRB- April 1993 -RRB- Number three ` Song to listen to when depressed ' -LRB- 6Music poll , 2004 -RRB- Number two ` Gen X funeral song ' -LRB- Bereavement Register , 1993 -RRB- Number one ` Cry-Pod song ' -LRB- Poll for Irish radio station RTE , 2007 -RRB- Everybody Hurts is not a typical REM song . For one thing , you can make out all of singer-songwriter Michael Stipe 's words . More importantly , it 's immediately obvious what they mean : do n't give up . And so the song has had a much more varied and exposed life than most of REM 's output , even before the imminent celeb-carousel rendition . It was , for example , the first song played by Radio 1 after the two minutes ' silence to mark 1996 's Dunblane shootings . A version edited to include the sounds of the attacks on the Twin Towers was widely circulated online in late 2001 . And the track rubbed shoulders with Candle In The Wind and I 'll Be Missing You on the official Diana Memorial album . But the troubles that the song originally speaks to are more personal . In the 1993 video , Stipe is portrayed among drivers stuck in an almighty Texas traffic jam , each with troubles on his or her mind , all of these conveyed in subtitles . Among them is a teenager staring out of a window , thinking : `` They 're going to miss me . '' And suicide - especially among the young - is the personal problem with which Everybody Hurts is most often associated . In 2001 , the Nevada Assembly passed a resolution praising REM for `` encouraging the prevention of teen suicides '' , specifically mentioning Everybody Hurts . And in 1995 , the Samaritans marked the first anniversary of the suicide of Kurt Cobain with adverts in music magazines which consisted of two verses of the song . If you 're consciously writing for someone who has n't been to college , or is pretty young , it might be nice to be very direct . In that regard , it 's tended to work for people of a lot of ages `` We 've tended to license the song out for free to charity , '' guitarist Peter Buck told the BBC in 2005 . In the same interview -LRB- see link on right -RRB- , Stipe is characteristically evasive , but Buck is more forthcoming . `` I remember Michael saying something to the effect that he wanted younger people to not have to worry about metaphors , '' he said . `` The only metaphor is in the bridge : ` throw your hand ' , which is a card-game metaphor . '' It 's also , to many , a metaphor for taking one 's life . Is it incongruous , then , to apply the lyric to Haitians affected by an earthquake ? ` Things are tough but they get better ' Not necessarily . Buck told Mojo magazine that `` trying to reach a 17-year-old and say , ` it 's OK - things are tough but they get better ' '' involved economy and directness - and that universality automatically means the song is picked up on by other people . The simplicity of the music helps , too . Based on a beat from a drum machine that cost $ 20 , the track revolves around a few familiar arpeggiated chords . Even after the arrival of the strings , arranged by former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones , there 's an intimacy that fits the lyric , and a vocal from Stipe that , in the words of rock critic Garry Mulholland , expresses `` all the personal tragedies and troughs that he has traveled through '' . An earlier version included the line : `` Everybody hurts , even the singer of the song . '' The charity-single template is , of course , very different to this , and Simon Cowell , the organiser of the new version , is not usually associated with musical restraint . However , the point of next week 's release is not faithfulness to the REM original , it 's something more commonly associated with Mr Cowell - that is money , in this case for Haiti . As for REM , Stipe says : `` How could we not say yes to this appeal ? We 're honored to play even a small role in trying to help . '' This echoes what Buck told the BBC in 2005 : `` The song belongs more to the people that it 's aimed at than it does to the band any more . '' Smashed Hits is compiled by Alan Connor . Add your comments on this story , using the form below . I am a vicar . At funerals I would normally expect to be able to rein in my emotions , but this song will always cause a tear to flow . On one occasion as I took the funeral of a suicide , we played this as part of some reflective prayer and the whole congregation , including me and the funeral director , were in tears . In my first term at university , I was wracked with absolute gut-wrenching homesickness . I heard this song on the radio late one night , and it was like a light-bulb . It made me realize that it was OK to be missing home , but that it was going to work out if I just hung in there and stayed the course . I saw REM live later that year , and hearing them play Everybody Hurts , with 100,000 other voices in the crowd remains a very special memory to me . I am not surprised Simon Cowell thought a song about suicide was appropriate for Haiti - he thought a song about sexual anguish was suitable for the Xmas number one in 2008 . I am a big REM fan and in its original context the song really works . I CAN imagine being desperate enough to want to commit suicide - so yes , everybody does hurt . But I can in no way imagine what it is like to be in Haiti now . Everybody does not hurt as they do . To tell them that everybody hurts , as if we can in some way empathise , feels patronising . I love this song . It 's a reminder that when you think you have it bad , other people have it worse and things will get better . A beautiful , simple piece of music and wonderful lyrics from Messers Stipe and Berry . An all time classic . As an expert on depression I can assure you that if you are depressed then you want to avoid this song completely . It 's a neat song if you 're in a reflective mood yes , but depression ... oh no ! This is an incredibly uplifting song that is both inspirational and powerful . I think that perhaps millions of people have at one time not given up on something because of listening to this song . Absolutely fitting to be used here . The most comforting things to be told when you 're in a terrible state are that you 're not alone and that things will get better ; you will be alright . This song does both of those , and it speaks to you as an individual . No , REM do n't know you or your individual pains , but this song says that somebody cares . Everyone has been through something , so everyone understands the song . Everybody Hurts is a great , great song and is no doubt going to be beaten to within an inch of its artistic credibility by this selection of pop stars . Would n't it be better to do a brand new song , or better still for REM to repackage the original and allow all proceeds from now on go to the Haiti fund ? All the pop stars could just contribute by buying it a few times . REM 's Everybody Hurts is a classic song that is as relevant today as it was in 1992 . Whilst I appreciate the new version will be for charity , I fear it will be a travesty of the original , ie bland and cheesy . I will probably listen to Automatic For The People tonight and donate a couple of quid to Oxfam instead . The BBC may edit your comments and not all emails will be published .

This past week , like everybody else on the globe , I have been glued to the television screens watching the agony of the Haitians . I have heard over and over again that Haiti is the poorest country in the Western hemisphere and as the rhetoric has expanded , I have even heard Haiti was THE poorest country in the world . Now I do n't know what the truth is about these claims ; I have never been to Haiti and I have deep scepticism about terminology like GDP and the like . My compatriots decided to demonstrate to the whole world that everybody might have mobile phones in Ghana but we remain a scientifically illiterate country One thing I do know is that there does not seem to be any evidence to contradict any of these claims about the level of poverty in Haiti when you watch the apocalyptic scenes on television . An earthquake of that magnitude would cause chaos and devastation if it occurred anywhere in the world . But surely it is a bit over the top to have an earthquake in which the archbishop gets killed , the head of the United Nations office gets killed and the presidential palace collapses . Pat Robertson the American televangelist is reported to have put it all to the wrath of God who has shown his anger on the `` devil-worshipping '' Haitians . Ghana lost to Ivory Coast but their fans are now celebrating again The Haitian consul to Sao Paulo , who happens to be white , was a touch more graphic . He told a Brazilian TV crew that people of African origin were cursed . `` I think it has to do with messing so much with voodoo , '' he said . In the midst of it all , my compatriots decided to demonstrate to the whole world that everybody might have mobile phones in Ghana but we remain a scientifically illiterate country when a nationwide panic was generated through text messages claiming that an earthquake was about to hit Ghana . My suspicion is that the hoax was induced by a desperate attempt to get Ghana into the headlines when we had lost a football match to Didier Drogba . Or we were probably hoping that President Barack Obama would make a speech praising Ghana 's democracy . We could n't allow Haiti to usurp Ghana 's position as the favored African\\/black country . It is of course the anniversary of Barack Obama 's inauguration as US president and many on this continent are getting anxious that Africa has not featured high on his agenda . If we want Mr Obama to be a successful president , Africa should resolve that the images of the continent will not be of wars , hunger , malnourished children and political chaos It is worth pointing out again for the umpteenth time that Barack Obama was elected by Americans as their president and his success or failure as president will be measured by how well Americans fare under his watch . And it seems to me that he will have a difficult time for as long as Africa continues to claim him as its own . I blame the results of the vote in Massachusetts on the Haitian earthquake . Every time another Haitian comes on the TV , some in the US probably see the face of the man in the White House . If we want Mr Obama to be a successful president , Africa should resolve that the images of the continent will not be of wars , hunger , malnourished children and political chaos . And we should stop claiming him as an African . If I were his white mother I would be outraged every time someone referred to him as black . Thanks for your comments . Please read a selection below : Africans need black -LRB- African or African American -RRB- people to aspire to , I 'm a young African and all you tend to here about black is negative if we get a chance to promote some black positivity we should grab it Obama is black , I do n't think he will solve Africa 's problems but he inspires me to reach the very top ! Eric Malebe , Johannesburg , South Africa No African or Ghanaian is saying that Obama is the answer to our problems . We just feel honored that someone with an African background has worked had to earn such an enviable position who is also a source of inspiration to all groups of people who think such achievement is not possible . Secondly it is very wrong for Elizabeth to attempt to discuss scientific literacy or otherwise . How many well resourced science labs do we have in our universities for those who claim to be scientist in Ghana . I do not even want to talk about science labs for the high schools . Just for the record you do not have to be literate to use a mobile phone . When someone is famous , people generally like to claim some kind of connection to them . But Obama 's presidency should not be reduced to an issue of race , as he has already outlined the challenges of his mixed heritage in his books . He also states his identity , so another person should n't presume to do so for him in a manner that could be offensive to some people with mixed heritage . I really find it amusing that Elizabeth , a senior colleague , can say that `` we should stop claiming him as an African . '' Yes , Barack Obama is the president of the United States and there is absolutely no doubt that his primary duty is to protect the interests of the American people that elected him to the Oval Office . But he is AFRICAN as well , even though it does not appears politically convenient to point this out to the American people . He is a Kenyan national , as well as being American . The last time I checked he has not renounced his Kenyan citizenship , which came through his father -LRB- the fact that he does not carry a Kenyan passport does not take this nationality away from him -RRB- . And he acknowledged the fact that he is Luo , -LRB- please read `` Dreams From My Father '' -RRB- notwithstanding the fact that he has only visited Kenya and never lived there . Does Elisabeth or anyone else have concrete proof to contradict this ? We need to get our facts right , even though I agree that Africa should not expect miracles or a great deal of attention from a man elected to solve the problems of Americans AND NOT AFRICANS . It is obvious that the Middle East and certainly Afghanistan\\/Pakistan , are more of a worry for Obama than Africa . I would like to think that he would help Africa , if only for the stark fact that he is tied to Africa by blood . But perhaps in this case , blood may not be thicker than water ... Osasu Obayiuwana , Associate Editor , NewAfrican magazine , Lagos , Nigeria\\/London , England I disagree with your views on the Democratic Party 's failure to obtain the Massachusetts senate seat . The failure has much less to do with an unconscious connection between Haiti and our black president than an initiative by the people of Massachusetts to send a message that policies must be accounted for and progress must be obtained . Another frustrating comment that you seem too willing to assume is that by having a black heritage , Mr. Obama is African . I suggest that President Obama is wholly American . Although his ethnicity presents itself inevitably from his African ancestry , it seems somewhat incoherent to suggest that his image as President of the United States is reflective of his ethnic heritage and `` tie '' to the African subcontinent . As many Africans well know , their skin color does n't reflect their nationality . If I were his mother , I would be proud of my son . By suggesting that she should be frustrated if anyone called him black , you seem to eager and perhaps unconsciously call upon several issues unrelated to the presidency , Haiti , and the United States all together . Elizabeth is right in her analysis . The blackman is not cursed as Moses who liberated the Jews was black . Kwame Nkurumah was not cursed . Africa , like any other continent produced good son and daughters , and like any other continent produced bad children too . I sympathise with Obama I believe that Obama represents hope , aspiration and the future for the human race . He is an African-American . As an African living in Britain , Obama brings respectability to the black race through what he has done and continues to do . I know the Americans whether black or white agree that there is a bright future for everyone . May God guide , protect and lead Obama 's path . By the way , how is Obama 's US Presidency helping Africa ? Former President Clinton was involve and is still involve with the development through his foundation . President G.W. Bush is known for education , health , and chasing dictators like Charles Taylor from Africa . Former President Carter will be remembered for good governance and health . What has Obama done or what can he do ? Even his John McCain has worked or is working to help immigrants . I am sick and tire of hearing this Obama 's blackness or African thing . Africans please try for yourself and leave `` poor '' Obama alone . Boima Gbelly , North Providence , RI . USA Genetically Obama is of mixed heritage , phenotypically he is black ! And also politically he is black ! And no this was not a paradigm made up by Africans . Check the history books , read , learn and you will grow . People have the right to refer to Obama as black ! I am amazed why some educated people are puzzled why a mixed race should be referred to as black . @Rasheed , my fellow countryman . I do n't know anyone who is sitting down waiting for Obama to rescue them . And there is nothing wrong with clinching onto the aspirations he represents to better yourself . In fact , the messianic view of Obama is shared worldwide not just by Africans . The author of this piece manages to mix several complicated issues into one . There is no direct correlation between success in Africa and Obama 's presidency . And everyone can claim Obama if they so desire ! Elizabeth , I understand your argument - to an extent - I for one refuse to call Mr. Obama , black . Simply because he is not . However , your comments and viewpoints about our beloved country 's earthquake fear , is perhaps too cynical and a little insensitive . Any country in the world would have reacted the same way , it was sent by text and could have only been disputed when the authorities came to know about it , which is exactly what happened . You of all people should know what Ghana is like on the ground , people dropped out of school to make money for their families , Ghana is not a country overflowing with 25 million scientists . Some things can not be helped . Frankly , Obama can not do much for Africa because he is fighting for his political survival . Instead of focusing attention on what goes on outside US , Obama should first try to solve the problem of black American . Africa will take care of itself . Enough of foreign aid that is making us more dependent ! After all , despite all the doomsday scenario and brutal colonialism , Africa is still standing . Contrary to what prophet of doom , Pat Robertson , thinks , neither Africa nor Haiti is cursed . It is a scare tactics to make black people irrelevant . You wonder while many people are sceptical of organised religion . Gbenga I beg to differ ! Obama is ours and we will claim him , whether good or bad . Even great schools like Harvard and Yale claim our purely African leaders whom they trained . As an African living in London , I am 100 % in support of what Elizabeth mentioned in her report . It leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth when the whole continent lays so much hope on one man 's journey and then forgets all that has been said and done and still continues to be cast in the most undignified manner . Take for example my country of birth Sierra Leone . We went through ten years of madness killing each other and after all that the people are still facing the same problems . The country is still being managed in the same manner , where we still need the west to answer our calls to maintain our daily living . No Mr Obama is coming my people - it 's time we get our self out of this dream and start living . President Obama sent his Secretary of State , Hillary Rodham Clinton , on a high profile tour in Africa , so I am not sure how you can say that Africa does n't figure into his agenda . As well , although I appreciate your resolution that images of Africa not be negative , your closing comment regarding his mother projects racism and self hate . If you know much about identity politics in the US , you might also realize that `` African '' and `` black '' are different . Which one is better or worse of an association for Barack Obama ? I ca n't say . I am one that thinks that change will come through the positive image of a black POTUS being projected everywhere to over the next few years and will positively influence young people . I am from Massachusetts and what I think you fail to realize is that when I see my President I do not see him as African because he is an American as I am . I also see him by his party affiliation . He is a Democrat and that is what fuels the majority of Americans regarding their views of their president . President Obama has been fixated on passing `` universal '' health care , which it is not , and the people of Massachusetts voted in a Republican to fill the empty Senate seat of deceased Sen. Kennedy not because of Haiti but because of the impending passage of the health care bill . The people of Massachusetts and his white mother take no offense to the fact that President Obama has a rich cultural heritage that includes Africa . The color of my skin happens to be white . But I know the whole world originated in Africa . Or at the least a significant majority of earths present inhabitants . So the article was completely refreshing . Genuinely appreciated and nestled in my heart , mind and soul . Your statement : `` If I were his white mother I would be outraged every time someone referred to him as black '' is moronic , because his mother raised him so he knew about his black culture . Obama loves his African heritage and identifies himself as being African American -LRB- not white -RRB- . To say that Africans should not support him is asinine and dumb . As far as I am concerned Obama is post graduate of Harvard University . There is no Africa about his being a US president . He is just like and in the same age as Clinton , JFK , to name but a few . Moreover , the UK did not change as Ian Smith became president of Rhodesia , nor Holland as Botha became that of Apartheid South Africa . The Holabohi , the Wahala and Palava over Obama 's African connection is nothing but `` much ado about nothing '' or `` as you like it '' . Africa needs to help herself meet the millennium goals through good governance , accountability , nonviolence etc. . Obama is the President of the USA not Africa . Though he has some of his roots in Africa Obama is not black but bi-racial . I have a fiancee who is bi-racial and it is always insulting to her as well her white mother when people call her a black woman . It takes her mother out of the picture .

Cheryl Cole , Alexandra Burke , Mika , James Morrison and Susan Boyle have all passed through the doors of Trevor Horn 's Sarm Studios this week , headed for Studio 1 . It 's the same studio that hosted Sir Bob Geldof and Midge Ure 's gang in 1984 for the recording of Do They Know It 's Christmas . Sadly this time there 's no Bono , Sting and Simon Le Bon huddled together round the mic . Instead each artist is coming in solo to sing a section of the REM classic Everybody Hurts . This cover version is getting a similar treatment to the 1997 Children in Need take on Lou Reed 's Perfect Day , with each act being asked to record just one or two lines that will then get stitched together digitally to make a complete track . Leona Lewis has scored the all important opening , laying down her vocals in a Los Angeles studio at the weekend . That 's where Robbie Williams and Take That will record their contributions later this week , while Michael Buble 's voice has already been added from New York . Over the weekend JLS and Cheryl Cole passed through Studio 1 while on Monday it was the turn of X Factor winners Joe McElderry and Alexandra Burke , who had flown in overnight from her European tour . Tuesday began with Mika arriving fresh from France to sing . He also gets to be like Phil Collins on Band Aid and play an instrument on the track , a `` New Orleans-style piano '' to round off the song , as Mika put it . She was all pumped and ready to go . She was cool , I leaned in to give her a kiss but I do n't think she was too keen on giving me a kiss Even though the studio hire and engineering staff were coming free , each act still only got a 45-minute time slot to nail their vocals . Mika overran his allotted time so James Morrison had to wait a while , but he was fine as that meant he had time for a quick sarnie from round the corner . James also had the added bonus of knowing the producer Steve Robson , so was ecstatic with his pre-selected lines . `` He -LRB- Steve -RRB- said that I 'd have the middle eight and I was like , ` Wicked ! ' That 's one of the best bits in the song . '' So that means James spent the afternoon trying to better Michael Stipe by belting out ` Do n't throw your hand ... oh , no. . . do n't throw your hand . ' By mid-afternoon on Tuesday the artists at Sarm were starting to overlap , allowing James Morrison a rare Susan Boyle encounter . `` She was all pumped and ready to go , '' James said . `` She was cool , I leaned in to give her a kiss but I do n't think she was too keen on giving me a kiss . '' Hardly a `` feed the world '' group hug moment , but then again this recording was low key in comparison . Each act came in one by one to stand at the single microphone in the voice booth in the middle of the relatively large studio , with that piano for Mika just off to one side . James Morrison was joined by the likes of Rod Stewart and Alexandra Burke As for SuBo , she admitted she did n't know this REM song very well so had to learn her part from scratch . But she thinks it 's a `` very nice song '' and admits `` it was an honor to be picked '' . The day ended with Rod Stewart arriving to add his contribution after Simon Cowell called him personally , although more acts are expected to join in over the coming days . The video to accompany Everybody Hurts is being made simultaneously with the recording , so in another nod to Band Aid , expect to see a lot of artists at the mic wearing headphones as they sing along . The estimated release date is 7 February , with proceeds going to the Disasters Emergency Committee -LRB- DEC -RRB- and there 's already talk this could become one of the biggest selling singles of all time .

The building housing Digicel , the Irish telecommunications firm with Caribbean roots , emerged unscathed from the earthquake from the 12 January earthquake . It has been reported that the 11-storey structure was built to withstand huge tremors of the kind that that struck Port - au-Prince . `` Where the streets outside the building are now filled with chaos and desperation , inside the buzz of workers tapping away on keyboards fills the floors of Digicel 's offices , '' the AFP news agency said . Cell phone operators have been working to get networks going again since the earthquake and to let those displaced by the quake contact loved ones in other countries . Digicel is Haiti 's leading wireless operator with 2 million customers . Last week it said that about 70 % of its cell sites were working . There is however still some congestion when making and receiving international calls . Digicel , which began in Jamaica , found a very captive market when it set up in Haiti in 2006 . The company says the operation cost $ 260 million and it remains a big employer , with nearly 900 people on its staff . Fewer than one percent of Haitians have landlines , according to Digicel figures , so mobile phones are crucial for communications . Irish telecoms billionaire Denis O'Brien , who founded Digicel , has said said he is working alongside former US president Bill Clinton on rebuilding Haiti . `` Obviously we need foreign direct investment but on a wider front we need a Marshall Plan , '' Mr O'Brien told AFP . The company says it has yet to account for all of its employees , at least four of whom were killed in the quake . But management is counting on having around 650 workers in the office by the end of the week . Digicel also says it is working to provide material and psychological support to staff . It has given each of its customers in Haiti the equivalent of $ 5 in free credit and has teamed up with Shaggy and other Caribbean singers to record a new song to raise money for earthquake survivors in Haiti .

He was rescued from the ruins of a building in the center of the city , and taken to hospital by US troops . Officials said it seemed he had become trapped by an aftershock two days after the quake and was severely dehydrated . The rescue comes 14 days after the 7.0-magnitude quake , which killed as many as 200,000 people . Wismond Exantus , 24 , found after 11 days Emmannuel Buso , 21 - rescued after 10 days Marie Carida , 84 - saved after 10 days Mendji Bahina Sanon , 11 - trapped for eight days Lozama Hotteline , 25 - pulled out after seven days Elisabeth Joassaint , 15 days - buried for seven days , half her life Ena Zizi , 69 - rescued after seven days Haiti has been rattled by at least 50 tremors since the original quake . The survivor , a man in his early 30s , was pulled from the ruins covered in dust . `` He was buried in the rubble for 12 days . The man had a broken leg and severe dehydration , '' a statement from the US military said . The Associated Press named the man as Rico Dibrivell and said he was discovered initially by a group of Haitians who pulled him from the rubble of a shop that had been repeatedly looted . Although he had apparently been trapped by an aftershock rather than the initial earthquake , the man is the longest survivor so far under the rubble . A rescue team has also been digging into the rubble of a university , after a man said he had managed to phone his cousin who said she was trapped in a basement , along with several other people . Some bodies have already been pulled out but as yet the woman has not been found . On Saturday , Haiti 's government declared the search and rescue phase over . It is estimated more than 130 people have been pulled alive by rescue teams in the Haitian capital since the quake . However , many more have been rescued by ordinary Haitians , often with their bare hands . Earlier , Haitian President Rene Preval made an urgent appeal for more tents to house up to a million people left homeless by the tremor . Rico Dibrivell was rescued from the rubble after being trapped for 12 days Mr Preval said 200,000 tents were needed before the expected start of the rainy season in May . His call came as donor nations and organizations met in Montreal , Canada , to assess the aid effort . In an interview with the BBC , the president 's wife , Elisabeth Preval , appealed for patience as criticism grew about the government 's response to the disaster . `` The president is working 24 hours a day , continuing to assess the damage , trying to direct the aid relief where the Haitian people need it '' she said . She added that the administration had been overwhelmed by the disaster , but that ministers had managed to get on to the streets on the day of the earthquake to assess the damage . The president , who lost his house in the quake , is planning to move into a tent on the lawn of the destroyed National Palace in the center of the capital . The Haitian government wants to relocate some 400,000 people , currently in makeshift camps across the capital , to temporary tent villages outside the city . But aid workers warned that if the camps were too big they could pose security problems , including robberies , rapes and gang activities . Meanwhile , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she `` resented '' criticism of American assistance to Haiti . She pinpointed some media outlets which had `` either misunderstood or deliberately misconstrued what was a civilian and military response '' .

Now it is a wreck , with what few items of furniture he has been able to salvage stacked neatly in a corner . `` The way things are now , '' he says . `` It 's like we are waiting to die - I 've got nothing left . '' His next-door neighbor Jerry , a pensioner , feels the same . He gestures towards a pile of rubble 50m -LRB- 164ft -RRB- away . Deep beneath the debris are almost certainly buried his neighbor and her two young children . More than 1.5 million people have been left homeless by the quake Nearly every Haitian you meet has a similar story to tell . These men are among more than one and half million Haitians left homeless following the earthquake . In Leogane , the epicentre of the quake , 50km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- south-west of the capital , Port-au-Prince , streets have been reduced to dust , and many people , like Wilmer , are not expecting help from the government . It is a government that barely exists now , and which before the earthquake , was mistrusted by many because of high levels of corruption . I 'm not going to wait for the government to help me But across the road from these men , modest rebuilding efforts are already under way . Pierre Paul Guerrier used to run the local brewery . Although the place has been flattened , along with two of his other houses , he has sold what furniture he has been able to salvage and has begun to rebuild the place . `` I 'm not going to wait for the government to help me . As you can see I 'm rebuilding the foundations here , to stop any rainwater from coming in . '' In the coming months Haiti 's seasonal rains will begin . So the drive towards reconstruction is a race against time . The Haitian government needs billions of dollars in assistance to begin the mammoth task of rehabilitating the country . In March a major conference is scheduled to persuade the international community to contribute . Many are hoping this could be the chance to give the poorest country in the western hemisphere , a fresh start . The finance ministry building is among those badly damaged by the quake But few Haitians have any illusions about the challenges that lie ahead . In Port-au-Prince , almost the entire seat of government has been destroyed . The government revenue office is a sea of rubble and tax forms , and the ministry of finance is a crumbling wreck . Miraculously the central bank seems to have survived relatively unscathed , but it is surrounded by twisted metal , cars mashed between concrete slabs and huge chunks of stone . Bulldozers from Haiti 's ministry of public works have started to shift some of the rubble in the main business centres , but if the pace of current progress is anything to go by it is likely to take weeks . The debris is being taken to a waste site on the edge of town , ready to be reused when the reconstruction work begins . Do n't be fooled by the fact that this looks like business as usual In the worst hit areas , crisis teams have been scrambled from among Haitian professionals and local government chiefs , determined to take a lead . Their job is to determine the need for the weeks and months ahead . `` Schools will be a priority , '' says Leogane deputy mayor Vincent Saint Juste . `` We also want to rebuild the churches and health clinics . This is a city where 90 % of the buildings were destroyed and the remaining ones are unsafe . So we have to start from scratch . It 's a city that has to be totally rebuilt .

The figures above seek to measure an earthquake in terms of the energy it releases . The scale used to measure earthquakes is unusual . For example , the difference in strength between an earthquake of magnitude five and a magnitude six earthquake is much more dramatic than a rise of just one unit would suggest . In fact a magnitude six earthquake possesses 32 times more energy than a magnitude five quake , as seismologists use a logarithmic scale to record these natural disasters . That means that a gap of two steps , from five to seven , represent an earthquake nearly 1,000 times stronger . Those quakes likely to cause the most destruction measure 7.0 and above . The 2004 earthquake which triggered the Asian tsunami was the third biggest quake since 1900 . There are an estimated 20 major quakes in the world every year according to the US Geological Survey . The Haiti quake measured 7.0 and because the epicentre was so close to the ill prepared capital , Port-au-Prince , the damage was severe , and over 200,000 people died as a result . The death toll in Haiti is in stark contrast to the magnitude 8.8 earthquake that struck Chile in February 2010 where less than 1,000 people died . Chile has a long history of strong earthquakes . The largest recorded earthquake took place there in 1960 . It measured 9.5 and was also followed by tsunamis .

At one point , they lowered a doctor - dangling by his feet - into the narrow tunnel they had cut , to attend to the young woman . Unfortunately , her arm - trapped under a concrete beam - had to be amputated before they could extract her . A Peruvian team managed to pull Maxine Fallon from the remains of a flattened school on Sunday . The UN and the host country decide when to call off the searches for those trapped , and to focus instead on looking after the survivors . The average time for this switch is between five and seven days . Individuals have been known to survive up to 13 days trapped if they have access to water . Ms Fallon said she had prayed fiercely for someone to find her . `` I had hoped I would be rescued , '' she told CNN . Reporters said she was drifting in and out of consciousness when she was freed . Rescuers went to the scene after buried survivors begged for help via text messages . It is unclear if the messages came from Ms Fallon , or if others were still waiting to be rescued nearby . Rick Santos , a 47-year-old aid worker , said he felt `` moments of just joy '' after being pulled from the debris of the Montana hotel on Friday , some 50 hours after he and four colleagues were buried there . He told the BBC they spent three `` very dark nights '' trapped in the dust and darkness , with only one lollipop - which they passed around . Mr Santos , who heads IMA World Health , said he `` ca n't begin to describe '' how he felt after he was rescued by French firefighters . `` I looked up and saw stars and that was amazing . Then I called my wife and said ` Sweetie , I 'm out ' - and she said , ' I know , I saw you come out on TV ' , '' Mr Santos told the BBC World Service . Also rescued along with Mr Santos was Sarla Chand , a 65-year-old physician from New Jersey . But two of their colleagues were not so lucky - they later died of their injuries . `` I want to remember them , '' said Mr Santos . `` A lot of people died and we are praying for them too . '' NAZER AND FRANGINA , CHILDREN IN DELMAS The moment six-year-old Nazer Erne emerged in the arms of a rescuer On Sunday , five days after the quake hit , American rescuers managed to save two children trapped under the rubble of a collapsed home in Port-au-Prince 's Delmas neighborhood . A six-year-old boy , Nazer Erne , was pulled out first , looking gaunt and covered in dust . But he smiled to the paramedics from his stretcher , saying he felt fine . Medics say he had chipped his tooth . Soon after Nazer , the team from South Florida pulled out a 14-year-old girl , named Frangina . As she was carried away by medics , she cried out that a third child buried in the house along with them had died . JENS KRISTENSEN , DANISH UN WORKER Jens Kristensen emerged without a scratch on him Also on Sunday , crews rescued the UN 's Danish civil affairs officer , Jens Kristensen , who was found fully conscious under the wreckage of its five-storey headquarters in Port-au-Prince . `` It 's a miracle really that he has been drawn out , alive and no damage at all to his body , '' his mother , Hanne Tranum Kristensen , told the BBC 's World Today program from Denmark . More than 300 UN employees are missing - many still buried in the rubble of four UN facilities around Port-au-Prince . Frances Gilles managed to call a relative on his mobile phone An Israeli rescue team managed to cut a small tunnel through the ruins of the national tax office to save its administrative director . Frances Gilles , 59 , was freed after eight hours of painstaking and dangerous effort . He said he had heard voices and cars for days , but had lost the strength to shout . `` I think I am privileged and my rescue is like a miracle because at one time I thought I would be abandoned , '' he told the BBC . Mr Gilles had managed to call a relative from his mobile phone , giving his exact location . A seven-year-old girl survived more than four days in a supermarket that collapsed around her , the New York Times reported . Rescuers said they heard a small voice from deep in a pile of rubble at the Caribbean Supermarket in the Delmas neighborhood late on Saturday . American and Turkish rescue workers then reached the girl , who said she had made it through with hope and by snacking on the supermarket 's dried fruit rolls . UK firefighters pulled two-year-old Haitian girl Mia from the rubble where she had been trapped for three days . Officers from the city of Manchester said the operation was `` lengthy and difficult '' in Haiti 's searing heat . She was trapped beneath piles of rubble when her kindergarten totally collapsed . Chief Officer Mike Thomas said : `` This is what we do the job for . The conditions we are working in are pretty dire . This is a real bonus to us all . '' Mia 's rescue came a few hours after Spanish rescuers pulled another two-year-old child , Redjeson Hausteen Claude , from the rubble . Covered with dust , he seemed to smile as he was reunited with his mother . TARMO JOVEER , ESTONIAN UN PROTECTION OFFICER Many of the thousands of UN peacekeepers , diplomats and development experts who live and work in Haiti were among those affected by the earthquake . At least 100 are still missing . Tarmo Joveer was given water via a rubber tube On Thursday US Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the tale of one UN staff member found beneath the rubble of the international body 's collapsed headquarters in Port-au-Prince . Estonian protection officer Tarmo Joveer , Mr Ban said , was only found after `` scratching sounds '' were heard and was kept alive by being `` given water through a rubber pipe '' . He was eventually rescued from where he was trapped , beneath some 4m -LRB- 12ft -RRB- of rubble . `` It was a small , small miracle during a night which brought few other miracles , '' he said , adding that Mr Joveer had been taken to a hospital in Argentina for treatment . JILLIAN THORP , US AID WORKER , AND HER HUSBAND , FRANK Frank Thorp , a US citizen in Haiti , says he drove about 100 miles -LRB- 160km -RRB- to Port-au-Prince immediately after Tuesday 's earthquake to rescue his 23-year-old wife Jillian , an aid worker . Jillian Thorp was trapped underneath about a foot of concrete `` I 'd spoken to her on Skype for about 10 seconds , she said that she was trapped . And that 's all that I knew . It was absolutely terrifying , '' Mr Thorp told CBS 's Early Show . Mr Thorp says that their entire house - a three-storey concrete building - had collapsed and Jillian and one other person were trapped under 30cm -LRB- 12in -RRB- of concrete . We had to plough bricks and bricks and bricks ... and doors and metal away for at least an hour before we were able to get her and her co-worker out `` I jumped into the hole and I was able to see her wave her hand ; I could n't see her whole body ... I could hear her voice ... '' He said his wife was saying : `` Just get me out of here ! '' `` We had to plough bricks and bricks and bricks ... and doors and metal away for at least an hour before we were able to get her and her co-worker out , '' he said .

We will not have to start from zero but from below zero , '' he said . The UN 's assistant secretary-general for peacekeeping operations , who is acting head of mission in Haiti , described the logistics of the relief operation as a `` nightmare '' , but said those involved were still managing to improve their capacity to provide the help needed . `` All this is coming together right now , '' he said . `` Every day you can see more and more Haitian national police on the ground , working with our troops and more and more water being distributed , so it 's a matter of time and putting all these elements together . '' He said areas around Port-au-Prince were being prepared for the creation of tented settlements for the homeless currently living in makeshift camps . Edmond Mulet said all of Haiti 's recent development had been undone The Inter-American Development Bank -LRB- IDB -RRB- was working with UN and Brazilian engineers at one site near Croix-des-Bouquets that would house around 30,000 people , and four other sites had been identified , he added . Mr Mulet said 200,000 heavy-duty tents had been ordered to cope with Haiti 's rainy season , which typically begins in May , and its hurricane season , which is expected to start around June . `` Of course , 200,000 family-sized tents - solid ones that can withstand a hurricane season - are not available in the market just like that , so they have to be made . It 's going to take a few days and weeks before they can arrive , but all this is coming , '' he added .

We look at the short and long-term priorities . The UN World Food Programme -LRB- WFP -RRB- has warned that while the relief effort in Haiti is beginning to gain its footing , providing food for more than two million people a day represents the most complex task it has ever faced . Relief agencies have tried to buy goods locally and regionally , but such efforts have been hampered because local markets affected by the earthquake have been slow to reopen , and Haiti 's subsistence farms have been unable to ramp up production . This has forced the WFP to use nearly all of its stores of high-energy biscuits and nutrient-rich meals which do not require water . Aid agencies will begin to distribute staple foods such as rice , beans , vegetable oil and salt - instead of just emergency ration packs - once cooking equipment has been distributed widely and safe water supplies have been established . There is an acute shortage of drinking water in areas affected by the earthquake . The water supply system , which before the disaster only provided 40 % of the population of Port-au-Prince with clean water , has effectively collapsed . Massive quantities of bottled water have had to be flown into Haiti Aid agencies are shipping in massive quantities of bottled water and distributing water purification tablets . Many people , however , have complained that they have received little , if any , of either . The rapid response phase is expected to last two months and will need to be followed by longer-term activities , such as providing reliable water supplies for rebuilt homes and new settlements . The main challenges are post-operative care and logistical support to the health facilities in terms of fuel and medical supplies , according to the UN humanitarian agency OCHA . Haiti 's ministry of health and the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- is revising its emergency response strategy and will gradually shift the focus from emergency surgical cases to primary health care . `` Priorities are changing , and there is more need for post-operative care and follow-up . But there is still little capacity to help patients who need that follow-up care , '' WHO Director Dr Mirta Roses said on 25 January . Among the most urgent needs are those of thousands of Haitians who had amputations as a result of injuries . `` These people will need physical rehabilitation as well as mental health services . That means more nursing and mental health personnel and more physical therapists , and of course the right equipment for these kinds of programs , '' said Dr Roses . Among the most urgent cases are the thousands of Haitians who lost limbs Doctors fear many amputees will languish or even die without proper rehabilitation . As the emergency phase of the disaster winds down , there is a pressing need for mobile and community-based clinics that can provide such services as maternity care , post-operative care , and treatment for chronic health problems including diabetes , heart disease , HIV , and tuberculosis , the WHO says . Forty-three of the 59 hospitals , are now functioning , but they are having difficulty meeting the demand for health services , especially as the emergency medical personnel who arrived after the earthquake head home . Also important is establishing surveillance networks to detect outbreaks of communicable diseases , a significant threat at the makeshift camps . The International Organisation for Migration -LRB- IOM -RRB- says work is under way to improve the living conditions of the estimated 692,000 people in makeshift shelters in 591 camps in Port-au-Prince , until more durable solutions are found . More than 235,000 people have taken advantage of the Haitian government 's offer of free transportation to cities in the north and south-west . The IOM estimates that 100,000 family-sized tents are needed urgently Although the IOM had 10,000 tents stored in Haiti before the earthquake and has a further 30,000 abroad that will arrive soon , it says `` the supply is unlikely to address the extensive shelter needs '' . The UN agency estimates that 100,000 family-sized tents are needed to house about 500,000 people , but the UN says up to one million require shelter . Meanwhile , work has begun at the sites identified by the Haitian government for the establishment of organised tented settlements . It is estimated that each settlement will accommodate up to 10,000 people . However , tents can not be set up and displaced people relocated at the sites until they have water and sanitation facilities . Tent settlements can only provide a short-term solution , officials say , particularly with the hurricane season expected to start around June . Haiti is likely to need billions of dollars to build new homes and government buildings in Port-au-Prince and the surrounding area , which were densely-populated before the earthquake . Many of the buildings that collapsed were poorly designed and built - mostly with concrete and often without steel reinforcement and foundations . There is a clear need for higher technical standards to be used during reconstruction . Many of the buildings that collapsed were poorly designed and built But Haiti 's government , along with many planning and architectural experts , have also called for a new strategy that will help Haiti build for the future , including reducing Port-au-Prince 's population density and replacing slums on unstable hillsides with homes that are safe , affordable and sustainable . A new comprehensive building code that complies with international construction standards will be a priority . Cletus Springer , the director of sustainable development at the Organisation of American States , said that for this to happen the authorities would have to work with the private sector and banks to help low-income families . `` Because of the poverty levels , not everybody 's going to be able to build to the exacting standards that a building code would require , '' he said . In the short-term , the United Nations Human Settlements Programme -LRB- UN-Habitat -RRB- is carrying out a rapid structural damage estimate of buildings in the affected area . Jean Yves Barcelo , the agency 's adviser in Haiti , hopes it will start planning for new settlements and at the neighborhood level within a week or two . Experts warn that desperate residents of the poorer areas of Port-au-Prince may begin informal and unregulated reconstruction before a long-term reconstruction plan can be instigated . The lack of investment in Haiti 's rural economy over the past three decades has led to an average of 75,000 people moving to the capital , Port-au-Prince , every year . Since 1982 , the city 's population has grown from 750,000 to more than 2.5 million . The rapid expansion was not planned and resulted in overcrowding , inadequate infrastructure , and the proliferation of slums containing scores of poorly-built homes , many of which were destroyed by the earthquake . Haiti 's ambassador to the US envisages a smaller , better-built Port-au-Prince Key official buildings - the presidential palace , parliament building , police headquarters and 13 of the government 's 15 ministries - were also destroyed . Many experts say that Port-au-Prince should be reduced in size when rebuilt , and Haiti 's economic and government activities decentralised . Some have even suggested relocating the capital altogether . Hundreds of thousands of people have already left the city for tented settlements or family homes in other parts of Haiti . Many say they should be persuaded to stay . Experts warn , however , that mass-relocation schemes after other disasters have usually failed because they isolate people from the jobs and economic opportunity that drew them to the city in the first place . While the main airport in Port-au-Prince was not put out of action by the disaster , it was not equipped to deal with the volume of flights required by the relief effort . The US military has taken over control of the airport To speed up the process , the US military took over control of the airport and 160 planes a day are currently able to land . Aid flights are also coming into and out of the Dominican Republic and several other regional airports in Haiti . Port-au-Prince 's main port was also badly damaged and other ports in the area could only accept smaller vessels . One of the two piers in the capital 's docks was recently reopened by the US Navy , allowing bulkier shipments to be delivered by sea . At present , 150 containers can be unloaded a day . The transportation of aid by road continues to be hampered by piles of rubble and the volume of people trying to move out of or around the capital . But the UN Development Programme -LRB- UNDP -RRB- has begun employing local people to clear roads . Telephones and internet connections were down in many areas of Haiti for some time . The situation has since improved , with emergency radios distributed and limited internet and phone capacity restored . Experts say large-scale capital investment , led by the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank , will be needed to bring the road , electricity , water and telephone systems up to standard , and rebuild Port-au-Prince 's seaport and airport . There has been concern about the security situation in Haiti , with fears that people not receiving aid would turn to violence . US troops have been tasked with some security responsibilities In a bid to boost security and assist the relief effort , the UN Security Council is increasing the UN stabilisation mission in Haiti -LRB- MINUSTAH -RRB- by 3,500 troops to 12,651 . Brazil plans to double its current contingent of 1,300 . The EU is also deploying 150 officers of its new European Gendarmerie Force to assist the 3,500-strong UN police force , UNPOL , and the Haitian Police Force -LRB- HNP -RRB- , which has , so far , managed to get half of its 8,000 officers back on the streets . Meanwhile , the US has dispatched more than 15,000 military personnel to Haiti . About 4,700 are deployed on the ground with the rest on ships off the coast . The UN and US military have also set up a Joint Operations Tasking Centre to co-ordinate security in and around Port-au-Prince . The US ambassador to Haiti , Ken Merten , says the rebuilding efforts have to focus on creating jobs and attracting investment to Haiti . Without it , those displaced will need income support or food aid to survive for the foreseeable future . The UN Development Programme has said that as part of the rebuilding strategy , it aims to temporarily employ 220,000 Haitians to work clearing debris and restoring basic infrastructure . A long-term economic strategy prepared by the UN in 2009 that remains valid aimed to create 150,000 jobs over two years by harnessing Haiti 's advantages in clothing manufacturing , tourism and agriculture . International investors had launched a number of big projects before the earthquake and will be encouraged to stay . Economists Paul Collier and Jean-Louis Warnholz , both of whom have experience in Haiti , say there is a need to relocate economic activity away from Port-au-Prince . They propose that the construction of new homes be linked to the generation of new economic opportunities , in areas less prone to natural disasters . This would require the expansion of secondary cities and agricultural modernisation . `` Done right , international intervention can deliver immediate jobs through construction , and longer-term jobs through new enterprises . Done wrong , it will only pour relief into Port-au-Prince , luring in rural migrants from the impoverished central plateau , and further diminishing local food production at a time when it is most needed , '' they wrote in the Financial Times . To guarantee effective management of the funding in a country where the government was overwhelmed before the earthquake , economists have proposed pooling money into a single `` Haiti Fund '' that can be used for development . `` It should receive emergency outlays from the United States and other donors ; organise a board that includes members appointed by Haitian President Rene Preval , the UN secretary general and donors ; and empower a management team to formulate and execute plans agreed to by the Haitian government , '' wrote Jeffrey Sachs , a leading development economist , in the Washington Post . Mr Sachs estimates that annual donations of $ 2bn to $ 3bn will be required over the next five years to cover urgent reconstruction costs and development financing . The head of the International Monetary Fund , Dominique Strauss-Khan , has even gone so far as to call for a new `` Marshall Plan '' , which helped rebuild Europe after World War II , and warned against `` a piecemeal approach '' in Haiti . One of the first steps in the transition from emergency relief into reconstruction and development is food security , and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation -LRB- FAO -RRB- has warned that it is crucial that any damage to agricultural infrastructure must be repaired as soon as possible . FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf says famers must be given immediate support before the spring planting season begins in March . The season , which lasts until May , accounts for 60 % of Haiti 's national agricultural production . Over the past 20 years Haiti has become dependent on food imports , yet around 80 % of the population are involved in agriculture . In the long term , officials hope to develop a rural agricultural strategy that would enable Haiti to become more self-sufficient . At the recent donor conference in Montreal , the US and other nations made it clear that Haiti 's government had to lead the reconstruction effort . The international community also reiterated its support for Haiti 's President , Rene Preval , and its Prime Minister , Jean-Max Bellerive . Mr Preval , who was elected in 2006 with broad popular support , initiated reforms of the police and judiciary with some success , according to Mark Schneider of the International Crisis Group . His government was also able to forge a national consensus on a recovery plan following the devastating hurricanes of 2008 . Nevertheless , the destruction of its ministries and deaths of hundreds of civil servants has meant the government has struggled to take control of the relief effort . Survivors are growing increasingly frustrated by its perceived inaction .

Some photos showed the medics with guns , smiling and drinking during what appeared to be an operation . The pictures were posted on Facebook , but were later removed from the site . Other photographs showed a doctor holding a saw next to a victim 's leg . `` My main concern is the transmission of a pictures of a patient not knowing whether there was an attempt for informed consent , '' Mr Gonzalez was quoted as saying by the Associated Press . The Puerto Rico Association of Physicians and Surgeons said in a statement that some Puerto Rican doctors `` displayed behavior ... that did not meet the highest standards of the medical profession '' . `` We wish to respectfully ask forgiveness ... for the unfortunate events described and widely disseminated , which we are sure added pain and sadness to the enormous suffering , '' the statement added . It said that more than 60 doctors had been sent to Haiti to treat the victims of the devastating earthquake on 12 January .

The BBC 's Rajesh Mirchandani has followed the story of a girl called Lovely . Haiti 's earthquake destroyed not just buildings , but families too . Now in its chaotic aftermath , we drive through the crowded ruins of Port-au-Prince to the suburb of Carrefour , past corrugated tin shacks , now leaning into each other , and narrow side alleys choked with debris . We are looking for one small child , trapped not by rubble but by bureaucracy . At an orphanage I show them a photograph of a girl called Lovely . It was given to me by the American couple who are hoping to become her new parents . At home in Los Angeles , Janelle and Bryan Benedict showed me a video they took when they last visited the girl last summer . They have been working through the lengthy adoption process since Lovely was six months old . She turned two on the day of the earthquake and their anguish was clear . `` I worry about her , '' says Janelle . `` About the fear she is experiencing . We just want to get her out of there as quickly as possible . '' But they are in a difficult position . Like hundreds of other Haitian orphans , Lovely 's adoption papers were stored in government buildings that collapsed in the quake . At the orphanage where Lovely lives , dozens of children have parents overseas , desperate to get them out . Most seem oblivious to the destruction around them . Their smiles light up their faces - and ours . Lovely is malnourished and has an infection on her arm Lovely is carried out to meet us . She is tiny through malnourishment , her arm bears the sores of an infection and her eyes barely register our presence . But what horrors she must have seen . The 70 or so orphans here all survived the quake . We see only the front of the building but it does not look seriously damaged , and the level of care seems good . But two sister orphanages in Petionville and Leogane were badly damaged and those children are now here , a house overcrowded with tiny evacuees . There are also American parents staying here . They felt they could speed up the evacuation of their little ones by coming here in person . They need the Haitian government to give its stamp of approval for the children to leave . But an already lumbering bureaucracy has been knocked off its feet . Confusion reigns and leads to delays . The buses drive through the airport gates and straight on to the tarmac . This is what happens when the Americans speed things up In addition , some aid agencies are calling for a halt to adoptions , because they believe the earthquake has provided an opportunity for child traffickers . With papers lost , it 's harder for would-be parents to prove they were already part of the adoption process before the earthquake , and the worry is criminals could take advantage . That means Lovely and hundreds more children must wait and endure . The next day we visit the US embassy , guarded by armed American soldiers . They patrol outside and across the street , weapons on show , even though this is foreign soil . Reporters are tolerated , Haitians moved on . We see more than 100 people queuing in the blazing sun to get in . More on nearby street corners , being corralled by US troops . Many hold yellow manila document envelopes . The US says it is cutting through red tape to speed up existing adoptions . Many want to go , but many are turned away . I encounter a large group of very emotional women , all of them Haitian Americans who have traveled back to try to get loved ones out . But they tell me officials wo n't let them bring all their family members back to America . Mireille Plaisimond , from New York City , shows me some US home ownership papers - proof , she says , that she can support the four children she wants to take back to America . Other flights have taken Haitian orphans to new homes in France Christiane Joseph angrily brandishes her US passport , while Sandra Joseph Marquis from Florida wails : `` what is the point of being a US citizen if our government wo n't help us ? '' It is clear that emotions are running high in the dusty heat of Haiti 's collapse . While we are at the embassy , I get a text from a man called Randy Presley from Oklahoma . On my way to Haiti I had met him and his adopted Haitian daughter Eliana . They were on their way back to rescue her four-year-old brother Christopher . Now Randy tells me they and 40 more orphans are inside the embassy unable to get out of the country . He says they have been there for three days , sleeping on mats on the floor , refusing to leave . Several hours and many confused text messages later -LRB- our phones do n't work to make calls -RRB- , he tells me they are boarding buses for the airport . More armed guards appear at the gate and then two buses pull out of the compound . On board are Randy , his family , and 40 more Haitian children and their carers are on their way to a new life . They wave as we draw alongside . `` We made it , '' Randy shouts out of the window as they speed past . We follow as the buses drive through the airport gates and straight on to the tarmac . This is what happens when the Americans speed things up . Next to a giant US military cargo plane is a passenger jet . It has been privately chartered by a Mormon group , many of whom are adopting Haitian children . The plane flew in the night before , loaded with supplies . The plane ... is a frenzied scene , the cabin echoing with the wails of nervous children The children were supposed to be on it then , but were held up . The pilot refused to leave without his precious cargo . Now , there are no delays . Clutching documents that say `` evacuated orphan '' , the children and their carers clamor to board the plane . One woman stands on the steps to the cabin clutching her adopted baby girl . She looks around , choking back tears , as if taking in this scene of destruction for the last time . Then we are told that Lovely may be among this group . We board the plane and start looking . It is a frenzied scene , the cabin echoing with the wails of nervous children . `` Is that relief on your face ? '' `` For the ones that made it , yes , but for the ones I had to leave behind , no , '' she says . Many of the children from Lovely 's orphanage are here , but we ca n't see her . I show her photo around . Some people think they have seen her , others do n't know . We get off the plane as the last children board . Still no sign of Lovely but we are sure she is in this group . A US official tells us she has seen the girl and will take us to her . We walk across the tarmac , away from the plane , through the terminal building and out to the front where a row of white tents stand , covering several people in hospital-type clothes . They are all cradling tiny children . Lee Everton from Utah Hospital Task Force is holding her . She is sleeping peacefully . `` The Haitian government did n't stamp her papers , '' he tells me , his eyes puffy and red . `` Does that mean she ca n't get on ? '' She must go back to the orphanage while Haiti 's crumbled bureaucracy runs its course . Her new life in America must wait . I am dreading telling her parents . As I pull out my phone , I see Bryan Benedict has already e-mailed me . They are crushed by this setback , he tells me . All the while , Lovely has remained fast asleep in Lee 's arms . At least she is unaware of the chaos around her .

It 's good news , another day without clouds means another day without rain . But it wo n't last . Everybody knows the rainy season is now only a few weeks away , and a million people have no proper shelter . A park on the edge of Port-au-Prince is sprouting what look like giant white field mushrooms . They are actually large white tents , hundreds of them . It 's the first proper tent encampment to be built since the earthquake . Along a high concrete wall workers are digging latrines , and building shower blocks . In a few days from now 3,000 refugees from the center of Port-au-Prince will start moving in here . But they will be the lucky few . Despite repeated calls from everyone - from UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to Haitian President Rene Preval - only a few thousand tents have so far arrived in Haiti . Mr Gascon says there are simply not enough tents `` The priority for flights has been given to bringing in food and medical supplies , '' says Christopher Gascon from the International Organization for Migration -LRB- IOM -RRB- . He is in charge of building the mushroom tent camp . He has 40,000 more tents on their way from Panama , but by ship , not by air . And even when those do arrive , they will not be nearly enough . It seems extraordinary , but so vast are Haiti 's needs that there are simply not enough of the right sort of tents in the world right now to house all the refugees . `` We are talking about a huge number of tents , '' says Mr Gascon . `` These sort of tents are not widely available . They will have to be made , ordered from China . If you want 200,000 tents now its not going to happen , they are not there . '' There is also chaos and confusion . The aftermath of every natural disaster is chaotic . But Haiti is especially so . Every aid agency and non-governmental organization -LRB- NGO -RRB- in the world seems to have poured in to Port-au-Prince . In the UN compound next to the airport clean-cut young men and women strut around in T-shirts proclaiming `` Scientologist Volunteers '' . In a bar across the street a group of Belgian men are drinking beer . Outside their large white lorry has a banner draped across it with the name of their own tiny environmental NGO . `` We want to help , but the World Food Programme says they already have enough water trucks , '' they tell me . But if the UN base is chaotic , it 's nothing to the Haitian government compound . It 's housed in an old concrete police station just down the road . The car park is crammed with large four-wheel drives jostling for position and hooting loudly . We manage to track down Charles Clermont , the Haitian official charged with building the mass tent cities that will supposedly house the hundreds of thousands of refugees from Port-au-Prince . `` We started work the day after the earthquake , '' he assures me , `` the first camp will be up and running within the next few days . '' Surprised , I ask him where it is . `` It is on the outskirts of the city , there is running water and there will be electricity and spaces , it will be operational within a few days , '' Mr Clermont says . Intrigued , I take down the details of the location and head out of town . The place is an empty stretch of highway that runs out to the mountains north of Port-au-Prince . One thing is immediately clear , there is no camp . Instead on a stony hillside we come across one of the most extraordinary sites I have ever seen . Hundreds and hundreds of people , camping in the open . As soon as I get out of the car a crowd surrounds me . One young man speaks English . Broadcasting on FM radio daily in Haitian Creole at 0910 local time -LRB- 1410 GMT -RRB- , for 20 minutes Giving up-to-date information about where to get basic services and aid Also available on satellite and online , and via social media I ask him where he sleeps . `` On the ground , '' he answers , pointing to a patch of dirt further up the hill . I ask him if he has had any help , any food or water . `` No , '' he says , `` we have nothing . '' Further on I find a young mother and her seven children squatting in a tiny shack they have fashioned out of sticks and old blankets . One of her children has a huge bandage around his hand . `` He had two fingers amputated after the quake , '' the mother says . Nearby Salnar Devoisie is lying on a makeshift bed . Her daughter is platting her mass of gray hair . There is a white bandage around the stump of her left leg . `` I was trapped in the rubble of my home for three days . When the Israeli doctors got me out they said we will have to chop it off or you will die , '' she says . As we talk she rubs her hand against her chest as if in pain . `` It is gas . I have n't eaten for four days . '' Despite the massive response from the outside world these people are still waiting for help to arrive . And for nearly a million Haitians the coming night will be another night spent in the open .

Gordon Brown announced the move , which should help some 2,000 families , at a charity poetry reading for Haiti in London on Saturday . The 5,700 sheets cost # 35,000 and were bought from the # 20m the UK government has allocated to the relief effort . They will be shipped to the stricken country next week . Between 100,000 and 200,000 people are thought to have died in the devastating earthquake which struck Haiti on 12 January . Up to 1.5 million people have been left homeless and humanitarian organizations fear for their safety with the hurricane season only a few months away . So far , the UK Disasters Emergency Committee 's -LRB- DEC -RRB- appeal has raised # 60m for the country . Mr Brown said supplies of corrugated iron from the UK would be used to provide Haitians with `` the hurricane-proof shelter that they so urgently need '' . The materials weigh more than 55 tons and will be transported on RFA Largs Bay along with other urgent relief supplies . The role of a poet is the extraordinary extent of your empathy The Department for International Development said in a statement it had `` worked with our suppliers to purchase as many of these sheets as could be manufactured to the required standard in the time available '' before the ship sails . The government said it was `` considerably cheaper '' to ship iron from the UK than purchase it in Haiti 's neighbouring country , the Dominican Republic . The prime minister announced the move as he told the Poetry Live fundraiser on Saturday that helping Haiti was `` the test of our humanity '' . The event at Methodist Central Hall in Westminster was organised by Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy and featured readings from 22 of the country 's leading poets , including Andrew Motion and Gillian Clarke . Christopher Reid , who won the Costa Book of the Year Award earlier this week with his collection of poems A Scattering , also took part . Duffy told the audience the world owed a `` duty of care '' to the population of Haiti and must do something `` more ample , more generous , more human '' to help . Former poet laureate Motion said : `` There 's an idea lurking somewhere in the background that poetry feeds itself by not being very practical , and in all sorts of ways that 's true . `` But if people will pay good money to hear poetry being read then of course it 's a good idea . '' Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy organised the fundraising event The prime minister , who was accompanied by his wife Sarah , thanked those taking part in the event . He said : `` People ca n't survive by words alone , or shelter in verse or place their children in the cradle of a sonnet . But the role of a poet is the extraordinary extent of your empathy . `` You know that poetry does what ordinary words can never do themselves alone . Instead of narrowing our view of the word , poetry broadens and deepens our understanding . '' He added : `` Wherever and whenever there is injustice , wherever and whenever there is unfairness , suffering , and wherever there is harm in the world , we will be there to help people around the world . '' The DFID said it was also giving # 1m in funding for the International Organisation for Migration and # 400,000 for relief agency ACTED to provide shelter and sanitation for earthquake survivors .

For me , the opportunity to throw myself into working on a program that was solely focused on helping Haiti was nothing short of an answered prayer . That is because I have several special connections of my own with Haiti . I have many close friends from Haiti from the early part of my career in Miami . And Haiti was also the first country I traveled to as a young Cuban-American journalist on a foreign reporting trip in 1991 . The first thing I had done that first night of the earthquake - before the idea of going to Miami to work on this program was even conceived - was pick up the phone and call the house in Miami of Marcus Garcia , a former Haitian colleague with whom I had traveled to Haiti on that first trip nearly 20 years ago . One of my oldest friends told me she did not sleep for four days until she heard that her mother had survived Marcus , I was certain , would have lots of important news to share with me and would no doubt be able to help me understand the full scale of the disaster . His son , Michel , answered the phone and I proceeded to introduce myself and say that , as he would imagine , I wanted information from Marcus on the earthquake . Michel sounded extremely upset . He told me that , in fact , he was desperately trying to get hold of Marcus , who was in Haiti . He said he could not get through and was agonising because he did not know what had happened to him , or his mother or any other family members . At that point , something hit me , which remains with me to this day . This disaster had touched every single Haitian inside or outside the country . Every Haitian family has been affected by the disaster I felt horrible . A wave of sadness mixed with embarrassment consumed me as a journalist for having called at such a crucial time . In the end , it turned out that my friend Marcus had survived . But his wife had died and their house , everything that was so dear to them , had been destroyed . A flood of images came to me of their beautiful and chaotic city , Port au Prince , which he and another Haitian colleague , Elsie , had introduced me to all those years ago - images that were buried somewhere in my memory . In the two weeks that have followed , not a day has gone by that I have not heard about another friend whose relative - or entire family - has perished in the quake . I distinctly remember a few days ago , getting into the studio to talk down our digital line to Port au Prince to Mario Delatour , one of our new program 's correspondents . He told me he actually lived in Washington . So , was he in Port au Prince simply to cover the story , I asked ? No , he replied . He had had to return because his parents were killed in the quake . Millions of Haitians will have to try to rebuild their lives Many of the Haitians living here in Miami or elsewhere around the world have faced unimaginable agony in trying to get in touch to find out about their loved ones . One of my oldest friends , Magi Damas , a Haitian-American filmmaker , told me on the phone from New York how she did not sleep for four days until she heard the news that her mother had indeed survived . Outside of Haiti , there are hundreds of thousands more like her . Inside Haiti , there are millions who are trying to get on with their lives and find a way out and back from the devastation caused by the earthquake - not only in Port au Prince but to so many other cities in Haiti , like Leogane and Jacmel . Our program 's aim is to help the survivors cope , to learn to move on and to rebuild . I think the well known Haitian musician , Jan Sebon , put it best . He was speaking on Connexion Haiti , in a regular segment we have on the program in which a musical artist dedicates one of their songs to the Haitian people listening back home . Jan said that he believed the time for counting the dead had passed , as hard as it might be to accept . It was now time to move on and to stop focusing on the destruction - as painful as it might be and to try to find a way to rebuild . If , through our broadcasts , we can help contribute to making that transition towards rebuilding possible then I think we will have succeeded .

Doctors had planned to amputate his crushed leg in the coming days after he was trapped in the rubble of a three-storey house but they have pumped him full of antibiotics and given him extra blood . It 's hard enough in Haiti having both -LRB- legs -RRB- let alone just one Now they have changed their mind . They can salvage the limb after all . For the 22-year-old , an avid football fan , his odds at returning to a relatively normal life have just improved dramatically . `` I was terrified I was going to lose my leg , '' he says . `` It 's hard enough in Haiti having both of them let alone just one - I do n't think I would have lived very long . '' It is estimated that some 2,000 people have had limbs amputated as a result of the earthquake . Many suffered crush injuries or quickly spreading infections which made amputations the only means to survive . But , like many surgeons , Tony Redmond from the British medical charity Merlin says he is trying to fathom why the figure is so high . `` I 've worked during other disasters but nothing like this , '' he says , speaking from Emmanuel 's bedside . `` What we are faced with now are thousands of patients who need prosthetic limbs and rehabilitation . Once the dust has settled , as an international medical community we really do need to look at this . '' At the central hospital in Port-au-Prince , the sea of tents transformed into neat wards house hundreds of patients nursing bandaged stumps . Some 2,000 Haitian earthquake survivors have had limbs amputated Charity workers are handing out crutches to patients as they leave . One young woman wobbles out through the main gate , trying to adapt to this new world . Back inside the hospital , dazed and depressed , is 29-year-old Pierre Michelle , a bus driver . Stricken with grief over the death of his wife and two young children , he is also trying to come to terms with the loss of his right leg , amputated four days after the earthquake . The doctors never explained why the surgery was needed . `` I was supposed to die , '' he says . `` Life has no meaning for me any more . I know people are ready to help me but how much can they really do ? '' The prospect of returning home to his sister-in-law 's house offers Mr Michelle some comfort but he knows in a country already gripped by high unemployment his prospects look bleak . Charities like Handicap International have been busy starting rehabilitation efforts on the patients , promising that truckloads of temporary prosthetic limbs will soon be on their way . But many veterans of disasters fear the scale of this earthquake will overwhelm such well-meaning organizations because the numbers needing help are simply so great . There are at least 2,000 people who lost their limbs in the Haiti earthquake - a figure far higher than a similar disaster in Pakistan five years ago , explains Celia Du Pre from Handicap International . There are fears that amputees will not receive proper aftercare She treated patients in that emergency and says the key to success is to get them enrolled onto rehabilitation programs quickly and re-integrate them back into the community . But communities have been shattered since the Haitian earthquake and health facilities and health staff have been wiped out in places . Although there have been huge acts of kindness between strangers in the worst tragedy this country has ever experienced , in true Darwinian fashion it is the fittest who fare best when it comes to food queues . One of the immediate challenges is to ensure that those disabled by the earthquake are not pushed to the back . `` I am 100 % certain that Haiti does not have the human resources to cope in the longer term , '' declares Dr Henriette Chamouilles , country director for the World Health Organization in Haiti . `` We do n't have enough physiotherapists ? . We need to make sure we have medical supplies and ensure patients who 've lost their limbs are registered with us , so we do n't lose them . '' For the moment , the scale of the disaster has made amputations big news but Dr Chamouilles is among the many who fear that , without long-term international support , it will slip off the agenda and Haiti 's handicapped survivors will be forgotten .

Only women will be able to collect the aid from 16 centres , exchanging vouchers for sacks of rice to give to their children and families . The aid effort comes as 10 Americans were detained by Haitian authorities . They are suspected of trying to take more than 30 children out the country without proper authorisation . Haitian Social Affairs Minister Yves Christallin said police had arrested five men and five women traveling with 33 children on the border with the Dominican Republic . `` This is an abduction , not an adoption , '' Mr Christallin said , according to Agence France Presse . The mistake we made is we did n't understand additional paperwork was required But the BBC 's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes , in Port-au-Prince , says the Americans could be in deep trouble as some of the children may not be even orphans . An international charity , SOS Children 's Villages , which is now looking after the children , says at least one of them , a little girl , said her parents were alive . George Willeit , the spokesman for the aid group in Port-au-Prince , told journalists the girl said she had believed she was being taken to a boarding school or summer camp . Mr Willeit said many of the children were also found to be in poor health , hungry and dehydrated . One of the smallest , just two or three months old , was so dehydrated she had to be taken to hospital , he added . Haitian authorities said none of the children , some as young as two months , had documentation or proof that they were actually parentless . The leader of the Idaho-based group , Laura Silsby , said the arrests were the result of a mistake . `` Our understanding was that , we were told by a number of people including Dominican authorities that we would be able to bring the children across , '' she said . `` The mistake we made is that we did n't understand there was additional paperwork required . '' But our correspondent says the regulations are very clear - each case of child adoption must be approved by the government . Karen Allen , BBC News , Port-au-Prince In the grounds of a former children 's hospital , in one of the worst-affected areas of Port-au-Prince , there is a queue of about 200 women snaking around the building . It 's all very orderly - the women are coming in and collecting a bag of rice which is to be shared between two families . Some distance away , behind security tape , the men are being held back . The reason is that , in the past , food distribution points have been trigger points for potential violence and scuffles . The UN estimates that up to a third of the population will be reliant on some kind of relief in the months to come . Even before the earthquake , he adds , child-smuggling was a massive problem in Haiti , with thousands of children disappearing each year . In the capital Port-au-Prince , the UN 's World Food Programme -LRB- WFP -RRB- has begun feeding families - distributing food only to women - at a series of 16 sites across the capital . Each woman will receive a 25kg -LRB- 55lb -RRB- bag of rice , enough to feed her family for two weeks . Only women will be allowed to collect earthquake relief supplies , because - the WFP says - this has proved that is the best way to get food to the people who need it . The WFP will work with the local authorities to ensure that men in need of assistance are not excluded , it said . `` Up until now the nature of this emergency has forced us to work in a ` quick and dirty ' way simply to get food out , '' said Executive Director Josette Sheeran . `` This new system will allow us to provide food assistance to more people , more quickly through a robust network of fixed distribution sites . '' The WFP says it has reached 600,000 people with over 16 million meals since the earthquake , amid huge logistical problems caused by damage to local infrastructure . Meanwhile , doctors working to treat survivors voiced concern over the US halting the evacuation of the critically injured to the country . Dr Barth Green , Dr Cathy Burneit and Dr David Pitcher describe difficulties in Haiti A senior US medic told the BBC that scores of people injured in the earthquake could die if the US did not resume emergency evacuations soon . `` The consequences - in the kids with crushed chests and on ventilators and respirators , and some of the adults - are they will die , '' Barth Green , a senior American doctor at a field hospital in Port-au-Prince airport , told the BBC . The US military stopped the flights to Florida on Wednesday . A White House spokesman told the BBC the move was due to `` logistical issues '' , not because of a row over medical costs as had been reported earlier . Hundreds of patients with spinal injuries , burns and other wounds have been evacuated to the US since the 12 January quake that killed up to 200,000 people .

They say the Americans were held on the border with the Dominican Republic . The group from Idaho-based charity New Life Children 's Refuge told the BBC they wanted to take quake orphans to an orphanage in the Dominican Republic . But Haitian police said the Americans had no papers authorising them to take children out of the country . They have not yet been charged . Haiti imposed new controls on adoptions to prevent child trafficking after the 12 January earthquake that killed up to 200,000 people . The Americans are being held at a police station next to the airport in Haiti 's capital Port-au-Prince . They told the BBC that their arrest was a mistake and that they were going to take a group of earthquake orphans to an orphanage set up across the border . They said they thought they had had a permission to travel to the Dominican Republic . `` This is an abduction , not an adoption , '' Haitian Social Affairs Minister Yves Christallin was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency . `` What is important for us in Haiti is that a child needs to have an authorisation from this ministry to leave the country , '' Mr Christallin said . He added that the children involved were aged two months to 12 years . The earthquake destroyed a number of Haitian orphanages and crippled relevant government agencies . Local officials have expressed fears that child traffickers will take advantage of the situation to smuggle children abroad .

Human stories and human connections are what brings the reality home to you . When I heard about Haiti 's earthquake , it was horrifying to discover tens of thousands of people had died , with many more injured or homeless . But amidst my overall feeling of shock and distress , I was particularly concerned about one person , Gerald Oriol , a disability and community activist who contributed to the World Report on Disability and Rehabilitation , on which I work at WHO - the World Health Organization . Gerald is a young disabled man working for a voluntary organization called Fondation J'Aime Haiti . I was put in touch with him via a humanitarian colleague who had met him in Port-au-Prince . My friend told me that , because the roads are so bad in Haiti , the UN sometimes would fly Gerald around the country in their helicopters , so he could support disabled people in outlying areas . After some emails back and forth , Gerald wrote his testimony for the World Report . Despite having never met him , I felt a connection , and so it was for him that I was most anxious , as soon as the news came through of the quake . I was encouraged to see that his website was still online , until I realized it is probably hosted outside the country . I emailed , and hoped for the best . Disabled people are among the most vulnerable when disaster strikes . They may be left behind in the evacuation of buildings . Environmental barriers - such as destroyed roads and pavements - are a greater obstacle to those with mobility issues . People who require regular medication or treatment are likely to lose out . For those disabled people living in emergency shelters , latrine arrangements may be inaccessible . And where food aid is distributed in refugee camps , disabled people are often at the back of the queue and so may go hungry . Evidence shows , for example , that many of those who died in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina were older or disabled people . The same goes for the Boxing Day tsunami , and other natural disasters . At WHO , we are trying to mainstream disability . In other words , rather than leaving the issue to a small specialist team , the hope is that all the technical departments address disability issues in their work . One of the clusters at WHO is Health Action in Crisis , and they were among our earliest collaborators . Together , we are working with an NGO to prepare a checklist for relief coordinators , to alert them to the particular vulnerabilities of disabled people . The next step is to promote training , so that humanitarian staff can be prepared and will understand what to do . There may also be a need to stockpile supplies so that disabled people 's specific needs are met and that emergency aid can include catheters , insulin or other regular medications , as well as the usual food and drugs . Emergencies are not just about immediate response , but about reconstruction and recovery . In the aftermath of a disaster , there is a huge need for rehabilitation services , so that people who experienced lasting injuries can return to active life . Many people in Haiti will have experienced paralysis , head injury , amputations and other traumatic injury due to the earthquakes , not to mention emotional distress arising from shock and bereavement . The only chink of light in the darkness is that perhaps , if sufficient aid is forthcoming , reconstruction efforts for homes , public buildings and other infrastructure will result in better and more barrier-free facilities than before . Every day since the quake , I have been hoping to hear a response from Gerald . When I woke up this Sunday , I checked my email again . This time , I was so relieved to get an email direct from him in Port-au-Prince . He wrote to me and other supporters : `` There is no word to describe the scope of the catastrophe in Haiti . The people are under extreme distress and face considerable challenges and needs -LRB- drinking water , food , shelter , medical attentions , etc. -RRB- . However , in this time of crisis , the people of Haiti have shown great solidarity and patience . For the past two days , I and the rest of the team have been working with a few disadvantaged communities in Port-au-Prince . Together with the communities , we have been burying corpses to avoid the spread of possible diseases . We have also been providing transport to medical centers ... Terrible , just terrible but we must muster all our strengths . On a personal note , my immediate family is safe . I have not yet reached the extended family ... however , many friends have perished . Thanks and take care ! Let us be strong for Haiti .

Would like to see more articles like this please . And very glad to hear that Gerald Oriol has survived this dreadful catastrophe . I would be interested to learn more about his work and those of other international campaigners . "}, {"uid": "693", "dct": "2010-01-31", "dates": [], "text": ""}]
