CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : Political protests in Egypt , the aftermath of an attack , and a music megastar who 's using his fame to raise awareness about a disease . All of it 's coming up in this Wednesday edition of CNN Student News . I 'm Carl Azuz . AZUZ : The place : Washington , D.C. . The event : An annual address to the nation steeped in history , and the response to it . U.S. President Barack Obama and U.S. Representative Paul Ryan , a Republican from Wisconsin , both took to the airwaves last night . CNN Student News brings highlights tomorrow . If you wanna watch the complete speeches , CNNStudentNews.com ! You 'll find 'em in the `` In Depth '' box . Click on `` State of the Union . '' Now , while we 're on the subject of State of the Union , we are breaking down the history of the speech for you right now . First stop : U.S. Constitution , Article II , Section 3 . `` The president shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient . '' Now , that 's what the Constitution requires ; there are a lot of things that are traditions that are not required by the Constitution . For one , this address does not have to be annual , though a yearly speech dates back to George Washington . It does n't need to be in person . In fact , our third president , Thomas Jefferson , had the speech delivered in writing to Congress . And the State of the Union does n't need to be made at a congressional session of both Houses , though that 's what we see every year , and what we saw last night . Here 's why the State of the Union address is delivered in late January or early February : the 20th Amendment . It was ratified in 1933 , and it specifies that congressional terms start on January third and presidential terms start on January 20th . So , it 's when everyone is seated in office that the speech is given in late January or early February . A little history for ya : President Coolidge was the first president to broadcast the speech over the radio ; that was back in 1923 . His nickname was `` Silent Cal , '' but he was n't silent then ! President Truman was the first on TV with the speech in 1947 . And this is around the time it started being called `` State of the Union '' instead of the president 's annual message to Congress , as it was known before that . And in 2002 , President George W. Bush became the first president to deliver the speech on the web . AZUZ : The members of Arizona 's congressional delegation were all planning to sit together for last night 's State of the Union address . But they were going to leave one chair empty in honor of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords . She was one of the victims of a shooting we told you about earlier this month . She 's recovering from her injuries , and she 's getting a lot of support . CLASS , HOUSTON , TEXAS : Get well soon , Ms. Giffords ! AZUZ : Those well wishes came from students in Houston , Texas . A lot of people in that community were sending their best wishes and signing `` get well soon '' cards for the Arizona representative . She was transferred to a hospital in Houston late last week . Doctors say that Giffords is doing well and showing lots of improvement , but that she has a long road ahead of her . TOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : See if you can I.D. Me ! I 'm an African country that 's home to more than 80 million people . My national currency is the pound . I border two seas , the Mediterranean and the Red . I 'm Egypt , and my current president , Hosni Mubarak , has been in power since 1981 . AZUZ : Russian President Dmitry Medvedev says that whoever is behind Monday 's suicide bombing at Moscow 's busiest airport will be found and will be punished . The attack killed dozens of people , injured more than 150 others . And sadly , this bombing is n't an isolated incident . Over the last decade , trains and planes around Moscow have been bombed at least four times . President Medvedev said that part of the blame for Monday 's attack is on the people who were responsible for the airport 's security . RUSSIAN PRESIDENT DMITRY MEDVEDEV -LRB- TRANSLATED -RRB- : What happened at Domodedovo shows that the airport lacked security . It 's unbelievable that such a huge amount of explosives was brought into the terminal . Those officials responsible for security at Domodedovo must be punished for their decisions . This is a terror attack , a grief , a tragedy . AZUZ : President Obama called President Medvedev yesterday to offer his condolences about the bombing . During that same call , he congratulated the Russian president on the progress toward a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty , or START . This would reduce the number of nuclear weapons in both the U.S. and Russia . Presidents Medvedev and Obama signed the treaty last April . Part of Russia 's parliament approved that treaty yesterday . The U.S. Senate did the same thing last month . President Obama calls the START `` the most significant arms control agreement in nearly two decades . '' JOHN LISK , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Today 's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Sheets ' American History classes at Glades Middle School in Miramar , Florida ! What part of the human body produces insulin ? You know what to do ! Is it the : A -RRB- Liver , B -RRB- Kidneys , C -RRB- Pancreas or D -RRB- Lungs ? You 've got three seconds -- GO ! Your pancreas makes insulin , which helps control your body 's blood sugar . That 's your answer and that 's your Shoutout ! DR. SANJAY GUPTA , CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT : The Jonas Brothers have been one of the most successful young acts for the past several years , having sold millions of records and entertaining audiences all over the globe . They just completed a world tour about a month ago , which took them from the United States to Argentina , Brazil , Europe and the United Arab Emirates . Now , shortly after the group signed their first recording contract , Nick , the youngest Jonas Brother , was diagnosed with Type I , or juvenile diabetes . NICK JONAS , JONAS BROTHERS : I was diagnosed in November of 2005 . So , I was about 13 . I lost 15 pounds in a total of about three weeks , which was a bit startling considering I only weighed about 105 pounds to start with . GUPTA : Nick was told his blood sugar was over 700 . A normal level is below 125 . JONAS : My commitment to myself when I was on my way to the hospital was that I would not let this slow me down . GUPTA : Nick has learned to live with his disease and has n't let it get in the way of the Jonas Brothers ' success . Two and a half years after his diagnosis , on a day when Nick says his blood sugar was a little out of control , he wrote a song about having diabetes . He says writing `` A Little Bit Longer '' was therapy for him , and fans have told him it 's helped them cope as well . JONAS : I think just the fact that I can say , look , you 're just like everybody else , you can do what you want to do , and you can do it with diabetes , that 's the best thing in the world . GUPTA : Jonas says he is thankful to be able to do what he loves and uses his fame to educate people about the disease . With the Jonas Brothers Change for the Children Foundation , Nick has been raising awareness and funds for diabetes research for several years now . JONAS : What we can do financially is great and I 'm always happy to do that , but if there is something that I can do personally to inspire or encourage somebody , that means the world . AZUZ : Before we go , during a timeout at a women 's college basketball game , one of the school 's officials was randomly chosen from the audience to try a half-court shot . Mr. Showoff decides he 's gonna do it backwards . There 's no way this is going to work , right ? He won a set of brand new tires in the process . Now , we could n't make sense of a pun about a backwards basket . AZUZ : I mean , we gave it a shot , but it just went over our heads . Gosh , we just never tire of this . Signing off for the next 23 hours and 50 minutes , this ... is ... Carl Azuz . I may just read it on the air . Have a great one !

BECKY ANDERSON , HOST : We 're getting the first word of casualties in Egypt , as thousands braved tear gas to demand a change at the very top . I 'm Becky Anderson in London . First , Tunisia , now Egypt -- two dead in clashes on the streets , but the U.S. thinks it 's too early to worry . HILLARY CLINTON , SECRETARY OF STATE : Our assessment is that the Egyptian government is stable . ANDERSON : Not if you ask these people , or , indeed , the opposition leader that we spoke to . That interview coming up in the show . Barack Obama gets set to make one of the most important speeches of his presidency , with the economy center stage . And making sense of extreme weather around the world -- a CONNECT THE WORLD special coming up this hour . That 's CNN in the next 60 minutes . But we begin with the largest public outcry for democratic reform in Egypt in decades -- some say ever . Young and old , Christians and Muslims , students and professionals all came together for protests inspired by Tunisia 's recent popular revolt . Demonstrators want to seize on the momentum for change -- a moment in history they do n't want to let slip by . The tens of thousands in Cairo and other cities demanded the ouster of long time president , Hosni Mubarak . Many are fed up with poverty , corruption and life under Egypt 's emergency law , which limits freedoms and allows police to arrest people without charge . Well , some protesters threw stones at riot police , who fired back with tear gas and water cannon . In the past , fears of police retaliation have largely kept a lid on these kinds of protests , but not today . Our own Ben Wedeman was right in the thick of it and he called the demonstrations unbelievable , like nothing he 's ever seen in all his years covering the country . And he joins us now live from Cairo with more -- Ben . BEN WEDEMAN , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Yes , Becky , this really shocked everybody -- the press , the protesters . Nobody really imagined that they would get this big . In fact , I had that moment of realization . We were driving in a taxi under one -- underneath one of the bridges that comes across the Nile . And then I looked up and the bridge was full of thousands of people , mostly students , crossing over into the heart of Cairo . They joined other protesters in Tahrir Square , which is the main square . There were well over 10,000 people there , all of them calling , as you said , for the ouster of the government of President Hosni Mubarak , in power since 1981 . We saw , as they clashed with the police just two blocks from the Egyptian parliament , protesters throwing rocks , the police throwing rocks back and then starting to fire with some very strong tear gas . Now , even now -- and it is 11:00 at night in Cairo -- there are still thousands of people in that main square saying that they 're going to continue to protest until their demands are met . But what 's really interesting is that these protests have had no religious overtone . We 've seen Muslims and Christians , farmers and students , office workers , factory workers , men and women , all sorts of people , joining in this demonstration , which has got to be the biggest one many of us have ever seen in Egypt -- Becky . ANDERSON : Ben , social media reportedly playing a part in galvanizing support for today 's protest . On Twitter , for example , the Egypt protests one of the most popular topics and people are using the hash tag @jam25 and @egypt to communicate with each other . Is it clear how significant a role the online world has played in rallying people onto the streets today ? WEDEMAN : Becky , the -- the online activism has always been an interesting part of Egypt . But until now , we would tend to see a lot of online activism that never really got translated into street action . And today , though , I think they 've really crossed that rubicon . What we 've seen is that this demonstration was , indeed , organized by two online groups working together that spread the word , as you said , through Facebook with one of those Facebook groups getting more than 300,000 followers . And word -- it spread , also , by word of mouth , by SMSes , so that , you know , we were really expecting little , small pockets of demonstrations , 200 or 300 apiece . So when I saw thousands of people pouring into the heart of Cairo , I realized that this was not your run of the mill demonstration . And clearly , Twitter , Facebook , SMSes played a huge role in helping organize this -- Becky . ANDERSON : Ben , you 've been recently in -- in Tunisia , covering what has become known as the Jasmine Revolution . How does what you 've seen on the streets and what you 're hearing in Cairo compare to what you heard and saw in Tunis ? WEDEMAN : Well , I worked in Tunisia during the time of the old regime , of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali . And it was a much more repressive regime than the one in Egypt . You know , there , you really could n't talk in public about politics . The press was very strictly controlled . Here , you have a much more liberal press . Egyptians are free to say whatever they want . The line is drawn when they start doing what they want , when they start holding demonstrations . So there 's -- there 's a big difference . On the other hand , you do have many of the same ills of society , so to speak , in Egypt that existed in Tunisia . You have a declining economy . You have rising costs of living . You have a lot of corruption within the government and , of course , you have a president who 's been in office for longer than most Egyptians have been alive . So there are important differences , but important similarities , as well -- Becky . ANDERSON : Ben Wedeman reporting from Cairo . Ben , thank you for that . Egypt 's foreign ministry spokesman said it 's important to put these protests into perspective . He says the demonstrators represent only a fraction of Cairo 's population . And he says it 's telling that they were even allowed to openly protest against the government . HOSSAMI ZAKI , EGYPTIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN : This country has known freedom much unprecedented in this region , in Arab countries , at least . This is something that has not been seen -- protesters being protected in the street , not being harassed , not being killed in the streets , like we have seen recently by -- by other regimes . This is a totally different situation . So we have to put things in perspective and not allow over zealots to qualify the situation by things that they 're -- that it is not . So we have to be very careful here . ANDERSON : Why do n't we just qualify what was said there after that interview , in fact , reports that one protester has died and another policeman has died to date in those protests . Well , the United States , an ally of the Egyptian government , says it believes the country is stable despite the unrest . Security -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sounded confident today in Egypt 's ability to address the people 's grievances . This is what she said . CLINTON : We support the fundamental right of expression and assembly for all people . And we urge that all parties exercise restraint and refrain from violence . But our assessment is that the Egyptian government is stable and is looking for ways to respond to the legitimate needs and interests of the Egyptian people . ANDERSON : Well , one of Egypt 's top opposition leaders takes issue with Hillary Clinton 's remarks that the Egyptian government is stable . I talked earlier with Mohamed ElBaradei , a former head of the UN 's nuclear watchdog who is now at the forefront of a push for political change in his country . MOHAMED ELBARADEI , FORMER IAEA CHIEF : I was stunned to hear , you know , Secretary Clinton saying that the Egyptian government is stable . And I asked myself , at what price is stability ? Is it on the basis of 29 years of martial law ? Is it on the basis of 30 years of a codified regime ? Is it on the basis of rigged elections ? That 's not stability . That is living on a borrowed time . Stability is when you have a government that is elected on a free and fair basis . And we have seen , you know , how the election has been rigged in Egypt . We have seen how people have been tortured . And when you see today almost over 100,000 young people getting desperate , going to the streets , asking for their basic freedoms , I expected to hear from Secretary Clinton stuff like , you know , democracy , human rights , basic freedoms -- all the stuff the U.N. is standing for . ANDERSON : I want to just show our viewers a Tweet from you from a couple of days ago . And I quote : `` Threats of violence against participants in peaceful demonstrations reveal the ugly face of a regime terrified of its own people . '' Mohamed , you 've been encouraging people to take to the streets . ELBARADEI : Because I 've been , Becky , trying for a year to engage the regime through peaceful means by collecting signatures on demands for free and fair elections , for opening the door for Egyptians to run for the presidency , for having a parliament that 's representative of the people . When you have a parliament right now that have opposition of 3 percent , you 're already insulting the intelligence of the people by trying to say this is a democratic system . ANDERSON : I wonder whether it 's responsible to encourage people to took to the streets in protests that could cur -- turn deadly and also wonder why you have n't , Mohamed , taken part ? ELBARADEI : Well , I did n't ask for people to took to the street , Becky . This was completely initiated by the young people . I have n't taken part because , you know , I have -- we have to have a division of labor . I - - I ca n't get access to the media while I 'm in Egypt . I 'm completely blocked from getting access to the media . And I think it 's important for me to continue to speak about the plight of the Egyptian people . And , unfortunately , I have to get out of Egypt to be able to speak about the plight of the Egyptians . ANDERSON : Mohamed , let me bring up a Facebook site here , ElBaradei for presidency of Egypt . There are more than 200,000 Facebook fans there , which begs the question , will you run for president ? ELBARADEI : Becky , the priority for me is to -- is to shift Egypt into a democracy , is to catch up with the 21st century , to get Egypt to be a modern and moderne -- moderate society and respecting human rights , respecting the basic freedoms of the people . Whether I run or not , that is totally irrelevant . And I made it very clear , I will not run under the present conditions , when the deck is stacked completely . ANDERSON : Mohamed , was the Jasmine Revolution that we 've seen in Tunisia just the start of things to come in the region ? ELBARADEI : It sent a message everywhere to the -- to the Arab world , Becky , that , to quote Barack Obama , `` Yes , we can , '' you know , that it is -- it is doable . Then that we can be empowered as people to change a system that is ossified , that is completely repressive of our own basic rights . ANDERSON : Do you fear for your own safety at this point ? ELBARADEI : Well , that 's a good question . There was an edict against me , you know , a couple of weeks ago basically saying that my life should -- should be dispensable because I am defying the rulers , you know . So I have no security when I -- when I go to Egypt . I -- I 'm going to Egypt in the next few days . And this is a good question , Becky . But , you know , you have to be with your people . ANDERSON : Mohamed ElBaradei speaking to me earlier from Vienna . Now , a new prime minister in Lebanon backed by Hezbollah . His offer of inclusion met with outrage by critics . A look at Lebanon 's uncertain future and present day fury , up next . Also this hour , U.S. President Obama 's second State of the Union Address just hours away . By the end of the day , they just may be calling his speech the state of the U.S. economy . And then a half hour CONNECT THE WORLD special from the bottom of the hour on the world 's wild weather . We 're going to ask experts if this current period of weather extremes is the new normal . I 'm Becky Anderson in London . We 're back in 60 seconds . ANDERSON : Well , in just under five hours from now , U.S. President Obama will deliver his second State of the Union Address . Yet while the president will talk of investing in America 's future , many will be looking to see whether he can reverse the debilitating spending patterns of the past . It 's a tough balancing act . In just a few minutes , we 'll look at whether Mr. Obama has what it takes to achieve it . I 'm Becky Anderson in London for you . You 're watching CONNECT THE WORLD this hour here on CNN . And a look at the other stories that we are following for you . And a dramatic shift in the balance of power in Lebanon triggers a day of rage . Hezbollah 's choice for prime minister has been tapped to form the next government . He says he 's extending his hand to all factions . But as Nic Robertson now reports , that did n't stop Hezbollah opponents from taking their fury to the streets . NIC ROBERTSON , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , within minutes of being announced as interim prime minister , Najib Miqati came on television saying that he was extending his hand to all political leaders to join him in a government he says he wants to focus on people 's issues and economic issues . But we 've already heard from outgoing prime minister , Saad Hariri , that he will not be part of that government , which throws into question how influenced will this government be by Hezbollah . Hezbollah 's leader appeared on television today , saying that if Hariri does n't want to be in this government , that means he only wants power to himself . But what we 've seen through the day is Saad Hariri 's supporters coming out on the streets in some violent demonstrations in the north , in Tripoli , burning a satellite truck belonging to the news network , Al Jazeera ; in Beirut , as well , clashes between the army and stone-throwing Hariri supporters . But this evening , it seems that the temperature is going down on those demonstrations . Not far from here , early evening , a relatively peaceful demonstration of Hariri supporters , several hundred of them . But they 're all saying that they 're not going to give up on their support for Hariri and what they want , the investigation into the -- his father 's , Rafik Hariri 's death . However , under this new government that 's been proposed by -- that 's being proposed by Hezbollah , it does seem very likely that Lebanon will end its support for the U.N. special tribunal on Lebanon and the investigation into Rafik Hariri 's death . It 's not fixed yet , but that 's the anticipation here . Nic Robertson , CNN , Beirut , Lebanon . ANDERSON : Well , the Russian president , Dmitry Medvedev , says lax security at Moscow 's Domodedovo Airport allowed a suicide bomber to sneak in and kill 35 people on Monday . A hundred and fifty-two others were wounded . Well , Mr. Medvedev says airport officials in charge of security must be punished . He adds : `` Russia will step up security measures at airports , employing tactics now used in the U.S. and in Israel . '' President Vladimir Putin vowed harsh retribution for those who planned the attack . There are reports that investigators believe a woman from the Muslim North Caucasus Region set off the bomb , but that can not , as yet , be confirmed . Well , first we heard reports that Palestinian Authority negotiators had offered to give Israel a significant part of East Jerusalem . Now it is a big concession over what 's known at the right of return . Al Jazeera news network is reporting more leaked documents uncovering secret peace talks , documents the Palestinian Authority characterizes as -- and I know that -- `` distortions and lies . '' Kevin Flower with an update for you . KEVIN FLOWER , CNN JERUSALEM BUREAU CHIEF : The second wave of leaked documents dubbed the Palestine Papers by the Al Jazeera news network were released late last night and their impact continues to be felt in the West Bank , the Gaza Strip and beyond . The most recent documents appear to show that Palestinian negotiators privately agreed to accept a very limited right of return for the some five million Palestinian refugees and descendents who were forced or fled from their homes in the 1948 war that created the state of Israel . Specifically , the documents suggest that Palestinian Authority officials agreed to a , quote , `` symbolic return of refugees numbering at just 1,000 a year for the course of 10 years . '' The right of return is a hugely sensitive topic for both Palestinians and Israelis and it remains one of the key sticking points in achieving a peace deal . So making concessions on the issue from either side carries huge political risk . ANDERSON : Well , a British football commentator has been acknowledged after making sexist comments about a female match official . In a statement , Sky Sports said Andy Gray 's contract had been terminated for what they say is unacceptable behavior . The football pundit was caught twice on tape making derogatory comments about assistant referee , seen here , Sian Massey . And the Oscar nominations are out . And `` The King 's Speech '' leads a crowded field , with 12 nods . The movie chronicles King George VI 's struggles with stuttering and the Australian man who used unorthodox methods to treat him . And a look for you at all 10 nominees for best film . You 'll see `` The King 's Speech '' up there at the top . Moving down , you 've got `` The Fighter , '' `` True Grit , '' `` Black Swan '' in there , `` The Kids Are All Right '' and right down to `` Winter 's Bone '' . Here are the best actress nominees . Among them , Nicole Kidman and Natalie Portman and dark horse choice , Jennifer Lawrence . Best actor nominees including Jeff Bridges , Colin Firth and the Academy Awards co-host , James Franco . The winners will be announced in Hollywood on February the 27th . You 're watching CONNECT THE WORLD here on CNN . I 'm Becky Anderson in London for you . Up next , he walks to the podium later tonight with some Democrats and Republicans sitting side by side . But will President Barack Obama 's second State of the Union Address be well received by both parties ? And what about the Tea Party ? We 'll have a preview from the White House for you . After that , batten down the hatches -- extreme weather across the globe . You 've seen it . You 've heard it . We ask if it 's here to stay . ANDERSON : Well , how do you keep America competitive in a changing world ? Well , that is the question that U.S. President Obama will attempt to answer tonight when he delivers his second what 's known as a State of the Union Address . Now , Mr. Obama is expected to call for new investment in education and innovation to help create jobs . Yet the president will also have to prove to a divided Congress that he is serious about cutting the deficit . Let 's kick off with Dan Lothian for you . DAN LOTHIAN , CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Well , this is a very important speech for the president , which he will be delivering later tonight . The broad themes that the White House says the president will be focusing on , job creation , not only in the short-term , but in the long haul . The president also will be focusing on deficit reduction . And then two key words that they 've been throwing around here at the White House quite a bit we 'll also here during the president 's speech -- innovation and competitiveness -- how to help the United States succeed and win on the global stage . I 'm told by a senior aide that the president will be rolling out a plan on how to win . Some of those things we 've heard before . Others , though , I 'm told will be new concepts . And then one other thing in tradition from these State of the Union Addresses the president will always honor some guests by inviting them to sit in the first lady 's box . This year is no different . We 're being told that the family members of the 9-year-old girl who was shot in Arizona have been invited , along with one of Representative Giffords ' doctors from Arizona and also a young man , an intern for Representative Giffords , who 's being hailed a hero . His name is Daniel Hernandez . All of them have been invited to watch the speech from the first lady 's box . Dan Lothian reporting from the White House . Well , CNN , of course , will have live coverage of U.S. President Barack Obama 's State of the Union Address . For our European viewers , it all starts at 2:00 in the morning London time , 3:00 a.m. . And wherever you are watching in the world , you can work out the time from those , at 2:00 GMT , of course , in London . While the U.S. continues to talk of investment , in Britain , the government is pursuing a very different policy . Yet even before a severe program of spending cuts could take effect , there was some worrying news today for the U.K. economy . Unexpectedly , the nation 's GDP shrank by 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 . Britain 's finance minister blamed the weather . GEORGE OSBORNE , U.K. FINANCE MINISTER : It was the coldest December for 100 years . People could n't get to work . And that 's had a bigger impact than anyone forecast . But if you look at areas not so affected by the weather , like manufacturing , they are growing . There 's an important part of rebalancing the British economy . And if we were to abandon our budget plans and not face up to the debts , as the way that Labor suggests , then we would be back in a financial crisis that would be a disaster for Britain . And this government is not going to be blown off course by bad weather . ANDERSON : All right , well , despite Mr. Osborne 's defiance , some fear the U.K. 's economy may not be strong enough to withstand the government 's tough austerity measures . Richard Quest is at the World Economic Forum all week in Davos in Switzerland . And earlier , we talked about the significance of today 's contraction in the U.K. ahead of these pretty severe spending cuts . This is what he said . RICHARD QUEST , HOST , QUEST MEANS BUSINESS : The U.K. is the laboratory rat , the experimental territory , if you like , for austerity , the poster child for measures designed to cut budget deficits . That 's why everybody is looking at the U.K. economy , which is by no means the most important in the world . But what Cameron 's governing coalition has done is put such strong austerity measures in place and now , potentially , seeing even the reaction of -- on confidence , that that 's been the big question and talking point . Having said that , this weather anomaly , Becky , is so unusual and so congenital -LRB- ph -RRB- and so obscure that we really do n't know what the long-term effect would be . ANDERSON : What we do know is that we will hear from President Obama today , much talk of not austerity , but stimulus measures again . Is that correct , do you think , at this point in the economic cycle ? QUEST : I think President Obama 's job is to walk this very difficult line between talking up the economy but also recognizing , as both sides do , that there has to be some form of cutback . Now , once you 've said that cut , we can all -- they can all agree on that . And then the differences of opinion begin . Interestingly , Becky , you may -- it may not have been noticed too much today that the IMF , in its latest revision to global economy , does say that the stimulus package and the increased quantitative easing from the Fed has played an important role in keeping the U.S. economy going . But on the political front tonight , with the State of the Union , it really is a case of everyone saying something must be done but I 'm not going to do it . Davos really sort of kicking off tomorrow morning , Wednesday , in Switzerland . What do you expect to be the key talking points , Richard ? And how will this austerity versus stimulus argument play , do you think ? QUEST : I do n't think it will . I do n't -- I think the -- the issue now is quite clear . There has to be cuts to government spending . There has to be a transference of debt from government back to the private sector , as the private sector has to start pulling economies out of the mile -LRB- ph -RRB- that they 're in . There 's pretty much agreement on that . The timing may be the issue . Where I think Davos is going to play a major role is how -- they 're going to talk , obviously , about the food crisis ; but also , handling this shift in global growth from the developed to the developing economies , the -- the , if you like , from the West to the East , North to the South . But that is going to be what people are talking about here . ANDERSON : Richard Quest in Davos . Do remember , you can see the State of the Union Address , of course , here on CNN . You 're watching CONNECT THE WORLD . Up next , a topic that we all talk about -- the weather . It 's made news headlines worldwide in the past 21 months , as it brings destruction and death at frightening levels . Are we simply experiencing freak weather events or is this the future ? We 're going to ask the experts , up next , a special program here on CNN . ANDERSON : You 're back with CONNECT THE WORLD . 2010 has been a deadly year of natural catastrophes . And already , 2011 is seeing its fair share of historic flooding . Why , and what 's being done about it ? Well , in the next 30 minutes , we 're going to take a spin around the globe to look for some answers for you . That is coming up here on CNN in the next half hour . Before we do that , let 's get you a very quick check , as ever , of the headlines at this point . Egypt 's interior ministry says one demonstrator and one policeman were killed during anti-government protests across the country on Tuesday . Thousands of people demanded more freedoms and the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak , inspired by Tunisia 's recent revolution . Anger , also , on the streets of Beirut . Hezbollah opponents declared a day of rage after the group 's choice for prime minister was tapped to form a new government . Billionaire businessman Najib Mikati says he will reach out to all Lebanese factions . Russian president Dmitry Medvedev blames lax airport security for the suicide bombing that killed 35 people and injured 152 at Moscow 's busiest airport . He says airport security officials should face punishment . Prime minister Vladimir Putin vows harsh retribution for whoever planned the attack . And mixed economic news led to a flat finish on Wall Street . The blue chips slid ever so slightly , dropping 3 points to close at 11,977 . Watch out for the State of the Union address later tonight . And -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE : La la la la la -- COLIN FIRTH AS KING GEORGE VI , `` THE KING 'S SPEECH '' : Up comes the royal hand . HELENA BONHAM CARTER AS QUEEN ELZABETH , `` THE KING 'S SPEECH '' : That should quite -- ANDERSON : A scene from `` The King 's Speech , '' which has been nominated for 12 Academy Awards , including Best Picture and Support -- Supporting Actress , Actor , and Supporting Actor . I got that one wrong , did n't I ? Other films to get a Best Picture Oscar include `` The Social Network '' and `` Black Swan . '' Those are your headlines this hour . ANDERSON : From Australia to Brazil , Pakistan , and more . In just the last few months , the world has endured weather events that are historic in their extremes . So , is it a trend , or are these events near outliers , a matter of coincidence over time ? Well , welcome to a half-hour special on CONNECT THE WORLD . I 'm Becky Anderson . In the next 30 minutes , we 'll have a report from CNN 's Weather Center examining the data , and perspectives from our correspondents in New York , in Islamabad , and in Rio . And I 'm happy to say , tonight , that we 're joined by two experts , here . Robert Watson charged -- or , chaired the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for five years . He now teaches at the University of East Anglia , a major player in climate research . And from Copenhagen , this evening , we have Bjorn Lomborg . He 's best-known for his book `` The Skeptical Environmentalist . '' He believes that global warming is serious , but not the end of the world . Gentlemen , we thank you for joining us . I 'm going to come to you very shortly . To make sense of what 's been going on around the world , first , let 's take a quick look back , shall we ? REZA SAYAH , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Record monsoon rains and landslides continue to wreak havoc in Pakistan , and the death toll and destruction continue to increase . ANDERSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Summer 2010 . The rainy season that 's also the lifeblood of Pakistan became a killer . The Indus River , swollen by two months of incessant rain , broke its banks , sweeping everything in its path , homes , villages , livelihoods . ANDERSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Nearly 2,000 people were killed , and a further 20 million were affected in what became Pakistan 's worst natural disaster . So sever were the floods , they caused an estimated $ 9.5 billion damage . And today , more than six months on , two million people are still dependent on aid and waiting to rebuild their lives . At the same time , record rainfall in China caused floods and mudslides , which killed more than 3,200 people . All told , some 117 million people were affected . The damage bill , almost double that of the Pakistan flood disaster , estimated at $ 18 billion . According to the United Nations , summer 2010 was deadly for some 56,000 people in Russia for an entirely different reason . An unprecedented heatwave , abnormally high temperatures wilting crops and sparking wildfires . Then , in December , extremes on the other side of the scale . ATIKA SHUBERT , CNN CORRESPONDENT : It 's more travel misery for anybody trying to catch a flight out of Heathrow Airport , today . More than half of the scheduled flights have been canceled today . ANDERSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : A rare , icy blast hit Europe and the United States , grounding flights in the lead-up to the holiday period , stranding motorists on highways and residents in their homes . And just this month , more devastating floods . Queensland in Australia has been hit by what authorities described as an inland tsunami . Entire neighborhoods were swamped in rising waters , which to date have claimed 35 lives . The deluge washing away memories of a decade-long drought in a matter of days and leaving thousands with an uncertain future . ANNA BLIGH , PREMIER OF QUEENSLAND : We 're the ones that they knock down , and we get up again . I said earlier this week that this weather may break our hearts , and it is doing that . But it will not break our will . ANDERSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Australians are still bracing for more floods . The agony continues , too , for Brazil . SHASTA DARLINGTON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : This is the landscape that the rescue workers are having to deal with . As you can see , the rivers still fill up quickly with rain . They have to dig through this mud . They 've got some sniffer dogs out here . But what they 're looking for are bodies . ANDERSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Days of torrential rains have caused floods and mudslides that , so far , have killed more than 800 people . Rescue efforts continue , and sometimes there is success . ANDERSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : But the toll is expected to climb in this Brazilian disaster , just one of many around the world caused by severe weather events . Events the United Nations warns we can expect more of in the future , due to factors including climate change , making it critical to put better plans in place now . ANDERSON : Remarkable stuff when you see it . We 've also seen severe flooding , of course , in the past six months in Colombia , Sri Lanka , and various other places . South Africa , Thailand , the list goes on . So , what is happening ? Let 's bring in our guests . Robert Watson of the University of East Anglia and , of course , Bjorn Lomborg from Copenhagen . A simple question , Robert . What is going on ? ROBERT WATSON , PROFESSOR , UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA : Well , the climate 's always variable . And , indeed , climate change caused by human activities might make it both more variable and more extreme in the future . But as early as last October , there were projections that we would have a cold , early winter in England . And projections there would be intense rainfall throughout Australia or the northern part of Australia , through southeast Asia all the way to Sri Lanka . It 's called a so-called `` La Nina . '' What that does is it -- the waters get very cold off of Ecuador , the Pacific . And this is the probably the strongest La Nina in 100 years . So , this very cold water three , four , five degrees colder than normal , sort of moved towards Australia , but there was warm water up by Australia , lots of evaporation . What goes up must come down , very , very heavy rainfalls in place . ANDERSON : Yes , all right . You 're referencing La Nina . You also alluded , there , to global warming . La Nina , global warming , or something else ? BJORN LOMBORG , AUTHOR , `` THE SKEPTICAL ENVIRONMENTALIST '' : Well , it 's definitely consistent with global warming in the sense that we know that there 's going to be more extreme precipitation , as we saw in Pakistan and Rio and many other places . But what we have to remember is , in our rush , in many green groups and also some of the media 's rush to blame global warming , we neglect the fact that many of these catastrophes certainly have a very large manmade element in the sense that , for instance , in Pakistan , they cleared the upper riv -- forests , which makes flooding more likely . The population of Pakistan has quadrupled over the last 60 years . A lot of people moving in on the flood plains , making it much harder not to have rivers flow over somewhere because they are diked in everywhere . And also , you have poor water infrastructure in Pakistan and many other places . And this is important , because if we say `` this is due to global warming , '' then our tendency will be , as your reporter just said , we should do something about global warming , we should cut carbon emissions . Now , this is a good idea . But trying to help Pakistan and Rio by cutting carbon emissions is an incredibly bad way to help them , fundamentally , because it 's infrastructure that 's the most important part . And because cutting carbon emissions is rather expensive and will really only help a tiny bit in a hundred years . WATSON : Bjorn 's right . It 's a combination of natural climate variability , possibly more extreme events because of human-induced climate change , and bad infrastructure . In many places of the world , we 've denuded our forests , let our hillsides erode and , therefore , it 's a combination of weather and the way we 've managed our infrastructure . So , Bjorn 's absolutely right . We need to take a more holistic view of looking at infrastructure and looking at climate change together . It 's not one or the other , it 's how we manage the system holistically . ANDERSON : We can forecast some of the weather cycles , one assumes . And as Bjorn says , and Bjorn , I 'll bring you in , here , we could probably gauge what will happen if we have , as you say , denuded these areas where people live . Are we doing a good enough job at either of those at this point ? LOMBORG : No , of course we 're not . One of the great examples where there was the hurricane that hit Myanmar , Burma , a couple of years ago . Had these people been informed , they would have had a much better chance at dealing with this , and probably we would n't have seen more than 100,000 lives being perished . So , we need to make sure we get much better information , as Robert also said earlier , we had good indication that much of this was going to happen . We certainly know this for Europe , for instance , in Britain , there was good indications there was going to be a cold winter . And yet , there was very little preparation . Very clearly , this is about saying , in the first instance , let 's prepare better . In the second place , let 's make sure we deal with our infrastructure so we 're much more robust . And , of course , in the third sense , we also need to tackle global warming . But let 's not try to say that that 's the way to help Pakistan or Rio or the other places in the first instance . Let 's take a look at a couple of those . Paul writes , `` Just more hype , '' he says . `` The weather is the weather and is chaotic as ever . The difference between today and former times is that we now know instantly about something happening on the other side of the Earth . '' This is a very good point , I guess . David believes `` It is just the Earth going through a cycle . All the environmentalists want to blame global warming on everything . You ca n't have it both ways . '' Briefly , your thoughts . WATSON : Climate is variable , but there 's actually no doubt the Earth is warming , and we can not explain it on natural phenomena . The only we can explain it is invoking human-induced activities , the way we produce energy and use energy , putting greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere , the way we 've deforested large parts of the world . There 's no question that we humans are starting to change the Earth 's climate . As you do that , we would expect more of these extreme weather events . More floods , more droughts , more heatwaves . So , it 's a combination of manage your energy , managing our land , as Bjorn says , managing our infrastructure . And countries have realized that when you denude a forest , for example , in the Yangtze River in China many years ago , they got the same rainfall as they might have had earlier , but when it was just bare ground , there 's only one thing that can happen , and that 's major floods , displacement of people . So , we have to look at an integrated land-management with the way we deal with climate and weather . ANDERSON : You 're both making very good points tonight . I 'm going to take a very short break . I can see you wanting to jump in at this point , Bjorn . We 're going to talk about the future coming up next . Then , we 're going to ask , historically , how bad are these pictures that we are seeing . Jenny Harrison from the Weather Center looks at some of the key data to break it down for us . Plus , holding government to account . What are people in power doing in response to all this extreme weather ? Our team of correspondents on the ground and our guests in the studio will have something to say on that . That coming up on CNN . ANDERSON : Japan on their way to beating South Korea on penalties in the semifinals of the Asian Cup in Qatar . Now , organizers have announced that they will donate the money from Tuesday 's matches to flood victims in Australia , in Thailand , and in Sri Lanka . They hope to raise $ 300,000 to help people rebuild their lives after the devastation . Just a few of the powerful images that we 've seen from around the world as heavy rains and mudslides take their toll . But historically , how bad are things at the moment ? I want to bring in meteorologist Jenny Harrison from the CNN Weather Center , who 's going to walk us through some of the data . I 'm here for you , Jen . We 're all here for you . JENNY HARRISON , CNN METEOROLOGIST : Yes , you 're right . Let 's take a little look back and actually , let 's start out with , perhaps , the most recent event , which is , of course , the flooding in areas of Australia . We 're heading first of all to Rockhampton . This is the before image , one of those very useful Google Earth images . This particular image taken on the 9th of January . And just look at all this brown area . This , of course , is the areas that are , indeed , under water . But again , when you look at historically -- this is what , of course , we 're trying to discern and talk about right now -- in the year 2011 , 9.2 meters , that was the level of flooding , that was the flood reach -- the flood levels as the reached in along the Fitzroy River . But when you go back historically , not quite as high as years before . 1954 , 1918 , both two very memorable years for the amount of flooding that took place . However , what we saw in the lead-up to the event in 2011 , an extremely wet December , where we saw five times the average amount of rainfall and a tropical cyclone that also came ashore , bringing , of course , those extra amounts of rainfall . Then , in Brisbane , a similar sort of story . Again , a very , very wet December , so some very saturated ground . And then , the Brisbane River , these lines you can see here , the green , the blue , the red , showing you the red line is the major area of the flooding . What happened in 2011 ? This was the level , again , that flood -- that the river actually reached . But you 'll notice these blue areas , these lines here , just above that red . So , six times , as far as we can tell in the last 150 years , the river actually did reach a higher level than that . Now , I 'm going to take you on to Brazil . Now , this , perhaps , more of an event that takes place , shall we say , during the summer months just about every year . We have to the south is the inter-tropical convergence zone . This , here , which is the convergence zone , the South Atlantic . And so , we see these thunderstorms forming along this line just about all throughout the summer months every year . As they tend to , of course , the strongest in the afternoon and the evening hours , the locations can vary very much , but what happened is we saw some very heavy amounts of rain , very , very mountainous topography , of course . And these are the numbers that were affected , in fact . Killed over 800 just recently , you go back to 2010 . And then , 1967 , in a similar region , estimated over 400 people . From there , we just look at Pakistan . This was pretty much an unprecedented amount of rain that fell . During 1956 , in the entire month they did n't see as much rain that came down in 24 hours , 274 millimeters , nearly six times the average amount of rain . Flash floods , of course , but then , that rain had to go somewhere , into the Indus River and , my goodness , it takes a while for that rain , of course , to flow southwards into those open waters , Becky . ANDERSON : Yes , and you 've got our guest , here , nodding away at those facts . Jenny , thank you very much for that . Our two experts with us tonight , Robert Watson , who chaired the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for five years , now a professor , of course , at the University of East Anglia . And Bjorn Lomborg in Copenhagen , author of `` The Skeptical Environmentalist '' and a professor at the Copenhagen Business School . As I say , you were nodding sagely at what Jenny had said . These extreme weather events do occur . They 're natural phenomena . So , we 've seen large floods before , we 've seen heatwaves before . The way we 've changed our landscape , as Bjorn said , has actually made us even more vulnerable to these floods when you have heavy precipitation . What we 're also saying is , in a warmer world , potentially caused by human activities , these types of events will become more frequent . So , we 've seen them in the past , they 're natural events , we 'll se them in the future . The question is whether they 'll become more extreme or more frequent . ANDERSON : Bjorn , what happens -- what do you say when people say to you , `` Hang on a minute , '' you 're talking about global warming , you 've heard what Robert said here , but what about me trudging through the snow this November and December ? I 've never seen anything of the like in the UK . It was one of the coldest winters we 've ever had . LOMBORG : And I think this very well shows the problem of us launching into saying , `` Oh , this is all global warming . '' While Robert is right , that this is partially consistent with what we would expect to see in a warmer world , telling every time we see a heatwave or every time we see a particularly hot summer or a lot of flooding , `` this is global warming , '' then , of course , every time it snows really much , you 're going to have people say , `` Oh , see ? There 's nothing to this global warming thing . '' We 've got to stop having weather as a way of arguing global warming . Global warming is real , it is a problem that we 'll need to face up with . But likewise with -- I do n't know if you remember . Back in 2005 , the big story was Hurricane Katrina and the way that global warming had affected that . But partly , of course , remember we virtually have n't seen any big hurricanes since then . Now , this does n't mean that global warming will not probably slightly affect the impact of really large hurricanes , but it also shows that we end up focusing on the wrong thing . Because if you wanted to help people in New Orleans , should you try to cut carbon emissions -- ? LOMBORG : Or should you build better levees ? ANDERSON : Robert , I 'm going to leave the last point to you . I -- for our viewers ' sake , what is in store in the future ? WATSON : Well , we need to do both , in my opinion . We need to build better infrastructure and address global warming . We need to do that . But he was also right . We can not attribute every heatwave , every storm to climate change . All you can say is , these events occur naturally , and more will occur in the future . So , I believe what we need to do is address the issue of global warming , we do need to cut our carbon emissions , we do need to start to prepare for a warmer world , we need to adapt our road systems , our infrastructure , our agricultural systems , et cetera , so it 's a balanced portfolio of development , both in developing and developed countries , and addressing climate change all at the same time . And , in fact , as I said in October of this year , we did project it would be a cold , early winter . We did project the floods , the types of floods you might see in Australia . The point I would also like to make is , even in a warmer world , human-induced climate change , we will see very heavy snowfall . There 'll still be more precipitation into the atmosphere and it will still be cold enough to snow , so heavy snowfall is still consistent with a warmer world . ANDERSON : Work that one out . Guys , we thank you very much , indeed , for joining us tonight . Devastating floods hit Pakistan in 2010 , what 's the government there doing to limit death and destruction in the future . And what about in Brazil ? Have officials there learned anything from the recent floods and mudslides ? Some lessons for the future , coming up next , here on CONNECT THE WORLD . ANDERSON : With floods threatening human lives around the world , how are animals faring ? In Brazil , this dog lost its owner in a landslide . Ever loyal , it did n't leave her graveside for two days . In Brisbane , this koala is one of the lucky ones . It 's recovering in an emergency shelter while officials race to save other affected wildlife . This baby elephant in Sri Lanka was n't so lucky . Officials believed it drowned when heavy monsoon rains caused a river to rise nearly six meters . And it ended up in a tree . These images from Pakistan , where locals scramble to save their livestock following the deadly floods last August . And this goat leaping to dry land . When severe weather strikes , how does government react , and how are people in power planning for the future ? I 'm going to leave the last word to our reporters from around the world who 've been taking a look for you . DARLINGTON -LRB- on camera -RRB- : I 'm Shasta Darlington in Rio de Janeiro . In response to recent floods and mudslides , the Brazilian government says it 's going to create a nationwide system to prevent disasters and to alert the population quickly when they do occur . They plan to spend $ 6.7 billion to stabilize hillsides and improve the water drainage system . They also want to map out high-risk areas and improve data collection on weather , so they can let people know quickly . Now , obviously , it 's too late for the residents of Teresopolis and Nova Friburgo , these hillside towns north of Rio that were hit so hard . And that was part of the problem , the drainage system . A month 's worth of rain dumped down on these towns in just 24 hours , and the rivers filled up quickly . They overflowed , and the barriers did n't hold . Part of the problem was also illegal construction . Many homes were built illegally on these steep hillsides , and they were just too vulnerable to the mudslides . Part of the solution local authorities have come up with is cutting off the water supply to these regions so that people wo n't be tempted to build there in the future . Nobody denies that the government simply was n't prepared for what 's shaping up to be the worst natural disaster in Brazil 's history . What 's left to be seen is if they will be prepared if there 's a next time . WHITNEY HURST , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- on camera -RRB- : Hi , I 'm Whitney Hurst in New York . Just one month into winter and New Yorkers are already feeling the extreme weather . The National Weather Service says the city has received four times the normal amount of snow , and the city has already exhausted their snow budget for the year . The winter weather has been so bad that New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg has instituted a new 15 point plan to deal with the heavy winter snow . Two of the new measures will include GPS communication devices in every snowplow truck , as well as live video monitoring of troubled spots across the city . With all the snow , ice , and wind , what do New Yorkers make of this extreme winter weather ? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Crazy . I guess it 's the global warming . Things have changed , the weather 's changed . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Well , it 's winter , is n't it ? So -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : A change in the rotation of the Earth by five degrees , which is supposed to happen by 2012 . HURST : No matter what your opinion is about why we 've seen such brutal weather here in New York , as far as the calendar 's concerned , we still have another two months of winter to go . SAYEH -LRB- on camera -RRB- : I 'm Reza Sayah here in Islamabad . The Pakistani government says they 've learned a number of lessons from the 2010 floods . Among them , the importance of the federal government to work more closely with local and provincial governments . The importance of the civilian government to work hand-in-hand with the army . You 'll recall the civilian government was heavily criticized for not being on the same page with the army during disaster relief work . The government has also taken steps to minimize damage the next time a flood hits . They 're working on an early warning system , they 're bolstering disaster response teams in local communities . And they 've also come up with a motto . `` Build back better . '' They want to build stronger structures that will withstand the next flood . But there 's very little time here in Pakistan to think about all these lessons learned , because this disaster is far from over . The Red Cross says four million people are still homeless , millions of others still going without the basic necessities . And the concern here is that much of the world 's attention has shifted away from these millions of people who still desperately need help . ANDERSON : With such extraordinary weather , it 's only natural that we 've seen some extraordinary images during these past months . And that 's what we 're going to leave you with in tonight 's Paring Shots . I 'm Becky Anderson . Thank you for watching this CONNECT THE WORLD special .

Analyst : Tunisia `` a little bit unique '' Time writer says Egypt `` not ready '' for revolution Protesters believe Cairo demonstrations can help trigger change Cairo , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Thousands of people who filled the streets of Cairo on Tuesday hope their demonstrations against corruption and failing economic policies will cause upheaval in the government , like the similar protests in Tunisia that inspired them . But analysts caution that in Egypt , the protesters are up against a different set of challenges . Juan Cole , a Middle East historian at the University of Michigan and blogger , describes Tunisia as `` a little bit unique . '' `` There have been lots of civil wars . There 's been lots of societies in turmoil . But this kind of phenomenon where you had crowds peacefully coming into the streets to demand a change in their own contract with their government -- in the Arab world proper , this is the first time it 's happened and it 's the first time since 1979 in the Middle East , '' Cole told CNN last week . He noted that Tunisia is the `` most secular country in the Arab world . '' Its traditions have favored women 's rights and its Islamist influence is negligible . Tunisia also lacked the oil resources of other Arab states and the ethnic divisions seen in other Middle Eastern countries , which make it harder for opposition movements to unite , he noted . Could Cairo be the next Tunis ? Gallery : Protesters fill the streets in Egypt Looking at the protests Tuesday in Cairo , Mamoun Fandy of the International Institute for Strategic Studies told CNN he was not seeing a `` turning point or tipping point yet . '' Noting the strength of the army , he said , `` The Egyptian system is too strong and too resilient . '' A key question that will show the potential strength of the demonstrations Tuesday is whether hardcore protesters will stay through the night , or whether the rallies will fizzle down , he said . Eric Trager , a Ph.D. candidate in political science at the University of Pennsylvania and a former Fulbright fellow in Egypt , wrote in The Atlantic , `` Egypt 's liberal activists overwhelmingly come from the wired generation of Twitter and Facebook , and this makes them optimistic that pro-democratic movements can go viral , even in a political environment as traditionally illiberal as the Middle East . ... Yet Egyptian activists face tremendous odds -- in particular , an entrenched dictatorship that is determined to discredit the very idea of domino-effect democratization . '' Time.com published a story Thursday from writer Abigail Hauslohner in Cairo headlined , `` After Tunisia : Why Egypt Is n't Ready to Have Its Own Revolution . '' Some Egyptians `` believe the time is now '' for protests to bring about change like in Tunisia , and several people in Egypt have set themselves on fire or attempted to in recent days -- much like the self-immolation of a young unemployed man in Tunisia that sparked protests in that country , '' she writes . `` But in Egypt , it does n't go much deeper than that . '' A greater percentage of Egypt 's population than Tunisia 's lives below the poverty line , she writes . `` The citizens of Egypt regularly complain of a neglectful regime that knows more about torture than it does about public service , and they 're furious with a regime that seems to swallow any domestic profits before they can reach the lower classes . And yet no one predicts a revolutionary reset anytime soon . '' Two factors distinguish Egypt from Tunisia in this respect , Hauslohner writes : Tunisia 's government spent generously on education , creating a frustrated educated but unemployed population . And in Egypt , `` the military stands with '' Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak . Time.com is a partner of CNN.com . Writing in Newsweek , journalist Mike Giglio suggested the `` upcoming protest in Cairo could mark the beginning of another upheaval . '' `` Tuesday will be the first real test of whether the revolution is contagious , '' he wrote in a story published Monday . Many protesters believe their demonstrations will prove to have far more power than naysayers suggest . A Facebook page that has served to help organize Tuesday 's protests in Cairo says , `` Many young Egyptians are now fed up with the inhuman treatment they face on a daily basis in streets , police stations and everywhere . ... Egyptians are aspiring to the day when Egypt has its freedom and dignity back , the day when the current 30 years long emergency martial law ends and when Egyptians can freely elect their true representatives .

People across Egypt took to the streets on Tuesday in demonstrations against corruption and failing economic policies , rallies partly inspired by similar protests that rocked Tunisia this month . Thousands were protesting in the capital of Cairo , according to the `` Front to Defend Egypt Protesters , '' an alliance of lawyers who helped organize the events . At first , witnesses said , the police were restrained in Cairo . But later , they said , police fired around a dozen rounds of tear gas on the protesters , and people in the crowd threw the canisters back at the officers . The group said about 200 demonstrators were in the southern city of Aswan , 2,000 in the eastern city of Ismailiya , and about 3,000 in the northern city of Mahallah . Protest organizers said they hope to capture the regional momentum for political change set by Tunisians , who 10 days ago forced the collapse of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 's 23-year rule . The Egyptian government did not issue permits for Tuesday 's planned protests . In an interview released Tuesday with state-run al-Ahram newspaper , Interior Minister Habib Adly warned that `` the security agencies are able to stop any attempt to attend '' the demonstrations and called the efforts of the `` youth staging street protests ineffective . '' By early Tuesday morning , more than 90,000 people throughout the country had pledged to participate in the event in a Facebook group called `` We Are All Khaled Said , '' named after an Alexandria activist who was allegedly beaten to death by police . The Facebook group demands raising the minimum wage , sacking the interior minister , creating two-term presidential term limits and scrapping existing emergency laws that the group says `` resulted in police control '' over the people and the nation . To highlight the role of police corruption , organizers tapped January 25 -- Police Day and a national holiday -- to hold protests . Amnesty International released a statement Monday `` urging the Egyptian authorities not to crack down '' on the planned nationwide demonstration . The banned Muslim Brotherhood , the biggest organized opposition to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's regime , had stated it would not have an official presence at Tuesday 's protests , but some of its members `` have reportedly been summoned and threatened with arrest and detention '' if they attend and protest , Amnesty International said .

Now , across the region , Arab populations are beginning to voice social and economic frustrations and assert their democratic rights . It puts the United States in the unenviable position of wanting and needing to support those yearnings at the same time the regimes they have long relied on for security in the region are the targets . The United States was completely caught off guard and largely absent from the scene in Tunisia . The State Department expressed some early concern about the free flow of information and the Tunisian goverment 's crackdown on the protesters , urging respect for their right to freedom of expression . But it did n't voice strong support for the protesters aspirations until President Ben Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali had already fled the country . In a carefully crafted statement , Clinton urged the caretaker government to respect the rights of the people assembling in the streets and to heed their call for political , social and economic reform . Egyptians , emboldened by the success of their Tunisian brothers , followed on the streets of Cairo Tuesday to protest the corruption and failed economic policies of President Hosni Mubarak . Once again , Clinton measured her words Tuesday morning . But she offered at least tepid support of the Egyptian government , calling it `` stable '' and `` looking for ways to respond to the legitimate needs and interests of the Egyptian people . '' While the chances of an overnight `` revolution , '' is far less likely in Egypt than in Tunisia , the consequences for the United States would be far more dire should that happen in Egypt . Ben Ali provided significant cooperation to the United States in its campaign against terrorism , but his ouster is relatively inconsequential to U.S. national security interests . Mubarak , however , is a key U.S. ally whose help is critical in maintaining security in the region on every issue from helping to forge peace between Israelis and Palestinians to continuing to keep pressure on Iran to stabilizing Lebanon and Iraq . His continued failure to heed the calls of his people could ultimately become a national security issue for the United States .

Police turned water cannons and tear gas on protesters in the early hours of Wednesday morning to try to break up anti-government demonstrations as the Interior Ministry warned it `` will not allow any provocative movement or a protest or rallies or demonstrations . '' In the heart of Cairo , people were being beaten with sticks and fists and demonstrators were being dragged away amid tear gas . Witnesses saw security forces harassing journalists and photographers . Demonstrations continued into the nighttime hours . Egypt 's official MENA news agency reported that at least 90 people were detained Wednesday while trying to demonstrate in downtown Cairo 's Tahrir Square . The country 's main opposition party , the Muslim Brotherhood , said Wednesday that 149 of its members were arrested during the protests . The state-run Nile News TV reported violent clashes Wednesday night between security forces and protesters in Suez , a port city east of Cairo on the Gulf of Suez . At least 27 people were wounded , Nile News said , most of them police officers . Quoting provincial officials , the station said most of the clashes took place in the Alarbeen neighborhood and that looters attacked some shops . The Muslim Brotherhood said 35 people were injured in Suez and that security forces in the city had implemented a curfew there Wednesday night . Egypt 's Interior Ministry denied claims of curfews in parts of the country , MENA reported . Dozens of Bedouins , meanwhile , gathered Wednesday in the Sheikh Zwayd area near Rafah -- close to Egypt 's border with Gaza -- and tried to stop traffic on the international road by setting tires on fire and throwing rocks at cars , MENA reported . The Interior Ministry urged `` citizens to renounce attempts to bid and trade their problems and not lose sight of the consequences of provocation for those who attempt to try to open the door to a state of chaos or portray the situation in the country this way . '' At least 10 journalists have been beaten by Egyptian security personnel during the demonstrations , the Committee to Protect Journalists said Wednesday .

Cairo , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Thousands of protesters spilled into the streets of Egypt on Tuesday , an unprecedented display of anti-government rage inspired in part by the tumult in the nearby North African nation of Tunisia . Three people died in the clashes between protesters and police , according to Egypt 's official MENA news agency . Two demonstrators died in the eastern city of Suez , and one policeman was killed in Cairo , it said . MENA reported that at least 49 people have been injured . Earlier , Egypt 's Interior Ministry said that 36 police officers had been hurt during the protests . Throngs in the sprawling capital city marched from the huge Tahrir Square toward the parliament building , according to CNN reporters on the scene . Demonstrators threw rocks at police , and police hurled rocks back . Tear-gas canisters were shot at demonstrators , and the protesters threw them back . Protest organizers said they hope to capture the regional momentum for political change set by Tunisians , who 10 days ago forced the collapse of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 's 23-year rule . Government : Keep protests in perspective Egyptian protesters run from smoke Gallery : Protesters on streets in Cairo The grievances were foreshadowed by several Egyptians who set themselves or tried to set themselves on fire this month , mirroring the self-immolation of a Tunisian man whose action spurred the uprising there . The Tunisian uprising was the most successful revolt in the region since 1979 , but it is anybody 's guess whether uprisings will spread to other Arabic-speaking lands . Juan Cole , a Middle East historian at the University of Michigan , says Tunisia is different from other Arab nations . Tunisia , he said , is the `` most secular country in the Arab world . '' Its traditions have favored women 's rights , and its Islamist influence is negligible . The United States and other governments are monitoring the demonstrations in Cairo and elsewhere closely . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged all people to `` exercise restraint '' and supported `` the fundamental right of expression and assembly for all people . '' `` But our assessment is that the Egyptian government is stable and is looking for ways to respond to the legitimate needs and interests of the Egyptian people , '' she said . To highlight the role of police corruption , the protest organizers in Egypt picked January 25 -- Police Day and a national holiday -- to hold protests . The protests started off small , but they grew as people came to the center of the city from bridges over the Nile River . Thousands protest corruption in Egypt Could Tunisia 's unrest spread to Egypt ? Tear gas fired at Cairo protesters Witnesses said large groups of plainclothes police were heading to Tahrir Square . Protesters had been expressing their anger over the rising cost of living , failed economic policies and corruption , but all those concerns were distilled into one overriding demand : the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak , in power for three decades . The outpouring included young and old , Christians and Muslims , students , workers and businesspeople . `` We breathe corruption in the air , '' said one demonstrator , who along with others said their children have no future . At its peak there were perhaps 15,000 to 20,000 people in Tahrir Square , but that crowd later dwindled to about 5,000 to 8,000 . The main road in front of parliament , Qasr Al-Aini , was closed to traffic . The square is two blocks from parliament . `` Egyptians have the right to express themselves , '' Foreign Ministry spokesman Hossam Zaki said of the protests . The Interior Ministry called on demonstrators to follow the law and avoid threatening the safety of bystanders , the public and private property . Social media have been all-important in mobilizing and organizing protests . But bloggers and others in Egypt reported problems with electronic communication later in the day . Activists ca n't access their cell phones or text messages , and opposition websites ca n't be accessed . Twitter was blocked in Egypt about 11 a.m. ET , the company said . There were other demonstrations in Cairo suburbs of Heliopolis , Shubra Al-Khaima , Muhandasin and Dar Al-Salam . One man said Egypt is not Tunisia , it 's Romania under Nicolae Ceausescu , a reference to the late and much-reviled communist leader . The Front to Defend Egypt Protesters , an alliance of lawyers who helped organize the events , said that about 200 demonstrators were in the southern city of Aswan , 2,000 in the eastern city of Ismailiya and about 3,000 in the northern city of Mahallah . The Egyptian government did not issue permits for Tuesday 's planned protests . In an interview released Tuesday with state-run al-Ahram newspaper , Interior Minister Habib Adly warned that `` the security agencies are able to stop any attempt to attend '' the demonstrations and called the efforts of the `` youth staging street protests ineffective .

The Facebook group demands raising the minimum wage , firing the interior minister , creating two-term presidential term limits and scrapping existing emergency laws that the group says `` resulted in police control '' over the people and the nation . Amnesty International released a statement Monday `` urging the Egyptian authorities not to crack down '' on the planned nationwide demonstration . The banned Muslim Brotherhood , the biggest organized opposition to Mubarak 's regime , had stated it would not have an official presence at Tuesday 's protests , but some of its members `` have reportedly been summoned and threatened with arrest and detention '' if they attend and protest , Amnesty International said . Opposition leader and Nobel Peace laureate Mohamed ElBaradei posted statements supporting the protests on his Twitter account . He also created a video statement addressing policemen that was released Monday on YouTube . `` I sympathize with you because sometimes you are asked to do things that you do not want to do , '' ElBaradei said . `` One day , I hope that you will regain your role as the protectors of the people ; rather than protectors of ... fraud elections . I am sure that every one of you deep inside is looking forward to the day that his role will again be with the people and a part of them , rather than against them , '' he said . Public sentiment against state security forces has grown recently with alleged videos of police brutality shown on the internet . A recent report from Human Rights Watch said the problem is `` epidemic , '' and `` in most cases , officials torture detainees to obtain information and coerce confessions , occasionally leading to death in custody . '' Some other human rights groups , such as the Arabic Network for Human Rights , have drawn a comparison between Egypt and Tunisia under Ben Ali , in terms of the level of government corruption and police brutality . Adly , the Egyptian interior minister , dismissed any such comparisons , calling it `` propaganda '' that had been rejected by politicians as `` intellectual immaturity . '' But one woman , identified only as Nahla , who planned to attend the Tuesday protests , disagreed . She wrote in an online post , `` I hope the -LRB- Tunisia-style -RRB- revolution will be taught in history . And that Egyptians will learn in school later about the January 25th revolution .

Meanwhile , Egypt censors access to Twitter . Twitter says its site is being blocked in Egypt Egyptians took to the streets in what could be a sequel to the recent revolution in Tunisia Twitter , Facebook and YouTube were widely used in Tunisia 's uprising and in Iran last year -LRB- Wired -RRB- -- Twitter confirmed Tuesday evening that its microblogging site has been shuttered by Egyptian authorities . This came hours after widespread reports that access had been cut off , as Egyptians took to the streets in what many hope and some fear would be a sequel to the revolution in Tunisia last week . The day 's speculation that the Mubarak administration might have pulled the plug on Twitter underscored the power of the site and other social networks as tools to both coordinate and disperse news of a citizen uprising . Twitter , Facebook and YouTube were widely used in Tunisia 's recent uprising and in Iran last year . But it remains an open and hotly debated question about how much of a role these tools actually play in real-world social movements , with some critics rightly pointing out that it becomes tempting for analysts to give more credit to the new and sexy tools than they actually deserve . `` We can confirm that Twitter was blocked in Egypt around 8 a.m. PT today . It is impacting both Twitter.com @applications , '' the company tweeted from the handle @twitterglobalpr . Earlier in the day , Twitter seemed unsure . `` We 're not experts on how Twitter is being used in highly developing situations 1000s of miles from our comfortable HQ in SF , '' the company tweeted from the same handle . In a separate tweet , San Francisco-based Twitter added , `` the experts are those using Twitter on the ground and those coordinating with them around the world . '' Social media and Egyptian protests New generation of protesters in Egypt One of the leading authorities on Middle East censorship , who is based in Cairo , said in a telephone interview that his Facebook account was accessible but not his Twitter account . His ISP , he said , is TE Data , that nation 's largest internet service provider . The source , who requested anonymity for fear of retribution , said some Egyptians using the Nour ISP were getting access to Twitter . `` Twitter , it 's almost across-the-board inaccessible in Egypt , '' he said . `` Given the size of the crowds we saw in the streets , I would n't be surprised the outage was from the government . There 's been calls to censor the internet here for ages . '' ABC News reported from Cairo that Twitter was down and that as many as three people were killed as tens of thousands of protesters hit the streets demanding President Hosni Mubarak 's 30-year reign come to an end . Vodafone , using the handle @VodafoneEgypt , had tweeted `` no blocking from our side ! '' It speculated that the outage may have been from `` overload . '' Jillian York , who compiles a crowd-sourced ledger of unavailable websites across the globe for the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University , said the center had received about a dozen reports of Twitter being inaccessible inside Egypt . `` We can not confirm for sure if twitter.com is blocked , '' she said in a telephone interview early Tuesday .

ELIOT SPITZER , CNN ANCHOR : Good evening and welcome to the show . I 'm Eliot Spitzer . Kathleen Parker is on assignment tonight . She 's in Washington and in just a moment she 'll be with us with breaking news , an exclusive one-on-one interview with speaker of the House , John Boehner . We 'll get his first comments on last night 's State of the Union speech and he had some strong things to say . But first I wanted to give you my thoughts on what the president told the American people last night . Some of it , I liked , some of it , not so much . Let 's start with this simple idea . Give the president some credit . He saved us from a depression . He brought back the auto industry . He added a million private sector jobs in the past year . And still everybody out there seems to want to give him hell . Everyone is a critic . Give him a break for a minute and listen to what he said . Because last night he told us the single most essential truth about what we need to do . We 've got to lift our game . In a world driven by technology and tough competition , we need to be better educated , more creative . The president set out a challenge . If we want to stay competitive , we had better invest in our educational skills , in infrastructure , in energy independence . But then he dropped the ball . After setting out the challenge , the president fumbled . He did n't answer the critical question . How do we do it ? How do we pay for it ? Last fall I think he made a big mistake . He extended the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy . Some saw it as a compromise . I saw it as caving . It added hundreds of billions of dollars to the deficit . If he 'd only told us how he wants to pay for his grand ambitions , a good speech could have been a great speech . Now still to come tonight , a stormy White House , not politically , aesthetically . Take a look at those pictures . It is a thing of beauty and it 's happening again in New York and Boston , another major winter storm . And elsewhere in the world , Egypt explodes as thousands storm the streets demanding the ouster of their longtime president and threatening the stability of a key U.S. ally . But first it 's time for Kathleen 's exclusive interview with John Boehner . KATHLEEN PARKER , CNN ANCHOR : All right , thanks so much , Eliot . And thank you , Speaker Boehner , for making time for us . I know you 're a busy man these days . REP. JOHN BOEHNER -LRB- R -RRB- , HOUSE SPEAKER : Glad to be here with you . PARKER : All right . Let 's cut straight to the State of the Union address last night . The president kept saying this is a Sputnik moment . What kind of moment would you say we 're in right now ? BOEHNER : Well , if you really want to talk about what the Sputnik moment is , it 's the fact that we 're broke . BOEHNER : The American people know we 're broke and they want us to do something about spending . And there was n't much talk last night about cutting spending and getting our debt under control . PARKER : And would you cut Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security ? BOEHNER : If we lead with our chin , nothing happens . That 's what 's happened in Washington for the last 25 years . I think that we need to have both parties working together to help explain to the American people the size of the problem and an array of possible solutions and out of that conversation we 'll begin to resolve what is possible . PARKER : All right . Well , let 's just focus on one piece of it . Let 's look at Social Security . Speaker Boehner , you have said that you would support or consider supporting raising the retirement age for Social Security . Would you go on record tonight and say that you will do that ? BOEHNER : I do n't -- I made a mistake when I did that because I think having the conversation about how big the problem is is the first step . And once the American people understand how big the problem is , then you can begin to outline an array of possible solutions . But when you look at life expectancy in America today and you look at the Social Security system , we 're all living far longer than anyone had ever anticipated and the result of these big demographic changes is having a disastrous effect on the Social Security program . And so raising the retirement age or considering it is something that ought to be on the table . PARKER : OK , so raising the retirement age is on the table . And you keep saying -- Speaker Boehner , you keep talking about an adult conversation . And nobody really -- yes , we have to have one . Everyone I 've talked to , I ca n't -- most people say , look , even -- Obama 's plans , even the plans that the Republicans have put forward , there 's really no way to get out of this economic mess without these drastic spending cuts that we 're talking about , cutting back on entitlements but also raising taxes . Ultimately are we going to have to raise taxes ? BOEHNER : Raising taxes is the wrong prescription for where we are . It 's pretty clear to me the cutting of spending is the most important thing we can do to get the American people back to work . That and eliminating a lot of the uncertainty of this coming out of this administration . The most important thing we can do to increase federal revenues is to get the American people back to work . Whether they 're taking care of themselves , their families and back on the tax rolls helping to supply income to the federal government to meet the demands of the American people . You 're not going to get people back to work by taxing the very people that we expected to reinvest in our economy . PARKER : Now we are talking about a debt and deficit of enormous proportions and I do n't know how you can cut enough without also raising taxes . BOEHNER : You ca n't raise -- PARKER : Believe me , I do n't want to pay more taxes . BOEHNER : You do n't -- you ca n't raise enough to solve the problem . And you ca n't spend -- you ca n't cut enough spending to solve this problem . Two things have to happen if we 're serious . We 've got to hold the line on spending and we have to get the American people back to work . PARKER : Last night after the State of the Union address , Michele Bachmann got up and gave her own response . Now she did this without consulting you . You 're the most powerful man in the House of Representatives certainly and one of the top -- most powerful men in the nation . And she decides to go out on her own and give a response . Are you able to manage these people ? BOEHNER : Well , the official -- the official response was given by Paul Ryan , who 's chosen by Senator McConnell and I , to give our response . But understand that every member of Congress , Democrat and Republican , does a response to the State of the Union . I mean in years past I 've been on a number of TV shows , I 've done a number radio programs back in my district . Everyone does something to respond to the State of the Union . She decided to do hers in front of a Tea Party group . PARKER : But the Tea Party people can be a little unruly at times , ca n't they ? BOEHNER : Well , if you look at what the Tea Party folks were saying , it was n't any different than what the rest of America was saying . That spending is out of control and we 've got to get our economy moving again to get people back to work . PARKER : Speaker Boehner , do n't the American people want you to work with the president and with the Democrats to find common ground and solve these problems ? BOEHNER : Well , clearly , and we are going to find common ground . I 'm not going to say it 's going to be easy but we 're going to find some way to find common ground in cutting spending . The president talked about tax reform last night and I think there are ways where we can simplify both the corporate tax code and the personal tax code . And I 'm optimistic that we can work together on that . PARKER : Could you get that down to one page , please ? That tax bill , that tax reform ? I want one page . BOEHNER : You and I and every American would love to have that . PARKER : You 've been -- you 've come from -- as you said , you had sort of a -- not a privileged upbringing and now you are speaker . PARKER : Of the House . And last night the president recognized you as sort of symbolizing the American dream . So let 's take a look at that . BARACK OBAMA , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : We may have different backgrounds but we believe in the same dream that says this is a country where anything is possible , no matter who you are . No matter where you come from . That dream is why I can stand here before you tonight . That dream is why a working class kid from Scranton can sit behind me . That dream is why someone who began by sweeping the floors of his father 's Cincinnati bar can preside as speaker of the House in the greatest nation on earth . PARKER : So how did that feel ? BOEHNER : It was a nice moment for Joe and I and for the president . But I think it gives -- it gives every American the opportunity to look up and say , hey , you know , they can do it , I can do it . SPITZER : When we come back Speaker Boehner finally explains exactly why he did n't go to the state dinner with the Chinese president last week . Has he rethought his decision ? Do n't go away . We 'll be right back . SPITZER : Now more of Kathleen 's exclusive interview with speaker of the House John Boehner on why he 's been spurning the president 's invitations and how he felt when he heard about the Tucson shootings . PARKER : Speaker Boehner , despite your new position in life , your new elevated place , you seem to me to be a little shy nonetheless . Maybe a bit of an introvert like me . You do n't like to go to parties much . You do n't even like to go to state dinners . BOEHNER : Now , listen , I 've been to one state dinner in 20 years . It 's just not -- the idea of putting on a tuxedo and sitting in a room for a long boring night , that 's not my idea of a nice evening . PARKER : Well , none of us really likes to sit in a boring room all night , but , you know , you turned down the state dinner with China 's President Hu Jintao . BOEHNER : I was meeting with him the next day . I was hosting him here in the Capitol and I really did n't see any reason to have -- to go have dinner the night before and then host a meeting up here the next day . I knew I was going to have my chance to talk to him . PARKER : So you do n't want to see people two days in a row ? PARKER : Do you not feel , though , as speaker of the House that you have a duty to show up to some of these functions just because of that 's who you are ? BOEHNER : Apparently a lot of people think that I do , and so maybe the next time I 'll reconsider . PARKER : You have an idea about what the House needs to be . I know you wanted to restore honor to the House as you see it . Tell us about that . BOEHNER : Well , the Congress is broken and I think most Americans realize that Congress is broken . And over the last five or 10 years , it 's been evident to me that we 're moving in the wrong direction . You know , in the last few years there were about five members who decided what the beginning of the bill looked like and the same five members who decided what the end of the bill was going to look like , coerced the process to achieve an outcome while 430 of us , each representing 650,000 people , we sat on the sidelines . And I gave a speech on the floor of the House in 1991 . I had been here about six months and they had to bring in a bill to the floor under a close rule , and I said this . I said , what do we have to fear in allowing the house to work its will ? Well , I do n't feel any differently about it today than I did then . So my -- what I believe is necessary is we need to open up the House . We need to let all members from both parties participate in the debate , offer their ideas , represent their constituents and let the House work its will . The House should not be coerced to produce legislation that fits my needs . Or to fit anyone else 's needs . And I do believe that if we open up the House , it 'll drive more power back to the committees where members were going to have to begin to work together again . And I think the result of this is that we 'll have better legislation , we 'll have more bipartisan legislation and we will begin to melt the scar tissue that is built up between the two political parties . PARKER : Do you feel like last night 's date night helped toward that end ? BOEHNER : Well , I do n't know whether date night helped , but it was nice to see members spread out . The vice president and I were not going to engage in the constantly jumping up and down and clapping . This is the State of the Union . The president comes here at the invitation of the Congress and the Congress in my view ought to respect the fact that a president has accepted the invitation and there ought to be more dignity at this event . Last night was better than what we 've seen in the past . Not as -- not as dignified as I 'd like to see it but we 're moving in the right direction . PARKER : I watched you and you have a poker face . It 's very hard to read what 's going on . BOEHNER : Oh , I did n't last night . Well , you know , it 's difficult . You 're sitting behind the president . You got these cameras on you , you know , and my -- one of my girls sent me a text and said now just remember this camera is going to be on you looking for any bit of a reaction . So I tried to do as good a job as I could . I did not want to be the issue . I never wanted to be the issue because this is not about me . PARKER : I 've heard that about you . I 've heard that you have kind of a coach 's approach to running the House . PARKER : You 're very happy to delegate and let other people have the limelight ? BOEHNER : I 've run my business , run my office and now hopefully run the House in a way where I try to build consensus . Build consensus , move ahead . Build consensus , move ahead . I do n't have to be in charge . But my job is to bring people together , get people to work together to achieve a common good and the common good here is following the will of the American people . And I think there are a lot of Democrats and Republicans who do want to come together to fulfill the common good . PARKER : Do you feel like you have a good relationship with the president ? BOEHNER : I do . You know , as I 've said it 's not particularly close , but we get along fine but I suspect over the coming months it 'll get a little closer . PARKER : You know one of the words that I listened out for in his speech last night was the word exceptional . I heard him use it when -- in Tucson . In Tucson , of course , it 's been this horrific event for the whole country . But I did n't hear him say it and I thought at a time when you 're building a speech around sort of defining the common purpose of America , that seemed to me a rather -- you know , a simple direct line , fairly -- pretty much a no-brainer , but he did n't say it . BOEHNER : Well , they -- they 've refused to talk about America exceptionalism . We are different than the rest of the world . Because Americans have -- the country was built on an idea that ordinary people could decide what their government looked like and ordinary people could elect their own leaders . And 235 years ago that was a pretty novel idea . And so we are different . Why is our economy still 20 times the size of China 's ? Because Americans have had their freedom to succeed , the freedom to fail . We 've got more innovators , more entrepreneurs , and that is exceptional but you ca n't get the left to talk about it . They do n't -- they reject that notion . PARKER : Why do you think that is ? BOEHNER : I do n't know . I do n't know . I do n't know if they 're afraid of it , whether they do n't believe it . I do n't know . PARKER : Going back one more time to the moment when Nancy Pelosi handed you that gavel , can you describe to me what that moment was like ? BOEHNER : It was nice . It was n't -- I was proud to be there . BOEHNER : I was proud to be there . I was honored to be there . You know , it 's an honor to be chosen by your colleagues to be their leader . But I 've been as steady and calm over the last four or five months than I 've been in years and you ca n't get too excited because you know that while there may be a moment of excitement , there is a mountain of work looking at you the next day , and so it was nice , but it was a long day . PARKER : Sad , sad moment when we all got the news of what had happened in Tucson . And you are the speaker of the House . This is your -- you know , your crowd and I know a lot of people -- everyone was very upset when you heard that Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords had been shot . How did you feel ? BOEHNER : Well , I felt awful . BOEHNER : It was -- it was one of our own , and in addition to that , just was n't her , it was one of her staffers was killed and , you know , while most people do n't think much about our staff or just does n't come to mind , you know , there are about 10,000 staffers who work here on Capitol Hill . And it might have been the moment -- I had only been speaker for about three days and I really began -- I realized at that moment that I am the speaker and I 've got a big job to do . There are a lot of pieces to what happens up here on Capitol Hill and who 's responsible , and on that Saturday I was responsible for a lot of it . But I talked to the president . Worked with our security people and our logistics people and there were a lot to do . PARKER : Have you been in touch ? Have you been in touch ? BOEHNER : I sent her a card yesterday . I -- SPITZER : We 'll have a final thought from Kathleen 's exclusive conversation with Speaker Boehner later in the show . But first coming up next , in Egypt , an explosion of violence in the streets and a government in crisis . Thanks in part to twitter and Facebook , the young people of that nation rise up threatening the stability of what had been that region 's only stable country . Harrowing details when we come back . SPITZER : Violence and revolt in Egypt tonight , a country that was until now America 's most stable ally in the Middle East . Thousands of protesters took to the streets for a second day calling for the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak . The protesters were met with police using teargas , batons and water canons . Four people have died . More than 100 are injured and things appear to be getting worse . How did this happen ? What will it mean for America and the Middle East ? Joining me now from Cairo is CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman . Ben , thanks for joining us . BEN WEDEMAN , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : My pleasure , Eliot . SPITZER : So , Ben , fill us in . What is the latest ? What is happening in the streets and what happened there today ? WEDEMAN : Well , today started off fairly quiet with just a few scattered demonstrations , but the Interior Ministry made it clear early in the day that no protests would be tolerated . So we saw around town small groups forming , trying to reproduce the massive demonstrations Cairo saw yesterday , but the crackdown was severe . The police , no restraint today as we saw yesterday in relative terms , using their clubs , using their water cannon , using rubber bullets and teargas to try to disperse the demonstrators . But every group they dispersed , another group formed somewhere else . We 're hearing that the city of Suez on the Suez Canal is in a state of open or insurrection against the government that the police have pulled out of the city and that they are now burning down things like police stations and ruling party headquarters . So even though the numbers of demonstrators in the streets of Cairo were smaller , it seems that this movement that really began sparked yesterday is not losing any momentum . SPITZER : What are the demands of the protesters if they can be discerned or known at this time ? And is there even an organization there to make demands ? WEDEMAN : Well , there 's not really an organization . What we have is something probably unique in history . We have Facebook groups that have formed . And they had some basic demands . They want a minimum wage . They want an end to police brutality , an end to corruption , and more than anything what you hear from people in the street is one single very profound demand . They want the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak who has been ruling this country longer than most Egyptians have been alive -- Eliot ? SPITZER : And is there any possibility that Mubarak would either resign and who is there to take over ? What would happen if he were to step down ? Is there an alternate government ? His son has been apparently slated to take over . What could possibly happen ? WEDEMAN : Well , there 's a whole variety of scenarios , all of which have a lot of question marks around them . First of all , President Mubarak has not uttered a word in public since these demonstrations happened which is causing a good deal of concern , causing some people to think that the government is simply losing its grip at the moment . He has no vice president . He 's been president since 1981 and has always refused to appoint one saying that the people will decide . Well , the people have n't had a chance to decide this matter . There 's a lot of talk about his so son , Gamal Mubarak , businessman , a banker in his mid-40s , taking over . But Egyptians across the board have rejected that option . They say we are after all a republic , not a monarchy , they do n't want that sort of system . There 's always the option that the army can take over but that is something most people do n't really think is possible unless the situation goes out of control . SPITZER : Was there any intimation ? Was there any evidence that this could erupt in a place like Egypt ? WEDEMAN : I have to confess that I and all of my colleagues in the press corps here and all the protesters I spoke with , nobody predicted that it would get so big so fast and throughout the country . It 's taken everybody by shock . The police , as well . They did n't expect this . And there were reasons for popular discontent . Police brutality , corruption , under a president that 's been in power since 1981 , and -- but nobody thought that this would happen so dramatically so quickly . SPITZER : What has the press coverage of these revolts been and these protests ? Has it been supportive ? Has it led to larger and larger protests building up in different neighborhoods ? WEDEMAN : All right . This is the state paper , sort of the gray lady of Egypt . Top story , `` Riots and Unrest , '' but it 's not in Egypt . It 's in Lebanon . The Egypt protest is below the fold . This is referring to yesterday . Here is another newspaper . Al Masry Al Youm . Here you have top story , great big red headline says , `` Warning . '' Complete comprehensive coverage , very positive about the protest , so two completely different ways of looking at the demonstrations , and this really gives you an idea of the chasm between the official stance on these demonstrations and a more sort of independent popular view of what they mean and where they 're going . ELIOT SPITZER , HOST : It seems that the communication between or among the protesters is on twitter , is on Facebook , is on social media . Is there any way for the government to shut that down ? WEDEMAN : Well , one important thing to point out is that Egypt has never put any blocks on the Internet . Egyptians can go to any site they want . However , yesterday during the protests , Twitter suddenly was blocked and that was one of the main forms of spreading information and spreading news about Egypt . Egyptian officials insist they did nothing . They say that the system was overwhelmed and it simply did n't function in Egypt . And what 's interesting is that it took about an hour and a half ago , mid-evening in Cairo , the Twitter page was working again , but Twitter and Facebook , things like text messages have been key to spread the word to organize these demonstrations and to keep them going and to spread information so Egyptians even at these demonstrations , they 're half the time chanting , the other time they 're looking down at their mobile phones to read text messages to check Facebook , to check Twitter . So it 's a very techie revolution if we can call it that . SPITZER : Who are the protesters ? WEDEMAN : There are students , workers , housewives . You see middle - aged couples coming out to chant `` down with Mubarak . '' There are sort of every sector of Egyptians deciding . What 's interesting is that the Muslim brotherhood , the largest political opposition bloc in Egypt is not taking part in these demonstrations . They 're taking part as members , but as a group , it declined to participate . And what this really is , is at least , until now , is a secular movement . It has no religious undertones . SPITZER : Ben Wedeman in Cairo , thank you so much for joining us . Obviously this story will be continuing as this arc of revolution seems to be sweeping from Tunisia to Egypt , on to Lebanon . No doubt we will be talking in the next couple of days . We 'll be right back . SPITZER : Last night , President Obama laid out his agenda and he challenged us to be better -- a better country with a bigger future . But again , I ask the same question I asked at the top of the show , how do we do it ? With me tonight , two friends of the show were always grounded in reality , our conservative tag team , Will Cain from `` The National Review '' and conservative analyst E.D. Hill . Welcome to both of you as always . E.D. HILL , CONSERVATIVE ANALYST : Thank you . SPITZER : So , E.D. , let me start with you . We heard the two rebuttals , responses from the Republican side . We heard Paul Ryan , Michele Bachmann . Did either one of them give you a sense that they really knew how they were going to close this huge deficit that was what the Republican Party ran on last November ? HILL : They may have an idea but they certainly did n't share it , neither did President Obama . That 's the problem that we face with Washington as a whole . We just listened to John Boehner , as well . He had the chance to say , yes , I would suggest we cut social security or we do this . He did n't do it . He said , well , everything is on the table . Everything is always on the table unless you 're not talking at all . Yet no one is willing to take that step and say , let 's talk about this specifically . And that was my problem with all of them . SPITZER : And , look , I completely agree . I listened to them and then I read the transcripts looking for something concrete . But , you know , well it seems your point about President Obama say not so much for him either , but this was the mantra of the Tea Party and the Republican Party and there 's Paul Ryan , the whiz kid budget guy , everybody has pointed to all season . Am I missing something ? WILL CAIN , `` NATIONAL REVIEW '' : Yes , I think you did on Ryan . First , Bachmann , no it was n't there . If I told you last night we were getting a speech , a late night speech , from somebody whose eyeliner had gotten a little out of control and they started at your left ear as they spoke to you the entire time -- HILL : Do n't get on her makeup and the way she looked . CAIN : Do you think I was talking about the rebuttal of the State of the Union , or the late night closing time of Dorothy 's bumper club ? I mean -- SPITZER : No , no , I 'm watching you . HILL : You guys go after the women . If the guy looks -- if the guy -- my eyeliner is fine . If the guys look bad , you would n't be saying that . CAIN : No , let me tell you why I 'm hard -- SPITZER : I 'm with E.D. on this one . CAIN : Let me tell you why I 'm hard on Michele Bachmann . Let me tell you why I 'm hard on her . Because I align myself very closely to Tea Party values and principles . And I think the Tea Party is an introspective movement that forces conservatives to look at the way we 've taken opportunities to govern , to really realign our priorities . And what I heard from Michele Bachmann last night was blame -- blame , not unfairly appointed to Obama but way too external . We need to look at ourselves and that 's what I did n't hear from Michele Bachmann . I think Paul Ryan did begin to give us the message . I do think we heard something . Actually I think it was subtle . I think it was when we talked -- SPITZER : That could be why I missed it . When he talked about social security , he said when we look at reforming entitlements , we will not touch the entitlements of people who are in or near retirement . I think that was a nod to the road back for America . I think he was saying there we do have a solution for your entitlement problem , and I 've already put it together and it does n't touch the entitlements of old people . HILL : More people just hitting you upside the head with a two by four and telling you what they 're going to do . SPITZER : I 'm with E.D. on this one . I mean , if that was , in fact , the subtle message , and I heard that . And I thought maybe this was a nod towards raising the retirement age or somehow changing the contribution structure . SPITZER : But this was his moment to speak to the nation and just as with John Boehner 's interview a few moments ago on the show , we said we have to have the conversation . Fellows , this is the conversation . You seize the moment to lead . I mean , that 's what disappointed me . CAIN : He 's got 10 minutes . Is that 10 minutes ? You 're not going to lay out your budget proposals in 10 minutes . I expect to hear them in the coming days and weeks . HILL : I expected to hear him last night . I 'm not giving him a pass because they 're the professionals . They 're the ones who have compose chosen to do this for their life . They 're the ones who have told us that they can lead us , that they can figure out the way to make our country better and they do n't . SPITZER : What do you think of Michele Bachmann or Paul Ryan should have said ? HILL : I think they should have given specifics . Let 's go with Bachmann . She was really railing on everybody else and what 's , you know , hurting us . Then you know what , then take that step and call them out . Call out India and say you 're not opening up your domestic markets to our companies . So you know what , we can do it . America can do it . Our companies can do it , but give us a fair playing field . And neither of them did that . Neither did President Obama . SPITZER : Social security . Let 's just stick to that for one more second . SPITZER : Because it is the touchtone , or Medicare or Medicaid . Should they have said directly we will raise the retirement age and here 's when and how we 'll do it ? Such as the bipartisan commission did -- CAIN : Principally , principally yes . It would be an entire political mistake to suggest that the House of Representatives now controlled by the Republicans will put out entitlement reform only to be vetoed and lambasted in the Senate and at the presidency . Principally , I would love to hear it . HILL : This should have come from Obama . It was his bipartisan commission that came up with it . SPITZER : We 'll get to that in a minute . I agree , and I 've written the same thing . I wish he had done that . I would have said it because I think it is incumbent now given the crisis that we are facing for them to get to that point and say it . Let 's move on to the president 's speech for a minute . CAIN : Yes , that was an hour long speech compared to these two -- SPITZER : All right . But look , they all had their moments to pick and choose what to say . The president 's speech struck me as in a way schizophrenic . On the one hand talking about a lot of investment , on the other hand talking about the fact that we have a deficit and therefore he was going to freeze domestic spending . I want to focus for a moment on the investments he talked about and conceptually you , as conservatives , do agree with him increasing investment in education to upgrade the quality of our human capital as they call it . HILL : I agree with increasing investments in a certain way . I guess getting money back to people and to companies . I do n't agree with more government spending . I agree with giving people more money for them to spend . SPITZER : Let me refine that . HILL : Education -- you can put more people through college but if they do n't have jobs when they come out of it , it does n't really matter . SPITZER : That 's certainly right . But do you agree with expanding Pell Grants , for instance , expanding the G.I. bill concept of giving people access to loans , to pay college tuitions that are right now beyond the reach of many ? HILL : Specifically what he said was , you know , you should get a tax break for college tuition . I 'm totally on board . CAIN : You and I talked about it . I think you 're touching on the edges of education reform almost worthlessly . Until we start talking about the way to improve our students ' test scores , I do n't care how many you send to college . SPITZER : Well , you care about -- I do n't want it . CAIN : You get my point . SPITZER : I get your point . I 'm trying to save you -- HILL : I 'm trying to send one in college . SPITZER : But in that case what would you do ? What would your education reform agenda be ? And , look , the president has raced to the top which many people give a lot of credit to . Would you expand on that ? CAIN : I do n't think education reform has to be centered in Washington , D.C. I think education reform can be done at the state and even at a local level where you actually know who your bureaucrats are and know who your teachers are . HILL : I agree with that . CAIN : I think that 's the way to go about education reform . SPITZER : But do you think that the president and Arne Duncan , the secretary of education , who is viewed by many as almost a visionary has done a good job using the federal money as a way , basically as candy saying to the states , embrace reform and we will compensate you for it . HILL : I 'm with Will on this . I do n't think that this is one of many jobs that federal government ca n't do as well as state and local governments . I think states understand what the unique problems are to their localities . They need to be handling this . SPITZER : All right . We 'll put education aside but let 's go to another type of investment , the infrastructure investments he keeps talking about . Road , highways , the Internet . HILL : We both sat back . CAIN : I know you want to go through every single investment , but let me just say -- SPITZER : I 'm trying to understand your sense here . CAIN : I want to give you my sense . And here it is . When the president -- the president and I have very different visions of America . When the president uses words like innovate and compete and work hard and do more , '' he 's talking about the collective we . He 's talking about government . These are words that I have traditionally assigned , and I think America has assigned to individuals and entrepreneurs . They are who innovate . They are who make us competitive . If the government can do things to get out of their way , that is a beneficial step . SPITZER : But do you agree , E.D. , that the notion of basic research being funded by the Defense Department , by NASA , by government , which has led to so many of these critical investments , let 's face it the Internet really did come out of government labs . Do you buy that notion , therefore , health research , good idea , bad idea ? HILL : I think that research is a good idea . However , I want to go back to your idea about this whole transportation and the infrastructure because I spent last summer driving across America with a bunch of my kids and I kept on seeing this `` your federal stimulus dollars at work . '' They were out there ripping up highways and literally in the middle of cornfields that were perfectly fine and repaving them . And to me that 's not accomplishing anything . Use that money wisely . That 's what they do n't do . CAIN : You used the word I think was completely appropriate earlier . At one point in the president 's speech last night , he said nobody could have seen the Internet coming . And then in other parts , he suggests that he can peer into the future and see what the future energy sources for America are and we 'll subsidize those . There 's a huge amount of hubris and arrogance in that assumption that you actually know . Why is there not some kid working on cold fusion or turning ocean water into oil ? Why do you know it 's wind ? Why are you going to allocate so much of our money to that ? SPITZER : Will , I think he 's saying something different . I think what he is saying is that the Department of Energy which has funded so much of the critical breakthrough technologies when it comes to energy wo n't play venture capital firm trying to pick companies and invest in them . It will give grants to universities , University of Chicago . You know , pick your favorite state university and say , you do the research on fusion , on fission . HILL : But we 've been researching . We know what works . You just ca n't -- SPITZER : No , we do n't yet know . HILL : You know that wind works , you know solar works , you know nuclear works and yet you do n't -- you 've got . SPITZER : But clean coal , for instance -- clean coal , which I think we all aspire to have as part of our complex of energy sources , you know , using traditional dirty coal but somehow taking the carbon dioxide and submerging it below ground so we do n't have the green gas issues , that is only going to happen if the federal government subsidizes it . CAIN : Eliot , if these are real , viable businesses that have a place in the market , they will figure out a way to make it on their own . I 'm afraid you 'll spend 50 years funding projects that have no future and in 50 years we 'll look back and it will be the equivalent of you trying to fund jet packs . SPITZER : Let me ask you a question . HILL : -- say the same thing . We need to be researching . I think fish or cut bait . Let 's go out there and start making some changes . SPITZER : Have you spoken to any executive in the nuclear sector recently ? They will tell you they want to build plants but what do they need ? They need federal guarantees on the loan . They need limitations and liability . These are the sorts of government assistance projects that are in my view neither conservative nor liberal . They are market intervention but the nuclear sector wo n't be part of our energy structure if we do n't do it . Are you against that ? CAIN : No , I 'm not against that . I think there is some place for some role in the government aiding some businesses along at a very , very small level . Not for a new investment as it was put out last night . CAIN : Not for the increasing our spending to the degrees that we 've been hearing . Look , this is going to be a continuing conversation with as we call you `` our tag team of conservatives . '' See if we can put up on the screen here my favorite chart . HILL : Oh , good . SPITZER : Here we go . Look at this chart for a second . It shows you -- HILL : Bachmann was using charts too . SPITZER : I like that . That 's the part I liked about the speech . I got a copy here . You ca n't see . SPITZER : Top one percent has had income go up 281 percent . Middle class in the 25 percent , about 1980 . HILL : Is this your spreadsheet at home ? CAIN : No , I agree with E.D. HILL : Keeping people from making money , no , I do n't think they should do . I do n't think it 's the government 's job to redistribute that into some sense that you think is more fair . I want the rising tide to lift all those -- HILL : I like you speechless . CAIN : I want them -- HILL : He 's looking and saying , are you crazy ? SPITZER : No , I 'm just trying to watch you dig a little deeper . CAIN : I want the rising tide to lift all those . I want the middle class incomes to have greater purchasing power . I do n't think it has to be in direct proportion to the wealthiest in society . SPITZER : What if the rising tide is lifting only the yachts , but not the rowboats ? Does that bother you ? HILL : I do n't think in our economy that is what will happen . Certainly you can -- I know . Certainly you can pull out your chart and you can show that . And recently that is the case . But I think that if the federal government backs off and lets people take more control of their own lives , of their companies , helps small , medium size companies do better , gives them the tax breaks , I think you do bring all those boats up . SPITZER : Will , Will wants to raise the yachts . CAIN : No , I think the issue is a tad bit more complicated than your chart . And I think there are income and wealth opportunities included in that middle class line that do n't show up . I think there are health care benefits . They 're provided through the employer that do n't show up on that line . HILL : Will , you 're challenging him to come up with another chart . SPITZER : Next time , more charts . That 's what you want . E.D. and Will , as always thanks for being with us . Coming up , Kathleen asked Speaker of the House John Boehner , any politician 's favorite question . SPITZER : There 's one question no prominent politician can avoid , but that does n't mean they do n't love to be asked . Kathleen sprints it on Speaker Boehner . KATHLEEN PARKER , HOST : I was thinking about 2012 , at last count about 413 people running for the Republican nomination for president . REP. JOHN BOEHNER -LRB- R -RRB- , HOUSE SPEAKER : And one of them will win . PARKER : Is that ever on your agenda ? BOEHNER : Oh , no , no. . No , no , no , no , no. . I decided a long time ago I never really wanted to be governor . And I really did n't want to be senator . So I decided all right the rest of my political career is going to be in the U.S. House . I thought I 'd be here about 10 years and go back and run my business or go do something else . But here it is , I 've been here 20 . But I decided a long time ago that the rest of my career was going to be in the House . My goal ought to be to be the speaker . Shoot for the top you 'll never get there . PARKER : What do you want your stamp to be when you leave as speaker ? BOEHNER : I want to have an institution that truly represents the will of the American people . And I want to have a process in place where no leader in the future can turn the clock back and take control away from the members . PARKER : All right . Well , thank you so much , Speaker Boehner . SPITZER : When we come back , from Maine to Mississippi , another winter storm blasts the East Coast . Bundle up and stay tuned . SPITZER : The northeast is slammed with another winter storm . Warnings have now been issued from Maine to Mississippi . Parts of the northeast could see more than 10 inches of snow tonight and this is just after digging out from a blizzard earlier this month . Take a look at the picture outside the building here . You can see , well , maybe if you look carefully , wind and snow blowing through Central Park . Gorgeous view unless you 're stuck outside . And then take another picture . This is the White House . Snow continues to fall there . More than 40,000 people , unfortunately , without power in Philadelphia . If you 're trying to fly out of Philadelphia right now , this is what it looks like , does n't look like too many planes are taking off . And here 's the view from Boston where they could get close to a foot of snow . Oh , my goodness , just what the kids want . Parents not too happy about it . Meteorologist Bonnie Schneider joins us with the latest . Bonnie , what 's going on right now ? BONNIE SCHNEIDER , AMS METEOROLOGIST : Well , Eliot , the storm is certainly not over yet . We 're watching our radar picture that shows a lot of snow sweeping through the mid-Atlantic and then on up into New England . At times it 's been mixing with sleet and turning slushy making for a real mess out there . Notice the change over here on Long Island , for example , where the warmer air is coming in . And then back to the south and to the east , we 're seeing some more snow build in . So it 's going to be cold enough to see that changeover overnight . The temperatures right over parts of Pennsylvania into the low 30s and then in the 40s along the Jersey Shore . That 's where you 're seeing some really heavy thunderstorms mixing in with sleet at times . Just really a treacherous situation out there . The question is what happens now as we go forward ? Let 's take a look at the storm track and we 'll advance it on end . And what you 'll find is that the storm is working its way to the north and east in a classic nor'easter sense . It 's kind of sliding up the coastline . It will be off the coast of New York by early tomorrow morning . Kind of in the overnight hours when we expect some really heavy snow to pile up and then it advances further to the east . It 's a fast-moving storm . So we actually could have seen even more snow with this system but it 's going to dump some heavy amounts . Four to six inches for Washington . Eight inches to a foot in New York . Eight inches to a foot in Boston . And , of course , there 's always the risk for isolated higher amounts . Other thing to note that 's really important is the temperatures . And right around the 30s . So it 's not that cold where we 're seeing light fluffy snow . We 're seeing big flakes , wet heavy snow . This is going to be dangerous tomorrow , Eliot , for people that are trying to shovel out because the snow will be heavy and tough to maneuver . SPITZER : You know , Bonnie , real quick , before time runs out . Are there more storms like this coming ? It seems like every week we 're getting another one . My kids are never going to school . Snow holidays every day . Is this just me imagining this , or is this for real ? SCHNEIDER : No , you are not imagining it at all . Because when you look at cities like Philadelphia and New York and even in Boston and Syracuse , we are way above normal for this time of year . Already in New York , over 27 inches of snow . For this date for the winter , the normal by this time would be 9.3 inches . And remember coming up , February is the snowiest month of the year . So we have a lot more ahead . SPITZER : All right , something to look forward to . Bonnie Schneider , thank you . And thank you all so much for being with us tonight . Good night from New York . I 'm Eliot Spitzer . `` PIERS MORGAN TONIGHT '' starts right now .

Matthew Nestor , left , Jason Hayes and William Moyer were accused of obstructing justice . Three former Pennsylvania police officers accused of trying to cover up the investigation into the beating death of an undocumented Mexican immigrant were acquitted of the top charge of conspiracy . A federal jury found former Shenandoah Police Chief Matthew Nestor and officers William Moyer and Jason Hayes not guilty of conspiracy to obstruct a federal investigation in the July 2008 death of Luis Ramirez , a court official told CNN . The official had knowledge of the verdict but was not authorized to speak . Nestor was found guilty of falsifying reports and Moyer was convicted of lying to the FBI . Hayes , who was also accused of falsifying police reports , was acquitted of the two charges against him . `` I 'd just like to thank all the supporters I had , especially my family , friends and neighbors . I had so many well-wishers from Shenandoah , '' Moyer said after the verdict , according to CNN affiliate WNEP .

The three men were accused of helping the boys conceal their roles and of falsifying police reports . Moyer was also charged with witness tampering and lying to the FBI .

There has been a common thread in the recent political upheaval in Tunisia and Egypt : Social media has played a role in both influencing the protests and reporting on them . `` Social media is key to the revolution taking place in North Africa , and this may actually be the first time a government leader has lost power because of social media , '' said Darrell West , the vice president for governance studies at the Brookings Institution , referring to the ousting of former Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali . However , social media is n't strictly a tool for those with a gripe with their government . Governments themselves have shown a willingness to use websites like Twitter for their own means in the wake of unrest , according to James Carafano , a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation . Any normal player might have gotten lost in the mayhem and hype of Brigham Young University 's most anticipated basketball game in school history . Jimmer Fredette is no normal player . The senior guard led the Cougars to a 71-58 rout of No. 4 ranked San Diego State Wednesday night at the Marriott Center . Though the nail-biting action of two top-10 teams battling it out lasted until the fourth quarter , the Aztecs fell short in their attempts to stave off Fredette 's offensive charge . As SI.com s Kelli Anderson writes : `` The Aztecs , the best defensive team in the conference , threw all sorts of defenders at Fredette , from D.J. Gay to Billy White to Chase Tapley , sometimes two at a time . The defensive pressure frequently forced him to change his mind in mid-air and pass instead of shoot -LRB- and he coughed up the ball four times -RRB- but he still filled the bucket . '' The game marked Fredette 's 15th in which he scored 30 points or more , clearly making him one of the school 's most fabled athletes and one of the year s biggest successes . He is on track to reach a rare milestone as well : nabbing a scoring title and the National Player of the Year award . He would join Bradley s Hersey Hawkins and Purdue s Glenn Robinson as the only three players since 1970 to achieve the honor . These small hand axes are at least 100,000 years old . A team of scientists found these tools in the United Arab Emirates . Scientists have discovered new evidence suggesting that modern humans first left Africa to explore Eurasia much earlier than previously thought . An international team of scientists has uncovered a tool kit that indicates that modern humans , who looked and perhaps behaved much like us , must have lived in eastern Arabia about 100,000 to 125,000 years ago . The collection of small hand axes , scrapers and other tools was found in Jebel Faya , United Arab Emirates . A report about the discovery appears in the journal Science . The people who made these tools `` are our ancestors , I have no doubt about that , '' said Hans-Peter Uerpmann , of the University of Tubingen in Germany , who collaborated on the project , at a press teleconference Wednesday . But the findings still do not prove definitively that modern humans made these tools , as the researchers did not find human remains near them , said Ted Goebel , anthropologist at Texas A&M University , who was not involved in the study . They potentially could have been made by Neanderthals or Neanderthal-like hominids , who were already in Eurasia at that time , Goebel said .

The Athens News Agency explained that under Greek law , university campuses are off-limits to police unless they have been invited or a serious crime has been committed . Greece s majority party says leftists have abused the law and are using the immigrants as political pawns .

Share your protest images with CNN iReport . Cairo , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Protesters taking to the streets in Egypt on Wednesday felt the wrath of security forces , a day after an unparalleled display of public rage at the government and full-throated cries for the ouster of the longtime president . Police turned water cannons and tear gas on protesters in the early hours of Wednesday morning to try to break up anti-government demonstrations as the Interior Ministry warned it `` will not allow any provocative movement or a protest or rallies or demonstrations . '' In the heart of Cairo , people were being beaten with sticks and fists and demonstrators were being dragged away amid tear gas . Witnesses saw security forces harassing journalists and photographers . Demonstrations continued into the nighttime hours . Egypt 's official MENA news agency reported that at least 90 people were detained Wednesday while trying to demonstrate in downtown Cairo 's Tahrir Square . Egypt cracks down on protesters Protesters fill the streets of Cairo ElBaradei : Egypt is not stable The country 's main opposition party , the Muslim Brotherhood , said Wednesday that 149 of its members were arrested during the protests . The state-run Nile News TV reported violent clashes Wednesday night between security forces and protesters in Suez , a port city east of Cairo on the Gulf of Suez . At least 27 people were wounded , Nile News said , most of them police officers . Quoting provincial officials , the station said most of the clashes took place in the Alarbeen neighborhood and that looters attacked some shops . The Muslim Brotherhood said 35 people were injured in Suez and that security forces in the city had implemented a curfew there Wednesday night . Egypt 's Interior Ministry denied claims of curfews in parts of the country , MENA reported . Dozens of Bedouins , meanwhile , gathered Wednesday in the Sheikh Zwayd area near Rafah -- close to Egypt 's border with Gaza -- and tried to stop traffic on the international road by setting tires on fire and throwing rocks at cars , MENA reported . The Interior Ministry urged `` citizens to renounce attempts to bid and trade their problems and not lose sight of the consequences of provocation for those who attempt to try to open the door to a state of chaos or portray the situation in the country this way . '' At least 10 journalists have been beaten by Egyptian security personnel during the demonstrations , the Committee to Protect Journalists said Wednesday . Lina Attalah , the managing editor of the English-language edition of the newspaper Al-Masry al-Youm , was attacked in downtown Cairo , CPJ reported . Egyptian protests got ` so big so fast ' Government : Keep protests in perspective Egypt police face off with protesters Man resists police water cannon `` I started running , but four policemen pulled me by my hair and kicked me in my face and back , '' Attalah told CPJ by phone . `` I tried telling them that I 'm a journalist but they were too busy kicking me . '' Her glasses were broken and police confiscated two cell phones , the journalists group said in a Wednesday statement . The Committee to Protect Journalists also said Wednesday that Egyptian authorities have shut down the websites of two popular independent newspapers , Al-Dustour and El-Badil . The clampdown comes after thousands of protesters spilled into the streets of Egypt on Tuesday in an unprecedented display of anti-government rage inspired in part by the tumult in another North African nation , Tunisia . At least four people died in the Tuesday clashes , the Interior Ministry reported -- three protesters in Suez and one police officer in Cairo . It also said at least 102 security personnel were injured . The Interior Ministry put the size of the Tuesday demonstration in Cairo 's Tahrir Square at 10,000 at its peak , falling to 5,000 . CNN estimated that demonstration peaked at 15,000 to 20,000 . But Wednesday is a work day in Egypt , so the numbers on the streets of Cairo were lower than they were on Tuesday , a holiday known as Police Day . Protesters had been expressing their anger over the rising cost of living , failed economic policies and corruption , but all those concerns were distilled into one overriding demand -- the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak , a reliable American ally who has been in power for three decades . Egyptian authorities have been aware of complaints , but protesters widely believe the government has simply paid lip service to their grievances . There is talk among protesters about staging a big demonstration on Friday , after Muslim prayers . Twitter said it was blocked for the second day on Wednesday but added that `` some users are using apps\\/proxies to successfully tweet . '' Magdi Radi , spokesman for Egypt 's prime minister , told CNN that the government `` did n't block Facebook , Twitter or any other website . He said that `` the websites may have been slow because of the heavy usage . '' The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information , a human rights group , on Wednesday underscored a `` national demand '' -- the dismissal of Interior Minister Habib Al-Adli . `` Yesterday , disengagement of peaceful gatherings by using excessive force was added to his crimes as well as arbitrary arrests of hundreds of citizens and detaining them in illegal locations , such as security camps of Darrasa in Cairo and Madinet el Salam at the outskirts of Cairo , two locations completely controlled by the Interior Ministry . '' The group said police `` turned into monsters attacking demonstrators , especially small clusters in side streets , without distinction between an elderly man or a woman or youth . '' Organizers said they hope to capture the regional momentum for political change set by Tunisians , who forced the collapse of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 's 23-year rule . But Mubarak , unlike Ben Ali , remains in his country . Stories that Mubarak or any other member of his family left Egypt are `` categorically false , '' said Karim Haggag , Egyptian Embassy spokesman in Washington . Calling its relationship with Egypt `` strong and friendly , '' the U.S. State Department regards Mubarak 's help in maintaining security in the Mideast as critical . The government , which has diplomatic relations with Israel , has helped forge peace between Israel and the Palestinians and has helped in efforts to stabilize Iraq , the State Department said . It contributes to U.N. peacekeeping missions , `` played a key role during the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis , '' and is a `` key supporter of U.S. efforts against terrorists and terrorist organizations such as Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda , the department said in a background note about Egypt . U.S. military aid to Egypt totals over $ 1.3 billion annually , and the U.S. Agency for International Development has passed along more than $ 28 billion in economic and development assistance to the country since 1975 . White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Wednesday that the Obama administration continues to monitor the situation . He called on all parties to refrain from violence and said authorities should lift bans on protests . Asked at Wednesday 's briefing whether the U.S. continues to back Mubarak , Gibbs said that `` Egypt is a strong ally . '' On Wednesday , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh spoke to reporters about the ferment in the Arab world . Clinton urged freedom for people and called on Egyptian authorities not to block social media . She urged the countries in the region to enact reforms and expressed optimism that the leaders there can do so . `` It is something that everyone knows must be on the agenda of the government as they -- not just respond to the protests -- but as they look beyond to what needs to be done economically , socially , politically . And there are a lot of very well-informed , active , civil society leaders in Egypt who have put forward specific ideas for reform and we are encouraging and urging the Egyptian government to be responsive to that . '' Jordan has experienced demonstrations over economic issues , and the foreign minister was asked whether the protests that raged in Tunisia and Egypt will spread . Judeh said Jordan does n't exist in an economic bubble and faces hardships that other lands endure . But he said the country is tackling a political and economic reform agenda and its system promotes freedom of expression .

The Muslim Brotherhood has called for its followers to demonstrate after weekly Muslim prayers on Friday , the first time in the current round of unrest that the largest opposition bloc has told supporters to take to the streets . Egyptian authorities arrested a prominent Muslim Brotherhood leader in Friday pre-dawn hours , detaining the party 's main speaker , Issam al-Aryan , according to his son-in-law . Police came to al-Aryan 's Cairo home at 2.30 a.m. local time , his son-in-law said . Protester : Why is n't the U.S. helping ? Egyptian protests got ` so big so fast ' According to multiple web services that check whether servers used by specific sites are active , the servers of Egypt 's main internet provider were down early Friday . The servers for the Egyptian government 's sites and for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo also appeared to be down . `` We are closely monitoring the situation and are aware that communication services , including social media , are being blocked , '' U.S. State Department Spokesman P.J. Crowley said Thursday . `` We continue to urge Egyptian authorities to show restraint and allow peaceful protests to occur . '' Facebook is aware of reports of service disruption and saw a drop in traffic from Egypt Thursday morning , company spokeswoman Jillian Carroll said in a statement . Government officials could not be immediately reached to comment on the internet and text message situation . Egypt 's Interior Ministry said Thursday that no protests will be permitted on Friday , but some Egyptians were going door to door in Cairo on Thursday night , urging their neighbors to participate . Opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei arrived in Cairo on Thursday and said `` there is no going back '' on change . ElBaradei , the Egyptian Nobel laureate , said people have taken to the streets because they `` realize the regime is not listening , not acting . '' `` The barrier of fear is broken , '' ElBaradei said after he arrived in Egypt from Europe on Thursday . `` And it will not come back . '' Now ElBaradei has said he will take part in the protests and passed along `` advice to the regime : It 's now the time to listen to the people . Make an innocent collective change . '' He called for demonstrations to be peaceful and for the government of President Hosni Mubarak to stop detaining and torturing people . He said that a violent response from the government is `` counterproductive '' and that the regime should promote democracy and social justice . `` I am asking the regime to listen to the people before it is too late , '' the opposition leader said , adding that he hopes to help broker a peaceful resolution to the unrest . Asked Thursday if the time has come for Mubarak to step aside , U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said , `` No , I think the time has come for President Mubarak to move in the direction to be more responsive to some of the needs of the people out there . '' `` A lot of the people out there protesting are middle class folks who are looking for a little more access , a little more opportunity , '' Biden said in an interview with PBS . `` I think that President Mubarak is going to respond to the legitimate concerns that are being raised . '' The U.S. Embassy in Cairo issued a message Thursday telling Americans that `` areas where people congregate after Friday prayers should be avoided . '' `` While many of the demonstrations have focused on the downtown Cairo\\/Tahrir Square area , violent confrontations have occurred at other locations both in the Cairo metropolitan area and in Alexandria , Suez , and other cities , '' it said . At least six have died in the demonstrations so far , according to the Interior Ministry and media reports . Video from Sinai on Thursday showed a protester being shot after the person picks up a rock . President Barack Obama urged the Egyptian government and demonstrators to refrain from violence . `` It is very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances , '' he said Thursday . The State Department also weighed in on events in Egypt on Thursday , with Crowley saying , `` We want to make sure that there 's no interference with the opportunity for the Egyptian people to use social media . '' Crowley 's remarks followed reports that social media sites like Twitter have been blocked for many Egyptian users in recent days . `` To the extent that we obviously see that , country by country across the region , people are watching what has happened in Tunisia ... they are drawing lessons from what is happening , '' Crowley said . Earlier this month , street protests in Tunisia led to the ouster of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali . With all eyes in Egypt focused on the protests , some events have been suspended . The Egyptian football federation has decided to postpone games scheduled for Friday and Saturday until further notice , according to Egypt 's official news agency . A smattering of protesters were in the streets on Thursday , after massive public protests on Tuesday and Wednesday calling for the ouster of Mubarak convulsed the nation and prompted a tough security crackdown . One protester arrested in Tuesday 's demonstrations told CNN Thursday that his nose and glasses were smashed by police before he was taken to a military camp and placed in a ward with about 300 other activists . `` The conditions were terrible because very few were allowed to go to the toilet , and we had to stand on the cold tiles of the floor -LRB- which were -RRB- very dirty , '' said Ahmed , who would not give his last name . Ahmed said he was disappointed by the United States ' reaction to the protests . `` The people of Egypt only want to see Egypt as a free , democratic country , and we would always assume that the United States is our model , '' he said . `` We ca n't understand how come this leader of the free world is looking the other way when it comes to our rights or freedom . '' `` The despotic regime that -LRB- the U.S. -RRB- supports always demonizes the image of United States ... always putting blame on the United States for everything , '' Ahmed said of the Egyptian government . Cairo was quiet Thursday compared with previous days , but there appear to have been smaller skirmishes , and more are anticipated as night comes . In Suez , the port city east of Cairo on the Gulf of Suez , people congregated to demand the release of those detained , and clashes broke out between demonstrators and security forces . The city has long been home to resentment against the government for economic and social reasons . Hani Abdel Latif , an Interior Ministry official , said that 50 people demonstrated peacefully in Ismaeliya . But there were news reports of clashes there . In Egypt 's Sinai region , there were clashes between security forces and protesters , television footage of the scene showed . Egypt briefly closed its stock market Thursday after it fell sharply . It reopened about an hour later . At the same time , Egypt 's ruling NationalDemocratic Party made reference to the discontent on the streets . Secretary-General Safwat al-Sherif said the party wants to talk with the youths who have been at the forefront of the protests . The protest movement in Egypt has been fueled by blogs and social media sites like Twitter and Facebook . ElBaradei , who is also the former head of the United Nations ' nuclear watchdog agency , has been posting messages of support for the demonstrators on Twitter . `` We shall continue to exercise our right of peaceful demonstration and restore our freedom & dignity . Regime violence will backfire badly , '' he said in one of his latest tweets . A Facebook page devoted to Friday 's planned protests had more than 80,000 followers as of 2 p.m. ET Thursday , compared with 20,000 the previous day . As he was waiting to leave Vienna , Austria , ElBaradei said he was going to Egypt to `` make sure that things will be managed in a peaceful way . '' `` I have to give them as much support , political support , spiritual , moral support , whatever I can do , you know , '' he said . `` I will be with them . They are my people , and I have to be there , and I 'd like to see Egypt , a new Egypt . '' In an interview Tuesday on CNN 's `` Connect the World , '' ElBaradei disputed a recent comment by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that the Egyptian government is stable . `` Stability is when you have a government that is elected on a free and fair basis . And we have seen , you know , how the election has been rigged in Egypt . We have seen how people have been tortured , '' he said . ElBaradei was asked whether he would run for the presidency of Egypt . `` The priority for me , '' he said , `` is to shift Egypt into a democracy , is to catch up with the 21st century , to get Egypt to be a modern and ... moderate society and respecting human rights , respecting the basic freedoms of the people . `` Whether I run or not , that is totally irrelevant . And I made it very clear , I will not run under the present conditions , when the deck is stacked completely . '' The outpouring of protests has led to unprecedented violence this week . Police turned water cannons and tear gas on protesters Wednesday to try to break up anti-government demonstrations as the Interior Ministry warned it `` will not allow any provocative movement or a protest or rallies or demonstrations . '' In the heart of Cairo , people were being beaten with sticks and fists and demonstrators were being dragged away amid tear gas .

Quoting provincial officials , the station said most of the clashes took place in the Alarbeen neighborhood and that looters attacked some shops . The Muslim Brotherhood said 35 people were injured in Suez and that security forces in the city had implemented a curfew there Wednesday night . Families and friends of people slain in Suez said angry demonstrations occurred because police did n't hand over the bodies of those killed .

As in Tunisia , the protest movement in Egypt is taking advantage of social media to communicate , inform and organize . Despite attempts to block Twitter , Facebook and other sites -LRB- the government denies it was responsible -RRB- , a Facebook page devoted to Friday 's planned protests had more than 80,000 followers as of 2 p.m. ET Thursday , compared with some 20,000 the previous day . Following Twitter comments with hashtags such as #Cairo , #jan 25 and #Suez generates a huge flood of tweets . There is a breathless excitement about many entries , which are mainly in Arabic , English and French , but there are also scores of rumors , much invention and plenty of hyperbole . Sifting the wheat from the chaff , given the extraordinary volume of traffic , is a full-time job . One typically overstated entry on a Facebook page Thursday read : `` Live ammunition is being fired at protesters . ... Innocent protesters who want their basic rights are being massacred . '' There is as much misinformation as information . But social media can help tip off journalists about developments in places they ca n't get to . For example , it 's been difficult -LRB- and risky -RRB- for foreign journalists to report from the city of Suez , which appears to have seen some of the worst violence of the past few days . But a steady stream of tweets and blog entries , as well as photos and cell-phone video , has provided at least some guidance on the rapidly evolving situation there . In a country the size of Egypt , even large media organizations ca n't be everywhere , especially when the security forces are throwing up roadblocks . As the protests have had -LRB- so far -RRB- little formal organization , social media have become a critical tool for arranging rendezvous . One Twitter entry , for example , called for a march at 3 p.m. Thursday in Giza , a suburb of Cairo . Another on Wednesday called people to Tahrir Square in central Cairo . Of course , there is a weakness in such methods -- because the authorities can also read them , and a plethora of such rallying calls can lead to confusion . In any case , social media may be overtaken as an organizing tool on Friday -- by Egypt 's mosques . The Muslim Brotherhood , which is influential in thousands of mosques throughout the country , has called for protests after Friday prayers . But the Brotherhood is playing catch-up with a movement it has done little to influence so far .

With five dead , more than 100 injured , and the police resorting to tear gas to disperse the demonstrators , most observers are examining whether the Egyptian regime will be able to contain the situation and suppress the protests without even more significant bloodshed . Two factors suggest continued tension and further challenges to the regime . First , the Egyptian state 's institutional framework is at its weakest point since the coup\\/revolution of 1952 that created the Egyptian republic . The delicate balance that the regime has nurtured , between the rise of the liberal capitalists within the ruling National Democratic Party -LRB- NDP -RRB- and the traditional power and influence of the military and security establishment , seems to be under strain . The center of gravity and decision-making has shifted from the long-established anchors of stability toward inexperienced new economic and financial players . The ascent of the new capitalists gave rise to the second factor : an unexpected solidarity between the politically active -- who see the influence of the new capitalists as a blurring of the lines between power and wealth -- and the disenfranchised poor , who as a result of successive financial reform measures , face severe economic pains . The situation is made more acute by a youth unemployment rate of more than 15 % -LRB- in an 80 million population , 40 % of whom are under 30 years old -RRB- . The politically active and the millions of poor Egyptians blame the Hosni Mubarak regime , which has been in power for three decades . This is a tenuous political environment , where anguish and anxiety can quickly turn into anger , and with any catalyst , into action . But , so far , the situation in Egypt is not combustible . Despite the regime 's overall poor record , its major upgrading of the country 's infrastructure , relative success in installing economic liberalization , and cautious foreign policy have fostered an environment in which a few million middle class families managed to secure economic gains . The past decade also witnessed a notable rise in entrepreneurialism with hundreds of thousands of Egyptians able to build small enterprises leveraging the growth in economic sectors ranging from food and beverages , to tourism , to information technology , to entertainment .

However , social media is n't strictly a tool for those with a gripe with their government . Governments themselves have shown a willingness to use websites like Twitter for their own means in the wake of unrest , according to James Carafano , a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation . `` In the Iranian election protests of 2009 , government people would put their own information on Twitter , sometimes disinformation to try and confuse people , saying this person is a government informant and things like that , '' Carafano said .

Thousands of people demonstrated against Yemen 's longtime president Thursday , demanding the kind of change that forced Tunisia 's president from office earlier this month . There were at least four demonstrations Thursday in the capital Sanaa , local journalists told CNN . Security was out in force , but there were no reports of violence . A much smaller number of people turned out to demonstrate in favor of President Ali Abdullah Saleh , the sources said . Egypt is also wracked by protests in the wake of the demonstrations that unexpectedly forced Tunisia 's longtime President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to leave the country . Yemen has become a key al Qaeda battleground , with Yemeni security forces carrying out offensives against suspected militants . The United States has sent top officials to Yemen and vowed support for the government 's fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , as the local branch calls itself . A Yemeni rights activist , whose arrest sparked an international outcry and domestic protests , was released from prison Monday and said there is a revolution taking place in her country . Authorities arrested Tawakkol Karman over the weekend , accusing her of organizing anti-government protests in Sanaa . They let her go after more than 5,000 protesters gathered in her support . She had initially refused to leave prison until officials also agreed to free other activists detained over the weekend , she said . `` This revolution going on in Yemen was inspired by Tunisia 's ` Jasmine Revolution ' and we are now having a ` Jasmine Revolution ' in Yemen , '' Karman told CNN soon after her release . `` The huge amount of pressure coming from the people here will force President Saleh to leave office . '' Karman , who heads the Women Journalists Without Chains organization , said she was arrested Saturday night near her home . People in Yemen are upset because the parliament is considering loosening the rules on presidential term limits . That has sparked concerns among the opposition that Saleh might try to appoint himself president for life . Saleh has been in office for some 32 years and was last re-elected in 2006 .

What similarities are there between the situation in Egypt and that in Tunisia ? Both nations have seen dramatic rises in the cost of living in recent years as well as accusations of corruption among the ruling elite . Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has now been in power since 1981 -- six years before ex-Tunisian ruler Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , who was forced from office earlier this month , assumed the presidency of his country . The protest movements in both nations have also been characterized by strong middle class elements . No surprise then that the dissent in Tunisia has inspired some demonstrators in Egypt . But below the surface there are differences between these two North African nations . Tunisia , until the fall of Ben Ali , had a strictly controlled media , with severe restrictions on what could be reported . Egyptian protests got ` so big so fast ' The press in Egypt , in contrast is lively and often highly critical of the president and his government . Certainly the media is afforded much more freedom than its counterparts in Syria , Iraq under Saddam Hussein and Tunisia . Anti-government rallies are not uncommon in Egypt -- but usually protesters are heavily outnumbered by the security forces . This week 's protests have been unusual because demonstrators on the streets of Cairo have outnumbered police . Is there as much freedom on the internet in Egypt ? Egypt has a less restrictive approach to social media : Facebook is freely available and often used as a means to organize protests . Twitter has also been used as an organizing tool . By contrast the previous Tunisian government took a more hardline attitude toward the web , closing down sites and forcing protesters to rely more heavily on cellphone SMS and word-of-mouth . So have the protesters in Egypt made use of the internet ? Definitely , driving protests more so than in Tunisia . Two groups stand out . The first is the Facebook group `` We are All Khaled Said , '' its name taken from an Alexandria activist who was allegedly beaten to death by police last year . It wants limits on the presidential term -- Egypt faces an election later this year -- and a raise in the minimum wage among other demands . By early Tuesday it had 90,000-plus users signed up . The April 6 Movement , started in 2008 on Facebook to support striking workers , shares many of the same concerns and is similarly characterized by a strong following among the young of Egypt . One political group that has been largely , though not totally , absent from the protests is the banned Muslim Brotherhood , the biggest organized opposition to the government . It draws its support from the poorer members of society , especially in the slums of Cairo and also Upper Egypt , but also among professionals , such as lawyers and doctors . The Egyptian government frequently characterizes the Brotherhood as an extremist group and uses this -- and the terror threat -- as a reason for clampdowns on opposition . Earlier in the week the Brotherhood said it would not be officially participating in protests but added it would not prevent its members from taking part . On Thursday the Brotherhood called for its followers to demonstrate after Friday 's weekly prayers -- the first time in the current round of unrest that the largest opposition bloc has told supporters to take to the streets . The economy is clearly a factor in the unrest across North Africa . How do Egypt and Tunisia compare ? Egyptian government being too harsh ? Could Cairo be the next Tunis ? Journalist ` trapped and beaten ' in Egypt The Egyptian economy has been in better shape in recent years than its Tunisian counterpart and has key exports such as oil on which it can rely . It also depends heavily on tourism , and revenues from the Suez Canal . Tunisia 's GDP grew by 3.4 % in 2010 and 3 % in 2009 , compared to 5.3 % and 4.6 % during the same periods in Egypt , according to the CIA Factbook . Meanwhile the unemployment rate in Egypt stood at 9.7 % last year , compared to 14 % in Tunisia for the same period . In both cases analysts believe the true unemployment rate is substantially higher . One of the complaints from many protesters in Egypt is that they have not been able to enjoy the fruits of this economic success . There has also been unease that the Egyptian government , which used to involve itself in crackdowns on black market activity and speculation , has played a less active role in recent years . Historically Egypt has a larger percentage of its population living below the poverty line than Tunisia -- 20 % , according to a 2005 estimate , compared to 3.8 % . But many of those poor have not been involved in this week 's protests , their places taken by students , businessmen and even middle-aged couples . Poor Egyptians can not take time off work to protest . There have been clashes between security forces and protesters in Egypt . Is the army going to get involved ? The army in Tunisia played a crucial role : despite clashes between security forces and protesters , the military never gave its backing to the then-president . In Egypt , the military has likewise rarely become involved in protests -- the last major incidents were bread riots in 1977 and a police strike in 1985 . Even the assassination of Hosni Mubarak 's predecessor Anwar El Sadat in 1981 involved only a small hardcore group of officers motivated by extremism . This apolitical approach means that the army is held in high regard by many ordinary Egyptians . Further afield , how is Egypt regarded by the United States ? The United States closely monitors all developments in North Africa due to the war on terror and the threat of extremism . However , among Arab nations Egypt enjoys a near-unparalleled relationship with Washington . On Tuesday Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that while the United States backed the `` the fundamental right of expression and assembly for all people '' it believed that the `` the Egyptian government is stable and is looking for ways to respond to the legitimate needs and interests of the Egyptian people . '' But on Wednesday Clinton said , `` We believe strongly that the Egyptian government has an important opportunity at this moment in time to implement political , economic and social reforms to respond to the legitimate needs and interests of the Egyptian people . '' She also urged the government not to prevent peaceful protests or block social networking sites . Also Wednesday White House press secretary Robert Gibbs was asked if the administration supports Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak . He replied : `` Egypt is a strong ally . '' Egypt has been a major player in the Middle East peace process over the decades -- most famously the Camp David Accords signed by Sadat , Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and U.S. President Jimmy Carter in 1978 . After Israel , Egypt is now the second biggest recipient of U.S. aid . Washington also regards Egypt as a key ally in the war on terror . It has also been alleged that Egypt has sometimes been used by the U.S. for rendition . Italian prosecutors claimed in 2005 that suspected CIA agents kidnapped Osama Nasr Mostafa Hassan in Milan and that he was taken to Egypt for interrogation and torture . The U.S. maintains it does not send suspects to countries that condone torture . Egypt has also played a key role in issues including the containment of Iran and relations between Lebanon and Syria . In comparison Tunisia has its importance -- it was hit by extremist attacks in the early to mid-1980s -- but does not compare strategically . And what about the rest of the Arab world ? Again , Egypt carries far more clout than its North African neighbor . Aside from its economic and strategic weight , it has a population of more than 80 million -- nearly eight times that of Tunisia . The rest of the Arab world is heavily influenced by Egyptian culture including literature , movies and TV . Put simply , it 's at the heart of the region in a way that Tunisia is not .

The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt this week urged its followers to protest after Friday prayers -- the first time in the latest wave of unrest the group has made such a call . What is the Muslim Brotherhood ? The Muslim Brotherhood is a religious and political group founded on the belief that Islam is not simply a religion , but a way of life . It advocates a move away from secularism , and a return to the rules of the Quran as a basis for healthy families , communities , and states . The movement officially rejects the use of violent means to secure its goals . However , offshoots of the group have been linked to attacks in the past , and critics blame the Brotherhood for sparking troubles elsewhere in the Middle East . Many consider it the forerunner of modern militant Islamism . The Muslim Brotherhood has been part of the political scene in Egypt for more than 80 years . It was formed there by Hassan al-Banna in 1928 . Teacher Al-Banna and his followers were initially united by a desire to oust the British from control in Egypt , and to rid their country of what they saw as `` corrupting '' Western influences . In its early years , the group concentrated on religion , education and social services , but as its membership grew , it moved into the political sphere , organizing protests against the Egyptian government . In the 1940s , an armed wing of the Brotherhood was blamed for a string of violent acts , including the assassination of Egyptian Prime Minister Mahmud Fahmi al-Nuqrashi in 1948 -- shortly after he had ordered the dissolution of the MB . Al-Banna himself was assassinated soon afterwards -- his supporters claimed he had been killed on the wishes of the government . The movement went underground in the 1950s , and decades of oppression by successive Egyptian rulers led many of the Brotherhood 's members to flee abroad , while others were jailed . The MB grew throughout the 1980s as part of a general growth of interest in Islam , and the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 saw a spike in membership . Why is it important in Egypt ? The Brotherhood is the oldest and largest opposition group in Egypt . However , it is illegal under Egyptian law , which bans all parties based on religion . Because of this , its members contest elections as independents . Until last year 's polls , the party had 88 seats in the country 's legislature . But following a decision to boycott the election because of voting irregularities , its parliamentary influence was wiped out . The Brotherhood has widespread support among Egypt 's middle classes , and its members control many of the country 's professional organizations . How influential is the Brotherhood elsewhere ? There are branches of the Muslim Brotherhood in countries across the Middle East and North and East Africa , including Sudan , Syria and Saudi Arabia . There is also a branch in the U.S. Its offshoots outside Egypt are markedly more conservative in their views : The Kuwaiti branch is said to oppose the right of women to vote . Sayyid Qutb , a member of the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1950s and 1960s , developed the doctrine of jihad , and the radical group Hamas is believed to be an offshoot of the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood .

He is a tyrant , and if the U.S believes that Mubarak would n't start the anti sentiment about the U.S as well they had better think again . He is an opportunist . His people started out peacefil and he wanted to get support from other countries thinking it was the people in his favor that started this . My heart breaks that these young men of Egypt have risked their lives for freedom as the rest of the Egyptian people hide in fear . Our government has the leverage of the billion plus dollars we send to them ... I pray that we do not let these brave men die in vain .

By Annalyn Censky , staff reporterJanuary 28 , 2011 : 5:11 PM ET NEW YORK -LRB- CNNMoney -RRB- -- Food prices have been rising worldwide , as the cost of raw materials and agricultural products surge , contributing to political unrest around the globe . In December , international food prices broke an all-time high when they rose 25 % for the year , led by rising costs for staples like rice , wheat , and maize , the United Nations reported . The sharp rise in food prices , in particular , has become `` a source of political instability , '' New York University economist Nouriel Roubini , told CNNMoney 's Poppy Harlow , at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland this week . Roubini , nicknamed `` Dr. Doom '' for his famously bearish predictions , said spiking energy and food prices pose one of the greatest global threats -- especially to emerging market economies . Why prices are rising : Bad weather in Australia and Russia over the summer severely diminished wheat crops , partially fueling the latest commodities surge . Rising incomes in emerging markets like China and India also play a role , analysts at the Eurasia Group say . The growing middle class in those countries has prompted a shift from a grain-based diet to one consisting of more meat . And a push toward biofuels has also led to rising demand for corn and sugar , pushing up commodity prices . Where it 's hitting : The pinch has been felt most in rapidly developing countries like China , India , and Russia , which still have large portions of their population living in poverty . Food inflation in China was recently at 9.6 % , while in India it surged a staggering 18 % . Countries that depend on imports and do n't grow a lot of their own grains , like many Middle Eastern nations , are also feeling the pain from price pressures . The recent turmoil there , with outbreaks of riots and violent clashes with police and military forces , is partially related to surging food prices . `` What has happened in Tunisia , is happening right now in Egypt , but also riots in Morocco , Algeria and Pakistan , are related not only to high unemployment rates and to income and wealth inequality , but also to this very sharp rise in food and commodity prices , '' Roubini said . In Egypt alone , food prices soared 17 % -- in part because of the worldwide surge in commodities prices but also because of local supply imbalances . But that does n't mean citizens there are completely insulated from price pressures . About 40 % of Egypt 's citizens live off less than $ 2 a day , so any price increase hurts . `` There 's a pretty expensive food subsidy system in Egypt , '' said Richard Fox , head of Middle East and Africa sovereign ratings at Fitch Ratings . `` Having said that , definitely high inflation has been squeezing people 's incomes . '' Plus there 's a thriving black market that often drives up the prices poor households are paying for foodstuffs , Sabra said . Meanwhile the bigger problem lies not in just prices , but in the fact that when citizens are unhappy , they have little opportunity for political recourse . `` In the U.S. if you 're unhappy about who you 've deputized , you vote them out in the next election , '' Sabra said . `` It does n't work that way in Tunisia or Egypt .

He recalls that day : When I went to the Kennedy Space Center on January 28 , 1986 , to cover the launch of the space shuttle Challenger , I was expecting it to be routine , like the launches I had covered in the past . The only thing different this time was the excitement that surrounded the first teacher-turned-astronaut , Christa McAuliffe . It was brutally cold , and the weather caused the launch to slip several times during the morning . Just before launch , I walked down to the countdown clock , as was tradition among the journalists , and waited for liftoff . I remember that typical winter clear-blue sky as Challenger took off . FULL POST Canadian lottery officials say they ve finally awarded to the correct people a 2003 multimillion-dollar jackpot that authorities say was fraudulently claimed by a lottery retailer s relative . Seven men who played Canada s Super 7 lottery together in December 2003 were awarded a $ 12.5 million jackpot plus $ 2.35 million in interest after being declared the rightful winners , the Toronto Star reported . Each will receive $ 2.1 million . It s a little surreal , one of the men , Joseph Reaman , 35 , of Ridgeville , Ontario , said at a news conference introducing the winners , according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corp . I got a baby on the way , and he s pretty much set for life . The correction comes after three members of a family -- two of whom worked for a Burlington , Ontario , lottery outlet were charged last year on suspicion of stealing the winning ticket , according to the CBC .

Matthew Nestor , left , Jason Hayes and William Moyer were accused of obstructing justice . Three former Pennsylvania police officers accused of trying to cover up the investigation into the beating death of an undocumented Mexican immigrant were acquitted of the top charge of conspiracy . A federal jury found former Shenandoah Police Chief Matthew Nestor and officers William Moyer and Jason Hayes not guilty of conspiracy to obstruct a federal investigation in the July 2008 death of Luis Ramirez , a court official told CNN . The official had knowledge of the verdict but was not authorized to speak . Nestor was found guilty of falsifying reports and Moyer was convicted of lying to the FBI . Hayes , who was also accused of falsifying police reports , was acquitted of the two charges against him . `` I 'd just like to thank all the supporters I had , especially my family , friends and neighbors . I had so many well-wishers from Shenandoah , '' Moyer said after the verdict , according to CNN affiliate WNEP . Hayes said he will reapply for his job with the Shenandoah Police Department , WNEP reported . Ramirez , a day laborer and father of two engaged to a woman from Shenandoah , died three days after he was beaten into a coma in a street fight with members of the small mining town 's high school football team . Derrick M. Donchak and Brandon J. Piekarsky were convicted of simple assault in state court last year but acquitted of murder , prompting an outcry from Latino groups and politicians . Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell urged the federal government to pursue the case , resulting in hate crime convictions for the two young men . At the time of Ramirez 's death , Hayes was dating Piekarsky 's mother and the two are now engaged , according to WNEP . Moyer 's son was a high school freshman who played football with the youths involved in the attack , according to an indictment . The three men were accused of helping the boys conceal their roles and of falsifying police reports . Moyer was also charged with witness tampering and lying to the FBI . Each of them testified in their defense and denied the allegations . An earlier ruling from a lower court said Rahm Emanuel did n't meet residency requirements for mayoral candidates .

There has been a common thread in the recent political upheaval in Tunisia and Egypt : Social media has played a role in both influencing the protests and reporting on them . `` Social media is key to the revolution taking place in North Africa , and this may actually be the first time a government leader has lost power because of social media , '' said Darrell West , the vice president for governance studies at the Brookings Institution , referring to the ousting of former Tunisian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali . However , social media is n't strictly a tool for those with a gripe with their government . Governments themselves have shown a willingness to use websites like Twitter for their own means in the wake of unrest , according to James Carafano , a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation . Any normal player might have gotten lost in the mayhem and hype of Brigham Young University 's most anticipated basketball game in school history . Jimmer Fredette is no normal player . The senior guard led the Cougars to a 71-58 rout of No. 4 ranked San Diego State Wednesday night at the Marriott Center . Though the nail-biting action of two top-10 teams battling it out lasted until the fourth quarter , the Aztecs fell short in their attempts to stave off Fredette 's offensive charge . As SI.com s Kelli Anderson writes : `` The Aztecs , the best defensive team in the conference , threw all sorts of defenders at Fredette , from D.J. Gay to Billy White to Chase Tapley , sometimes two at a time . The defensive pressure frequently forced him to change his mind in mid-air and pass instead of shoot -LRB- and he coughed up the ball four times -RRB- but he still filled the bucket . '' The game marked Fredette 's 15th in which he scored 30 points or more , clearly making him one of the school 's most fabled athletes and one of the year s biggest successes . He is on track to reach a rare milestone as well : nabbing a scoring title and the National Player of the Year award . He would join Bradley s Hersey Hawkins and Purdue s Glenn Robinson as the only three players since 1970 to achieve the honor . These small hand axes are at least 100,000 years old . A team of scientists found these tools in the United Arab Emirates . Scientists have discovered new evidence suggesting that modern humans first left Africa to explore Eurasia much earlier than previously thought . An international team of scientists has uncovered a tool kit that indicates that modern humans , who looked and perhaps behaved much like us , must have lived in eastern Arabia about 100,000 to 125,000 years ago . The collection of small hand axes , scrapers and other tools was found in Jebel Faya , United Arab Emirates . A report about the discovery appears in the journal Science . The people who made these tools `` are our ancestors , I have no doubt about that , '' said Hans-Peter Uerpmann , of the University of Tubingen in Germany , who collaborated on the project , at a press teleconference Wednesday . But the findings still do not prove definitively that modern humans made these tools , as the researchers did not find human remains near them , said Ted Goebel , anthropologist at Texas A&M University , who was not involved in the study . They potentially could have been made by Neanderthals or Neanderthal-like hominids , who were already in Eurasia at that time , Goebel said . Almost 300 protesters arrived at Athens University this week and are staging a hunger strike . Riot police in Athens , Greece , late Thursday surrounded a law school where 237 immigrants are waging a hunger strike , according to a Greek newspaper . The protesters , who arrived this week from the Greek island of Crete , are demanding residence permits , Kathimerini reported , and the police arrived after failed attempts to move the protesters to another building in central Athens . Athens University s Law School and the government have been at odds over whose responsibility it was to handle the demonstrators . The prosecutor s office for the appeals court announced an inquiry into whether the university failed to take action to prevent the immigrants from occupying the building . The Athens News Agency explained that under Greek law , university campuses are off-limits to police unless they have been invited or a serious crime has been committed . Greece s majority party says leftists have abused the law and are using the immigrants as political pawns .

Los Angeles detectives assigned to the Grim Sleeper serial killer case say they are investigating two additional homicides that may be the work of suspect Lonnie Franklin Jr. , according to an aide for an L.A. councilman in whose district some of the killings took place . The detectives also said there are four missing persons cases that may be related to the overall investigation , the aide told CNN.com Thursday . In July , 57-year-old Lonnie David Franklin Jr. was arrested and charged with 10 murders and one attempted murder related to slayings that date to 1985 . He has pleaded not guilty . In 2009 , CNN.com published a special cold case interactive on the decades-long hunt for the killer . Police were led to Franklin after his 28-year-old son was arrested and gave a DNA swab , authorities said . When authorities announced the arrest , they revealed that Franklin had , for a time , worked as a garage attendant at a Los Angeles police station . Detectives delivered the news about the additional cases at a community meeting Wednesday night at Bethel AME Church in South Los Angeles . They were responding to a question from a family member of one of the two homicide victims , according to the Los Angeles Times . Dennis Gleason , a spokesman for Eighth District Councilman Bernard Parks , told CNN that the possible additional homicide victims were identified through photographs related to the Grim Sleeper case that police released to the public in December . Shortly after Franklin 's arrest , police searched his home and said they found Polaroids and videotape of many women . In December , investigators released some of those photographs -LRB- viewable here -RRB- , which generated leads , they said .

Cairo , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` Freedom ! '' That word , yelled out in Arabic , reverberated Friday along the banks of the Nile River in Cairo -- as well as in the port city of Alexandria , near the canal in Suez , and other pockets of Egypt . Many demonstrators voicing their desire for a new government and new political future remained on the streets well into Saturday morning , defying a curfew and revelling in a historic day in a nation whose history dates back millennia . By early Saturday , police were nowhere to be seen in the capital of Cairo , with military forces deployed on streets all around the nation for the first time in more than three decades . They were ordered out by President Hosni Mubarak , whom many demonstrators were urging to step down or , at least , institute dramatic economic and political reforms . `` We want -LRB- Mubarek -RRB- to leave , '' said Ahmed , whose last name was withheld to protect his identity . `` His time is over , '' the 19-year-old law student said early Saturday from Raml Square in central Alexandria . Egypt 's ruling party headquarters on fire Police fire tear gas at protesters Suez crowds confront riot police Mubarak has been in power for 30 years , during which time Egypt has established itself as one of the most important powers in the region and a strong ally of the United States . At the same time , the long-time ruler and his regime had a reputation for restricting freedoms and staunchly holding onto power . Resistance in the past had often been stifled by either political manuevering or the police , members of which were out in full force this week . But rarely have they met an opposition force as large , or as apparently determined . `` Police have always been violent , but we have n't seen it this way , '' Sarah Sirgany , a reporter for Daily News Egypt who has been posting regular developments on Twitter , told CNN 's Piers Morgan . `` We have n't seen this many people on the streets at the same time . '' Video footage from Friday showed throngs of protesters charging down a bridge over the Nile River in Cairo , overrunning police trucks that fired off tear gas with minimal effect . Elsewhere , demonstrators torched and ransacked the headquarters of Mubarak 's ruling National Democratic Party . When protesters circled the Ministry of Information in Cairo on Friday , they were greeted by police , who responded with sharp cracks of gunfire . It 's not clear whether police shot at protesters or into the air , whether their bullets were rubber or steel , whether anyone was wounded or killed . There were many other reports of run-ins , and the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights reporting early Friday that the government had arrested more than 1,000 people , including political opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei . Mohammed Mansour , a resident of the Shubra neighborhood of Cairo , said that he and fellow demonstrators had been `` beaten and assaulted by police '' since Monday , when the popular unrest began . Continuing to fight Friday , he said that his group had beaten back police , who retreated . Later he claimed , protesters set fire to three police stations and about 20 police cars . `` We went out today and we were ready to die , so our children can live in dignity , '' said Mansour . Protesters ' interactions with Egypt 's military -- members of an army that is widely respected in Egypt -- were far more friendly . In Cairo and Alexandria , many protesters greeted troops with embraces and cheers , some even shaking hands with soldiers . Mansour , the Cairo resident , said he and fellow demonstrators celebrated when they saw troops roll into town , and they were not alone . `` It means we are victorious , '' he said . `` If the army comes out , that means the government ... is no longer in control . '' In the wee hours of Saturday , with the curfew ostensibly in effect , people continued to come up to friendly army troops , greeting them and posing for pictures by tanks . Some military personnel were stationed outside burned out police stations , but did little to prevent people from going into them and coming out with chairs , tables and various valuables . The army was n't the only side exercising restraint . The Muslim Brotherhood sent its followers onto the streets after Friday prayers , the first time Egypt 's large and venerable -- but illegal -- Islamic opposition called for protest during this round of demonstrations . And when younger Muslim Brotherhood protesters seemed ready to hurl rocks at the police in Alexandria , Egypt 's second-largest city , older men put their arms around their shoulders , calming them down . Just after midnight Saturday , Mubarak gave a speech defending and explaining the government 's response to the protests while saying that he 'd soon form a new government mindful of the demonstrators ' demands for policy changes . Still that did n't appease many on the streets , who vowed to continue demonstrating again against what they felt was an unjust ruling government that needed a fresh start -- without Mubarak . `` We are one of the richest Arab countries , and we want to live , '' said a 20-year-old student named Mohammed , whose last name was withheld to protect his identity , from Alexandria . `` Let a new government form , but if we do n't get what we ask for , we will go back to the streets again and again . '' Another protester in Alexandria , an 18-year-old taxi driver named Yousef , did n't even think the entrenched Egyptian ruler deserved even that much of a chance . He said Egyptians should press on with their protests , following the lead of their fellow African nation Tunisia . There , President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali left the country after 23 years in power following weeks of demonstrations against his rule . The new government , under Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi , announced new freedoms and promised to institute numerous democratic-minded reforms . `` They kept protesting until he fled the country , '' Yousef said of Tunisia . `` We will do more and more , we will continue our demonstrations , and we will do 3,000 times more of what the Tunisians did .

This is the big one . For years , Egyptian demonstrators raged against Hosni Mubarak 's military regime , calling on their fellow citizens to take to the streets and oust the agents of their oppression . For years , earnest U.S. officials urged Mubarak to open up Egypt 's political system , crack down on the grand and petty corruption that pervades Egyptian life and deliver economic progress to the masses . For years , analysts -- myself included -- dismissed the possibility of real change as long as Mubarak , now approaching his 83rd birthday and his third decade in power , still breathed . It seems the Arab street had other plans . Inspired by events in Tunisia , a smart , tech-savvy network of young activists seized upon January 25 -- a holiday ironically celebrating the country 's police -- to organize mass rallies demanding Mubarak 's ouster . The Egyptian interior minister dismissed them as `` a bunch of incognizant , ineffective young people . '' Longtime Egypt watchers tried to keep their hopes low , expecting the same disappointing results as before . Now , four days into an uprising in the Arab world 's most populous country , the beating heart of its media culture , and the historical strategic leader of the region , it 's no longer possible to argue that Egypt is a stable country . The situation is changing rapidly , but what we know is this : The country is virtually cut off from the outside world . Egyptians from across the social and geographical spectrum -- from poor , jobless young men along the Suez Canal to upper-class women in posh Cairo suburbs to workers in the teeming Nile Delta -- are in an uproar . The ruling National Democratic Party 's headquarters has been set on fire . The army has sent troops and armored vehicles into the streets to enforce a curfew as defiant demonstrators torch police stations and vehicles . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , speaking slowly and carefully to avoid making a mistake at a sensitive moment , urged the Egyptian government Friday to allow its people to protest peacefully . But , she added , `` We want to partner with the Egyptian people and their government '' and called on Mubarak to make reforms . All week , the U.S. message has been largely consistent : Egypt is a key ally , both sides should refrain from violence and the government should respect the legitimate grievances of the Egyptian people .

WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- - Just three days after a State of the Union Address that President Obama 's own aides say was 80 percent devoted to the economy and domestic issues , the pressing national security issue of unrest in Egypt has suddenly vaulted to the top of the commander-in-chief 's agenda as he struggles with how closely he wants to stand with a longtime U.S. ally , President Hosni Mubarak . White House national security spokesman Tommy Vietor said Obama has been getting regular briefings on the unfolding situation throughout the week , and the president got a special memo with the latest information on Friday morning . `` The president has requested multiple briefings each day on the situation in the Middle East , '' said Vietor . `` Today , he received a memo updating him on the latest in Egypt from National Security Advisor Tom Donilon . '' Vietor added that Obama will get even more on the latest intelligence on Friday during his Presidential Daily Briefing , which is focused each day on sensitive material dealing with pressing national security issues . Asked if there have been any direct telephone calls between Obama and Mubarak , Vietor said , `` The president has not called President Mubarak , but there is daily contact between the U.S. and Egyptian governments through various channels , including the embassies and other organizations in which President Obama 's messages and concerns are relayed . '' The president publicly expressed some of those concerns about Mubarak 's reaction to the protests on Wednesday , during a Q&A session moderated by You Tube in which Obama took questions from the general public . `` My main hope right now is , is that violence is not the answer in solving these problems in Egypt , so the government has to be careful about not resorting to violence , and the people on the streets have to be careful about not resorting to violence , '' Obama said . `` And I think that it is very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances . '' Obama and top officials in his administration are in the awkward position of deciding how closely to stand with the repressive Mubarak , who has been in power for 30 years and is now cracking down on protesters and cutting off social media . `` As I said in my State of the Union speech , there are certain core values that we believe in as Americans that we believe are universal : freedom of speech , freedom of expression , people being able to use social networking or any other mechanisms to communicate with each other and express their concerns , '' Obama said . `` And that I think is no less true in the Arab world than it is here in the United States . '' It 's hard to overstate how pivotal Mubarak has been to the U.S. in bringing stability to the region over the years , including help to the Obama administration on building international support to stop Iran 's nuclear ambitions as well as trying to bring together the Israelis and Palestinians in efforts to forge Mideast peace . All of that makes this a tough balancing act for Obama . `` Let me say , first of all , that Egypt has been an ally of ours on a lot of critical issues , '' Obama said during the You Tube session . `` They made peace with Israel . President Mubarak has been very helpful on a range of tough issues in the Middle East . But I 've always said to him that making sure that they are moving forward on reform - political reform , economic reform - is absolutely critical to the long-term well-being of Egypt . And you can see these pent-up frustrations that are being displayed on the streets . When the protests first sprung up earlier in the week , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs was twice asked if the White House still backed Mubarak directly , and he twice fell back on quotes declaring that Egypt in general is an ally of the U.S. Vice President Joe Biden is also trying to walk that same fine line , refusing to call the Egyptian leader a dictator in an interview with PBS on Thursday , while also noting that Mubarak needs to make changes to his government and let his people taste freedom . Asked specifically by Jim Lehrer if it is time for Mubarak to `` stand aside , '' Biden said , `` No I think the time has come for President Mubarak to move in the direction to be more responsive to some of the needs of the people out there . '' Biden added the protesters are `` middle class folks who are looking for a little more access a little more opportunity and the two things we 've been saying Jim is that violence is n't appropriate and people have the right to protest and so we think that I hope I think that Mubarak president Mubarak will is going to respond to the legitimate concerns that are being raised .

I do n't like his dealing with Red China who has caused more deaths to our American soldiers than any other country . I do n't like his opening relations with Cuba . The most oppressed people around are the Cubans . I do n't agree with his policy on Illegals . I have nothing against them I think he should tell the Mexican president you 're going to let these people come and your not going to charge them a fee as great as it would take for them to sneak into our country . That way they can become benefitting citizens of this country . I am sorry if I offended you . We are all carrying the same blood line . About slavery it was an atrocity that American bought the slaves . But slavery is and has being going on since forever . Think of the thousands of years the Christians were slaves . We all are a sad people if we are a party to that . Take my apologys for what some of the forefathers of this nation did . Thankfully my family was not a part of that . My forefathers came to Mass. then migrated to Texas after the war . They did not have slaves nor believed in it . They wore blue in the Civil War and my family has been connected with the military since each generation .

Hezbollah , a force greater that the Lebanese army is waiting the wings to seize powerLet 's look at Mubarak and his current regime . It really is a typical past Egyptian regimes under Soviet sponsored Nasser and Sadat . Maybe there were a few symbolic reforms . The US did not invent the current system , not did to prop it up . Mubarak comes for the same pedigree as the two previous leaders . As for the teeth necklace comment , that truly sickens me coming for someone who fails to see the demons within the Arab world .

With parts of his capital ablaze , Mubarak said he was asking his government to resign and would soon announce a new one , pledging to address the concerns of thousand of Egyptians protesting in Cairo 's streets . `` I just spoke to him after his speech , '' Obama said , `` and told him he has a responsibility to give meaning to those words , to take concrete steps and actions that deliver on that promise . Violence will not address the grievances of the Egyptian people . Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away . `` This moment of volatility has to be turned into a moment of promise , '' Obama said . The U.S. president repeated his administration 's call for the Egyptian government to restore access to the internet and cell phone service and urged `` concrete steps that advance the rights of the Egyptian people . '' Obama 's remarks , delivered from State Dining Room , were the strongest yet from the United States . `` There must be reform , '' he said , `` political , social and economic reforms that meet the aspirations of the Egyptian people . Gibbs : Violence not the answer in Egypt Police van slams into protester Suez crowds confront riot police Who would fill Egypt 's power void ? `` In the absence of these reforms , '' he said , `` grievances have built up over time . `` The United States will continue to stand up for the rights of the Egyptian people and work with their government in pursuit of a future that is more just , more free and more hopeful , '' he concluded . In his remarks , Mubarak was clear that he had no intentions of stepping down -- yet his resignation is what the protesters are demanding . And privately , U.S. officials fear that Mubarak may be in over his head as protests against his 30-year rule showed no signs of ending . A senior administration official said the White House saw Mubarak 's address as `` hardly conciliatory and highly disappointing , but what did you expect ? '' It 's clear , the official said -- speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter -- that Mubarak believes he can ride this out , `` and this time , we 're not so sure that is the right assumption . '' Administration officials had hoped Mubarak would promise an immediate and open dialogue , the official said . Before the speech , senior U.S. officials had similar thoughts , worrying that the Egyptian government may not realize all it is up against or what the protesters are saying . Mubarak , they said , has two choices : to embrace meaningful reforms or to continue the crackdown . The United States is being very careful not to be too tough on the Egyptian leader directly , the senior officials said , because they fear that might drive the government into a survivalist mentality , causing a further crackdown . The officials said conversations with the Egyptian government are taking place across the U.S. administration , including with U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Margaret Scobey , who has participated in several videoconferences with Washington during the day . A senior State Department official said , `` our initial impression is that he emphasized security far more than reform . '' `` We 'll see what the implications for the government reshuffle are , but he was not particularly forthcoming in the speech , '' said the official , who could n't speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the situation . Earlier , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the administration is `` very concerned '' about the situation in Egypt , adding that at risk could be economic and military aid from the United States . `` This is a situation that will be solved by the people of Egypt , '' Gibbs said . `` We are watching very closely the actions of the government , the police and all of those in the military . '' The United States will review its `` assistance posture '' to Egypt based on events that take place in the coming days , he said . Gibbs declined to elaborate how the United States might alter relations with a key ally in the region but urged restraint as massive demonstrations have resulted in widespread property damage , including at the offices of Egypt 's ruling party . That building was burned and ransacked by protesters in Cairo on Friday , Nile TV reported . A CNN witness saw the building ablaze . Gibbs said the collective consequences of the government 's actions will be the subject of a review in determining whether the U.S. will alter assistance toward Egypt . `` Within that review is military '' assistance , Gibbs said . Egypt receives about $ 1.3 billion in military aid from Washington every year , second only to Israel , and has received nearly $ 30 billion in economic aid since 1975 , according to State Department figures . `` The die is cast , '' said Leslie H. Gelb , the president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations . `` The administration has made clear that it leans toward the demonstrators . '' Gibbs said , `` we 've reach a point where the grievances of the people have to be addressed through concrete reforms '' but would not elaborate on the potential fallout if the Mubarak government -- considered a strategic ally in the region -- does not survive the protests . `` We do n't know who these people are or if they are at all capable of putting a government together , '' Gelb said , cautioning of a power vacuum left by the possible collapse of the three-decade-old government . Often considered a crucial power broker in the Middle East , Egypt has played major roles in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and in controlling the Suez Canal , a strategic passageway for trade across the region . Earlier Friday , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called on Egypt 's government `` to allow peaceful protests and reverse the unprecedented steps it has taken to cut off communications . '' `` We are deeply concerned about the use of violence by Egyptian police and security forces against protesters , and we call on the Egyptian government to do everything within its power to restrain its security forces , '' Clinton said Friday , referring to the unfolding crisis in several Egyptian cities where tens of thousands of demonstrators clashed with state security forces . `` At the same time , protesters should also refrain from violence and express themselves peacefully , '' she said . `` As a partner , we strongly believe that the Egyptian government needs to engage with the Egyptian people immediately , '' Clinton said . `` They need to view civil society as their partner , not a threat . '' Servers of Egypt 's main internet provider were down early Friday , including servers for the Egyptian government 's sites and for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo . Early Friday , Gibbs said that he is `` very concerned about violence in Egypt , '' tweeting that the `` government must respect the rights of the Egyptian people & turn on social networking and internet . '' But at least one internet service provider , Noor , was still working . The U.S. State Department on Friday urged Americans traveling abroad to `` defer non-essential travel to Egypt . '' `` U.S. citizens in Egypt should remain in their residences or hotels until the situation stabilizes , '' the agency added in a written travel alert . The agency warned that Egyptian security forces may block off the area around the U.S. Embassy as a result of massive demonstrations that have set vehicles ablaze and resulted in widespread property damage . `` U.S. citizens should not attempt to come to the U.S. Embassy or the Tahrir Square area at such times , '' the statement said , urging Americans to carry identification and a working cell phone . Delta Air Lines spokeswoman Susan Elliott said Friday that the carrier 's last flight from Cairo will depart on Saturday , and all other Cairo service is indefinitely suspended as a result of the civil unrest . President Barack Obama has requested `` multiple briefings '' on Egypt , White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said Friday . He has not called Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , the target of the protesters ' anger , `` but there is daily contact between the U.S. and Egyptian governments through various channels , including the embassies and other organizations in which Obama 's messages and concerns are relayed , '' Vietor said . Former Clinton Defense Secretary William Cohen said Obama is likely reluctant to call Mubarak `` without it appearing that we are directing what Mubarak should do and he is responding to the control of the United States . '' `` I think that , if anything , one might ask why has n't President Mubarak called President Obama and said , ` Are you with me or against me ? ' I mean , that would be a call that might also be worthy of consideration , '' Cohen said . Obama has urged the government and demonstrators to refrain from violence as protests continued . `` It is very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances , '' he said this week . Vice President Joe Biden said on `` PBS NewsHour '' on Thursday that Mubarak should listen to protesters but rejected claims that the embattled Egyptian president is a dictator . Still , Biden said , `` violence is n't appropriate , and people have a right to protest . '' Obama received information on Egypt from national security adviser Tom Donilon on Friday and is expected to receive additional updates throughout the day . He noted Thursday that Mubarak has been `` very helpful on a range of tough issues , '' but he said he has pushed the Egyptian leader to take steps toward reform . On Wednesday , Gibbs said the U.S. administration was `` monitoring quite closely the situation in Egypt and continue to do so , obviously , in Tunisia . '' The protests in Egypt started after weeks of similar disturbances sparked a revolution in Tunisia and forced then-President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to flee the country . `` This is an important time for the government to demonstrate its responsiveness to the people of Egypt in recognizing those universal rights , '' Gibbs said .

A 30-year state of emergency has aided his rule He now faces widespread demonstrations after Tunisia 's revolt The uprising removed the `` barrier of fear , '' one analyst says -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For nearly 30 years , one man has dominated Egypt . Hosni Mubarak , 82 , has survived would-be assassins and ill health , crushed a rising Islamist radical movement and maintained the peace with neighboring Israel that got his predecessor killed . His government 's continued observance of the Camp David accords with Israel is the cornerstone of what peace has been achieved in the decades-long Arab-Israeli conflict . Following the revolt that toppled Tunisia 's longtime strongman , demonstrators in the streets of Cairo are standing up to riot police and chanting , `` Mubarak , Saudi Arabia is waiting for you . '' Experienced observers say it 's the most most significant challenge to his rule yet . It 's far from clear , however , that the demonstrators have the support or the coordination to bring down the man critics have called Egypt 's last pharaoh . `` He 's been in power a very long time , and he is very wily , '' said Juan Cole , a Middle East historian at the University of Michigan . `` He 's developed all kinds of techiniques for dealing with opponents that have proven relatively successful . '' But longtime observers of the region say the stability Mubarak has purchased has come at the cost of entrenched poverty and repression in the Arab world 's most populous nation . `` Egypt is a broken country , '' Fawaz Gerges , a professor of Middle Eastern relations at the London School of Economics , told CNN . `` It used to be the jewel of the Middle East . It 's the capital of its cultural production . '' But now , Gerges said , `` Egyptians have no outlets . They do n't feel that they have a sense of hope for the future . '' Who would fill Egypt 's power void ? Egypt protester : My life is in danger Mubarak was a Soviet-trained pilot who was chief of staff of Egypt 's air force during the 1973 Mideast war . The early success of Egyptian pilots against Israel made him a national hero , and then-President Anwar Sadat made him vice president in 1975 . Six years later , Sadat died in a hail of gunfire at a military parade , killed by Islamic militants from within the army 's own ranks after he took the dramatic step of making peace with Israel . Upon assuming office , one of Mubarak 's first acts was to declare a state of emergency that allowed barred unauthorized assembly , restricted freedom of speech and allowed police to jail people indefinitely . He has made extensive use of those powers in the ensuing decades . The Egyptian army put down riots by disgruntled police officers in 1986 , and he threw an estimated 30,000 people in jail when jihadists carried out a string of attacks on tourists . `` He pretty much wiped them out , '' Cole said . `` It 's not an accident that they were in Afghanistan instead of Egypt . '' And the government has also penetrated opposition movements so thoroughly that `` If five people sit down to plot something , the fifth person writes a report to Hosni Mubarak about it , '' he said . The result is `` a regime that has very little legitimacy , but presents itself as something there 's no point in trying to change , '' said Nathan Brown , a professor of Middle Eastern politics at George Washington University in Washington . But Brown said the January 14 overthrow of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , who fled to Saudi Arabia after 23 years in power , has changed the thinking of many in the region . `` I think what the events in Tunisia did was take that sense that nothing could ever change and lead a few people to question it , '' he said . Mubarak has headed off a similar movement before , in 2005 , when Egyptians mounted large-scale protests to demand fundamental and widespread reform . He intimidated the leaders of the officially banned but tolerated Muslim Brotherhood , harassed middle-class demonstrators and managed to pick off the leadership of those protests , Brown said . But the current movement `` has no real leadership , so it ca n't be decapitated the same way , '' he said . `` If Mubarak decided tomorrow , ` I 'll sit down and engage with you , ' it 's not clear who that ` you ' is . '' Mubarak won four terms as president in elections that were considered formalities . His fifth , in 2005 , was Egypt 's first multi-party presidential vote , but it was widely criticized as a `` sham , '' Cole said . Egyptians have no outlets . They do n't feel that they have a sense of hope for the future -- Fawaz Gerges , London School of Economics professor Meanwhile , the country 's economy stagnated for the first 20 years of his rule . Development has picked up in the past decade , fueled by a move away from state control and by billions in tourist dollars , but its gains have been `` very unevenly distributed . '' About 40 percent of Egyptians currently live in poverty , Gerges said . The aging autocrat has escaped at least two assassination attempts , including a close call in 1995 when Islamic militants opened fire on his motorcade at a pan-African conference in Ethiopia . And in recent years , he has had several bouts of illness but has never picked a vice president . He is widely believed to have anointed his son Gamal as his successor , but no formal announcement has been made . In 2003 , he collapsed while delivering a televised speech to the Egyptian parliament -- returning later to blame his illness on the flu . He had back surgery in Germany in 2004 , returning in 2010 to have his gall bladder removed . He has largely withdrawn from public view in recent years and has not addressed his country during the current crisis , Brown said . His situation is being closely watched overseas , particularly in the United States . In the past decade , Egypt has been major player in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks , and it contributed troops to the U.S.-led coalition that drove Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991 . It gets about $ 1.3 billion in military aid from Washington every year , second only to Israel , and has received nearly $ 30 billion in economic aid since 1975 , according to State Department figures . But it opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 -- and while sticking with Camp David , Egypt 's ties with Israel amount to a `` cold peace , '' Cole said . President Barack Obama noted Thursday that Mubarak has been `` very helpful on a range of tough issues , '' but he said he has pushed the Egyptian leader to take steps toward reform . `` You can see these pent-up frustrations that are being displayed on the streets , '' Obama said . He urged the Egyptian government to avoid resorting to violence to put down the demonstrations , adding , `` I think it 's very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances . '' Brown said Mubarak probably has to endorse some political form to survive . But he will have to do it `` extremely carefully , so it 's not seen as a desperate measure of last resort . '' Cole said Mubarak could bow to one of the protesters ' demands and lift the state of emergency . `` Egypt does have a fairly liberal constitution and it does enshrine a lot of rights in it , '' he said . `` But it 's just a piece of paper . It 's sidestepped by the emergency . '' If lifted , `` The judges and the courts in Egypt are very feisty , and they will take on the government . '' He could also hold a free and fair presidential election this year , `` but it 's asking a lot , '' Cole said . But Gerges said the Middle East has seen `` the barrier of fear '' removed since the events in Tunisia . `` Arabs really no longer feel terrified of the security apparatus , regardless of whether Mubarak remains or goes , '' he said . `` We 're going to have a new era of politics .

With parts of his capital ablaze , Mubarak said he was asking his government to resign and would soon announce a new one , pledging to address the concerns of thousand of Egyptians protesting in Cairo 's streets . `` I just spoke to him after his speech , '' Obama said , `` and told him he has a responsibility to give meaning to those words , to take concrete steps and actions that deliver on that promise . Violence will not address the grievances of the Egyptian people . Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away . `` This moment of volatility has to be turned into a moment of promise , '' Obama said . The U.S. president repeated his administration 's call for the Egyptian government to restore access to the internet and cell phone service and urged `` concrete steps that advance the rights of the Egyptian people . '' Obama 's remarks , delivered from State Dining Room , were the strongest yet from the United States . `` There must be reform , '' he said , `` political , social and economic reforms that meet the aspirations of the Egyptian people . `` In the absence of these reforms , '' he said , `` grievances have built up over time . `` The United States will continue to stand up for the rights of the Egyptian people and work with their government in pursuit of a future that is more just , more free and more hopeful , '' he concluded . In his remarks , Mubarak was clear that he had no intentions of stepping down -- yet his resignation is what the protesters are demanding . And privately , U.S. officials fear that Mubarak may be in over his head as protests against his 30-year rule showed no signs of ending . A senior administration official said the White House saw Mubarak 's address as `` hardly conciliatory and highly disappointing , but what did you expect ? '' It 's clear , the official said -- speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter -- that Mubarak believes he can ride this out , `` and this time , we 're not so sure that is the right assumption . '' Administration officials had hoped Mubarak would promise an immediate and open dialogue , the official said .

They are the young and unemployed , or underemployed , many with advanced degrees struggling to find jobs to support themselves and their families . Many have lived their entire lives under the same leader and want change , believing that it will lead to a better life . Muslim-majority countries in North Africa and the Middle East have the highest percentage of young people in the world , with 60 percent of the regions ' people under 30 , according to study by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life . With unemployment rates at 10 percent or more , those countries also have the highest regional rates of joblessness in the world , reports an article published in `` Foreign Policy '' titled , '' The Arab World 's Youth Army . '' The article highlights the stories of Tunisians in their 20s who took to the streets last month to protest corruption in various levels of government and a lack of meaningful opportunities . One young man with a master 's degree in computer science described a daily routine of internet job searches at a coffee shop in Sidi Bouzid , home of 26-year-old Mohamed Bouazizi , a fruit seller who burned himself to death after bribe-seeking police took his products , effectively sparking Tunisia 's uprising . The young man 's high school economics teacher estimated that just 5 % of his students from the young man 's class have found jobs since completing high school . In the streets of Egypt , CNN spoke with several protesters who shared similar grievances , especially after President Hosni Mubarak announced Friday that he had asked his government to resign without giving any indication that he planned to step down . `` We are one of the richest Arab countries and we want to live . Let a new government form , but if we do n't get what we ask for , we will go back to the streets again and again '' said Mohammed , a 20-year-old student . Yousef , an 18-year-old taxi driver , credited the Tunisia uprising with spurring Egyptians into action . `` We do n't care if a new government rules for 100 years to come . We just want a good , honest government . -LRB- President Zine El Abidine -RRB- Ben Ali said he understood the Tunisians and what did the Tunisians do ? They kept protesting until he fled the country . We will do more and more , we will continue our demonstrations and we will do 3,000 times more of what the Tunisians did , '' he said . `` Mubarak needs to resign and some of the regime figures need to be arrested and they need to face trial . Some of the parliamentary figures are good , some are just corrupt and they need to face justice . We do n't need the same ministers with different posts . We need new elections . '' Of course , the problem is not exclusive to the twentysomethings of the Arab world , but the complaints are the same . A resident of Shubra , an impoverished neighborhood in Cairo , said his chief concerns were corruption and economic hardship . He spoke about the rising prices of staples such as rice , wheat and bread . He was dismissive of Mubarak 's promises to bring about reform and vowed to continue protesting . `` We do not want him or the government or the parliament and we want all the corrupt people of this country to be tried for every penny they stole from this country , '' he said . `` We went out today and we were ready to die so our children can live with dignity .

As a dictator Mubarak should learn from Hu jintao , i guess If I read this right ; the USA is handing Egypt three billion a year in aid for their military murder machine ???? WHY !

Take a hint government officials , this could very will be the United States !!! \\* Wayne \\* These people protesting are primarily young people dispossed by a lack of jobs and opportunuity . In the U.S.A. there is also a growing population of young educated people that are also dispossed by similar factors , with the additional factor that the U.S. government has supported the reign of Wall Street and the wealthy that are propped up by Wall Street profits at the expense of the average American . At some point in the future I expect to see a similar occurence in America and other Western countries when continued unemployment and a feeling that excessive profits are more important than meaningful jobs , will lead to street protests as we have witnessed in North Africa . No meaningful changes have occurred since the banking industry artificially brought the worlds economy to the brink and no significant prosecution of those responsible has occurred . It will be interesting to see what the U.S. governmnent and military response is when this happens . In Egypt , very few of these protestors have access to weapons , which is most definitely not the case in America . Politicians of all stripes need to understand that they represent the people of America and not the bankers of America and the world .

Analyst : The protesters `` all want the same '' as they oppose growing inequality Analyst : `` There 's a feeling a lot of people are being left behind '' Differences involve government structure and population makeup -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Protesters who have taken to the streets in several Arab nations of North Africa are angry at their own governments , and lashing out over some specific problems in their countries . But what they 're looking for -- and , in the end , what inspired them to stand up and demonstrate -- is very similar , experts on the region said Thursday . `` They all want the same , '' said Emile Hokayem , with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in the Middle East . `` They 're all protesting about growing inequalities , they 're all protesting against growing nepotism . The top of the pyramid was getting richer and richer . '' Speaking to CNN about the recent demonstrations that have occurred , to varying extent , in Algeria , Egypt and Tunisia in northern Africa , and Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula , Hokayem said the protesters were also standing up `` against a high level of police brutality . '' `` Fundamentally it 's a question of dignity . People 's dignity has been under assault for decades , '' he said . Juan Cole , a Middle East historian at the University of Michigan and a blogger , put it this way : `` There 's a feeling a lot of people are being left behind . '' The protesters are driven by economic frustrations , `` discontent with authoritarian character of the regime , '' and the `` feeling that there 's no real representation '' -- although to different degrees in each nation , Cole said . Across all four countries , the protest movements are `` largely driven by young people '' and include a `` high proportion of the educated middle class , '' he said . There 's `` a feeling amongst that middle class that they 're not being given the opportunities in life that their degrees warrant -- what historians would call a ` blocked elite . ' '' The worldwide economic crisis helped trigger the demonstrations by adding to economic pressures at home , and showing up in things like petroleum and food prices , Cole said . But there are differences among the protest movements as well . In Egypt , `` the state probably has done more to protect people '' from rising food prices by offering subsidies , Cole said . The Egyptian economy was stagnant for decades , but in the past 10 years started to grow -- creating bigger differences between rich and poor , Cole said . `` And I think some of the protest is over the ways in which the labor movements have gotten left behind and have n't shared in the economic growth '' in that country , he said . Egypt cracks down on protesters Algerian forces clash with protesters In Algeria , where protests have been relatively small , the demonstrations `` look to me like an after-effect of the civil war that Algeria had between the fundamentalists and the secular generalists , '' Cole added . Yemen has also faced great internal strife , which serves as a background to the wave of protests , he said . The dire poverty in Yemen has also left questions about how many people have access to water , he said . `` It 's a deeply poverty-stricken country which is getting worse off . ... People are desperate there . '' In Tunisia , the government was run by an especially small clique , `` a kind of mafia state , '' which people are railing against , Cole said . `` The tightness of that clique and the way in which it dominated the economy is beyond anything you see elsewhere . People just were n't being let into the system to benefit . '' Hokayem said that `` the key differences have to do with the makeup of these societies . '' For example , `` Egypt is more diverse , a much bigger country , '' while Tunisia has a `` pretty homogeneous population . '' Also , the military plays a different role in the different societies , he said . In Tunisia , it is `` small and underfunded '' and not a major instrument of power , unlike in Egypt , where the military is a much bigger player , he said . But while the context for each protest movement may be unique , `` at the end of the day , the real driver is psychology , '' Hokayem said . He noted two more key similarities among the protest movements : `` The Islamists do n't seem to be on the forefront in any of those countries , '' he said . `` Up to now , it has been a mix of separate leftist and moderate Islamic movements . '' And unlike other protests seen in the Arab world in recent years , the protests are n't against the West -- nor do they seem inspired by the West . `` The West is irrelevant in a way , '' he said . Grievances at home `` are driving all of this .

Egypt has had a long tradition of a very strong state . What we 're seeing is quite incredible because this is the oldest society in the Arab world with a deep and sophisticated culture with an authentic middle class . It is also the oldest state , with a very long tradition of administrative control and a very powerful military . Both sides are trying to test the other to see which will give . Any scenario , post-Mubarak , is going to involve the military because the military , in a sense , holds the country together . They will have to support whatever processes are put in place . My guess is that they 're going to want to play a role that is behind the scenes and not right in front . But the key issue , right now , is what is Mubarak thinking ? Because he had the opportunity a year ago to decide to peacefully begin a political evolution . He decided not to do that and he had given every indication that he was going to run for re-election at 82 , and ailing . That sent a signal to the entire society that they were in for another decade , potentially , of this dictatorship backed by the military . And that killed the sense that Egypt was evolving . Because there had been reform , there had been opening , so there was a sort of rising expectation that Mubarak crushed . The question is : Is it too late for him to go back and provide some scenario for political reform which will prevent some kind of revolution . He will have to decide whether he can get in front of this change or whether he will be dragged , kicking and screaming . This does n't seem the time for anyone from the middle east to be dissin the great satan . Freedom is what you want ? Where have you been for the last 235 years ? We wrote the book on Freedom , and quite frankly , it 's high time you pulled your head out of your asses . Good luck with freedom , and maybe we wo n't have tn pay to defend or generally aid you anymore . Maybe you can even aid us -- freedom is kinda sucking right now , but it 'll come around , always does .

All this talk about Egypt and odd names like Zakaria make me want to watch `` The 10 Commandments , '' with Yul Brenner and Charles Heston . Throw in a few grilled camel burgers and whala ! Cesar : It 's `` viola '' Not nit picking . Just saying for future reference . The question asked was , `` Is it too late for him to go back and provide some scenario for political reform which will prevent some kind of revolution ? '' Personally , it is definitely too late for Mubarak to provide any say in Egypt 's future . If he shows his face in public now , he is likely to be killed . It is amazing how everyone is always so critical of the USA . USA is just like other governments in the world ; they usually will only get involved if there is a benefit to themselves . This is usually the way human nature works . When we are the wealthy , we want to hold on to our wealth . This is the same for the USA as well as it is the same for Hosni Mubarak . The only difference is that the USA has a government composed of different branches in order for the people to speak up and prevent a dictatorship for decades on end . In the news it mentioned that the USA has gone through eight presidents while Egypt has only seen one individual . Yes in the ideal world DEMOCRACY is the ideal , but reality is that a government must make executive decisions for the whole and it is impossible for the government to make everyone happy at the same time . Although , the USA has funded Israel it has also provided foreign aid to many other countries including Egypt 's billion dollars a year . We may preach democracy for Egypt and one of these days , Egypt as well as the USA will have a 100 % democratic country . Until then we should be praying for the people who are unable to leave their homes because of fear and pray that the current situation improves quickly not only in Egypt but around the world . The innocent civilians that are caught up in these protests need our support for a better outcome . I admire your depth of analysis . Please go a little more south to Ethiopia , where ethnic apartheid is being practiced . We have the worst dictator on the planet . Mubarak 's dictatorship fades in the eyes of Meles Zenawi , who is cruel and does n't blink an eye before he orders the slaughter of more than 200 people when he lost the election in 2005 , more than 100,000 and the entire opposition was arrested . The US says nothing as usual . What happens in Egypt will ultimately happen elsewhere where `` US friendly distatorships '' are allowed to stay in power supported by successive US governments . By the way , be it democratic or republican , the world sees no change in the approach used by the US government , it is always about US or Israeli interest , but not about the suffering of the masses in those opressed countries . At last , I think Mubarak may have got some advice from our dictator , `` disturb the peaceful demonstration by using security thugs , and then stop demonstration `` in the interest of safety and security '' . ALL DICTATORS WILL FALL . I watch in pain images on the screen . Is there any doubt that men on horses and camels are paid by the Egyptian government ? These are not normal civilians . Yes , you can see carts pulled by horses in Cairo . But , you never see men riding horses in Cairo . These are government paid thugs .

Naimah Abdullah , a secretary at Atlanta , Georgia 's Masjid of Al-Islam said that the Quran commands Muslims to stop traffic and trade on Fridays . Muslims are expected to take time out of their day to think of God and reflect before returning to their daily routines . The Friday prayer is obligatory for Muslim males . Abdullah says Friday s congregational prayer carries an abundance of blessings . It s said whatever you pray for you will get during this prayer , she said . I would guess there is hardly a person alive who hasn t exclaimed , at one time or other in their lives . Oh , my God !

This being the case , god -LRB- if one even exists -RRB- is not able to alter life and requests\\/prayers will not be answered . Statistically , your request might come true but it is simply the result of the variabiliy\\/randomness of Nature . So put down your rosaries and prayer beads and stop worshiping\\/revering cows and bowing to Mecca five times a day . Instead work hard at your job , take care of aging parents , volunteer at a soup kitchen , donate to charities and the poor and continue to follow the commandments of your religion or any good rules of living as gracious and good human beings . Prayer should not be all about receiving things and good things happening , it should also be about connecting to the higher power on a spiritual level and providing sustenance for your soul . Also religion has been described as the opiate of the masses and I believe that is true to an extent , since religion and praying helps to calm one down and provide a time for thought and reflection similar to meditation without the connecting to a higher power thing . And as for the question of why are their bad things going on in the world and why god does not fix them or help , the answer I would give would be too ask god and the way to do that is too pray Alright , so it seems that we 've at least agreed that your god cares little for human life . If on the other hand he is able to help but does not , that makes him a despi-cable , contemptible , and vile creature who should be hated . There 's no moral argument against that . You should be deeply ashamed of yourself if you think that a god like that is worth praising . And as far as `` evidence '' for God , you ca n't expect to be taken seriously with reasoning like that ! Sure , many have been happy to `` seek him , '' yet in all of our collective seeking , there 's nothing to be found . If you think that your personal experiences and emotions consti-tute evidence , then by that same logic , every other god and religion is equally as valid , and their followers say and feel just as you do . Do you think that for one second I would care what you think about me ? How dare you say I should be ashamed ? I have nothing to be ashamed of .

God rewarding people with paradise after they die does not justify that he simply sat back and watched them get tortured for their life , knowing full well he had the power to stop it . That is not moral and if you can not see that then ashamed is far too weak a word . I have nothing to construct because there IS nothing to construct . I deconstruct because justifying evil such as the inaction of God is the epitome of immorality . I say you should be ashamed for good reason . I pity you because you can not even bring yourself to look at God under the same moral light that you view the rest of the world .

Kennedy once said , `` Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable . '' The recent pro-democracy mass protests around the Arab world -- in places like Tunisia , Yemen and Egypt -- reflect the beginnings of a `` democracy Renaissance , '' launched by the millions of citizens within these countries that have been ruled for decades by ruthless autocrats and soft dictators . The recent `` Jasmine Revolution '' in Tunisia began with the desperate act of a young unemployed man who set himself on fire . And that passionate fire would ultimately rage against the Tunisian government machine until its long-serving president would be forced into exile two weeks ago . The young man was 26-year-old Mohammed Bouazizi , an unemployed fruit stand owner who became distraught when a policewoman confiscated his unlicensed produce stand . He died from his burns . Following suit , several other unemployed youth around the country tried to commit suicide , and subsequent mass protests would soon topple the 23-year reign of Tunisia 's strongman , 74-year-old Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali . Long-standing autocratic rule within the Arab world shows a `` depressingly familiar pattern '' in terms of regional suppression of democracy , notes Egyptian-American writer Mona Eltahawy , in a recent Washington Post opinion piece . Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi , 68 years old , has been in power since 1969 ; Yemen 's Ali Abdullah Saleh -LRB- 64 -RRB- has ruled since 1978 and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak -LRB- 82 -RRB- since 1981 . Eltahawy wrote that these dinosaur political figures are `` not so much fathers as grandfathers of their nations , these autocrats clinging to office -- and are increasingly out of touch with their young populaces . '' Much larger than Tunisia , the nation of Egypt is home to some 80 million people -- with Mubarak as its not-so-democratic leader since the assassination of Anwar Sadat in 1981 . From creating a virtual police state to promoting censorship by placing all media under state control , Hosni Mubarak has spent the better part of 30 years strengthening his autocratic rule , while millions of young Egyptians remain hungry and unemployed . Over time , his regime has needlessly tried to silence bloggers , imprisoned prominent pro-democracy activists such as Saad Eddin Ibrahim , and during these most recent mass protests even placed 2005 Nobel Peace Prize co-winner -LRB- and political opposition leader -RRB- Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei under house arrest .

In Egypt and Tunisia , pictures of U.S.-made canisters have been posted online . Tear gas canisters fired at Egyptian protesters are marked `` Made in the U.S.A. '' Combined Systems Inc. also has sold tear gas to Tunisia and Israel Some Twitter users demand why U.S.-made weapons are being used against protesters -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A thick pall of chemical smoke hung over a crowd in Cairo on Friday afternoon . People ran , covering their noses and mouths to escape yet another volley of tear gas . The same scene was being played out elsewhere in Cairo , in Alexandria and Suez . And several weeks back , Tunisian police used tear gas to try to quell protests there . It is one of the most common ways to used to disperse protests -- but not everyone runs . In both Tunisia and Egypt , some protesters stopped to pick up canisters , and posted photographs online . A few inches long , blue and silver , they include warning labels and then a set of initials : CSI , followed by `` Made in the U.S.A. '' The photograph posted in Tunisia was of a 40 mm riot CS smoke projectile , made by a company called Combined Systems Inc. , which describes itself as a `` tactical weapons company '' and is based in Jamestown , Pennsylvania . CSI 's website describes the projectile as `` a launched burning extended-range single projectile round that dispenses smoke or chemical agents via rapid burning . Used effectively during riots at safe stand-off distances to disperse groups or deny areas . '' Its warning label reads : `` Danger : Do not fire directly at person -LRB- s -RRB- . Severe injury or death may result . '' That warning is apparently not always followed . Lucas Mebrouk Dolega died in Tunisia on January 17 , three days after being hit by a tear gas grenade at close range . The 32-year-old was a photographer for the European PressPhoto Agency . On Thursday , a similar picture was posted on Twitter by a someone in Egypt , only this time it was of a grenade , not a canister . It , too , was made by CSI . The grenade appears to be an `` Outdoor 52 Series Large Grenade '' that `` discharges a high volume of smoke and chemical agent through multiple emission ports . Specifically for outdoor use , '' the website says . CSI 's website -LRB- www.less-lethal.com -RRB- bills the company as the `` premier engineering , manufacturing and supply company of tactical munitions and crowd control devices globally to armed forces , law enforcement , corrections and homeland security agencies . '' Clients include the U.S. Army , U.S. Customs and Border Patrol , and the U.S. Department of State , as well as Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Israeli Military Industries -- both of which are weapons companies based in Israel . On January 1 , Jawaher Abu Rahmah died in the West Bank during a weekly protest against a security barrier being built in Bilin . Israel considers the protests violent and illegal . Rahmah died of severe asphyxiation and cardiac arrest after Israeli soldiers fired tear gas canisters into the crowd . In April 2009 , Rahmah 's brother was killed participating in the same weekly protest when a tear gas canister struck him directly in the chest . A spokesman for CSI says the company is operating well within the law by selling tear gas to countries like Tunisia and Egypt . According to the Chemical Weapons Convention , riot control agents are not considered chemical weapons unless used during a time of war . This means that it 's perfectly legal to manufacture and sell tear gas , so long as countries do n't stockpile a large amount of the chemical compounds . The spokesman declined to say how much tear gas CSI had sold to countries in northern Africa , but said it is a small company . He also said CSI could not control how its products are used once sold . Social media reaction to the `` Made in the U.S.A. '' label on the canisters was scathing , with some suggesting it meant the U.S. government itself was somehow involved in suppressing the protests . Some Twitter users demanded to know `` why so many weapons used against Egyptian protesters read ` made in the USA ' . '' Others advised `` Maybe U.S. weapons manufacturers should stop printing `` made in USA '' on their weapons especially the ones we send to brutal autocrats . '' Whether CSI is operating within the law has n't stopped protestors from voicing their dissatisfaction with the company . After Rahmah died in Israel , demonstrators gathered outside Point Lookout Capital Partners ' Manhattan offices . Point Lookout owns a majority interest in CSI . The protesting group -- the New York Campaign for the Boycott of Israel -- demanded that CSI stop providing tear gas that could be used on Palestinians by Israeli forces . Israeli authorities are still investigating Jawaher Abu Rahmah 's death . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , there are several compounds that are considered to be riot-control agents . Two of the most common are chloroacetophenone -LRB- CN -RRB- and chlorobenzylidene malononitrile -LRB- CS -RRB- . Others include chloropicrin -LRB- PS -RRB- , bromobenzylcyanide -LRB- CA -RRB- , and dibenzoxazepine -LRB- CR -RRB- . Riot control agents temporarily disable those affected by causing irritation to the eyes , mouth , throat , lungs , and skin . Long-lasting exposure to these compounds can cause blindness and chemical burning of the throat and lungs resulting in death , as well as respiratory failure , which can also result in death .

He is the author of `` Egypt on the Brink : From Nasser to Mubarak '' -LRB- Yale University Press , 2011 -RRB- . Cairo , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- This week tens of thousands swamped the heart of Cairo , Alexandria , and other major Egyptian cities , facing down anti-riot police , to demand cheaper food , better services , and substantial changes to the regime 's modus operandi . With five dead , more than 100 injured , and the police resorting to tear gas to disperse the demonstrators , most observers are examining whether the Egyptian regime will be able to contain the situation and suppress the protests without even more significant bloodshed . Two factors suggest continued tension and further challenges to the regime . First , the Egyptian state 's institutional framework is at its weakest point since the coup\\/revolution of 1952 that created the Egyptian republic . The delicate balance that the regime has nurtured , between the rise of the liberal capitalists within the ruling National Democratic Party -LRB- NDP -RRB- and the traditional power and influence of the military and security establishment , seems to be under strain . The center of gravity and decision-making has shifted from the long-established anchors of stability toward inexperienced new economic and financial players . Egypt cracks down on protesters Suez crowds confront riot police Tear gas in the air in Alexandria The ascent of the new capitalists gave rise to the second factor : an unexpected solidarity between the politically active -- who see the influence of the new capitalists as a blurring of the lines between power and wealth -- and the disenfranchised poor , who as a result of successive financial reform measures , face severe economic pains . The situation is made more acute by a youth unemployment rate of more than 15 % -LRB- in an 80 million population , 40 % of whom are under 30 years old -RRB- . The politically active and the millions of poor Egyptians blame the Hosni Mubarak regime , which has been in power for three decades . This is a tenuous political environment , where anguish and anxiety can quickly turn into anger , and with any catalyst , into action . But , so far , the situation in Egypt is not combustible . Despite the regime 's overall poor record , its major upgrading of the country 's infrastructure , relative success in installing economic liberalization , and cautious foreign policy have fostered an environment in which a few million middle class families managed to secure economic gains . The past decade also witnessed a notable rise in entrepreneurialism with hundreds of thousands of Egyptians able to build small enterprises leveraging the growth in economic sectors ranging from food and beverages , to tourism , to information technology , to entertainment . The development of the Egyptian real estate industry and the country 's capital markets attracted the life savings of few more millions . In today 's Egypt , specifically in Cairo , Alexandria , and the major cities of the Nile Delta , there is a relatively large middle class that has a serious stake in the country 's economic future , realistic ambitions for further economic gains , and which abhors the prospect of chaos in the country . Another factor reduces the chances of immediate change in Egypt : the unpreparedness of the regime 's serious political opponents . The street 's demonstrations create momentum and could be a catalyst for change . But the regime 's rivals vying for power in Egypt remain deeply wanting . This is a tenuous political environment , where anguish and anxiety can quickly turn into anger ... The liberal movement continues to be fragmented , from the traditional opposition parties , to students ' movements , to the upper-middle-class intelligentsia , to the new National Association of Change , the vehicle associated with Dr. Mohamed El-Baradei . Arguably , the liberal movement benefits from the nationalist , inclusive slogans of the demonstrations which shunned appeals to Islam and Christianity in favor of Egyptianism . But the liberal movement so far lacks the institutional structure required to evolve into a viable , immediate alternative to the regime . This unpreparedness is a paramount deficiency in a country with colossal economic challenges such as Egypt 's . As Egypt heads toward a presidential election in September , two things will shape its political landscape . One is the interaction amongst the regime , political Islam , and the liberal movement ; the other is the relationship within the regime itself -- between the military and security establishment on the one hand and Egypt 's economic power centers on the other . It is unlikely that the situation in Egypt will descend into chaos . The military and security establishment can enforce stability , provided we do not see major unrest within the country 's middle class . But these expressions of anger intensify the uncertainty surrounding Egypt 's future -- especially in the period post-Mubarak , who is approaching his mid-80s . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tarek Osman .

Abhisit Vejjajiva sent in government troops to quell long-running Red Shirt protests in the Thai capital last May . Ninety-one people died and hundreds were injured in the street battles that followed . But as thousands gathered on the streets of Cairo , Alexandria and Suez to demand an end to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's 30-year-rule , Abhisit -- speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland -- told CNN leaders should respect the wishes of their people . Abhisit said as long as demonstrators did not resort to violence , governments had a responsibility to restrict the use of force . `` When the protesters were peaceful -LRB- when they -RRB- were exercising their constitutional rights , there was absolutely no need for any kind of force to be used . `` Unfortunately in the protests in April and May there was violence -- grenades launched , invading hospitals and so on -- and we had to make sure that order had to be preserved . '' He told CNN : `` For us what was important , we needed to enforce the law -LRB- and -RRB- at the same time , we had to exercise the utmost restraint , and try to address whatever legitimate grievances these people on the streets had . '' `` I hope that in a number of countries , they will be able to do the same . '' Asked to offer advice to Mubarak , the Thai PM said : `` He should just respect the key principles of governance , respect the wishes of the people , and at the same time do his duties . '' Thailand 's Red Shirt protesters took to the streets to call for the return of former PM Thaksin Shinawatra , who was ousted in a coup in 2006 .

Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has urged embattled leaders in the Middle East and North Africa to listen to the wishes of their own people , as civil unrest spreads across the region . Thousands of people took to the streets of Cairo on Friday to call for an end to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's authoritarian 30-year rule . The demonstrations came after similar anti-government protests in Tunisia toppled President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali . Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , Ban told CNN he was concerned at the growing potential for violence , and had called on political leaders to act responsibly . Annan : People clamoring for democracy `` Leaders have a ... responsibility to listen more attentively to the challenges and wishes of their own people , '' he said , urging them to `` provide decent jobs and opportunities to engage more constructively in their social and political life -- this is what has been lacking . `` I have been urging the authorities , first of all , that freedom of expression , freedom of association should be fully respected , and they should also protect the human rights of those people . '' Ban said he hoped the region 's leaders would see the situation `` as an opportunity to heed their own people 's wishes , '' and called on them to preserve democracy and restore peace and stability . His predecessor as U.N. chief , Kofi Annan , told CNN it was `` too quick '' to say if the protests would spread further in the coming weeks . `` What is important is that people are clamoring for democracy and the right to participate in government . `` These are signs that there is a need for serious changes in these countries , and the leaders have to take that on board and respond appropriately , '' he said . `` We need to be careful that some leaders may think ` It 's time to calm down -- you give an inch and you will be overwhelmed ' -- that approach will not work . `` It 's gone beyond that and I think they need to find a way of working out -LRB- the -RRB- changes that are required .

Mubarak began the address , which started just after midnight , with a call for unity , saying , `` We all honestly should stand with each other for this country . '' Still , it was n't until the speech 's conclusion that he detailed a major step he had taken to begin addressing the crisis : asking for his current government 's resignation . The president -- who has been in power for 30 years -- then said he would form a new team , with a refocused mission acknowledging a popular desire for economic reforms , starting Saturday . `` I will ask the new government to have clear and specific responsibilities to deal , in a calculated way , with the the vital next phase , '' Mubarak said , according to a translation of his remarks from Arabic . Mubarak said earlier that he had heard , and understood , demonstrators ' pleas asking for the government to take more action to create jobs , lower prices and improve the plight of the poor . `` I know all these things ... that the people are asking -LRB- because -RRB- I 've never been separated from it . I work for it every day , '' he said . `` I 'll always be on the side of the poor . '' Still , most of the president 's speech did not focus on policy changes or economic issues but rather on how the government had and should respond to the demonstrations . As they had done earlier this week , thousands of protesters hit the streets of Egypt 's major cities on Friday , calling for major economic reforms and for Mubarak 's resignation . Military personnel became an increasingly visible presence during the day , even as many police withdrew to their stations in the capital of Cairo by Friday evening . Still , this was not before significant confrontations between protesters and authorities , who in some cases used tear gas and water cannons to pacify the crowds . In addition , the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said the Egyptian government detained more than 1,000 people , including political foes like opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei , who was placed under house arrest .

Members of the NASA family and the public will gather to honor those who died aboard space shuttle Challenger . Twenty-five years ago the STS-51L crew boarded Challenger for a six-day flight . It was just after liftoff when things went wrong . Challenger was in the air for 73 seconds before the orbiter exploded . June Scobee Rodgers , the widow of Cmdr. Dick Scobee , will be one of many speakers honoring her husband and the members of his crew . This mission was to take the first teacher , Christa McAuliffe , up into space . Her widow , Steven McAuliffe , released a statement saying that his family finds it `` comforting and inspirational '' that people across the country continue to remember his wife and her Challenger crew members . The astronauts on the flight with Scobee and McAuliffe were pilot Michael Smith , mission specialists Judith Resnik , Ellison Onizuka and Ronald McNair ; and payload specialist Gregory Jarvis . According to investigators ' findings , the cause of the explosion was an O-ring that failed in one of the solid rocket boosters . Cold weather was cited as a contributing factor . The ceremony is taking place in front of The Space Mirror Memorial . This memorial lists the names of 24 U.S. astronauts who lost their lives while exploring space . That 's how long NASA 's space shuttle Challenger was in the air before an O-ring failure turned a routine mission into space into a tragedy on January 28 , 1986 .

Saudi Arabia slammed protesters in Egypt on Saturday as `` infiltrators '' who seek to destabilize their country , while a a top Palestinian official affirmed `` solidarity '' with Egypt . An official in Iran called on Egypt to `` abide by the rightful demands of the nation '' and avoid violent reactions . And in Israel , a member of the Knesset , or parliament , described a recent conversation with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that suggested that Mubarak had been expecting -- and preparing for -- the wave of unrest that has engulfed Egypt , the most populous Arab nation . Leaders across the Middle East were following events in Egypt with rapt attention Saturday , aided in that endeavor by saturation coverage on Arabic television networks such as Al-Jazeera . Many are on edge after protests in Algeria , Jordan and Yemen following unrest in Tunisia that forced that country 's president from office after two decades in power . In Saudi Arabia , the turmoil in Egypt rattled investors as the nation 's stock market lost over 6 % of its value Saturday . That said , Saudi King Abdullah called Mubarak and `` was reassured '' about the situation in Egypt , the state-run Saudi Press Agency reported . `` During the call , the king said , ` Egypt is a country of Arabism and Islam . No Arab and Muslim human being can bear that some infiltrators , in the name of freedom of expression , have infiltrated into the brotherly people of Egypt , to destabilize its security and stability and they have been exploited to spew out their hatred in destruction , intimidation , burning , looting and inciting a malicious sedition , ' '' the news agency said .

Don Lemon here at the CNN world headquarters in Atlanta . Thank you so much for joining us . A popular uprising in Egypt that threatens to bring down the presidency of Hosni Mubarak now in its fifth day . LEMON : Dozens of people have died in violent clashes with riot police over the past week . Many others have been injured . Here you see the body of one victim carried today through the streets of Cairo . It is impossible to know how many people were out protesting today . But tens of thousands , it 's safe to say is an estimate . One major change is the disappearance of riot police . Now , military troops and vehicles fill parts of Cairo . And for the most part , the military and civilians have avoided clashing with each other . But what we are now seeing is how protests have spread to cities around the world . LEMON : Impassioned Egyptian-Americans gathered in Washington today , calling for the removal of Egypt 's president . They rallied first at the Egyptian embassy and then marched to the White House . Inside the White House , President Obama huddled with his national security team to discuss the crisis . There 's a lot at stake because Egypt has one of America 's biggest Arab allies in the Middle East . LEMON : And we are getting similar protest videos and iReports from across the U.S. and around the world . This rally took place in downtown Montreal -- Atlanta , Chicago , New York , Los Angeles and many other places had similar demonstrations to show their support for the uprising in Egypt . We 'll hear from them throughout this hour . Social order and security have collapsed across Egypt 's largest cities . As darkness falls , looting has become pervasive . And without police , many shopkeepers are arming themselves to protect their stores from looters . There have also been conflicting reports about looting of priceless artifacts from the national museum . And right now , it appears the museum is secure . We 'll let you know if we get any additional information about that . A lot of people are concerned about . We 're also just now getting word from Nile TV that about 1,000 inmates have escaped from a large prison outside Cairo . CNN 's Ivan Watson has a live report from Cairo in just a moment on that . He 's going to update us on that situation . So , Michael , let me start with you . Michael is a Christian broadcaster here . He is Michael Youssef . And you and your family came from Egypt 1997 . What do you make tonight as you see this drama unfold and you hear about the riot police and all of that ? MICHAEL YOUSSEF , CHRISTIAN BROADCASTER : I actually escaped from Egypt back in the '60s when I left . I came to the States in ' 77 . But -- so , I know what dictatorship is lived under Nasser . And it 's really very disconcerting as I talk to several leaders in Egypt , Christian leaders and others , of the looting shops , banks . And so many young people are arming themselves because they ca n't have guns with sticks in order to defend their families and their possessions . It 's really , very , very , very disconcerting . I was talking to an 80-year-old person who said , I 've never seen anything like it . LEMON : So , listen , you know , you said you escaped . Is it necessarily -- and , you know , maybe people in America for the most part will read this a certain way -- that Hosni Mubarak , if he is removed from power , is there some good to what Hosni Mubarak has done for Egypt ? YOUSSEF : Well , I personally think so . And everybody has a different perspective , you know ? Number one , he was a war hero . He is the one that led the Air Force at the Yom Kippur War . And so , the younger generations coming up -- I 'm 62 now . So , I lived through the days of Nasser in the '60s , and saw the improvements that Mubarak made and I travel -- YOUSSEF : A lot of the economy . I mean , their economic growth is about 6.5 percent annually . And private enterprise , privatizing banks and companies and allowing more and more -- of course , not enough for young people to be able to have employment . I know that I had a driver who was a lawyer and he is making more money driving a car than practicing law . LEMON : He 's making more money . LEMON : But comparatively , it 's not a lot of money when you consider how much money most people make in Europe . LEMON : It does n't compare to the United States or most countries at all ? And inflation is humongous . It 's a problem . LEMON : Here 's what -- why would one support Hosni Mubarak , who has lots of money , lots and lots of money , if you are living and you have to wait in queue to buy basic needs and get necessities . Why would there be support for someone like that in the country ? YOUSSEF : I do n't know what kind of money he has . It 's my -- I 'm not here to defend him . But -- and I think , the people have every right to demonstrate . It 's disconcerting the fact this turning into violence . LEMON : All right . Stand by , Michael . I want to talk to you throughout the show . And a little bit later on , I want to go now to Ivan Watson who joins us now . He is in Cairo . And he 's been watching this unfold . Ivan , what are you seeing now ? And also , talk to me about the prisoners who have escaped there . IVAN WATSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Don , I 'm sorry . I could n't quite hear your question there . We 've had some interruptions with the audio here . Basically , it 's now after 1:00 in the morning , 2:00 in the morning here . And the center of Cairo , the Egyptian capital , is quite calm . I do n't know if you can see over my shoulder . But we 've got a number of army tanks parked here along the banks of the Nile , perhaps a reassuring sign for some residents of this sprawling city who are concerned by the disappearance of the police force after the battles that raged in these streets between the very unpopular police officers and demonstrators that resulted in basically the police evaporating overnight and not really having much of a presence at all in the city . Some fears of looting -- I 've seen stores and shops in residential areas that were looted over the course of the previous night . And that is a concern , maintaining law and order . And that is one of the arguments -- LEMON : That 's our Ivan Watson reporting to us live there in Cairo . And as you can see , we 're having a little bit of trouble with the satellite transmission . But just a short while ago , Ivan went out and he witnessed firsthand what people are doing there and spoke to some of the protesters . WATSON : The crowds have gathered here . They 're still chanting . There 's a lot of elation . But the curfew is coming fast . So , we 're trying to ask people what are they going to do when they 're told to go indoors ? Madam , are you going to go inside when the curfew starts ? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : No , I will not go inside , over my dead body . They will kill me , no problem . WATSON : You 're going to stay out protesting ? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : All of us , we will stay here . WATSON : It 's hard to put into words the scenes of elation that we 're seeing here with people hanging on the military 's tanks , riding through town . One man said , as a result of today , I feel proud to be an Egyptian for the very first time , Chanting `` Down with the regime . '' But there has been violence amid this carnival atmosphere . We 've seen a number of people wounded , being treated by doctors on the dirty floor outside a mosque . Mubarak -- -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- Mubarak . WATSON : We 're very excited right now and pretty upset because there 's been some shooting going on . The doctor telling us five dead people have been brought into this entrance of this mosque and there 's one being treated right now with a bullet wound . This has been a day of liberation for some . But it 's also been a day of violence . And the doctors here at this restoration center , they say they 've been treating people coming in with wounds throughout the afternoon . We 've heard about a number of gunshots . You can see this young man being treated right here with some kind of wounds to his chest and arms . WATSON : The name of this square where this sea of chanting humanity has come to is called Tahrir Square . And the people here are celebrating a kind of freedom that many of them say they 've never felt before . -LRB- END VIDEOTAPE -RRB- LEMON : So , Ivan , you have been there watching this . As the days go on , have you -- are more people coming out or does it appear to be dwindling ? WATSON : Well , no , certainly there were far more people in the streets today . But we 've already moved into Sunday here . But on Saturday , there were far more people than on Friday , in part because they did n't face opposition . The police that had been attacking demonstrators prior to Saturday had left the scene and vacated the streets to the protesters , who are allowed to conduct themselves and chant and run around and have this festive atmosphere that was unfortunately tainted by some of these very bloody clashes that were going on just a few blocks away from where that carnival-like atmosphere was taking place . LEMON : Ivan Watson reporting to us from Cairo -- Ivan , thank you very much . I 'm joined here in Atlanta by Michael Youssef . He has family there . You escaped from Egypt in 1977 , you said that ? LEMON : Oh , my gosh . Listen , can you talk to me real quickly about this prison where supposedly about 1,000 prisoners have escaped ? YOUSSEF : I just saw that on BBC that they announced that 1,000 prisoners escaped from what is known as Abuzaba -LRB- ph -RRB- Prison which is a very notorious prison . And they think those are the people who are out there looting and they actually bombed a bank and got into the safe . LEMON : And , again , they think those are the people -- I have been getting e-mails as well saying the protesters are really not the people who are looting . LEMON : Those are other people and we should make that distinction . You 'll be joining us throughout the hour here . Thank you so much . We 're going to talk about this . Coming up , our Nic Robertson shows what it 's like on the streets of Alexandria in the midst of a curfew . And later , there were a lot of angry protest here in the U.S. today and we 'll take you there . LEMON : The ancient port city of Alexandria has seen its own share of demonstrations and deadly clashes . And CNN 's senior international correspondent , Nic Robertson , has been in the thick of it all there . NIC ROBERTSON , CNN SR. . INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : It 's now half an hour since security began . This is one of the army trucks here ostensibly enforcing the curfew . Everyone is out on the street . And on the side of the truck -- hi guys -- from the side of the truck , Mubarak go instead . This is the slogan on here , `` Mubarak , get out of the country . '' And this is painted on the truck of the army here . You were telling me you 're a former general ? You were a general , ex - general ? ROBERTSON : So , you think that the army is out here to protect the president , not the people ? Yes , to protect him . ROBERTSON : Thank you very much indeed . It 's very nice talking to you . You have a handshake like a general , very strong . ROBERTSON : Well , that 's just another opinion that we 're hearing on the streets here . People have been very friendly with the army so far . But clearly , there 's a train of thought here that feels that the army is still at the moment really protecting the president and his interests rather than theirs . They are all spoiled people . They stole our land . They stole our jobs . They stole our future . ROBERTSON : Thank you very much , sir . Everyone here wants to speak to us . Everyone has an opinion . And as you can see , some people would like to push to get their voices out and to get themselves on camera . But despite that , it is quite relaxed and it is quite friendly . But this is probably a good time to move on . It 's almost getting to be night facility here in Alexandria now . The people , very clear in what they 're saying . They want President Mubarak to go . They said , if he has any honor and dignity , then leave . And they also say , if you want to leave , go to Saudi Arabia . It 's waiting for you . This is the message the people are saying . I 'm making a report right now . We 're making a video report right now . What do you want to say ? -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- I will stay . ROBERTSON : So , you think he 's going to stay ? He can not have a curfew . We are staying here . ROBERTSON : You 're hearing it -- So , you 're hearing it from the streets right here . He 's challenged the people by saying he 'll stay -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE : He wants to calm us down . ROBERTSON : He wants to calm you down . That 's not calming us down . ROBERTSON : That 's not calming you down . And that 's what we 're seeing here . People angry and they 're saying right now that he must go . ROBERTSON : The trend continues to be the same . We want him out . We want him gone . Mubarak has to go . That 's the message that comes out . The electronic part of the revolution here goes on . Everyone here almost is carrying their cell phone filming what 's going on , propagating their message around the country . The voices here in Alexandria are just getting louder and louder . There are people here now , like this gentleman , who are helping control the crowds . But the message now is getting louder and perhaps a little more controlled . LEMON : That was CNN 's Nic Robertson . Protesters in the U.S. express outrage over the situation in Egypt , including right here in Atlanta at a rally that I covered . That 's coming up next . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : What 's happening to our president ? He said , `` I will change everything . '' We do n't want him . He 's the one -- he should go out . We do n't want him here because he 's not responsible about all this here . LEMON : A show of solidarity with the Egyptian protesters in cities around the country . In New York , hundreds gathered outside the United Nations to show their support . They shouted slogans and waved signs , but the rally was a peaceful one . LEMON : And in Washington , a similar scene outside the Egyptian embassy there . Afterward , the group marched to the White House where President Obama held a meeting with his national security team today . And in Atlanta , demonstrators held a rally right in the front of CNN 's headquarters . We went out there and found that much of the anger -- much of their anger over the situation in Egypt is actually directed at the U.S. government . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : We 've got to help out the people . MUSTAFA MAZHER , PROTESTER : If there 's no sort of democracy that we 're promoting here , that 's in the Middle East and it 's not represented over there , we 're not doing our job here . We 're supporting a government over there that 's been in power for 30 years . SEAN PHILLIPS , PROTESTER : I do n't think that the Egyptian people will be free until they take down Mubarak . LEMON : -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- said `` U.S. ` aid ' equals tear gas . '' What does that mean ? AHMED NAZEEM , PROTESTER : Yes . This is the military , they are giving to Egypt . They are supporting that corrupted regime by giving them money and these weapons to be used against the Egyptian people . And we want the U.S. to stop supporting these dictatorships and give the opportunity to the Egyptians to elect the leaders . LEMON : This sign says Americans should be aware of that ? SAMI ALMALFOUH , PROTESTER : Of course . They should know that their money is not being used building democracy . It 's been used to oppress the people . It 's quite the opposite of what 's the purpose of the U.S. funds . It goes for a different message , sends a different message . The U.S. aid for the military today to Egypt is $ 1.3 billion . The economy is $ 250 million only . So , if you compare that to that , that 's the point -- that 's the point of this sign , is that we want aid , of course , to build infrastructure and build -- kind of let the people , you know , live a normal life and have a real democracy . SAMEH ABDELAZIZ , PROTEST ORGANIZER : We 're not here to try to talk to Mubarak 's government . We gave up on this a long time ago . We 're here to talk to our government , the American government , to ask them to stay true to our American principles of democracy and freedom by standing beside the Egyptian people that are dying in the little towns and villages over there . SHERYFALI MOUSA , PROTESTER : President Mubarak has been there for 30 years . We want him out . LEMON : Just one of the many protests here in the U.S. and around the world . Coming up next here on CNN : CNN 's Fred Pleitgen shows us what it was like on the streets in downtown Cairo with no security . LEMON : Looters are taking advantage of the chaos in the streets of Cairo . Security forces seem to have disappeared , leaving people to fend for themselves . Our Frederik Pleitgen met up with some who are spending the night guarding their own property because no one else will -- Fred . FREDERIK PLEITGEN , CNN SR. . INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : While there 's a lot of security presence and army in the downtown area of Cairo , if you get out of the downtown area , large parts of the city are basically without any security forces . So , we 've seen a lot of people here who are banding together to try and protect their property , protect their homes , protect their families . No one to prevent this . PLEITGEN : What happened to the police ? PLEITGEN : How long are you going to stay out here ? PLIETGEN : And you guys -- are you guys -- are you guys sort of all friends ? Are you one family ? How does this work -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE : I have my cousins that live with me . I have my neighbors . We have our friends , neighbors down there . We 're all like one community to prevent the whole street -- the whole area . PLEITGEN : To prevent people from coming in here . PLEITGEN : And you 're getting no help at this point , from the police actually ? PLEITGEN : The people tell us that guys like this , guys on the motorcycles , those are usually the ones who are doing the looting . Now , we 've seen some who have passed by here carrying real samurai swords on their motorcycles . Now , every time those motorcycles pass , obviously , the guys here from the community watch . They come out and they threaten them and tell them , do n't stop here . It clearly is a very , very difficult situation with a lot of uncertainty for the people in the Egyptian capital . LEMON : Many pictures of really what some say is chaos ; others say it 's organized protest . Let 's bring in Dr. Michael Youssef . You 're sitting here . You 're watching our coverage all evening . As you look at these reports , does this indicate anything to you about whether this is going to ramp up or slow down ? Too soon to tell ? YOUSSEF : It is too soon to tell , really very hard . This is absolutely new to the Egyptian experience . Old and young alike that I talk to , they just really do n't know . There is a hope , of course , with the appointment of a vice president that maybe -- and I have a feeling that Mubarak really did not want to run . LEMON : But the keyword there is appointment . LEMON : It is an appointment by someone who would be seem the masses want out . Well , that 's how it worked . Nasser appointed Sadat as vice president . Sadat appointed Mubarak as vice president . That 's just how it sort works over there . He has to appoint a vice president so that he can be a transition -- a peaceful transition of power , because if he 's going to say , we 're going to have an election for a vice president in midst of this chaos , it 's really is unlikely . LEMON : So would it be - they 're saying step down , we want you out . Not a good move , you believe ? YOUSEF : Not now . There has to be a timetable . There has to be an opportunity for a transition of power . To leave just now , there is no floor under the system that can catch it . There will be just street mob rule . In fact , I 've written about this on my Michael Yousef.com blog . Because it 's very important for people to understand - it 's not like here where - LEMON : There is n't street mob rule happening right now , though ? YOUSEF : It is . It 's going to be far worse if he just leaves the country like the Tunisian president did . But if he brings in people that he begin to trust and hand over the power , maybe in the next several months he 'll be able to just retire and enjoy the rest of his life . LEMON : All right . We have more coverage . Because our coverage of the uprising in Egypt is going to continue here on CNN . We 'll have a live report on the latest from Cairo . And we 'll talk with a few Egyptian Americans here in Atlanta . I had the pleasure of meeting them just last night . STEVE PERRY , CNN EDUCATION CONTRIBUTOR -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : The legend of Franco Harris is growing here in Pittsburgh , not just because he won four Super Bowls for the Steelers but for the work that he 's now doing with an education foundation called the Pittsburgh Promise . FRANCO HARRIS , THE PITTSBURGH PROMISE : This is the chance for so many kids who have an opportunity like myself even though I did n't plan to go to college , it was a great experience there , I was able to pursue my passion and profession in football and then afterward I was able to use my education to go into business . HARRIS : We will give up to $ 5,000 a year . HARRIS : Any school in the state of Pennsylvania . PERRY -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Saleem Ghubril has served as executive director of the Promise since it started in 2007 . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : How many kids so far in just three years ? SALEEM GHUBRIL , EXEC . , THE PITTSBURGH PROMISE : In three years , we have sent 2,500 kids to college . PERRY : Where is this money coming from ? GHUBRIL : In order for us to honor that promise , it 's going to require raising $ 250 million . Our largest employer in Pittsburgh is UPMC , University of Pittsburgh Medical Center . When we approached them with this idea , they jumped on it right away . PERRY -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Vanessa Thompson is now a junior at Chatham University in Pittsburgh . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : What -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- to you now ? VANESSA THOMPSON , SCHOLARSHIP RECIPIENT : It means that I can get places that I never thought that I could before so I can dream bigger . PERRY -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Steve Perry , Pittsburgh . No work here , no eat , no independence . All people are very tired for that . We need a change . I wanted to send the message to America . Please do n't help Mubarak . Because Mubarak , he will go . We hate his current system . -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- Why is this fire still going right now ? Because we do n't like him . All Egyptians , we do n't like it this way . We hate him , OK ? And anyhow he will quit . -LRB- END VIDEO CLIP -RRB- LEMON : A popular uprising in Egypt that threatens to bring down the presidency of Hosni Mubarak is now in its fifth day . Dozens of people have died in violent clashes with riot police over the past week . Many others have been hurt . Here you see the body of one victim carried today through the streets of Cairo . One major change is the disappearance of riot police . Now military troops and vehicles fill parts of Cairo for the most part , the military and civilians have avoided clashing with each other . Protests are spreading to cities around the world . Impassioned Egyptian Americans gathered in Washington today calling for the removal of Egypt 's president . They rallied first at the Egyptian embassy and then marched to the White House . And inside the White House , President Obama huddled with his national security team to discuss the crisis . Joining me now is Michael Yousef , he 's here this hour . And he 's a Christian broadcaster who moved here from Egypt more than 30 years ago . And we got Ivan Watson standing by live for us in Cairo . First to you , Mr. Yousef , why not a full democracy there ? YOUSEF : Well , you have to understand , in my blog , michaelyousef.com , I explained how the concept of democracy is really a western concept . We believe that the power rises from the people . And we the people empower government to rule . That 's why - YOUSEF : Well , at least it 's working here . In fact , Washington and - LEMON : Yes , but has that worked there ? It 's not working there . So why not a full democracy because there are people who say Hosni Mubarak is not that bad , he 's not that bad for the country . Who would believe that when people are in - there are so many people in poverty there ? YOUSEF : Sure , but there are many people who have moved from poverty into a middle class , too . I 'm not defending him , believe me . I know some of the things that needed to be done that were not done . And I think a change is in the air , with him or without him . But at least he permitted the political parties to operate freely , have their own newspapers . -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- Sadat allowed that to happen . LEMON : Well , comparatively . If you compare them to those two people . Let 's go now live to Cairo and go to CNN 's Ivan Watson . Ivan , you have been watching all of this unfold . What are you seeing now ? IVAN WATSON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , right now , the streets are pretty calm and it 's after 2:00 in the morning . There are a number of Egyptian army tanks that have been conducting patrols and parking in major intersections , kind of trying to maintain law and order . You know , Don , as we talked about this , there 's one theme that 's come out over the course of the day repeatedly as I meet demonstrators or just passers-by . When they often - Egyptians ask where I 'm from , I say , I 'm an American citizen . One of the first things they say is , `` you are welcome , you are welcome . '' It 's a sincere response that you get from Egyptians . But then you 'll often hear a second message . One taxi driver told me , tell America to stop supporting this expletive government , meaning the presidency of Hosni Mubarak , of course . And I 've seen signs around saying , you know , effectively , `` Obama , stop supporting this government '' and with the argument that an estimated $ 2 billion a year of U.S. aid comes to the Egyptian government . More than $ 1 billion of that money , according to a WikiLeaks report , going in direct military aid to the Egyptian military and help prop up a regime that 's been in place for some 30 years that is now feeling a real challenge , one of the most severe challenges it has faced in 30 years as a result of these demonstrators who clearly want the strongest ally to the Mubarak government to take a step back right now and listen to the voice of the Egyptian people . LEMON : Ivan , stand by . We 're not done with you yet . As you listen to that , Mr. Yousef , that 's a very good point . As I was out there today , people said , the cans of the tear gas , it says , right there Made in the USA . Some of the ammunition from the weapons , whatever , the U.S. is supporting a government basically that is not for the people . YOUSEF : Well , now they 're saying it 's not for the people . Where have they been for 30 years ? Where have they been for 50 years ? I mean , at least they are able to go down in the street and say things . Papers have been able to attack Mubarak for the past 10 , 15 years . LEMON : So the papers but Mubarak and the government did not want these people out there . That 's why the military was sent out . He did n't want the people out protesting . He shut off the internet . He shut off the lines of communication . It 's not a free democracy where these people are allowed . He does n't want this at all . Of course , he is protecting his turf . I 'm not , again , defending him . I 'm just saying that he has done so much in terms of allowing these voices to speak . When I was a young man living there under Nasser , you could never dream of getting down in the street and attacking the government . LEMON : Your point is things are getting better . And Ivan Watson , in Cairo , things are getting better , according to him , but things are n't according to where these people , these protesters you have been seeing - it 's not to where they would like it to be ? And I think what you could do is point to the most recent round of elections in Egypt , at the end of November and early December , parliamentary elections which were denounced not only by international observers but even by the U.S. State Department saying that there were real problems with those elections , allegations of fraud , that the Egyptian government was n't allowing independent international observers to watch that - those elections . And in the second round of those parliamentary elections , Don , the two main opposition parties boycotted the vote because they saw that that election was rigged , was basically a farce . The main ruling party got , by some estimate , more than 90 percent of the seats in the current parliament . That was seen as a big step back for Egypt as far as electoral democracy goes . And one of the recurring themes I 've heard from people in the streets is here , `` we want to be able to choose our own leader . After 30 years , we deserve that right , '' Don ? LEMON : Ivan Watson in Cairo . Ivan , thank you very much . Egyptian Americans share their thoughts and concerns about the uprising in Egypt , next . I do n't know -- are they even alive or not ? I do n't know what is happening . LEMON : This is a moment of upheaval for the people of Egypt but it 's also a time of hope and anxiety for Egyptian Americans who have to watch all of this unfold from thousands of miles away . We met Mustafa -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- and some others while they were having a dinner at Sultan 's restaurant in Atlanta . And here 's what we talked about just last night . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : My concern is the safety of the people there . The people - the young people especially . I do n't think the bloodshed will be there . LEMON -LRB- on camera -RRB- : When you finally get through on a land line and you talk to your relatives , what 's their state of mind like ? What do they say about all this ? You know , they feel that they are - UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Because they do n't know what 's going to happen . LEMON : As you watch Mubarak 's speech , what did you think ? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Let the people rule . Let the people choose who they want . LEMON : And you said it was almost as if it 's a joke for you ? It is a joke because he does not understand , I mean , he obviously either does n't understand Arabic or he has n't been watching TV because people are going out and saying `` no '' to Mubarak . LEMON : You think it 's over ? LEMON : What does this mean to me ? Why am I interested in what 's happening in Tunisia , in Cairo ? What does it matter to me ? This region has control of oil and that 's a big factor . LEMON : Are you hopeful , Hannah ? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Yes , I hope everything will go well . Not only for Egypt but for the entire region . Get out of Egypt . We do n't need you . We do n't want you here in Egypt . -LRB- END VIDEO CLIP -RRB- LEMON : As we continue our coverage here the response , the revolt in Egypt has been overwhelming on cnn.com . Numerous I-reports have come in showing images of our viewers that have taken , what they 're experiencing there , that they have taken and show us what they 're experiencing from Egypt to Europe and elsewhere around the world , including here in the United States . Egyptian American Nancy Mousa is an i-reporter with several dozen relatives in Egypt . She lives in Atlanta and visited Egypt just last October . So why did you upload your video on I-report ? NANCY MOUSA , EGYPTIAN AMERICAN JOURNALIST : You know , I felt , Don , that it was very important that everyone knew what was truly happening there . I know that Hosni Mubarak has limited the media , information that was being leaked to the United States and I needed to make sure I was able to let everyone in the United States know what my family members were telling me . We 're going to take a look at some of the most compelling images that have come in here . So here 's one I-report from Switzerland of people condemning Hosni Mubarak at a rally . LEMON : So , Nancy , what are they saying and when you were in Egypt , did you see any signs of what they are talking about ? What are they saying ? MOUSA : In that i-report , they were talking about in Egypt here , we do not want the president here anymore . We want to get rid of you . We do n't want you . LEMON : We do n't want you . MOUSA : When I was in Egypt last October it was around election time and , you know , I saw all kinds of corruption within the government . I had a distant relative who was running to be a member of parliament there , and he was actually taken off of the ballot . Somebody bribed somebody in the government and he was taken off the ballot . LEMON : I want to talk now , sitting next to you is Moustafa Mokhemar , one of the people I spoke to last night at the restaurant . We had a very interesting conversation . As you watch all of this 24 hours later from our talk , what do you think ? MOUSTAFA MOKHEMAR , EGYPTIAN AMERICAN : I think Mubarak should leave and Mubarak has no place now . Whatever he did wo n't solve the problem because , again , we have military - LEMON : Moustafa , you disagree with what the doctor said earlier , what Dr. Yousef - I could n't agree more with him , why ? MOKHEMAR : Because he said he gives the media freedom . That 's limited freedom . Yes , he gives them freedom to talk but he makes them angry so they ca n't talk . LEMON : And you agree , you are sitting here going , why ? MOUSA : He does n't give them freedom at all . I think that 's ridiculous as a very perception . That 's very false . The people in Egypt - I 'm very proud of them that they are rebelling right now because he limits what people can say . LEMON : Yes , all right . Well , thanks to both of you . We really appreciate it . We 're going to talk a little bit more here . We 're going to move on and talk about how the U.S. is reacting to the development in Egypt and what 's the next move . Let 's bring in our CNN State Department producer , Elise Labott . So what is going on ? What 's next for the United States ? ELISE LABOTT , CNN STATE DEPARTMENT PRODUCER : Well , Don , the president has been meeting with his national security team and members of the cabinet have been meeting today really trying to decipher what to do next . As you remember President Obama gave President Mubarak a pretty tough message yesterday . Just reshuffling the cabinet is not enough . We really want to see meaningful change . And now talking to officials in the administration they want to see that change . They 're not going to cut Mubarak loose , so to speak , and call for him to leave . They 're going to give him some time to institute some of those changes . They want to see a national dialogue with the opposition . They want to see steps at job creation and I think they 're going to give them some time before they step up their rhetoric and talk about other leverage they can use such as U.S. aid . But they are watching this very seriously . They do n't know who would come in his stead . If he were to leave , there 's really no rallying figure at the opposition they can deal with . And so they 're really concerned for what is coming next . So I think they 're hedging their bets a little bit . What happens if he stays ? LEMON : Elise , stand by . I 'm getting some strong reaction from the folks here . You say what to that ? MOKHEMAR : I think there is no way for Mubarak to clean his mess now after 30 years . He is 82 years old . What change will he make now after 30 years ? LEMON : Then what would you like to see ? She is specifically talking about the Obama administration , our government , watching this very closely . What should they do ? MOKHEMAR : I understand what Obama , President Obama , trying to do because there is nobody can come in to take over . But that 's another problem because Mubarak in the era of Mubarak he did n't bring any people to learn about the politics . LEMON : So I say why should n't he resign and Mr. Yousef said it would be complete chaos if he resigned . Do you agree with that ? MOKHEMAR : What would be more chaos than that ? LEMON : You said to me that you believe in six months that there would be an election and that he would step down . He has n't gone anywhere . He will step out this week . I believe strongly of that . LEMON : Elise Labott , back to you again . The Obama administration is watching this . What is the next move for the Obama administration ? LABOTT : Well , I think they 're going to give some time for this to play out , to see what President Mubarak does . If he does n't take some steps , I think they 're going to talk about possible withdrawal , or holding , suspending U.S. aid . But Don , to answer your guests , I think that they 're really trying to walk a very fine line right now . Because clearly they see that change is coming in Egypt and they really want to be on the right side of history , be on the right side of the aspirations of the Egyptian people but at the same time they do n't know how this is going to play out . It 's very possible in their eyes that President Mubarak does stay in power and so , as I said , they 're hedging their bets . They really do n't want to alienate him and close the channel to future reform if they close the channel and he is still in power . LEMON : All right . Elise , that 's going to be the last word . We have to run . We 're out of time here . Thanks to my guests here , Nancy and Moustafa and Elise Labott in Washington as well . I 'm Don Lemon at CNN World headquarters in Atlanta .

Follow the latest tweets from CNN correspondents and images from the protests . Send your video , images to CNN iReport . Cairo , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Embattled President Hosni Mubarak said early Saturday that he asked the country 's government to resign after thousands of angry Egyptians defied a government curfew and faced stinging police tear gas as they marched for change . `` I asked the government to resign today and I will commission a new government to take over tomorrow , '' Mubarak said in a national address on Saturday shortly after midnight . As Mubarak spoke , Egyptian tanks rolled into the country 's major cities after the nation 's police force had been largely faced down by protesters on Friday . Demonstrators burned many police stations in Cairo and Alexandria and overturned and torched police vehicles . Tear gas in the air in Alexandria Egyptians demand a better life `` When President Mubarak addressed the Egyptian people tonight , he pledged a better democracy and greater economic opportunity , '' Obama said from the White House . `` I just spoke to him after his speech , and told him he has a responsibility to give meaning to those words , to take concrete steps and actions that deliver on that promise , '' Obama said in a televised appearance . `` Violence will not address the grievances of the Egyptian people . Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away . '' Mubarak gave no indication that he would step down or leave the country . `` I assure you that I 'm working for the people and giving freedoms of opinion as long as you 're respecting the law , '' he said . `` There is very little line between freedom and chaos . '' At the same time , Mubarak said that `` these protests arose to express a legitimate demand for more democracy , need for a greater social safety net , and the improvement of living standards , fighting poverty and rampant corruption . '' `` I understand these legitimate demands of the people and I truly understand the depth of their worries and burdens and I will not part from them ever and I will work for them everyday , '' he said . `` But regardless of what problems we face , this does not justify violence or lawlessness . '' Egypt 's president asks gov n't to resign Police van slams into protester Protester shot during Egypt clashes It 's clear , the official said -- speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter -- that Mubarak believes he can ride this out , `` and this time , we 're not so sure that is the right assumption . '' Administration officials had hoped Mubarak would promise an immediate and open dialogue , the official said . The streets of downtown Cairo appeared to calm somewhat overnight Friday as the army -- a much more respected force than police among Egyptian civilians -- took control of the country . The army was much less aggressive with protesters than the police had been , and many Egyptians applauded the arrival of its tanks in Cairo , Alexandria and elsewhere . One of the key questions ahead of sunrise in Egypt on Saturday is whether people will continue to welcome the army as a protective force or reject it as a tool of Mubarak . Celebratory crowds that had gathered overnight Friday ahead of Mubarak 's speech , expecting him to announce his resignation , quickly transformed into street demonstrations when the president announced he was staying put . The government cracked down throughout Friday with thousands of riot and plainclothes police , later joined by army troops in tanks and armored personnel carriers equipped with gun turrets . Undeterred , people ran , screamed , hurled rocks and accosted walls of security as they tried to make their way to central Cairo . Anti-government demonstrators have taken to the streets in Egypt since Tuesday to demand an end to Mubarak 's rule . The protests come weeks after similar disturbances sparked a revolution in Tunisia , forcing then-president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to flee the country . Both Egypt and Tunisia have seen dramatic rises in the cost of living in recent years and accusations of corruption among the ruling elite . In downtown Cairo , a calm seemed to be settling in overnight Friday amid little sign of authority . `` There is no authority ... there 's nobody to protest against , '' CNN 's Ben Wedeman said , speaking of the capital 's downtown area . `` State authority in much of downtown Cairo has disappeared . '' Mubarak imposed a nationwide curfew from 6 p.m. Friday to 7 a.m. Saturday . State-run Nile TV said the curfew was in response to the `` hooliganism and lawlessness '' of the protesters . Vans packed with riot police circled Cairo neighborhoods before the start of weekly prayers in the afternoon . Later in the day , Egyptian soldiers moved onto the streets , the first time the army has been deployed to quell unrest since 1985 . But protesters defied all warnings to demand an end to Mubarak 's authoritarian 30-year-rule . They chanted `` God is Great '' and that the dictator must go . `` Down , Down , Mubarak , '' they shouted . Plumes of rancid , thick smoke billowed over the Nile River as , by nightfall , chaos reigned in the bustling metropolis . The headquarters of the ruling National Democratic Party was ablaze Friday night . Nile TV said protesters ransacked the building and set it afire . Police fired water cannons , rubber bullets and tear gas with force and impunity . A tourist on the balcony of his 18th floor hotel room told CNN he had to run in and wash his eyes and face from the stinging gas . Police confiscated cameras from people , including guests at the Hilton Hotel . At least six people have died in the demonstrations this week , according to Egypt 's Interior Ministry . But Nile TV reported Friday that 13 have died and 75 were injured in Suez , south of Cairo , citing medical sources As the government cracked down on protesters across Egypt , opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei , who returned home to Cairo to join the demonstrations , was placed under house arrest , a high-level security source told CNN . ElBaradei , a Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the United Nations ' nuclear watchdog agency , was warned earlier not to leave a mosque near downtown Cairo where he was attending Friday prayers . White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said that the U.S. is reviewing its aid to Egypt `` based on events now and in the coming days . '' U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton addressed the Egyptian crisis Friday , urging all parties to be peaceful and engage in dialogue . `` We are deeply concerned about the use of violence by Egyptian police and security forces against protesters and we call on the Egyptian government to do everything within its power to restrain its security forces , '' Clinton said . `` At the same time , protesters should also refrain from violence and express themselves peacefully . '' The protests sent ripples around the world , with stocks plunging on news of Egypt unrest . The Dow dropped 166 points on Friday , its largest loss since November . The State Department urged Americans to defer all non-essential travel to Egypt and within the country . Delta Air Lines said its last flight from Cairo will depart Saturday ; all other Cairo service was indefinitely suspended , said spokeswoman Susan Elliott . American Airlines and British Airways will allow customers with tickets between Friday and Monday to or from Cairo to change their flights at no charge , according American Airlines spokesman Edward Martelle . Egypt is the most populous nation in the Arab world and often a barometer for sentiment on the Arab community . `` What happens in Egypt will have an impact throughout the Arab world and the Middle East , '' said Edward Djerejian , a former U.S. ambassador to Israel and Syria . In the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria on Friday , at least 1,000 protesters gathered and youths hurled rocks through black clouds of gas . Crowds ran through the streets toward the city 's central square . There was no indication of a curfew in that city either , as people remained out well after the time it was to begin . In Suez , 15,000 riot police were out , using tear gas to disperse crowds , Nile TV said . Riot police also confronted protesters in the cities and towns of Ismailia , Fayoum and Shbin Elkoum , according to the anti-government group Egyptian Liberation . A CNN crew covering the clashes in Cairo felt the wrath of the police . CNN 's Wedeman and Mary Rogers were under an overpass and behind a column as police tried to hold back protesters . Plainclothes police wielding clubs surrounded the CNN team and wanted `` to haul us off , '' Wedeman said . In a struggle , police grabbed Rogers 's camera , cracked its viewfinder , and confiscated it . Wedeman said the police threatened to beat them . Egypt 's Interior Ministry forbade protests Friday , but some Egyptians went door to door in Cairo , urging their neighbors to participate . The main opposition bloc , the Muslim Brotherhood , urged its supporters for the first time to take to the streets . Hours ahead of the protests , the internet went dark in many parts of the country . Some text messaging and cell phone services appeared to be blocked . Even though it was difficult to use Twitter and Facebook within Egypt , thousands of others outside the country ran with the powerful social media tool to provide a real-time chronology of events . `` Mubarak '' was a trending topic . Authorities arrested a prominent Muslim Brotherhood leader early Friday , detaining the party 's main speaker , Issam al-Aryan , according to a relative . Other government critics voiced their opinions -- amazingly -- on state-run television . A popular morning show on state-run Nile TV included comments from guests calling for the resignation of government officials and increased dialogue between authorities and arrested protesters . The network carried coverage of the protests , even at times calling them large and peaceful . They followed days of unrest that have roiled several Arab countries . Demonstrations in Tunisia were followed by protests in Algeria , Egypt , Yemen and Jordan . `` They all want the same , '' said Emile Hokayem of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in the Middle East , speaking of protesters in different Arab countries . `` They 're all protesting about growing inequalities , they 're all protesting against growing nepotism . The top of the pyramid was getting richer and richer . '' People are also fed up with authoritarian regimes that do not afford the people proper representation . Mubarak has not been seen in public for some time . He is 82 and there has been speculation of failing health . Many Egyptians believe Mubarak is grooming his son , Gamal , as his successor , a plan that could be complicated by demands for democracy . CNN 's Nic Robertson , Frederik Pleitgen , Salma Abdelaziz , Housam Ahmed and Caroline Faraj contributed to this report .

Amazing pictures out of Egypt , right now . Thousands taking to the streets demanding historic change , Gunfire exploding . We 've got gunfire near a key government building . The Interior Ministry , as police try to hold back protesters . Demonstrators seem to be coming in waves ignoring the curfew emboldened by today 's government resignations . From CNN Center , this is CNN SATURDAY MORNING . I 'm Randi Kaye . ISHA SESAY , CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR : And welcome to our international viewers , I 'm Isha Sesay . JONATHAN MANN , CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR : And I 'm Jonathan Mann , let 's get you up to the latest from Egypt , now . If you 're just joining us , here 's what we know , so , far today . The death toll is rising from the anti-government demonstrations . Right now we know that at least 38 people have died in clashes between protesters and police , 10 of the dead are police officers . The protesters want new leaders , and today a modest move toward that . A short time ago the cabinet handed in their resignations , but the main target of the protesters ' anger says he is n't going anywhere . President Hosni Mubarak has been defiant to this point . HOSNI MUBARAK , PRESIDENT OF EGYPT -LRB- via translator -RRB- : I take responsibility for the security of this country and the citizens . I will not let this happen . I will not let fear live in the citizens or to let this tell us what 's going to happen in the future . MANN : We are seeing an increased military presence in major cities , especially in Cairo itself . Tanks and soldiers have taken up positions among the demonstrators . Now , more and more tanks are moving in to place , so far without incident , though . A curfew went into effect just about an hour ago . But protesters have pretty much ignored it and just about welcomed the tanks . People around the world are watching these historic protests , especially in Washington , where President Obama talked about the importance of real change . BARACK OBAMA , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : What 's needed right now are concrete steps that advance the rights of the Egyptian people , a meaningful dialogue between the government and its citizens and a path of political change that leads to a future of greater freedom and greater opportunity and justice for the Egyptian people . MANN : The story 's changing and fast , and we 've got it all covered for you . We 've got reporters on the ground in Cairo and Alexandria . And we 're watching reaction in places like Washington and Jerusalem . Stay with us all day as we watch and analyze all of it as it happens . SESAY : Let 's head to Cairo , capital city in turmoil this hour . Thousands are defying a curfew and are calling for change . Our correspondents there report gunfire and the acrid smell of tear gas . CNN 's Frederik Pleitgen is there in Cairo . Fred , explain to us exactly where you are and what you 're seeing right now . FREDERIK PLEITGEN , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Right now I 'm on the Corniche , one of the main roads here along the Nile River . As you can see below me there are a lot of tanks in place here . The military is here in full force . What we 've been hearing here is because of the fact that the police have absolutely disappeared off the streets , there appears to be lawlessness , homes being broken into , armed criminal gangs that are on the loose in this city , also stores that are closed or have been ransacked . So certainly the population of Cairo -- I can tell you there are many , many people who are very worried about the situation . We 're also hearing some neighborhoods here , people organizing to try to keep their property safe . On the one hand we have this interesting situation where on the one hand people here -- obviously the police were heavy handed in their response to the riots , however -- -LRB- AUDIO GAP -RRB- SESAY : I want to apologize to our viewers . We appear to have lost Frederik Pleitgen . There are some technical problems . We 'll work to get him back . KAYE : The diplomatic community is watching what is happening in Egypt very close . CNN Senior State Department producer Elisa Labott is live and will be joining us from Washington with the latest developments . But first , speaking of Washington , let 's talk a little bit right here why this is so important to the U.S. First of all , I mean , you know this region so well , where this is all unfolding . Let 's talk about the Suez Canal . Why is that at play here and why should the U.S. care about it ? SESAY : Anyone at home who is wondering that question should listen up . The bottom line is Egypt , which owns the Suez Canal , has given the U.S. preferential access to it so its warships can go through as well as giving us access to its air space , all critical to the U.S. in terms of any kind of operations it 's doing in the region . The bottom line is Egypt 's the U.S. most important strategic partner in the region . It 's a relationship that dates back to the 1970s . If someone wants a price tag it 's costing the U.S. billions of dollars a year . That 's how important it is to this country . Egypt is very much seen as a counterweight in many ways . It 's seen as a moderating influence there in the region . And many people say as Egypt goes , so the region goes . MANN : A point about Egypt 's moderating role , Hosni Mubarak is largely responsible for that . But if you think about the Specter of Islamic fundamentalism , Islamism as a movement was born in Egypt . The Brotherhood is the most Islamist organization in the world . It has links to group like Hamas and around the world . But the Muslim Brotherhood has been on Hosni Mubarak 's target list for years . It was a country that was casualty to Islamic terrorism . Hosni Mubarak crushed it . What 's so extraordinary about the pictures we 're seeing today these are n't Islamists , these are n't agitators . These are the ordinary people of the country . But once again , this country has been a bulwark against the kind of Islamism that so terrifies Washington . Hosni Mubarak is the personification of that . Without Hosni Mubarak , what happens now ? SESAY : To that point about the Muslim Brotherhood , which was banned all the way back in 1954 , let 's be clear on that , it is a group that started with violent roots and it has renounced that violence , to be very clear . It has a lot of young educated people in its ranks . A lot of people who enter government these days who are members of the Muslim Brotherhood because it 's a band organization , they join as nominal independents . That 's the way they get in . But it 's still an important organizing force and opposition voice there in Egypt . KAYE : And they do support ElBaradei . SESAY : They say they do . MANN : There 's another Washington angle to this which is really crucial . I would be so curious to hear from the second President Bush today . President Bush had the freedom agenda . He said that the people of the Middle East were crying out for the democratic rights that Americans take for granted . There was a lot of cynicism by people in Egypt and cynicism by people in the United States , but this is evidence that he was right . When I visited Egypt to cover some of the early political efforts during his year in power , people said if it were n't for President Bush , their own political movements would be crushed . In time their movements were crushed . The Bush administration made a choice and in a sense was less vocal about it than it might be . But this has been U.S. policy under the Bush administration a little less so under the Obama administration , to encourage the spread of democracy in Egypt . So why should Washington care ? This was policy for this country under President Bush . It 's policy that 's been changed , and we 're now seeing a little bit of discomfort as the Obama administration grapples with the repercussions here , because , once again , Egypt matters to Washington . KAYE : We talk about this ripple effect or the concern of this ripple effect or the Tunisian effect now that we 've seen what happened in Tunisia and what 's happening now in Egypt . Isha , what would you say would be the next greatest concern ? And how concerned should the U.S. be about this spreading ? SESAY : I think that the U.S. should look very closely at Yemen because we have seen protests there in Yemen . Let 's talk about the similarities as we talk about this Tunisian effect , this domino effect that many have talked about at great length . The bottom line is you have a lot of these Arab countries that have these aging rulers who have been in power for decades . They have young population , they have high unemployment . I mean , according to one statistic I read , in the case of Egypt itself , it may have the highest unemployment among educated classes in the world , so to give you some insight into what 's taking place on the ground . But in places like Yemen , in places like Libya , Algeria , all these countries that are grappling were leaders in power for a long time , people have had enough . And Yemen in particular where we have Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , the U.S. should be paying attention to we saw protests there on Friday . People saying Salah he must go . The question is , if you remove these people who have had some kind of uneasy calm for a length of time , what fills the vacuum ? KAYE : This is a fascinating discussion that we 'll have to continue . For the meantime , you know the diplomatic community is watching what 's going on in Egypt very closely . CNN 's Senior State Department producer Elise Labott is live in Washington with the latest developments on that front . Elise , what 's happening there in Washington and at the State Department ? ELISE LABOTT , CNN SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT PRODUCER : Well , Randi , you really see the administration walking this very fine balance between wanting to support the protesters , making sure that their rights are respected , that the government does n't crack down , but at the same time really sending the message to the Mubarak regime that if you are going to be in power , and that is something Egyptians are going to have to decide , you need to make meaningful reforms . As we heard from President Obama and many members of the administration that we talked to , that speech was not good enough . President Mubarak did not give any hint that he 'll allow more political inclusion , that he 's going to provide more jobs , more opportunities . And just a reshuffling of the cabinet , a reshuffling of the deck , you say , is n't going to suffice . And there 's really been a debate in this administration about how far to go on the reform issue . You were just talking about that . And the issue is it was anything but the Bush administration 's policy . This administration came in wanting to distance itself from the Bush administration . They did not emphasize the reform issue for that reason . But in the last few months there 's been a debate in the administration about how much to pick up on this . Should we be talking about this ? You heard Secretary Clinton talking at a forum in Qatar a few weeks ago saying , listen , Arab leaders , if you do not reform , if you do not answer some the social unrest , the economic unrest that your people are talking about and protesting on the streets and clamoring for change , your regimes are going to sink in the sand . So there 's been a very -- that was a dire prediction , you would say , and there 's really been a ramping up , I think , of the administration 's policy on pushing reform . I think now they 're finally getting it . You will see a more consistent message from the administration . Let 's listen to what Secretary Clinton had to say yesterday about the need for reform in Egypt . HILLARY CLINTON , U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE : These protests underscore that there are deep grievances within Egyptian society , and the Egyptian government needs to understand that violence will not make these grievances go away . As President Obama said yesterday , reform is absolutely critical to the well-being of Egypt . Egypt has long been an important partner of the United States on a range of regional issues . As a partner , we strongly believe that the Egyptian government needs to engage immediately with the Egyptian people in implementing needed economic , political , and social reforms . LABOTT : So a various ramping up of the administration 's message to President Mubarak . But at the same time , as we 've been discussing all morning , we really do n't know what comes next . So the administration is really looking at what 's happening in Egypt , looking at other countries like Jordan , like Yemen , as you mentioned , about what happens next . They really do n't know . And so they 're really saying anything short of suggesting for regime change , but they really would like to see -- I 've heard the phrase recently `` managed change . '' They 'd like to see Egypt move towards elections , move towards more political inclusion , and the September elections down the line could give space for that . But if President Mubarak does not institute some of the reform , you heard President Obama and his spokesmen say that there 's a lot of U.S. aid on the line here and the U.S. will be reviewing its assistance to Egypt . KAYE : And Elise , before we let you go , just very quickly , I want you to react to a tweet from the State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley saying the United States remains , quote , `` concerned about the potential for violence in Egypt and urges restraint on all sides . '' Very quickly , your reaction ? LABOTT : I think they 're really focusing on the rights right now . The rights , restoring the Internet , you saw a little bit of the phone companies and the Internet being restored , really focusing on the rights right now of the people , making sure that there is not a massive crackdown . Obviously the speech we heard was n't enough for the administration , but right now they 're really focusing on making sure that the situation does n't spiral out of control and we see a lot of deaths and arrests , particularly of journalists , Randi . KAYE : All right , thanks for your insight , we 'll check back with you . History unfolding in Egypt , the government resigns but President Hosni Mubarak is n't going anywhere . And protesters are out in full force again . KAYE : Welcome back . It 's 15 minute past the hour . Nick Lewandowski is a writer and editor in Cairo who was interviewed earlier in the week on CNN . He is joining us now . Nick , can you tell us where you are in Cairo , and what you 're seeing ? NICK LEWANDOWSKI , WITNESS : Right now I 'm actually away from the demonstrations that are downtown . I 'm in my apartment in Manira , which is across from basically the Four Seasons hotel and the embassy district where the American and British embassies are . Right now we 're hearing sporadic gunfire coming from what sounds like downtown . It is not clear to us again from this vantage point , whether that gunfire is being fired at people or just in to the air to disperse them . There was a 4:00 curfew . When 4:00 rolled , though , around there were still large numbers of people downtown on the streets . We heard that people are basically trying to storm the ministry of the interior downtown and the police and military units down there have reacted by shooting rounds , live rounds . KAYE : I know that you sent us some iReports yesterday . What do you see in terms of a difference in the crowd or the anger or the trust rags , maybe even the level of violence from one day to the next ? LEWANDOWSKI : In terms of what we saw yesterday , I was out on the street all day starting at the al Aqsa mosque and making my way back to the center of town . What we were seeing everywhere on the streets was a battle , a street battle between protesters and police . And what we saw happen throughout the day was the protesters no longer were afraid to confront the police directly . There were instances where we seeing them picking up tear gas canisters and throwing them back into the police lines . We saw people who were basically unafraid to go toe to toe with the police units . And then as evening came around , of course t level of violence did seem to ratchet up . We saw Molotov cocktails being thrown near the 15th of May bridge . Police trucks were being burned , there were cars burned out . At that point really , the people had taken the streets downtown , and there was a gap period downtown where there was a great deal of looting and really no one was in control until the army units were moved in later in the evening . And this morning things were a lot calmer . Armored personnel carriers at intervals spaced out downtown . Earlier in the day things were comparatively -- KAYE : Are you in the street or where are you ? LEWANDOWSKI : I 'm actually in an apartment where I live right now . KAYE : OK , I was just wondered who we hear there talking next to you . So we 're now about an hour past when this curfew took effect , more than an hour past . Any word on what will happen to the people who remain on the street and ignore this curfew ? And obviously they 're not concerned about that . Well , the big issue is there is not -- especially for those of us who do n't speak Arabic fluently , it is difficult for us to get information at this point because we do n't have Internet access . We do not have access other than satellite television to news outlets that are reporting , you know , reliability this information in English . We heard that there was a curfew . We were coming out and visiting friends who were holed up . And the guys at the hotel were pulling potted plants and boarding the front . Journalists need to get out there , and there was a curfew and a great bit of dispute . There was no announcement of the consequences and how -- if there is a curfew is also probably questionable . KAYE : All right . Nick Lewandowski , we 'll leave it there . Thank you for sharing your story with us . LEWANDOWSKI : You 're very welcome . KAYE : The protesters planned the demonstration and rallied the troops , but on Thursday , actually , the government shut it down . We 'll tell you where that stands . In the meantime , we 'll take a very quick break . Be sure to stay with us because we have correspondents and cameras all over the region , and we 'll bring you everything as it happens . MANN : Five day of upheaval in Egypt continue . Now reports that president Hosni Mubarak has for the first time in nearly three decades in power name a vice president to serve under him . You recall he fired his government . He now has a new second in command . Early indications are it 's a man with a history of involvement in intelligence . Our Mohammed Jamjoom joins us now . Mohammed , the name is not familiar to most of us , but Omar Suleman , what do we know about him ? MOHAMMED JAMJOOM , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Pardon me . Jonathan , in effect we were just going to talk to you about social media and what we 're seeing right now out of Egypt . Let me just show you some of the tweets that are coming out even though the Internet has effectively been shut down across Egypt since yesterday , we actually have an iReport video that came out from the hotel walking through the streets . You can see demonstrators . Look like to be of all ages . Could be thousands walking through going there through Tahrir Square in Cairo . This is someone tweeting out of Cairo , `` I am hearing the biggest crowd ever is going in Tahrir Square . '' P.J. Crowley , the State Department spokesman , `` With protesters still on the streets of Egypt , we remain concerned about the potential for violence and again urge restraint on all sides . '' Also we can look at some photos . This is the party headquarters still smoldering . Here is the trends map from twitter to show how popular the term and the hash-tag Egypt is across the world . This is a headline map , what 's popular on CNN.com , what 's being e-mailed a lot on CNN.com , `` Protesters head toward the heart of Cairo . Mixed reaction in the Middle East . Who is holding the cards in Egypt ? Egyptian president dissolves government . '' There is still an Internet block , nonetheless people are trying to get the message out . Protesters are trying even through their mobile phones on how to be out on the streets and protest today . MANN : As we watch all this unfold , one thing that you 're struck by is the cooperation that the Egyptian government has received from cell phone companies , from Internet providers . Are you surprised by that ? Or is that the way they would normally behave in a time of crisis ? JAMJOOM : What 's been interesting is that what happened was unprecedented in Internet history . What happened yesterday is at a certain time effectively everything was cut off . We 've heard that there might be one Internet service provider that was still kept open and that maybe some of the banks in Egypt are still able to do banking online . Nonetheless , completely shut down . And it is a government shutdown . And that has really added fuel to the fire in Egypt because people who were not maybe using social media , people wanting to use their mobile phones and wanted to get online have not been able to . So it really caused a lot more anger toward the government than the government anticipated . MANN : What is quite extraordinary -- and this is amazing when you think about it , they 've gone through great efforts to shut down social media . They 've sent crews to attack one of our journalists . One of our camera crews their camera was taken and destroyed . But state-run media has continued to broadcast these extraordinary pictures . So it seems they do n't want the independent media to report what 's going on . They do n't want ordinary people spreading the word , but within Hosni Mubarak 's own apparatus , someone is putting these pictures on television anyway . JAMJOOM : John , that 's a very good point . Yesterday quite extraordinary what we were seeing on Nile TV , state-run Egyptian television , before the curfew was imposed , you were seeing opposition speaking , you were seeing the protests , you were seeing clashes , then after the curfew was imposed it went to more generic pictures . You were seeing a more placid view . You were n't seeing the worst of it . Today if you look side by side of pictures of what 's on Nile TV , state-run television and the other nets that are there , including CNN , it 's a much different picture . That holds true to a lot of state-run television networks in the Middle East , when there 's violence going on , you are n't seeing the worth of it . Side by side , Egyptian Nile television compared to the other networks , you see a real stark difference . MANN : The government of China has an extraordinary apparatus to monitor the Internet and some other countries as well . People can be -- well , they can be in jeopardy just for tweeting . How much do we know how closely Egypt watches its Internet , its tweets , its people online ? JAMJOOM : We know from detentions of bloggers in the past before any of this and harassment of bloggers in the past in Egypt that there has been a crackdown , especially when it comes to online activism . Egypt has been accused by human rights groups of really cracking down on people that have been involved in activism online . They 've been accused of beating to death even bloggers . In fact one of the icons of this movement is somebody is very much heavily involved in online activism , and he was allegedly beaten to death by security forces last year . That caused a huge amount of rage amongst the Egyptian people in the past several months , and his picture is one of the pictures that 's really being sent around by a lot of people behind this movement to try to compel people to get out into the streets . So , yes , Egypt is authoritarian when it comes to these types of things . They have in the past gone after people who they think are trying to use online activism to be dissenters , to go after the government . As of now , we 're not hearing reports , mainly because of the online shutdown , because there is no Internet . If people have been tweeting or managed to get around the blockage , we 'll probably hear more about that in day to come . MANN : Mohammed Jamjoom reporting for us . Egypt is maintaining control of the web . Five days of upheaval in Hosni Mubarak 's Egypt . The Egyptian president is holding on , but he 's fired his cabinet and now appointed a new vice president for first time in three decades . CNN 's extensive coverage of the events in Egypt will continue after this . KAYE : Let 's get you up to date here on CNN . Thank you to our international viewers who are joining us as well . You are looking at pictures there of Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak . This is new video coming in to us at CNN , new video of Hosni Mubarak along with the vice president that he has just appointed . Omar Suleiman is his name . And apparently , according to U.S. diplomatic cables , he 's been mentioned several times as a possible transitional leader , even should Mubarak go . MANN : Just a hint of what the president has in mind . Suleiman is the director of Egyptian intelligence . Even some time ago one media account called him the fixer in the shadows , a man who has taken on some of the president 's worst enemies , the Islamists , the terrorists who threatened Egypt and threatened massive upheaval in that country . That problem went away . Suleiman is the man apparently who did it . SESAY : I was just going to jump in there and add that the question we all have to ask ourselves is whether this move by Mubarak will be enough to quell these protests , if this kind of reform for the masses on the streets remains to be seen . KAYE : The death toll now rising from the anti-government demonstrations that we 've been watching for days , right now we know at least 38 people have died in clashes between protesters and police . Ten of the dead are police officers . The protesters want new leaders . And today there is a move toward that . A short time ago the cabinet handed in their resignations . But the main target of the protesters ' anger is n't going anywhere . President Hosni Mubarak has been defiant to this point . -LRB- BEGIN VIDEO CLIP -RRB- MUBARAK : I take responsibility for the security of this country and the citizens . I will not let this happen . I will not let fear live in the citizens or to let this tell us what 's going to happen in the future . KAYE : And we are seeing an increased military presence in major cities , especially in Cairo . Tanks and soldiers have taken up positions among the demonstrators . We 've seen the interior ministry . Many folks gather there , tens of thousands of people gather there , gunfire reported . Our witnesses there , eyewitnesses who have joined us by phone telling us that two people were shot . Now , though , more and more tanks are moving in to place . A curfew went into effect more than an hour ago , just about an hour and a half ago , but protesters have pretty much ignored that . In fact they 're getting more emboldened by all of this . People around the world are watching these historic protests , especially in Washington where President Obama talked about the importance of real change . OBAMA : What 's needed right now are concrete steps that advance the rights of the Egyptian people , a meaningful dialogue between the government and its citizens , and a path of political change that leads to a future of greater freedom and greater opportunity and justice for the Egyptian people . SESAY : As we watch the events in Egypt , the whole world is closely watching what is unfolding there , it 's important to get reaction from the region . With that , let 's go to Jerusalem and bring in CNN 's Jerusalem Bureau Chief Kevin Flower who is standing by for us . Kevin , just getting word that Hosni Mubarak has appointed a vice president , the first time he 's done that since being in power . Israel very closely watching what is going on there across the border . Any comments from Israeli officials at this point ? KEVIN FLOWER , CNN JERUSALEM BUREAU CHIEF : Isha , nothing . We know that Israeli officials , they 've told us that they 're watching events very closely . But that is all they 're saying . And Israeli officials , analysts and government officials assessing the first couple days of the protests in Cairo and the other parts of Egypt were saying that they thought that the government of Hosni Mubarak would be able to withstand this social upheaval . Some are probably reconsidering that assessment or having doubts about that assessment as they see events unfold over the past 24 hours or so . And , of course , the Egypt-Israel relationship has been a hugely important one for Israel . It 's 30 years old , a 30-year peace treaty that 's been in effect . Hosni Mubarak has been there for 28 years . He is a known quantity to the Israeli government . He has been around for eight Israeli prime ministers , again , a known quantity . So the notion of Hosni Mubarak going away or his government radically changing that is unsettling to a lot of Israeli officials here because they do n't know what 's going to come in its place . And so some fear and apprehension about what this could bring , but nothing being expressed openly right now . SESAY : I 've got to ask you , are we getting anything from the Palestinian territories , anything coming out from the government of Mahmoud Abbas ? FLOWER : Well , it 's interesting . At this point it 's equal silence from the Palestinian side . What we do know today from the Palestinian official news agency is that the Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas actually called Hosni Mubarak this morning to affirm his , quote , `` solidarity with Egypt and to express his commitment to its stability and its security . '' That 's as much as we 've heard from the Palestinian authority and nothing from the Hamas rulers in the Gaza Strip either . So they , just like the Israelis , are watching these events unfold . They do n't know what it means . They have different , you know , different stakes in this fire . The Palestinian authority has been very close to Egypt . Egypt has been an ally enshrined to promote the Palestinian authority 's sort of stance on talking to Israel in the past . In Gaza , the Hamas rulers have had a more antagonistic relationship with Egypt . It will be interesting to see what they have to say in the days going forward . SESAY : Kevin , let me ask you this . We were just telling our viewers that Hosni Mubarak has appointed Omar Suleiman as his vice president . We want to know what kind of relationship he has with Israeli officials . Do we know anything about that ? FLOWER : Well , Omar Suleiman is a known quantity to this Israeli government and past Israeli governments . He 's a man who has been in charge of the security apparatus in Egypt for many years , and in that capacity he has had dozens of conversations about dozens of topics with Israeli officials over the years about the role of Hamas , about the role of Hezbollah , you know , issues like the Israeli prisoner Gilad Shali , various negotiations between Hamas and the Palestinian authority . This man has been involved in all of them . And he 's also been talking to Israel during that time as well . So it 's a significant -- I think the Israeli government would be happy to see that he has been moved into this vice presidential position , but again , the events are still moving so quickly , I do n't think they can take any solace in it just yet . SESAY : Israeli officials not speaking out on this , but I wonder how this is playing with the ordinary Israeli public . Is this generating as much interest and concern among them as it is in other part of the world ? FLOWER : Well , absolutely . It 's been a top story here . And Israel 's frequently a place that the media is often consumed with domestic political stories , you know , things that involve the Palestinians . There have been a lot of attention paid to the Palestinian papers that came out this past week . But the past two days , this has been the number one story here . This is a hugely important development and a lot of Israelis are wondering -- just normal Israelis as well as government officials -- what is this going to mean for Israel going forward ? Are we going to have a continued ally in Egypt in the future or is that relationship going to change fundamentally ? And of course , Israel always feeling somewhat isolated in this region , surrounded by some countries that are hostile to it . It 's fought wars many of its neighbors . It does not want to see the relationship with Egypt deteriorate in the future . SESAY : CNN Jerusalem bureau chief Kevin Flower providing us with excellent analysis and perspective . Kevin , we thank you . We are going to closely follow the events as they unfold in Egypt . Our special coverage of this crisis will continue after a very short break . You 're looking there at a picture of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , new video in to CNN . We want to show you it one more time , Hosni Mubarak along with the new vice president who is expected to be sworn in shortly , which we will , of course , bring that to you live . His name is Omar Suleiman , and he 's really one of the world 's most powerful spy chiefs , apparently . All of the most delicate issues for the Middle East land on his desk . We want the talk about him and much more about the impact of these demonstrations on the global scene . Marco Vicenzino is the founder and director of Global Strategy Project . He joins us now from Washington . Marco , first , let 's get your reaction to the appointment of this new vice president . MARCO VICENZINO , FOUNDER AND DIRECTOR , GLOBAL STRATEGY PROJECT : It does n't surprise me . Arguably Omar Suleiman is the most powerful man in Egypt , arguably . He 's been by the side of the president for nearly 20 years now . And the way he did so , he was a member of the security apparatus , but in the early '90s , Hosni Mubarak visited Ethiopia . Omar Suleiman insisted that the president take certain precautions . And the precautions he took saved his life . From that point onwards Omar Suleiman became the right hand man of Hosni Mubarak and behind the scenes he 's extremely well respected in the region , with other intelligence chiefs and has a lot of respect in Washington and is listened to in Washington . When he arrives here , it is not often announced in the media that he 's coming . He 's someone is behind the scenes . This is an individual who defeated what one can arguably consider the precursor to Al Qaeda . In the '90s , before 9\\/11 , people tend to forget in Washington that Egypt was fighting an internal struggle with hardcore Islamists radicals . The number two in Al Qaeda Ayman al Zawahiri had to flee Egypt and join bin Laden in Afghanistan because he was defeated by Omar Suleiman . Then what took place in Afghanistan , the fusion between Al Qaeda , the group of bin Laden and al Zawahiri 's group merged together . So someone with a very impressive track record in the security field . KAYE : I would imagine that Hosni Mubarak trusts very few and he would certainly be in his inner circle . But he 's also been described to us as a `` thug '' -- I 'm using that word , that 's a direct quote , a thug straight out of central casting . What can we expect his role to be here ? VICENZINO : Maintain order . And when you say he 's a thug , to defeat a movement , an Islamist movement that was a powerful movement in Egypt , you ca n't be an ordinary , nice person . In situations like that in that part of the world being a thug helps , and you need the respect of people , of people within your apparatus . Omar Suleiman I think after the scenes of yesterday , the violence , 38 dead from what we understand , the main thing is preserving order and stability , order in the streets . And the person who can do that is , obviously , Omar Suleiman . He 'll be having a more public role now , obviously . Operating behind the scenes for 20 years requires you to do so much , but now that you 're a public face and you 'll be out in the open , it 's a different challenge , a different test now . KAYE : Might we read anything into this appointment , do you think ? KAYE : That 's what I was going to say , do you think that could be happening here ? VICENZINO : A possible transitional leader . In my opinion , a piece that I wrote on the CNN website , what I called for was Mr. Mubarak to renounce that he 's going to be running in the presidential elections of 2011 to offer himself and his circle a graceful exit from politics where you have an evolution over the next few months as opposed to a revolution , sort of like we saw in Tunisia . So I think this is a good step in the positive direction if this is going to begin a transformation . And if that does take place , that 's in the best interests for internal Egyptian stability , for regional stability and for international order and for American interests around the world . KAYE : Why do you think he would be so good at bringing regional stability ? VICENZINO : Obviously he has good relationships ranging from the Palestinian leadership , governments throughout the region . And , once again , he 's someone -- you 're talking about a part of the world where strong individuals are often respected more than in other part , perhaps . So to have that sense of stability , his track record in the '90s of maintaining order and saving -- in my opinion saving Egypt from radicals gives Mubarak -- gives Mubarak more breathing time . Now , do I think we 're at the point of no return where the violence is going to take off and go sort of as it went in Tunisia ? I do n't think so . I do n't think we 've reached that point of no return yet . But one needs to go beyond not only just appointing Omar Suleiman but lifting the 30-year state of emergency . That has to be lifted . A transformation , a political opening where parties can organize themes in preparation for the 2011 presidential elections , that 's just one step on a long road . KAYE : Wonderful insight . Marco Vicenzino , Thank you so much . MANN : Our extensive coverage continues . Is there a WikiLeaks angle in any of this ? Atika Shubert is live from London right after the break . We are closely following events in Egypt as they unfold . Let 's go back live to Cairo right now were Amr Khalid is a well-known televangelist in the world . We appreciate your time on this day . I want the start by getting your thoughts on what we 've been witnessing there in Egypt and what it means for Hosni Mubarak . AMR KHALILD , TELEVANGELIST : Let me tell you first that the Egyptian youth ten years ago nobody listened to them , no jobs for them . They have no hope . They have no dream in their life . So what happened this week , they have a lot of problems . No one respected them . In '06 I asked the youth in the Middle East and in Egypt , please send me your dreams for your country for 20 years from now . Can you imagine , I got 700,000 dreams . I asked them , what are the priorities ? They said , we need jobs , we need to work . They want to work . They want somebody to respect them . This is the problem . This is the situation . But , at the same time I disagree about what some people going to do , this is not acceptable to do in our country . So from CNN , I 'm giving you that I have an initiative . We 'll start tomorrow , 50,000 of lawmakers , my organization in Egypt will go to keep and to protect all the banks , the hotels and museums in Egypt , to be with one image , we will go -- SESAY : Amr Khalid , let me jump in there . You say you 're going to do your bit if you can to bring about peace on the streets . President Hosni Mubarak a short time ago introducing a vice president , Omar Suleiman . What effect will this have on these protests ? Will it go anyways towards calming them down ? KHALILD : Actually , I 'm not quite sure . I ca n't tell you now . We are in a very bad situation . And I can tell you as you see from all these people . But what I 'm going to tell you that if we did n't look for the future of our youth , their dreams , and we have to respect their dreams . The problem is not only in Egypt . It 's in all the Middle East it will be worse . I went to Yemen to establish a project to stop their extremists in Yemen . But the local Yemeni youth told me , where are the jobs ? We need to work . This is what I 'm saying and what I 'm trying to do in my projects . Again , we have an initiative and with the army in Egypt to say , with Amr Khalid tomorrow will be to protect our museums , banks , to keep our country . KHALILD : Amr Khalid , we have to leave it there . We want to thank you for joining us . Amr Khalid saying he 'll play his part to protect Egypt 's important institutions and buildings . We 'll try to do a little bit of digging to find out what that really means when it does come to pass , if it does come to path . Hosni Mubarak , the president has just appointed a new vice president . We 're standing by for that swearing-in ceremony . We 're going to be right back after this . We 're covering the unfolding events in Egypt , the upheaval there from every angle . Here 's an intriguing one , WikiLeaks . The purloined State Department documents have revealed a lot about the world 's leaders and there 's an Egyptian angle to it , too . Atika Shubert joins us now from London . What did you see ? ATIKA SHUBERT , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : As you know , there 's a quarter of a million diplomatic cables that WikiLeaks is sitting on . As you can imagine there are dozens of Egyptian cables in there . They really reveal the sort of complicated and contradictory relationship the United States has with Egypt . I want to bring up something I just found here which is a cable dating from 2007 that talks about presidential succession in Egypt . It mentions Omar Suleiman , who is now , of course , just been appointed vice president . It describes him as Mubarak 's consigliore , saying that it 's only been in the last few years that he stepped out of the shadows as the director of intelligence , has allowed himself to be photographed in meetings with foreign leaders . And that because of his military background , that analysts believe that he would at least have to figure in any sort of succession scenario . The cable also points out that he is known to be extremely loyal to Mubarak . The exact description is `` his loyalty to Mubarak seems rock solid . '' And they also point out that he could be attractive not only to the ruling apparatus but to the public at large as a reliable figure , because , quote , `` He is unlikely to harbor ambitions for another multi - decade presidency . '' So that basically sums up what U.S. diplomats , at least in 2007 , what they were thinking of Omar Suleiman at the time . MANN : I do n't want to make too much of this , but consigliore is not a word that we use very often . I do n't speak Italian . The only way I know that word is from the `` Godfather '' movies . Are they making a reference to mobsters by choosing that kind of title ? SHUBERT : Well , we 'd have to ask U.S. diplomats to find out . But it certainly suggests his role as an adviser , giving advice to somebody who perhaps sees himself as something like a godfather to a nation , who sees himself as somebody who is basically holding the forces of chaos at bay and who really is trying to rule the country in the way that he sees as just and fair , even if apparently the public does not . MANN : Atika Shubert live in London , thanks very much . And so President Hosni Mubarak is under pressure from his own people there , demonstrators in the streets of his capital . He has fired his cabinet but he 's now hired a vice president for first time in 30 years in power , a trusted figure within the regime , a man with a background in solving the president 's problems . We 'll be back with more right after this .

NEW : Saudi Arabia 's stock market drops over 6 % of its value An Israeli Knesset member says Mubarak told him the army was prepared Iranian official says Egypt should abide by ` rightful demands of the nation ' Saudi king says no Muslim can bear `` infilitrators , '' Abbas affirms solidarity Abu Dhabi , United Arab Emirates -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Saudi Arabia slammed protesters in Egypt on Saturday as `` infiltrators '' who seek to destabilize their country , while a a top Palestinian official affirmed `` solidarity '' with Egypt . An official in Iran called on Egypt to `` abide by the rightful demands of the nation '' and avoid violent reactions . And in Israel , a member of the Knesset , or parliament , described a recent conversation with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that suggested that Mubarak had been expecting -- and preparing for -- the wave of unrest that has engulfed Egypt , the most populous Arab nation . Leaders across the Middle East were following events in Egypt with rapt attention Saturday , aided in that endeavor by saturation coverage on Arabic television networks such as Al-Jazeera . Many are on edge after protests in Algeria , Jordan and Yemen following unrest in Tunisia that forced that country 's president from office after two decades in power . In Saudi Arabia , the turmoil in Egypt rattled investors as the nation 's stock market lost over 6 % of its value Saturday . That said , Saudi King Abdullah called Mubarak and `` was reassured '' about the situation in Egypt , the state-run Saudi Press Agency reported . `` During the call , the king said , ` Egypt is a country of Arabism and Islam . No Arab and Muslim human being can bear that some infiltrators , in the name of freedom of expression , have infiltrated into the brotherly people of Egypt , to destabilize its security and stability and they have been exploited to spew out their hatred in destruction , intimidation , burning , looting and inciting a malicious sedition , ' '' the news agency said . At a glance : Nations facing unrest Saudi Arabia `` strongly condemns '' the protest , it said . Mubarak assured the Saudi king `` that the situation is stable '' and that the protests `` are merely attempts of groups who do not want stability and security for the people of Egypt , but rather they seek to achieve strange and suspicious objectives . '' Mubarak added that Egypt will `` deter anyone who tries to exploit the freedom of -LRB- the -RRB- Egyptian people and will not allow anyone to lure those groups or use them to achieve suspicious and strange agendas , '' the news agency said . Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called Mubarak and `` affirmed his solidarity with Egypt and his commitment to its security and stability , '' according to the official Palestinian news agency , Wafa . In Iran , meanwhile , Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said Egyptian authorities should respect the demonstrators . `` Iran expects Egyptian officials to listen to the voice of their Muslim people , respond to their rightful demands and refrain from exerting violence by security forces and police against an Islamic wave of awareness that has spread through the country in form of a popular movement , '' the state-run Press TV quoted Mehmanparast as saying . The reactions did not come as a surprise . Iran 's Shiite government has long been at odds with mostly Sunni Saudi Arabia for dominance in the region . In Israel , where the Sabbath lasts through Saturday evening , there was no comment from top officials . But Benjamin Ben Eliezer , a Knesset member , told Israel 's Channel 10 that he recently spoke with Mubarak , who told him that `` this is not Beirut and not Tunis '' and suggested that Egyptian authorities had prepared the army in advance . Ben Eliezer is known to be the Israeli politician with the best personal relationship with Mubarak . Some staff members at the Israel Embassy in Cairo plan to stay in Egypt , but some of their relatives and other Israeli citizens have flown back to Israel , an Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman said . On the streets of Abu Dhabi , CNN spoke with people to gauge their views of the Egyptian demonstrations . `` It 's great that everyone is coming together , '' said Ayat el-Dwary , an Egyptian . `` These are not just one group of people or one faction ... It 's a revolution , absolutely . '' `` Tunis opened the door , '' el-Dwary said , in a reference to protests in Tunisia that ultimately overthrew a government . `` But it was bound to happen -- it was inevitable . Change is coming to Egypt . '' Samar Barakeh , who is Lebanese , said , `` It 's time for them to change their government and they have the right to say whatever they want . '' Fellow Lebanese Antoinet Ghanem said , `` It 's about the whole regime structuring themselves to create more opportunities for these people to realize their ambitions and dreams ... It 's about the people trying to express what they need .

'' Tens of thousands emboldened to join protests Saturday -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Defiance and hope replaced Friday 's scenes of widespread chaos and violence in Cairo on Saturday but at least five people were reported dead in clashes between police and protesters outside the Interior Ministry building . CNN 's Ian Lee said a `` firefight '' was going on around the ministry as protesters attempted to charge the building . Lee said he had seen one protester shot in the head as police cordoned off the area and fired shots down side streets . At least five people died from gunshot wounds , according to a physician at a triage center in a Cairo mosque . CNN 's Frederick Pleitgen said the Interior Ministry building was a symbol of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's regime and had become a `` flashpoint '' for confrontations between protesters and security forces . Earlier , tens of thousands of protesters were `` losing their fear '' and taking to the streets in unprecedented numbers , emboldened by rumors that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak may soon step down , Pleitgen said .

'' `` Nothing short of a complete change is what they want , and there are no signs of them dispersing , '' said Pleitgen . On streets where demonstrators had police clashed on Friday , protesters shook hands with soldiers and shouted `` The people and the military , we are one . '' `` What we 've seen from these crowds is an immense respect from the crowd for military members , unlike anything we saw before , '' said Pleitgen . `` If this was a line of police officers and not military members , then certainly you would have violence . '' Thousands marching along the Corniche on the banks of the Nile towards Tahrir Square chanted `` Down with Mubarak ! '' Others shouted `` We are all Egyptians . '' `` There is a very , very large and peaceful movement throughout this country -- something that President Mubarak can not shut his eyes to , '' said Pleitgen . Protests in Alexandria mirrored those in Cairo , according to CNN 's Nic Robertson , with up to 5,000 people marching through Egypt 's second-largest city . Families carrying their children and signs reading `` Get out Mubarak '' and `` Saudi Arabia is waiting for you , you should leave '' walked peacefully past soldiers . `` People are very concerned about what happens next , they 're concerned about the violence , '' reported Robertson from Alexandria . `` What we 're seeing is an effort to maintain the momentum , but the volatility does n't match what we saw on Friday .

Egypt will never go back to what it was yesterday . Tomorrow , we will wake up to a new and different Egypt . What will that Egypt look like ? It is likely the beginning of the end for one of the longest serving authoritarian regimes -- as well as one of the most closely allied with the United States . The implications of such a shift , even if it does n't produce an outright revolution , are considerable . The regime of President Hosni Mubarak tried everything . It took the unprecedented step of blocking internet and cell phone service , stripping Egyptians of the ability to communicate with each other in the most basic ways . Police have fired on protesters with rubber bullets . They 've beaten them and sprayed tear gas . But , remarkably , the protests only seemed to grow . This is what a revolution looks like : Protestors overwhelming police ; everyday , ordinary citizens taking to the streets for the first time . It may get messier still . What happens if police forces or the army decide to use live ammunition ? What happens if protestors overtake a number of government buildings ? Already , the Egyptian regime has effectively lost control of parts of its own territory . It is worth remembering that revolutions do not happen overnight . The question , then , is whether protesters can sustain their momentum over a longer period of time . Similarly , can the Egyptian regime sustain weeks or months of protests that effectively shut down the country ? Tourism , one of Egypt 's most important industries , will suffer . Already , the stock market is in free fall . The streets of Cairo have become a war zone , complete with Molotov cocktails and broken barricades . Considering the costs , the regime has little choice but to move quickly to offer concessions to the people , in the form of more jobs , more freedoms and a more honest government . Along these lines , the Obama administration urged the Mubarak regime to take these events as an opportunity to institute long-needed reforms . This might seem a prudent course . But , as the protesters have made clear , they do n't want a better regime . They want a different regime .

RANDI KAYE , CNN ANCHOR : Good morning . I 'm Randi Kaye at CNN World Headquarters . Welcome to our international viewers and Jonathan Mann joining us this hour . JONATHAN MANN , CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR : Randi amazing images coming out of Egypt . And amazing developments we 've heard about a new vice president . And now the latest reports we have just moments ago , a new prime minister . In the meantime , darkness is falling . And demonstrators are still in the streets demanding historic change . They seem to be coming in waves , ignoring the government-ordered curfew . The military and police , we should make clear , they are also out in full force . And we have been hearing gunfire near a key government building . KAYE : Earlier in the day , state-run TV reported Egypt 's government officially resigned . President Mubarak said he 's putting together a new cabinet now . But protesters want him out as well , they want him to go . At least 38 people are reported dead now including 10 security forces . MANN : We 're also seeing demonstrations in support of Egypt 's protesters in cities around the globe . People are -- are -- seeing this -- some people and being moved by what they see from Beirut to London , Montreal and Washington . KAYE : Events are changing fast and CNN has it all covered for . You we have correspondents on the ground in Cairo and Alexandria , Egypt . We 're also monitoring places like Jerusalem and Washington . We have the whole region covered with our correspondents and our cameras . So stay with us all day as we watch and analyze all of this as it happens . MANN : Now , let 's get to the capital Cairo and CNN 's Frederik Pleitgen . KAYE : Fred , we are being told that a new vice president has been appointed and also a new prime minister . Before we get to the new prime minister , what can you tell us about Omar Suleiman and how he 's viewed there in Egypt , this new vice president that we 're expecting will be sworn in here shortly . FREDERIK PLEITGEN , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , we -- we know very little about this man . But we do know that he 's apparently a very trusted person by Hosni Mubarak . So certainly this is probably something that 's not going to make very many people here on the ground very happy . This is not something that looks like fundamental change . This is someone who has served the president very well . He 's from the intelligence community here in Egypt . So certainly someone who is very much trusted and very much part of the old guard here in Egypt . Let me tell you what 's going on , on the streets as we still have a lot of protesters out here . As you said , they 've been ignoring the curfew by and large , so they 're still out here in force . Right now in front of our building it 's not as many as it was during the daylight hours . Night is sort of falling here right now . We are , however , hearing of widespread looting , especially on the outskirts of Egypt . We 're getting a lot of calls here to our bureau -- bureau by people who are very , very worried telling us that there are gangs out on the streets who are looting property . There 's people out there who are banding together to try to stop those gangs . But all in all , people here are very afraid for the property and very afraid in fact for their safety because one of the things that we 've been talking about that 's basically happened is that the police have vanished off the streets of Cairo , by and large . And right now there does n't seem to be much in the way of public order except , of course , for places at our office building where you have the military out in force . But of course they ca n't be everywhere . And therefore right now it is still a very volatile and very much a -- a situation that 's in flux , if you will . KAYE : And -- and Fred , I -- I 'm not sure how far you are from the interior ministry , but we -- we were speaking with Ian Lee there earlier and he was reporting gunfire to us , several people shot . And quite a scene there as protesters , he said , were storming the interior ministry and -- and getting into quite a scuffle with police as police were opening fire on them . Do you have any updates on that situation ? PLEITGEN : That 's also one of those situations . It 's very , very difficult to get any verifiable information on that situation . What we 're hearing from people there who are close to that area is that there is a large protest at the interior ministry , that there is apparently violence at the interior ministry . It appears as though , there 's interior ministry possibly police personnel inside that building , guarding the building and sort of shielding the building trying to get people to -- or trying to stop people from getting in that building . I 'm hearing from people that there are snipers on the roof of that building who are shooting at people . This is stuff that we have n't been able to verify independently . But it certainly is from people who we trust very much who are giving us this information . So certainly the interior ministry seems to be one of those flashpoints . And I can tell you that the interior minister of this country or now the former interior minister was -- of course one of the most despised people here in the country simply because the police force here -- here in Egypt is -- is so very hated by so many people because so many people had witnessed and have been subject to police brutality that this ministry is certainly one of the flashpoints here in the city and -- and indeed here in this country . MANN : Now Fredrick , obviously , this is far from over , but already there has been an enormous human cost . We 've seen reports of hundreds of people in hospital , dozens dead . What can you tell us about those who have been hurt , those who have been killed and those who have been taken under arrest ? PLEITGEN : Well , we do know that there 's some sort of makeshift center being set up in some places to treat people who have been injured and people are trying to get treatment . Other people are telling us that after they were arrested by police , that they were beaten by police officers , something people held for two days or so . So certainly , you 're absolutely right , there has been a very high toll not just of course in deaths but also in people who are injured and wounded in the fighting in recent days . -LRB- AUDIO GAP -RRB- that there were a lot of people who seem to be wounded . Some of them lightly , some of them more heavily in part by tear gas and in part because they were hit by tear gas canisters , in part because they got shot -- they got hit in the head . So certainly this is something where a lot of people have gotten hurt so far . So you 're absolutely right . This has already taken a very , very large toll -LRB- ph -RRB- not just here to Cairo but of course , also in other places across the country -- Jonathan . MANN : Frederik Pleitgen reporting to us live . And we want to bring you the latest developments now . Amid Shafiq we know has been appointed to form the new Egyptian government . Egyptian state TV , NOW TV said Shafiq has been serving as civil aviation minister . And so after the president dramatically fired his government and appointed a new vice president for the first time in his regime choosing what sounds like a technocrat to form the next government . Civil aviation is not traditionally one of the key posts where you 've made a lot of powerful enemies in a government like that . KAYE : So what do you make of this , when you have now -- he 's -- he 's now appointed a -- a prime minister and a vice president . Should we read into this ? MANN : It sounds like he 's not going away any time soon . It 's hard to tell . All of this is mystifying people around the world . And I -- I 'm -- I 'm no visionary , but the extraordinary thing is Hosni Mubarak had a chance to leave easily and quickly . He 's clearly not doing that . He seems to be doing what he told his people he would , assembling a government and remember in that -- in that speech he gave to the -- to the Egyptian people , he said , `` That he was responsible for the stability of his country '' . What we now know is that the vice president , the first vice president in 30 years of the Mubarak regime is a figure who has been responsible for suppressing this dissent and suppressing violence and suppressing opposition . KAYE : And part of Mubarak 's inner circle . The man who trust very few has now brought even closer . KAYE : Well , we will continue to follow this . We 'll take a quick break . KAYE : Welcome back , 12 minutes past the hour . More rage in the streets of Egypt . Anti-government protesters are there . You 're looking at some video of some of the protesters who are still out in the streets in full force today . Anti-government demonstrations are in their fifth day . This hour , protesters are defying a curfew . The state-run Nile TV reports at least 38 deaths in those protests . A doctor in Cairo is reporting that at least five people have died from gunshot wounds near the Egyptian interior ministry . We 've spoken with several eyewitnesses in that area , one who had seen two people actually shot by police there . One grazed in the head and a very graphic description of a man spitting out blood . Earlier state TV reported President Hosni Mubarak 's cabinet resigned . That move hours after the Egyptian leader promised reforms in an address to the nation . Reports from Saudi Arabia say that King Abdullah called Mr. Mubarak to say he stands with the embattled Egyptian president . We should also mention that -- that Hosni Mubarak has also appointed a vice president , Omar Suleiman , who has been described to us as a -- as a bit of a thug but well-respected in that region . A fixer , if you will , one of the world 's most powerful spy chiefs . And he has also appointed a new prime minister . So two new cabinet members . The prime minister being -- who is once served as civil aviation minister according to Egyptian state TV and Nile TV . MANN : Intriguing appointments . He 's appointed his spy chief to help him and he 's also taken someone from the ranks of the air force because Ahmed Shafiq spent decades as a courier air force man . That is of course , Hosni Mubarak 's own background . So he 's not reaching out to new people , as best we can tell . But Jonathan Alterman has followed all of this . And the events in Egypt closely , he joins us now to talk about what 's ahead . What do you make of these appointments ? JON ALTERMAN , CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES : Well , you know , Omar Suleiman , in many ways is Hosni Mubarak 's comfort zone . The way he got close to Hosni Mubarak is in the 1995 assassination attempt in Addis Ababa . He protected the president . He 's been close to the president since 1995 . He 's the guy who makes everything that the president needs to have work , work . So he 's very important with security relationship with the United States . He 's very important in Egypt 's relations with Hamas and with Israel . He runs a lot of the domestic intelligence and security services . He 's the person Hosni Mubarak is most comfortable with . He has no question -- Hosni Mubarak has no question Omar Suleiman is not going to try to push him out . He 's going to defend Hosni Mubarak . MANN : And he already has because we can describe him as a trusted confidante , as a problem-solver , as a fixer . This is not a man with a gentle past . This is a man who put down the Islamists who are threatening this regime and that was a fairly bloody bit of work . ALTERMAN : Not only that but he 's also a person , he does n't like the spotlight . He does n't want to be in the press . It 's actually hard to find a picture of Omar Suleiman . I met him once in a sort of strange situation . But he is not somebody who wants to be the president of Egypt . He 's somebody who wants to protect the president of Egypt . He wants to protect the military government in Egypt . And that 's the kind of person Hosni Mubarak wants at his side at this time of tremendous uncertainty . KAYE : As we watch the uncertainty continue and the protests continue on the streets , Jonathan , what will these new appointments mean to ordinary Egyptians who are there fighting for their rights , fighting for jobs , fighting for economic security ? ALTERMAN : Yes , I think what this suggests is the president is trying to signal resolve . That he 's not going to make what he sees as the mistake that Ben Ali made in Tunisia that you try to concede and actually a day after Ben Ali tried to give conciliatory speech he was on a plane out of the country . I do think though that this has to be understood as the beginning of the final act of Hosni Mubarak 's presidency . There are presidential elections slated for next fall . I can not imagine that Hosni Mubarak will run in those elections . I think what we 're looking at is some transition . And the issue here is really is Egypt 's political future going to be a continuation of the military establishment essentially running the country in a civilian guise or is that all in doubt and then nobody has any idea what would be there ? And as I read the quotations in all the newspaper articles that I read in the last several days , I do n't really sense that Egyptians are clamoring for democracy in elections . I sense what they 're clamoring for is better results . The bet that Hosni Mubarak is making , that Omar Suleiman are going to be making is that if the military closes ranks and supports the president and talks about working that transition , that they can have a guided transition away from Hosni Mubarak instead of a chaotic one . KAYE : And of course , a lot of people are still wondering how all of this , as it unfolds , whether it gets better or worse , is going to affect the global markets . What 's your take on that ? ALTERMAN : Well , it 's very early to tell partly because I think the most important decisions are going to be the decisions made over the next nine to 12 months about what is the future government of Egypt going to look like , who is going to be in and who is going to be out and how is Egypt going to relate to others in the region ? Is it still going to be as strong an ally as it has been to the United States for the last 30 years . I sense there 's going to be some jitteriness now and certainly if Hosni Mubarak goes down in flames -- and I think that 's probably not especially likely , but it 's possible , then that would create a huge sense of uncertainty throughout the Middle East . It would also create uncertainty in Israel . And then Israel would be much more likely to take unpredictable unilateral action which would create greater instability in the Middle East . KAYE : All right . Jonathan Alterman for us . Thank you so much for your insight . MANN : Hosni Mubarak says he 's staying , and now he has help . Two new figures emerge from the chaos in Cairo . We 'll be back with more right after this . MANN : Well , tens of thousands of Egyptians want Hosni Mubarak to leave the presidency , but at least two men have signed on to help him stay . KAYE : They want to be a part of it . MANN : We have word that Ahmed Shafiq has been appointed as the new prime minister of Egypt and Omar Suleiman has been appointed vice president for the first time in three decades of Mubarak 's rule . KAYE : Two men with some interesting history there as well . MANN : Interesting history and contacts around the world which brings us now to Elise Labott in Washington for more on State Department reaction . Suleiman , in particular is well-known to diplomats around the world , well-known to America . ELISE LABOTT , CNN SENIOR U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT PRODUCER : That 's right , Jon ; really well-known to the U.S. ; really one of the main interlocutors between the U.S. State Department , intelligence agencies and the White House . We just spoke to State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley who told CNN that he 's someone we know well and have worked closely with . Our focus is putting concrete reactions behind Mubarak . Words , we believe Egypt needs a meaningful process that leads to genuine reform . And I spoke to another official just a short time ago that said , we like him very much , but it 's not about personalities . It 's about policies . The U.S. really wants to see over the next couple of days , they 're not expecting instantaneous results , but they want to see President Mubarak really reach out and make a meaningful set of reforms that he can demonstrate to his people that he hears them , what 's going on in the streets . MANN : Elise , can I ask you a basic undiplomatic question ? Does the Obama administration want to see Hosni Mubarak hang on ? Do they want to see him remain as president of Egypt ? LABOTT : Well , I keep hearing this phrase , managed change . And I think Jon Alterman had it about right . They want to see a process -- political process where people are brought in , a national dialogue , if you will , going beyond the elites , talking about job creation , talking about how to alleviate some of the social and economic frustrations in the country . I think they 'd like to see him go , but at some point , because obviously they 've been working closely with him , but he 's frustrated them on a lot of issues including human rights , but they do n't know who is going to come next . And so they want to see a process where maybe lift a state of emergency , there are elections in September . If you can see a process where a genuine opposition with a face , with a name , specific candidates maybe could run in the September election . I think they 'd like to see Mubarak gradually phase out . But right now they do n't know who comes next , that 's a very scary proposition for the United States . So I keep hearing that phrase , managed change . Not right now , I do n't think they want to see him go , but ultimately they would like to see a more democratic face in Egypt . MANN : Elise Labott in Washington . Thanks you very much . KAYE : This uprising in Egypt is not a surprise to our next guest . Aladdin Elaasar is the author of `` The Last Pharaoh : Mubarak and the uncertain future of Egypt in the Obama age . '' Aladdin also ran against President Mubarak in the 2005 election . MANN : He joins us now live from Chicago . Aladdin , you not only predicted a revolt against Mubarak but you also believe his regime will fall . Is this what 's going to do it ? Are we watching this happen now ? ALADDIN ELAASAR , AUTHOR , `` THE LAST PHARAOH '' : Well , I was not surprised to see that all happen and unfold . I was not surprised either to see Omar Suleiman to be appointed as the vice president because I talked about that in my book and I have predicted that . I predicted several scenarios that could unfold . This is all too similar . And the thing that is not about Omar Suleiman as a fixer , as a consigliore -LRB- ph -RRB- , but it 's about what the Egyptian people want . The people on the street , they simply want Mr. Mubarak out , his regime , his party , people , his family , all of these symbols . MANN : Let me jump in . Is that what they 're going to get ? MANN : Is that what they 're going to get ? All hope aside , let me ask you this . Just look at what 's going to unfold in the next several days and tell us what you expect . ELAASAR : Well , I do not think that these demonstrations will go away very soon because they have very specific demands . And these are very young people , about 60 percent of the Egyptian population who are educated , a lot of them unemployed . They can not get married , there 's a housing crisis . They live with their families . So they have a lot of anger and frustration and hopelessness . So they have specific demands . And they said it loud and clear that they want President Mubarak out . I would not be surprised either to see that all of that will not happen and will not succeed to appease the Egyptian people and Mr. Mubarak would be stepping down because already some members of his family headed for London since the last few days , even some of the heads of the regime . They know that their days are numbered . We 're seeing the same that 's been happening in Tunisia . And we are failing again , once again , to read the writing on the wall . We failed to learn the lessons of Iran 30 years ago or Marcos in the Philippines , Suharto in Indonesia that military dictators -- dictators will inevitably fall . And we have to talk to the people . We have n't been talking to the Egyptian people . They need to see strong messages from us . MANN : We 're doing our best to talk to them now . And they 're certainly being heard . Thank you very much . And just a quick point to make , Randi , before we go . He talked about a report that we 've been seeing that some of the figures close to Mubarak personally , some members of his family -- we 've been seeing all kinds of rumors -- have started turning up in other places . MANN : We 're trying very hard to find out if that 's true . We do not know that that 's the case . You may be seeing these kinds of rumors on the Internet . People being spotted in airports and other countries ; we 're trying very hard because those would be important signals if they were accurate . We simply do not know . KAYE : We also do n't know where Hosni Mubarak is , not only his family but also where he is . We 'll continue to stay on top of that and everything else . We are watching our correspondents . We have cameras all over the region and we 'll be right back . MANN : Welcome back . Let 's update you now on the latest out of Egypt , a country very much in crisis as protests continue there for a fifth consecutive day . There is also a major government change to tell you about . Egyptian state television reporting that Omar Suleiman , the head of Egypt 's Intelligence Service , has been appointed vice president , and a minister from the recently dismissed cabinet , Ahmed Shafiq , has been appointed to form a new government as prime minister . That word coming as well from state TV . KAYE : And we have correspondents , as we 've mentioned , all over the region , all over Egypt . Nic Robertson is in Alexandria , Egypt , for us . Nic , we 've heard so many reports of violence this morning , and shooting as well . What is the situation in Alexandria ? NIC ROBERTSON , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : It 's still a fluid situation . It 's been a relatively peaceful situation through the day . There are army on the streets . Thousands of people have been protesting . Behind me , you 're looking along the Cornish area , the road that runs along by the side of the Mediterranean . Just a few minutes ago , a couple of army personnel carriers , armored personnel carriers , raced along there , heading away somewhere else . We could n't tell where . They 've been posted around the city , keeping security on some of the government institution buildings here in the city . Fifteen minutes ago we heard gunshots being fired off in this direction over here . We have n't heard any more gunshots since then . Today , however , the tone has been a very solid tone of get rid of President Mubarak . But the tone has also been a relatively peaceful one . But the crowds are still out . And about a half an hour ago , I just looked over the balcony here and there was some shouting going on . And I could see the crowds dragging away a man from the street . And they had their arm around his neck , in a neck lock . It was n't clear where this mob was taking him away to but , clearly , whatever he 'd been doing , they were certainly very angry with -- Randi . KAYE : And from what you 've seen in terms of the anger on the street , as we get word of a new prime minister and a new vice president , how do you think that will be received among the protesters on the street ? Will that be enough ? ROBERTSON : Among the protesters we 've been talking to , the vast majority are going to reject these picks , because they see them as part of the system , as part of the apparatus of President Mubarak 's regime . And for that reason , they will probably say that they do n't want them , they reject this idea , they want a fresh start . However , there are quieter voices on the sides -- on the margins of the demonstrations here . And they 've been saying , look , President Mubarak said out with the old government , I 'll bring in a new one . And people were saying , look , we 're very worried about what 's going to happen . We do n't want a return to violence here , we 're worried about where all these street protests will lead us to , perhaps it 's better to let this new government be formed and see how that is . But the people saying that , I do have to say , seem to be in the minority . The majority are looking for a clean sweep of the leadership -- on the streets here , if you will . These politicians have been part of President Mubarak 's regime . Who is going to explain to these angry people that these new leaders who are part of the old system are going to be better for them ? And it 's not clear at the moment how that 's going to happen . So I think we can expect to hear challenges even to these early picks . KAYE : All right . Nic Robertson for us in Alexandria , one of the many correspondents that we have in that area covering this crisis for us as it unfolds . We 'd like to take you to Cairo now , where our Ivan Watson is standing by . And Ivan , can you tell us what you were able to gather from the events as they unfolded at the Interior Ministry , where we understand that several people were shot , and tell us what you witnessed ? IVAN WATSON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : That 's right . Randi , what we saw was on the doorstep of a mosque a few blocks away from the Interior Ministry . There was a makeshift clinic set up . And we were watching young men come in , in shock , and their faces started to turn green from loss of blood after just having been shot . Some of the bystanders said that these were plastic or rubber bullets . And they 're right on the scene there amid the prayer mats outside the mosque . Doctors in dirty , bloody lab coats were swabbing these puncture wounds I saw , some in one man 's stomach . Another young man had been shot in the hand and was getting bandaged there . And one of the doctors there , he said that since about 3:00 in the afternoon , and at 6:30 local time here , over the course of about three hours , they had treated some 60 people with these kinds of presumably plastic rubber bullet wounds . In addition to that , Randi , we saw another man wrapped in an Egyptian flag with his feet bound , apparently the body of a man being carried through the streets by a chanting crowd . And a weeping man there telling us that he had been , in fact , shot and killed by the Interior Ministry . I got a lot of warnings from bystanders saying do not go too close up , there are snipers on the roofs there -- Randi . MANN : Ivan , it 's Jonathan Mann . Just to be very clear about this , as best you know , this challenge , this fight for the Interior Ministry , is it still ongoing ? WATSON : Hard for us to tell . We did hear what sounded like a few gunshots within the last 10 minutes , and I have heard at least one other burst of gunshots over the course of the last three to four hours there . I have to point out , I was n't able to get close to that building , but one man , after hearing some of these claims coming from -- I saw at least four young men with these kinds of injuries , Jon . Another man said , `` Listen , the people in the Interior Ministry are afraid of the crowd , and they 're just trying to defend themselves from when the mob gets too close to their building . '' So two different versions of what may be happening there . But there 's no question that amid the scenes of elation , Jon , that we 've seen , truly a festive atmosphere in the square just a few blocks from the Interior Ministry . We 've also had very bloody clashes going on , and a number of injuries , as well as at least one death . KAYE : Yet , despite the blood , Ivan , despite the shooting , despite the tear gas , these protesters do n't seem to be giving up . In fact , they seem to be growing stronger . Is that how it appears to you ? It 's really remarkable . And we are hearing about clashes in one place -- area , Randi , but I have to say , for the most part , it is the people in the streets who appear to be in charge . They 're climbing on to the Egyptian military 's tanks . They 're riding around on them , cheering , embracing the soldiers , praying next to the soldiers ' tanks . And they 're cheering . And it 's a curious combination , Randi , of elation -- elation at being free and being able to say things that people have n't been able to say in a long time . And also real hatred for the Egyptian regime . So when I ask people , are they angry , you kind of get a mix of , `` Yes , I 'm furious at this government , I want Hosni Mubarak to go . '' And then they say , `` But I 'm so proud to be an Egyptian because I finally get to stand up and be proud to speak my own mind . '' KAYE : Ivan Watson for us in Cairo . It 's so great to have you there , Ivan , and really bring us the story as it 's unfolding , along with so many of our other correspondents around the region . We 're going to have to take one very quick break . And we will be right back with the very latest . MANN : Welcome back to our continuing coverage of the upheaval in Egypt . A short time ago , we had one of our reporters say that he spoke with a Muslim cleric who said that protesters were n't following his leadership , they were following the leadership of Facebook . It 's an extraordinary thing . Social media , Facebook included , Twitter have been a galvanizing force in the protests that we 've seen in Egypt . CNN 's Mohammed Jamjoom is following that part of the story for us . Mohammed , what is the latest ? Is social media back up . Is the Internet back up in Egypt ? MOHAMMED JAMJOOM , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Well , Randi , the Internet is still not back up in Egypt , but mobile phone service has been up intermittently throughout the day . And what we 're seeing is a lot of users have been able to use mobile phone networks in order to try to get their messages out on social media . Now , we have seen some new iReports . There 's an iReporter that sent us this video actually close to Jilali -LRB- ph -RRB- Square in Cairo . This is taken from the balcony of a hotel close by . You see all these protesters , many of them looking to be from all ages , lots of different protesters out there in the streets today . If I can take you up to this screen as well , we 're getting tweets now . Yesterday , we were getting very few tweets purportedly out of Cairo . Today , quite a few more . This tweet : `` I know this is farfetched , but if any doctors could help in downtown , a small mosque next to Koshari El Tahrir where injured are kept . '' That 's a plea for help from any doctors that might be in that area . We ca n't verify it , but that 's what this person on Twitter is saying . Here 's another tweet . `` Live rounds litter the ground leading up to the Interior Ministry . Everything on the ground floor looted and trashed . '' `` The biggest crowd to date in Tahrir now huge , bigger than the January 25th sit-in that started it all . Whole families , children . It 's a jubilant atmosphere , '' says this Twitter user . This one , `` Do n't believe the lie . No one in the streets of Egypt was chanting to get Omar Suleiman as president . '' Now , Omar Suleiman was just appointed vice president , not president . But nonetheless , indicative of the mood there , purportedly out of Cairo . And this one , `` The Egyptian people are protecting public and private properties , and organizing traffic and protecting each other . '' Very interesting to see Twitter users , purportedly out of Cairo , now tweeting once more . It will be interesting to see if the Internet is finally back up and running in the next few hours or the next few days to see how much more the traffic increases and what people will be saying , because as you said before , social media has been such a galvanizing force , has been such an integral part of getting people out and into the streets to demonstrate what 's going on in Egypt right now -- Randi . MANN : We 're seeing a lot of this , and we 're grateful for everything we 're learning off of social media . But one question you have to ask is , obviously , we 're reading it , you 're reading it in English . Now , Mohammed , you 're a fluent Arabic speaker , obviously . How different are the messages that are being sent , shared for Arabic speakers ? JAMJOOM : Well , what we 've seen so far , a lot of it has been very similar in sentiment . I mean , there have been a lot of angry tweets with regards to the vice president being appointed . A lot of reaction on social media is that this is n't going to change anything . But as far as the pleas for help , as far as the atmosphere of jubilation , as far as people being happy to be able to tweet and to be able to use social media as a rallying cry , you 're seeing the same sentiment being done in Arabic and English . But it is interesting that you 're seeing so many tweets in English out of Cairo right now -- Jonathan . MANN : Mohammed Jamjoom monitoring the Internet and social media for us . KAYE : You know , it 's so interesting , just quickly , to mention that tweet that he was saying he got about people asking for doctors to help at this mosque in Cairo . That 's actually from CNN 's Mary Rogers -LRB- ph -RRB- , who is there at the scene , who had reported that five people had died from gunshot wounds . Also at that triage center , according to a physician there , also asking for doctors . So it 's amazing how we 're getting it , they 're getting it , it 's all happening and we 're all over it . MANN : And a point to make , we 're following those stories , taking them very seriously . I have been in another context we do n't have to go into where the Red Cross as also getting those tweets . People do take those kinds of messages very seriously , and so social media saves lives in a situation like this . And clearly they needed help , and we 're getting the message out there . Again , a quick break . We 'll be right back . Egypt has a new vice president . Egypt has a new prime minister . But Egypt still has the same man in charge , Hosni Mubarak , and he 's doing his best to hold on while thousands of demonstrators gather in the streets of at least two cities that we 're monitoring closely , demanding he resign . Our extensive coverage is continuing . KAYE : And people in Egypt are really trying to digest all of these changes as it happens . We want to take you to Cairo now , where an Egyptian-American communications consultant , Maha -- we 're not going to use her last name for her safety there . But Maha , if you can , can you tell us a little bit about the mood there and what you 're feeling among the people in Cairo ? MAHA , COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTANT : Well , we 're feeling a level of uncertainty right now , I think . We 're monitoring the situation on television to see scenes of what 's taking place . We 're at home . A lot of my friends are at home . We 've been calling each other today to check on each other to make sure everyone 's OK . We do n't have Internet access , so we 're not able to fully see the scene and understand what 's going on in the world around us , but we do have televisions , we 're able to communicate with friends and family . The situation is that -- we see from the streets -- is that there needs to be kind of a restoration of order . I think the main concern now is that things get under control , that we feel safe , that we feel the streets are under control . There are protesters on the streets , it looks peaceful , but we hear sporadic stories of burglaries and looting and stuff like that . So that makes us uneasy and nervous . But we 're all staying home , we 're all just checking on each other , and we 're monitoring the situation , hoping for calm . MANN : Maha , this is Jonathan Mann . And as we 're talking to you , we 're looking at these extraordinary pictures , these crowds that have gathered along some of the biggest thoroughfares in some of the major squares of Cairo . But I 'm curious about the rest of the city and how ordinary people are getting by . Can you buy milk ? Can your kids go out to play ? Are people talking about what they 're going to do when the workweek starts ? Are they going to go actually try to go to work , as many do on Sunday or Monday ? MAHA : Well , they 've already announced that the banks are closed tomorrow , the central bank is closed tomorrow , and the stock market is closed tomorrow . I advised my staff , we 're obviously not going to work tomorrow . One of my friends tried to go get groceries this morning . She said there was a huge line at one of the main supermarkets and she could n't get what she needed . We 're all staying home . I think on Thursday -- those of us that planned ahead kind of braced ourselves . And I 've never been in a hurricane , but on Friday , yesterday , I kind of felt this is what it 's like , where you brace yourself for a storm , and you just sit and wait . So you ca n't really leave your house , you should n't leave your house . We need to respect that there 's a curfew and it 's there for our safety . And so we 're basically sitting tight and kind of talking to each other and watching what you 're all watching on TV . MANN : I do n't want to put words into your mouth , but it sounds like apart from the scenes we 're seeing , a lot of Cairo would be a ghost town today . I guess some people tried to move around today , and they just said it 's not safe to move around . The main squares and the main areas downtown , they are seeing a lot of foot traffic , and a lot of people are venturing out , I think . I know people are n't able to get to their families in other parts of the towns , so everyone is just staying home . KAYE : All right . Maha , an Egyptian-American in Cairo with some interesting perspective . MANN : Of course the unrest that we 've been watching in Egypt is n't isolated . Over the past few weeks , we 've seen turmoil in several neighboring countries . Tunisia , most notably , but Yemen as well . We 've been following that development , but if you 're just joining us now , let me bring you up to date with what 's going on in Egypt itself . The region is watching nervously because there 's a new prime minister , there 's a new vice president . Hosni Mubarak is trying very hard to stay in power . KAYE : Well , as we 've been mentioning , none of this is isolated . We 've seen problems in other parts of the region . We 're getting some confusing signals there . I just want to make sure we all know where we 're going . But the bottom line is this -- the most powerful Arab nation , a pillar of the region , is now in turmoil . The president is doing his best to hold on , but the rest of the region also is being affected . Egypt 's not isolated . We 've seen the turmoil , and we 're watching it unfold . KAYE : And over the past few weeks we 've seen turmoil in several neighboring countries , as we mentioned , but does that mean that these protests really , throughout the region , are the same ? We 've seen so many different protesters , so we put that question to Josh Levs earlier this morning . JOSH LEVS , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Well , here 's the thing , big picture they kind of are about the same things . But there are specific situations in each country that have gotten a lot of people upset . It 's important to understand these differences , especially as we are seeing all these videos come in . And let 's get back to Egypt for just a second . We 'll take a look at this video . I have been speaking with all these experts on this scene . And all these countries in recent days , the way one expert put it to me , he said they all want the same thing . It 's about inequalities , it is about a lack of opportunities . It is about the rich getting richer . It is about what demonstrators feel is a totalitarian regime , or aspects of a totalitarian regime in each country . And something important to understand here , we were just talking about the make-up of these protests . We do have a lot of people who are middle class ; a lot of educated people , a lot of young educated people . And there is a term that might be new to you all this morning , but it is not new to those who follow revolutions through history . It 's called the blocked elite , Randi . This is a group of people who are educated and believe they should be elite . Because they know how to take on major jobs , they feel they should have major jobs inside their countries . And they feel that what 's been happening is stopping them . They believe it is because of the government . And decisions made from the government are preventing them from more advanced jobs inside of their countries . So -- KAYE : The common theme is really they think they deserve more . They believe they deserve more , they believe that they can play a major role , they believe that economically , they should be at a higher level . And we can quickly show you . I mean , we 've had videos from what 's been going on in Tunisia as well , and then you had smaller protests take place inside Algeria and Yemen . There are specifics scenarios inside each country to keep in mind , and it 's important to mention that . For example , in Algeria and Yemen , you 've had civil wars in the past . So that 's a backdrop , whereas in Tunisia , you have a more of a homogeneous population . All of these affect the way that these rebellions play out , but big picture , Randi , we are looking at a lot of middle class people , a lot of young people who are pushing hard for what they believe is their place in society . KAYE : And as the protests continue in the region and throughout Egypt , we do want to just remind you that we 're now seeing already the cabinet has officially resigned , we have a new vice president in Egypt , apparently going to be sworn in any time now . A new prime minister as well . In terms of numbers , we 're being told that at least 38 are dead . The shootings continue at the Interior Ministry . We have our correspondents spread throughout the region , and we will continue to stay on top of this . MANN : Extraordinary upheaval in a country that had long been considered really one of the most stable in the region , a pillar of Western policy , a close ally of the United States . All of that very much in question . I 'm Jonathan Mann . KAYE : And I 'm Randi Kaye . Thanks for being with us throughout this very busy morning . The news continues after this .

Egyptians and activists around the world took to the streets in various cities Saturday to show their support for the protests currently underway in Egypt and to join the call for President Hosni Mubarak to step down . Outside the Egyptian Embassy in London , people rallied , chanted , hoisted banners and demanded change . One sign , written in red ink , read : `` From The Nile , To the Sea -- Egypt Soon Will Be Free ! Freedom for Egypt ! '' `` People were clearly voicing their anger at President Mubarak 's regime but similarly they were also very passionate about their demands for democracy and political reforms , '' said Amedeo d'Amore , who attended the London protest . Demonstrators chanted : `` One , two , three , four , we do n't want Mubarak anymore ! '' d'Amore said in an e-mail to CNN . Elsewhere in Europe , protesters in Geneva shouted slogans in Arabic , French and English , chanting , `` Get out , Mubarak ! '' according to Courtney Radsch , who attended the demonstration there . Radsch sent CNN a video of the protest that showed a crowd of people carrying signs that read , `` Freedom . Democracy '' and `` Free Egypt . '' Protests also took place in cities throughout Canada . About 150 protesters gathered outside the Egyptian consulate in Montreal , CNN affiliate CTV reported . In Toronto , a downtown rally drew more than 500 people , it said . Ahmed Khalifa , who helped organize the Toronto protest , said he was encouraged by the protests in Egypt and stressed their significance . `` We are witnessing a great change in history , '' he told CTV . `` It 's like the fall of the Berlin Wall .

Mubarak called out the army Friday to help quell the protests The military will play a key role in what happens next In the past , the state-run media have ignored protests or downplayed them Friday , Nile TV showed the clashes but also justified the crackdown -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As mass protests swept Egypt on Friday , the actions of two key institutions served as indicators for what lies ahead for the embattled regime : the military and the media . President Hosni Mubarak deployed the Egyptian army for the first time to the streets to quell angry demonstrations against his authoritarian regime . That 's a sure sign of the government 's desperation , according to experts on the region . And for the first time , the state-run media did n't ignore the unrest or dump on the demonstrations as acts of terrorism in its usual manner . That , too , say experts , was a key indicator that Mubarak could be facing trouble . It 's a given that the military , a pillar of Egyptian authority since a 1952 coup toppled the monarchy , holds the keys at this critical juncture . Many feared that the army will silence the protesters with its firepower and tanks that are now out on the streets of Cairo and Alexandria . But Edward Walker , a former U.S. ambassador to Egypt , said that a military crackdown would be a `` death knell not only to the military but the regime . '' Such a crackdown did n't happen in nearby Tunisia , where the authoritarian ruler fled the nation , and it was hardly what happened in Egypt on Friday . On the contrary , Egypt 's 450,000-strong armed forces are well-established and respected by the people . Journalists reported seeing protesters cheer army convoys as they drove into Cairo and Alexandria . Some embraced the soldiers on the ground ; they were seen as saviors from excessive police brutality . U.S. reacts to Egypt turmoil To Mohammed el-Nawawy , a professor at Queens University in North Carolina , the fact that the military was called out Friday showed that Mubarak was desperate . The all-important question is how loyal the armed forces will remain to the aging leader who has ruled Egypt with an iron fist for three decades . Meanwhile , the state-controlled television network walked a tightrope Friday . Early in the day , Nile TV began showing footage of the demonstrations of `` tens of thousands of people '' and reported the use of police tear gas . It aired opposition leaders criticizing the government for shutting down the lines of communication . Shawn Powers , a Georgia State University assistant professor who studies international media , said it was unusual for an arm of the government to even cover these events or portray them as anything but acts initiated by unsavory elements of society . `` I 'm amazed , '' Powers said of the coverage . Even with social media and mobile phone messaging blocked , Egyptians could see events unfolding live on international networks including CNN . The Egyptian media may have felt that they would lose all credibility with the people if they were to completely distort the story . Egypt : Revolution captured in real time Ultimately , Powers said , he suspected fissures within Mubarak 's ranks and said some in the government may be thinking of their own future in a nation barely holding back from the brink . `` What we 're seeing today is parts of the government feeling increasingly isolated from Mubarak or intentionally doing so to hold on to power after Mubarak goes , '' he said . By the end of the day , however , Nile TV 's coverage shifted , reverting to words like `` hooliganism '' and `` lawlessness '' to describe the demonstrations . El-Nawawy , who has studied Egyptian media in depth , said Friday 's media coverage could mean that Mubarak has no one left to blame , so he gave the protesters , many of whom are young people , a little wiggle room . `` The state media is walking a fine line to give credit to the young people , but in the meantime , it has to justify intervention and crackdown , '' el-Nawawy said . El-Nawawy said things will get really thorny if Egypt 's impoverished masses join hands with the protesters -- believed to be largely from the educated middle classes -- and the demonstrations grow to even more chaotic proportions . That 's when the military and the state-run media will both have to come to terms with events in their country . That 's when Mubarak , el-Nawawy said , may realize that he can shut down Facebook but not the People 's Book .

What 's at stake ? And what will happen next ? We 're on the ground with every angle . It 's Egypt 's crisis . But the world is watching . I 'd like to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world . I 'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington . ISHA SESAY , CNN ANCHOR : And I 'm Isha Sesay in CNN world headquarters . You are looking at live pictures from Cairo where it is now 3:00 in the morning . Well , we begin with this breaking news that we want to bring you . Egypt 's state television channel , Nile TV , is just now reporting several people have been killed in a prison escape in an Egyptian town of Fayoum -- Wolf . BLITZER : The report says a number of prisoners overcame prison security and fired live ammunition at them . An earlier report from Nile TV said approximately 1,000 prisoners escaped onto the highway connecting Fayoum and Cairo , creating a state of fear for families . SESAY : Well , in other news from Egypt , Sunday is expected to see a sixth day of protests against the government of Hosni Mubarak . Right now this is what we know : On CNN early tonight , former U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen warned that Egypt will face a , quote , `` leadership vacuum '' if the Mubarak government falls . While the powerful police have all but abandoned the streets , the army has largely stood by and done nothing . The result , looting . People turned out with sticks and knifes to protect their homes and possessions . Now , in a very unusual joint statement , the leaders of Britain , France and Germany expressed grave concern about the turmoil and caused for the Egyptian government to allow free and fair elections . The cry for freedom and demand for President Mubarak to go rang loud and clear today as tens of thousands of protesters swarmed into the streets of Cairo and other major Egyptian cities adding to a rising death toll . `` Reuters '' now reporting police today shot and killed 17 people trying to attack police stations just south of Cairo . Dozens of people were wounded . CNN 's Ivan Watson has been on the streets of Cairo . He 's joining us now with the latest . Ivan , what is going on ? IVAN WATSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Right now , the center of Cairo is quite calm and sleepy , Wolf . We 're pushing 3:00 in the morning here . And the only noise I 've really heard in the last few hours are the tanks of the army that have been conducting patrols around town . Now , earlier in the day , there were dramatic scenes here , scenes of jubilation from the thousands of people out in the streets cheering . Many of these people could not have done that the previous day because on Friday , there were serious clashes with police in these very streets . But the police force seemed to have evaporated overnight Friday to Saturday and ceded the streets to the demonstrators . Take a listen to what one woman had to say to us . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : What 's happened to our president ? He said , `` I will change everything . '' We do n't want him . He 's the one -- he should go out . We do n't want him here because he 's not responsible about all of this here . The people are poor . One year , I live here . I 'm fed up . It 's difficult for me . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Forty-three years in Saudi Arabia . I feel it 's easy life . Here , it 's very difficult for us . WATSON : Are you happy today ? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I am happy because everybody -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- in here . Before , I thought there is no many -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- in Egypt . Now , when I saw all this , I feel , yes , we can change . We do n't want Hosni Mubarak . We do n't want him . WATSON : And , Wolf , here you have this fascinating contradiction where you have real hatred and loathing for the government of President Hosni Mubarak , who 's been in power for nearly 30 years . And , at the same time , elation and joy , pride even , coming from the fact Egyptians finally are able to express that hatred , have that freedom to really lash out and speak their minds perhaps for the first time for many of them in their lifetime -- Wolf . BLITZER : What do we know , Ivan , about the breaking news that 1,000 , at least several hundred , maybe as many as 1,000 prisoners escaped from that Fayoum prison outside of Cairo and are out on the streets right now ? WATSON : At this predawn stage , we pretty much only have what Nile TV itself has reported , Wolf . As you said about 1,000 people . And that 's going to be very disturbing news for Egyptians who are worried . Not all of the demonstrators -- not all of the Egyptians are demonstrators . I 've spoken to some Egyptians who were quite worried as what they see as a threat of breakdown of law and order . One of the chief fears coming is that , yes , many people do not like the police force here but now that they 're gone , they 're hearing about armed groups or robbers moving around invading houses , looting shops . I 've seen a number of burned and looted shops just within the past 24 hours and some Egyptians who are unable to go back to their homes because of a `` dusk until dawn '' curfew , very worried they can not protect their families at home from any possible thieves , robbers and criminals that may be out there . And a prison break is only going to make that worse . BLITZER : Yes , it 's a dangerous situation all around . Ivan , we 'll stay in close touch . Be careful over there . SESAY : Well , Wolf , in the port city of Alexandria , what started as relatively calm protests grew much more intense . CNN 's senior international correspondent Nic Robertson has been in the thick of things on the ground . NIC ROBERTSON , CNN SR. . INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : It 's almost getting to be nightfall here in Alexandria now . The people are very clear in what they 're saying . They want President Mubarak to go . They said , if he got any honor and dignity , then leave . And they 're also saying , if you want to leave , then go to Saudi Arabia . It 's waiting for you . This is the message the people are saying . I 'm making a report right now . We 're making a video report right now . What do you want to say ? ROBERTSON : So , you think he 's going to stay ? He can not have a curfew . We are staying here . ROBERTSON : So , you 're hearing it -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE : He 's not the president anymore . So , you 're hearing it from the streets right here . He 's challenged the people by saying he 'll stay -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE : He wants to calm us down . ROBERTSON : He wants to calm you down . ROBERTSON : By saying that he will stay . ROBERTSON : That 's not calming you down . And that 's what we 're seeing here . People angry and they 're saying right now that he must go . Our national security analyst Peter Bergen is here once again with his take on five straight days of violent protests across Egypt . Why do you think the police , for all practical purposes , have abandoned their post ? The military is still involved . But he police which these protesters despise , they simply disappeared . PETER BERGEN , CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST : I think the word `` despise '' is the important one . I think that they understand that they 're held in great disdain by their own population for very good reason . Wolf , you may recall that there was a widely circulated videotape of a group of police officers sodomizing somebody who just was involved in a traffic accident . This circulated on the Internet . This kind of material has obviously turned the population even more against the security forces for whom they 've long had a disdain for . They know that the security forces have tortured literally thousands of people almost on every given year . The State Department releases a report excoriating the Egyptian security -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- , this treatment of their own people , who are tortured for almost any reason . If you go into -- there is no forensic techniques other than beating people up in these police stations . BLITZER : Can the Mubarak government survive right now ? We know a new vice president was named today ; a new prime minister was named today . Both with heavy military backgrounds . Can this government of President Mubarak -- can he survive ? BERGEN : Personally , I do n't think so . But history has a way of surprising us and revolutions are inherently unpredictable . You know , he might be able to manage his departure in such a way that it is n't , you know , on a plane to exile very quickly . Obviously , he retains -- seems to retain some kind of hold over the military . But , you know , frankly , wolf , I have no idea . And no one else really does . It 's a very fluid situation as the State Department likes to say right now . But there 's this weird picture that we see , these demonstrators out there , and they 're almost celebrating together with soldiers on tanks , armored vehicles . It 's as if they are one . At least some of those pictures . BERGEN : There 's a good reason that the Egyptian military is held in pretty high esteem . I mean -- BLITZER : As opposed to the police . BERGEN : As opposed to the police . I mean , this is , you know , the army has done relatively well on occasion against Egypt 's enemies . Of course , Mubarak himself comes out of a military background . This -- you know , the officer class enjoys a certain privilege , a place in Egyptian society , and is n't seen to be part of cracking down on the population . BLITZER : There you see pictures of some of the demonstrators on a tank , on an Egyptian military tank . All right , stand by . We 're going to get back to you , Peter Bergen . SESAY : Well , Wolf , the big question many are considering now is could Egyptians be near their breaking point ? An Egyptian student living here in the United States gives me his reaction to what he 's seeing in his homeland . Get out , Mubarak . Get out of Egypt . We do n't -- we do n't need you . We do n't -- we do n't want you in Egypt . BLITZER : The protests are spreading beyond the streets of Egypt . We watched rallies all over the world today . First , New York City , hundreds demonstrated outside the United Nations in support of the uprising . Emotions ran high but the protests remained peaceful . Here in Washington protesters , many Egyptian-American filled the streets in front of the Egyptian embassy . Demonstrators also criticized President Obama 's response . In Atlanta , across from the CNN global headquarters , more than 100 demonstrators chanted and waved signs saying stop supporting the dictator . And in London hundreds outside Egypt 's embassy . Actually , there were two protests , Islamists on one demonstration , and around the corner , a secular protest . SESAY : Well , you 've seen the images , the protesters , their faces , but who are they ? We 're taking a closer look . They are the young . The median age in Egypt is just 24 . Many are highly educated with advanced degrees . Well , despite that , though , they are unemployed or underemployed . According to the U.N. , Egypt 's per capita income is $ 1,800 a year . The official unemployment rate last year was 7.9 percent . But experts are saying the real jobless rate is significantly higher . All of those factors created a volatile situation . Many different Egyptian students right here in the U.S. are keeping a very close eye on the protests , knowing that their friends are among those on the streets . Sherif Morad is a PhD student at Georgia Tech and I 'm pleased to say he joins us now . Thanks so much for joining us this evening . I want to start with a very basic question of how you are feeling seeing these scenes play out in Egypt , your home ? SHERIF MORAD , GEORGIA TECH GRADUATE STUDENT : Well , basically , of course , the situation today is very chaotic . Of course , as you know in the whole country . The problem is the people who are let out of the prisons are doing a lot of looting , of course , across the nation . The issue here , of course , we feel a lot of anger . We feel there 's a lot of chaos going on . We 're still proud , though , of the Egyptian people and what they have accomplished to get their freedom , trying to get real democracy . SESAY : You touched on this issue of the fear , the anxiety and the looting . Have you been able to make contact with family and friends ? What are they telling you about the situation ? MORAD : Yes , actually my parents , they live in the district in Cairo . Stories from there are that people are trying to do a lot of vandalism and theft across the district and people who are trying to -- the neighbors and the whole -- in their district where the men were down the streets carrying basic , you know , stones or whatever they could get just to protect those homes from getting stolen . After that the army came and took over . SESAY : I spoke to someone early on today who said to me the issue with the young people in Egypt is that they have no dreams . No dreams that can be achieved . Explain for our viewers here in the U.S. and around the world what the heart of the matter is here that is driving these people out on the streets , creating these scenes that we 're seeing . MORAD : Well , basically , of course , you hear about poverty , unemployment and other issues , but the real thing at stake here is basic human rights , freedom , democracy . That 's the thing that is at stake . And the people when they want change right now , they need the change that is not only change of cabinet . It 's not a change of another ministry . It 's not getting your vice president . It 's not getting a vice president from the same regime . SESAY : So , you do n't think this move of appointing Omar Suleiman is something significant ? MORAD : Not to the people . They are not convinced that a vice president from the same regime can do any good . The prime minister can not do any good . He 's from the same regime . They want a change of the whole regime , and they want to express their free will basically . SESAY : What is your sense about where the Mubarak regime stands now in light of these protests ? Is this the beginning of the end or is that really wishful thinking ? MORAD : Well , in a way , it is wishful thinking because now that he has -- that Mubarak has tightened the security , providing a government that is very security oriented , a vice president that is not so lovable in the country , being part of the regime . So , personally , I think it 's the beginning of the end . SESAY : If you were in Egypt right now , would you be on the streets ? SESAY : You would be joining these people in these scenes ? And I want to mention here that a lot of people have been talking about who are these protesters , what category -- what social category are they coming from ? Is this Muslim Brotherhood ? Is this -- whatever movement ? No , it 's just basically Egyptian people just wanting their free will , wanting democracy and getting out there to express it . SESAY : Is there a discussion among people like yourself who are here and hopefully being able to communicate with people back in Egypt as to what a post-Mubarak regime would look like ? Because there are fears in the U.S. as to what could fill that vacuum . Do you share those fears ? MORAD : In a way , yes . But , of course , change in itself is the goal right now . Getting a regime that really responds to people , getting a parliament that is really representative of the people . That 's really missing right now . So , we need fair elections . We need basic human rights . We need to get rid of the emergency law . We need a lot of things that -- plus , we have sort of achieved and we are reaching out . The Egyptian people are urging the international community to feel that this country is , as any other country , there 's a people that has to express its needs . Of course , looking at the future seems -- now it seems very chaotic , it seems very dark . But there is light at the end of the tunnel . SESAY : Sharif Morad joining us here at CNN headquarters , we really appreciate your time and your insight . Wolf , you hear Sharif saying that there is light at the end of the tunnel . That is the hope of many people that they will see change there in Egypt , Wolf . BLITZER : He makes excellent points there . Thank you very much , Isha . By day , \\ tens of thousands are turning out to protest . By night , they 're mourning the dead , treating their wounds and gathering strength . What started this whole uprising ? That 's coming up next . SESAY : I want to welcome our viewers here in the United States and right around the world . Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is facing the greatest threat ever to his 30-year regime and is struggling to maintain his hold on the government and regain control of the country . Here 's the status right now of this extremely fast-moving , highly volatile situation . Tens of thousands of anti-government protesters again swarmed into the streets of Cairo and other cities demanding that Mubarak step down . `` Reuters '' news agency is reporting that police today shot and killed 17 protesters trying to attack two police stations south of Cairo . Dozens of people were wounded . The army , well , they have taken up positions in the streets acting on orders from Mubarak . But so far , the military has n't cracked down on protesters . Also , we should tell you that Nile Television is reporting that several people were killed today when some 1,000 inmates escaped from a prison southwest of Cairo . Eyewitnesses of some Cairo neighborhoods report residents armed with sticks , kitchen knifes , other weapons they 've been able to get their hands on are trying to protect homes and businesses from looters . BLITZER : Thanks , Isha . Take a look at this raging protest filled the streets of Egypt 's second largest in Alexandria , demanding that the president , Hosni Mubarak , give up his 30-year reign of power . Many among the tens of thousands say they were inspired by demonstrators in Tunisia who forced their longtime president out of the country . But is that the only driving force in Egypt ? Let 's assess what 's going on with Shibley Telhami . He 's a senior fellow at the Saban Center for Mideast Policy , the Brookings Institute . He 's the author of the important book , `` The Stakes : America in the Middle East , '' and he 's the Anwar Sadat professor at the University of Maryland . Shibley , thanks very much for coming in . If Mubarak goes and a lot of experts say eventually he will . It could be days , weeks , months . SHIBLEY TELHAMI , SABEN CENTER FOR MIDEAST POLICY : Well , obviously , it will be uncertain . But if you look in the past and we have never had an uprising of this scale in Egypt in any recorded history . I mean , if you look at 20th century , even the major anarchy in 1952 was relatively orderly led by the military . So , this is really extraordinary . And we all should be very modest in what we can predict , and let 's face that . BLITZER : So , a lot of us were stunned to see the speed with which all of this has developed . TELHAMI : We were stunned and it 's a leaderless movement . We are not talking about this being led by a political party or having even -- BLITZER : So , this motion that Mohamed ElBaradei , the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , is really one of the pillars of this . TELHAMI : He 's definitely not one of the pillars of this . He has certain popularity , his credibility . He 's been out there for a while . He 's also not necessarily the type of person that most people want . But this is not led by him or led by anyone else . And , by the way , a lot of the parties have made a decision not to really lead it , in part because they do n't want the backlash against them and they do n't want finger-pointing and let the public -- but it does n't mean that someone is n't going to exploit it at some point . So , at some point when there 's a transition , it 's all going to depend to a large extent where the military will be . And let 's face it , right now , including with the appointments today of the Vice President Omar Suleiman , who is obviously out of the military and the president himself is out of the military , the prime minister is out of the military , the military institution is asserting itself . BLITZER : And that 's key right now . You know , it 's fascinating , those of us who have studied Egypt over the years and I know you have a lot more than I , that when Nassir went down , the vice president , Anwar Sadat , took over . When Sadat was killed , the vice president , Hosni Mubarak , took over . Mubarak , for 30 years , never wanted to have a vice president because he was afraid the vice president would take over . Today , he names Omar Suleiman vice president . What does that say to you ? TELHAMI : Number one , it really excludes his own , Gamal Mubarak already . BLITZER : So , he 's gone ? Gamal Mubarak is not going to be the leader of Egypt ? TELHAMI : I mean , no one knows in the future . But in any immediate scenario , he 's gone . BLITZER : Because that 's who Mubarak wanted . He wanted Gamal to take over . TELHAMI : No question . Number two , Mubarak is already preparing for his transition with Omar Suleiman . This is someone he can trust . BLITZER : So , he wants Suleiman to take over ? TELHAMI : He -- this is someone he can trust and this is someone who 's got credibility . BLITZER : But I suspect a lot of those protesters despise Omar Suleiman as much as they might despise Hosni Mubarak . TELHAMI : Not as much . He does have some following . But this kind of appointment would have made a lot of sense a month ago and it might have been able to appease a lot of people . With all that happened in the last week , it 's too little too late . So , I do n't think it 's going to appease people but it does tell me one thing , though , that is the military is asserting itself . And , clearly , how they behave on the streets is going to matter a lot . And , by the way , the military is n't just going to be interested in the particular person who 's going to lead Egypt . They have to protect their reputation . They have been the anchor of political institution in Egypt really since 1952 overthrow of the monarchy , and they do n't want to sully their name with the public which still sees them as an anchor of the government themselves , and they need them for , you know , order no matter how the transition takes place . They do n't want to put themselves against the people and that 's going to be the dilemma . Can they maintain the order without , you know , antagonizing the public that they need because they have to look post - Mubarak era to make sure that they 're going to play an essential role in the future and that 's going to be really critical . BLITZER : I was fascinated by some of the reaction unfolding throughout the Middle East . The Saudis , for example , they issued a statement in the name of the king , infiltrators , Saudi Arabia calling the protests of the work of infiltrators pledging solidarity with Egypt right now . Iran , on the other hand , their foreign ministry issuing a diametrically opposed statement , saying Iran expects Egyptian officials to listen to the voice of their Muslim people , respond to their rightful demands and refrain from exerting violence by security forces and police against an Islamic wave of awareness that has spread through the country in the form of a popular movement . Assess what we 're just hearing . The Saudis support Mubarak . The Iranians support the demonstrators . TELHAMI : Well , look , there 's going to be a war of narrative . Let 's face it . It 's going to be -- it 's already begun . I see it today , who 's behind this finger-pointing . There 's even stories in some of the Arab press maybe even the U.S. was behind the uprising in Egypt . BLITZER : Because there 's always conspiratorial theories . TELHAMI : There 's always conspiratorial . So there 's going to be two things that are going to be contested . Number one is who 's behind it . There 's already reinventing what happened in Tunisia saying it was a failed coup by the security services only to be preempted by the military . This really was n't about the popular old revolution . You 're going to have reinvention in Saudi because the stakes are so high for everyone involved . And you 're going to have also a war of narratives about what the consequence will be . You can see people scaring people saying there 's going to be anarchy . There 's going to be looting . There 's going to be prisoners escaping . BLITZER : We 're seeing a lot of that . We 're seeing a lot of that . And the conspirators -- the conspiratorial theories say the government is behind this . They want to see this chaos develop so that the people will come back to the regime and say , please , quiet things down . TELHAMI : And , in part , because they 've been used to governments scaring them by saying there 's -- BLITZER : Is there an element of truth to that ? TELHAMI : You never know and that 's why the public ca n't be sure . But they know when they saw the anarchy in Iraq after the overthrow of the dictator Saddam Hussein , they did n't like it at all and the governments were able to say , do you want Cairo or do you want Baghdad ? And they wanted Cairo at that time . And they wanted Ahman -LRB- ph -RRB- at that time . So I think that kind of scaring tactic worked in the past . They think it will work in the current situation . I do n't think so . It 's too late for it . BLITZER : Shibley 's going to stay with us . Do n't go too far away , Shibley Telhami . Thanks very , very much . Isha , there 's a lot of questions that have to be answered . We 're going to try to do the best we can but , no doubt , many of these questions will remain unanswered . It will depend on what happens on the street . And one of the big questions is , of course , Egypt 's army . It is a major factor in events unfolding rapidly in Cairo and the rest of the country . As we 've told you , the army is in the streets of Cairo but so far has n't turned against the protesters . The police , well , they seemed to have vanished . Ivan Watson joins us live to bring us up to speed of what he 's been seeing and hearing in Cairo at this point in time -- Ivan . IVAN WATSON : Well , Isha , it 's 3:30 in the morning right now and the streets are quite quiet . We have tanks -- army tanks parked at intersection and , in fact , right behind the balcony where I 'm standing right now . But for the most part the streets have been quiet for the last few hours . I 'm going to show you a report that gives you a sense of some of the scenes we saw -- dramatic scenes in the streets of the Egyptian capital during the afternoon just a few hours ago . Take a look at this . WATSON : Crowds have gathered here . They 're still chanting . There 's still a lot of elation . But the curfew is coming fast . Also , we 're trying to ask people , what are they going to do when they 're told to go indoors ? Madam , are you going to go inside when the curfew starts ? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : No , I will not go inside . -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- on my dead body . They will kill me no problem . WATSON : You 're going to stay out protesting ? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : All of us , we will stay here . WATSON : It 's hard to put into words the scenes of elation that we 're seeing here with people hanging on the military 's tanks riding through town . One man said , as a result of today I feel proud to be an Egyptian for the very first time , chanting , down with the regime . But there has been violence amid this carnival atmosphere . We 've seen a number of people wounded , being treated by doctors on the dirty floor outside a mosque . WATSON : People are very excited right now and pretty upset because there has been some shooting going on . The doctor telling us five dead people have been brought into the entrance of this mosque and there 's one being treated right now with a bullet wound . This has been a day of liberation for some but it 's also been a day of violence and the doctors here at this rescue center say they 've been treating people coming in with wounds throughout the afternoon . We 've heard about a number of gunshots . You can see this young man being treated right here with some kind of wounds to his chest and arm . The name of this square where this sea of chanting humanity has come to is called Tahrir Square . And the people here are celebrating a kind of freedom that many of them say they 've never felt before . Isha , many of the Egyptians I 've spoken with today they said that they no longer feel fear for their government or the security forces which is part of why we see these scenes of amazing defiance . Another point I wanted to bring out , many of them also said that much of the momentum behind this movement and these protests really came from the example of Tunisia just a few weeks ago this very month when Tunisians rose up -- another Arab country , another north African country , rose up and overthrew a dictator that had ruled them for more than two decades -- Isha . SESAY : Ivan Watson , bringing us up to speed with what 's happening in Cairo , Egypt . Ivan , we appreciate it . BLITZER : All right , Isha . We 're going to stay in touch with all our correspondents on the scene . Also , circus performers , musicians , magicians , tourists . Tonight , they 're all stuck at the huge international airport in Cairo . We 're going there live right after this quick break . SESAY : Welcome back , everyone . The Cairo airport is a sea of humanity and confusion as people struggle to get out of the country . CNN 's Arwa Damon is there . Arwa , describe what 's happening right now . ARWA DAMON , CNN BEIRUT CORRESPONDENT : Well , Isha , both at the arrival and departure lounges you have people who have basically been bracing themselves for the night ahead . Trying to sleep on the floor . A few with sleeping bags curling up inside . Very difficult situation especially because things like food and water at the airport itself are really running down to very , very low stocks if any at all . We were struggling to find some ourselves . We spoke with a number of people who are stuck there , an elderly couple from the United States who were saying they had been on a weeklong vacation in Egypt . Clearly had a lovely time . They were then at the airport trying to catch a connecting flight to their next destination only to be stuck there for two days in a row . Bearing in mind , though , that the majority of these passengers stuck at the airport not necessarily because of a delay in flights , although that is taking place , but also because of the fact that there is this curfew going on . We saw large tour operators , groups that were there , many of them saying that their tour guides were telling them that it just simply was not safe to leave the airport and go outside . We also spoke with a group of British artists . They had come over to be part of a high-profile VIP celebrity . They were coming over with a party organizer . They were a group of musicians , artists . They was a magician amongst them . They were saying that the magician was putting on tricks at the airport trying to entertain others . But they also not knowing what they were doing , where they were going next . A lot of confusion , Isha , at this stage . SESAY : Arwa , we 've been telling our viewers about the state of anxiety there in Cairo , in many neighborhoods . Tell me , is there a feeling of safety at least at the airport ? DAMON : There is to a certain degree . You know , the conflict and the violence itself has not yet reached the airport . But there is fear of really just stepping outside beyond the doors of the airport . Transportation , for example , very tricky especially because of the curfew that is taking place overnight . To give you an idea , we were trying to leave the airport . We managed to find a young man who was willing to drive us to a nearby hotel . He was so frightened and so anxious , he took a wrong turn . We ended up at an army checkpoint where the troops that were there made us get out of the vehicle . They went through our belongings , our IDs . They 're also very tense . We just received reports that they had -- that other forces had managed to detain two Egyptian individuals who had a vehicle filled with weapons appearing to be preparing some sort of ambush . When we finally arrived at the hotel , a fairly steady stream of people who had somehow managed to make it outside of the airport at least to find a more comfortable place to sleep . But it really gives you an idea of just how tense this city is . People do n't know what is going to be happening in the morning . They do n't know what is going to be happening next -- Isha . SESAY : Arwa Damon , joining us there from Cairo 's airport . And , Wolf , Arwa very clearly breaking it down for us there at the airport . There 's a lot of tension and food and water stocks running down and people just do n't know what 's going to happen next . BLITZER : Yes , I know . So many tourists including a lot of American tourists , European tourists , they are anxious to get out of Egypt for understandable reasons . Right now , it 's not that easy . A lot of them are stuck at the airport . We 're going to have more on this part of the story , Isha . But let 's turn to our national security analyst Peter Bergen once again . Peter , it started in Tunisia , I think it 's fair to say . What happened there created this spark and it 's spreading . It 's spreading not only to Egypt but to Yemen , maybe even to other countries like Jordan . Is that what 's going on ? PETER BERGEN , CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST : Yes , that is what 's going on . It will be interesting to see which countries are not affected . I mean , I think the Saudi regime is obviously -- they have a very effective police state . They do deliver something to their people , the cost of , you know , an autocratic regime . BLITZER : And they issued a strong statement today condemning the uprising in Egypt . And the Saudi royal family has been on the throne at one time or another since the 18th century . They 're also -- they 're officially the defenders of the faith of Islam , a title they awarded themselves in 1986 , the defenders of the two holy places . So , you know , I think where we 're least likely to see this is in Saudi Arabia and , of course , there 's not much freedom of the press . BERGEN : Well , Jordan we 're already beginning to see some of that . But again , you know , the Hashemite monarchy has also been around for some period of time . This is not something that just sprang up , you know , 20 , 30 years ago as a result of a military coup . This is something that has been around for most of the 20th century . So , again , King Abdullah may not have quite the stature of his father and he is not necessarily particularly popular , but I think there 's more legitimacy in these long-term monarchies than , let 's say , somebody like Mubarak who , after all , came to power essentially because he just -- he was the guy who was n't shot on the reviewing stand in 1981 . BLITZER : Two countries where the U.S would like to see a Democratic uprising develop would be Iran and Syria . How likely is that -- how likely is this to spread to those two countries ? BERGEN : Well , I 'm not holding my breath on Syria for obvious reasons . A very effective police state . In Iran we did see , you know , something -- BLITZER : Fifteen months ago it looked like things were happening . You know , the difference between Iran and Egypt , Iran is not one man . You know , Ahmadinejad is also part of a larger system . So , you know , dictatorships are , you know -- when the dictator is unpopular , he is the only person who can be blamed because he has not apportioned power to anybody else . You know , Iran has a larger system and does have , you know , some form of Democratic elections . Obviously , they 're not perfect but , you know , there is more legitimacy strangely for the Iranian regime than there is for the Egyptian regime . We 're seeing that very clearly , I think , here . BLITZER : Peter , thanks very much . Isha , there 's a lot of dominos potentially out there that could yet fall . We 're watching it every step of the way . SESAY : We certainly are . We 're watching the entire region . Well , dancing with leaders who rule with iron fists . For years , the U.S. has supported Egypt 's Hosni Mubarak . Has President Obama now decided to cut ties with him ? Some answers coming up next . BARACK OBAMA , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : The people of Egypt have rights that are universal . That includes the right to peaceful assembly and association . The right to free speech and the ability to determine their own destiny . These are human rights and the United States will stand up for them everywhere . BLITZER : The crisis in Egypt is triggering protests around the globe . Starting in the upper left and moving like the hands of a clock you see people supporting the pro-democracy effort from Istanbul , Turkey , to Geneva , Switzerland , to New York and London . In New York , protesters outside the United Nations Building carried signs saying , the Mubarak regime must go . The U.S. government has a long history of supporting directly or indirectly iron fisted rulers or outright dictators . But now President Obama finds himself facing a very , very tough dilemma , offering moral support to the protesters in Egypt while struggling what to do about Hosni Mubarak , the president . Joining us now with their thoughts , two guests , Fran Townsend , a CNN national security contributor , and Mona Eltahawy , an Egyptian-born commentator and journalist . Thanks to both of you for coming in . There are no easy answers , Mona , for President Obama right now . What do you do ? What should the U.S. be doing right now ? MONA ELTAHAWY , COLUMNIST , ASHARQ AL-AWSAT : Well , I would remind President Obama of his inauguration speech in which he promised that he would stand with those who unclenched their fists -- tyrants who unclenched their fists . And he told those tyrants that they were on the wrong side of history . So my message to President Obama tonight is choose the right side of history because the right side of history is Egypt 's future , who are the young people who have filled the streets of my country and made me very proud to be an Egyptian . This is the most exciting time of my life . Choose the future of Egypt and choose the people of Egypt over the dictator of Egypt . That 's my message . BLITZER : So if you were in Cairo right now , Mona , you would be marching with those demonstrators . ELTAHAWY : Oh , you bet I would . I was in Cairo in 2005 and it was a huge -- it was one of the proudest moments of my life when I was marching in some of those street protests , those very courageous young people organized . And it 's the same courageous young people who took me to those marches in 2005 who have been confronting Mubarak 's brutal security forces every day . I salute them and I bow down to their courage and I urge the international community to side with the future of Egypt and choose freedom and dignity for the Egyptian people as we are choosing today . BLITZER : I 've studied the pictures of the demonstrators , Mona . I see women , although obviously not as many women there as men . What 's your assessment ? Are women as involved in these demonstrations as the men are ? ELTAHAWY : They absolutely are . Somebody asked me on Twitter because I spend my entire life on Twitter these days . Someone asked me , where are the women in the uprising of Egypt ? And so I sent out a question . I have something like 10,000 people who follow me . So I thought someone has to tell me . I 'm not there . And I got lots of pictures . There are pages that have been set up on Facebook called the Women of Egypt . Women who look like me . Women wearing head scarves . Women who cover their face . Women of every background . Because we in Egypt -- I say , we , because I 'm Egyptian but it 's their courage . They in Egypt today and every day for the past five days have been fighting to take back our country and this involves women and men . I 'm very proud of what they 're doing in Egypt . BLITZER : Mona , hold on for a minute . Fran Townsend , our homeland security contributor is here . You used to be the homeland security adviser to President Bush and you worked with Omar Suleiman , who 's the new vice president of Egypt . Tell us about this man . FRAN TOWNSEND , HOMELAND SECURITY CONTRIBUTOR : That 's right . I mean , this is a guy who has an illustrious military career which is how he came to Mubarak 's attention , of course . He then becomes the chief military -- chief intelligence officer . This is at the absolute top of the security apparatus throughout Egypt . And so when he becomes the vice president today , what message does that send to the world and to the people of Egypt ? BLITZER : What is the message ? TOWNSEND : Well , I think this is more of the same . This is part of that tight circle around Mubarak that he 's only promoting those who he trusts and that are already around him . I will tell you , this is really disheartening and President Obama called for a number of things including not seeing violence against protesters . Today we see more than 17 dead . He 's talked -- the president called on Hosni Mubarak to open up the Internet and the social networking sites . None of that 's happened . And the pressure is going to continue to increase on Mubarak and on President Obama to make a clearer statement . BLITZER : So what I hear you saying is when President Mubarak reshuffles his government , his cabinet and names Omar Suleiman to be the vice president , the first time he 's ever had a vice president , former head of the intelligence organizations in Egypt , name is Ahmad Shafiq , the prime minister , a retired air force general . What you 're saying is , this is n't change you can believe in . TOWNSEND : No , this is -- not only is this not change you can believe in , but this is the kind of change , the sort of moves that will absolutely infuriate and further inspire the protesters . BLITZER : Let me ask Mona to weigh in . Do you agree with Fran on that , Mona ? When Hosni Mubarak addressed the nation yesterday and said , I 'm going to fire my government . He got it all wrong . He got it back to front . They want him to fire himself . The protesters in Tahrir Square , Liberation Square in downtown Cairo , are chanting now against Mubarak and Omar Suleiman . You know , Egypt is the number one destination for -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . Omar Suleiman has been responsible for torturing terrorism suspects for the U.S. administration . Everybody in Egypt knows this and they associate Omar Suleiman and Hosni Mubarak with torture and with filling up Egyptian jails and human rights violations . Egyptians want the entire Mubarak regime gone in the way that Tunisians want the entire -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- regime gone and they 're doing it . And we are learning from the Tunisians . And I 'm optimistic that they 'll do it in Egypt . BLITZER : During the Bush administration , were there renditions to Egypt and to Omar Suleiman who is in charge of the intelligence community ? Is she right , in other words ? TOWNSEND : Well , the one that 's best known is the one where the individual was taken to Canada . Canada then returned him and there was much litigation about it and there was litigation about his treatment . BLITZER : That was in Syria , was n't it ? TOWNSEND : You know , you 're right , Wolf . That one was to Syria . Look , there 's a long history of renditions , you are quite correct , between the United States and Egypt . And , look , we -- because of the State Department Human Rights Report , there were procedures put in place to try to protect anyone who has returned from Egypt from suffering from the kinds of human rights abuses . BLITZER : Mona , one final question before I let you go , how much time do you think there is for President Mubarak right now before he steps down ? ELTAHAWY : Hosni Mubarak is finished and he is going to step down in a matter of days . And just to put that into perspective for you . It took the Tunisians 29 days to overthrow the 23-year dictatorship of Ben Ali . Egyptians took to the streets five days ago and in four days Hosni Mubarak called in the army . In four days , a regime , a tyrant of 30 years has crumbled before tens of thousands of his people in just four days . Hosni Mubarak is finished and I am confident that the people of Egypt will find an interim government and will move on . And I 'm confident that this uprising will turn into a revolution that will inspire the entire Arab world . BLIZTER : Mona and Fran , both of you stand by . You 're going to be joining us in the next hour as well . Isha , you can see there 's a lot of passion when it comes to this subject . SESAY : Yes , there certainly is . And , Wolf , these protests are obviously taking a significant toll on the people of Egypt . They 're also taking an emotional toll on one of our reporter 's family . That story 's coming up next .

It is 5:00 here in the morning . We 're going to have continuing complete coverage all through this hour from here in Cairo , also in Alexandria , also in Washington , where Wolf Blitzer is standing by and also in Atlanta , where Isha Sesay is standing by . Our coverage continues as it has where for this many -- now going on seven days . As I said , dramatic developments today . Mohamed ElBaradei , the Nobel laureate who returned to Egypt just on Thursday , appeared in Liberation Square today , which is the central point where a lot of the protests are taking place here in Cairo . He spoke to the crowd . We 'll show you what that was like in just a moment . The curfew is still in effect . Though , as you will see in Liberation Square , people defied the curfew in order to come out in large numbers . Right now , the streets around downtown Cairo are relatively calm , pretty empty , except for the heavy presence of Egyptian soldiers manning tanks and many of the intersections , many of the roadblocks . There are also large civilian militias , just people , ordinary civilians who have armed themselves with kitchen knives , with bats , with clubs in order to try to protect their neighborhood since police are no longer visible on the streets here in Cairo . Though we have gotten a report from the government that police will be returning to the streets in a few hours on Monday . Whether or not that actually occurs and what kind of an impact that 's going to have , we 're just going to have to wait and see . Here 's what we saw , though , after the curfew , about three hours after the curfew went into effect at 4:00 on Sunday . We went to Tahrir Square , to Liberation Square , and here is what we saw . COOPER -LRB- voice over -RRB- : Sunday night , the sixth day of protests in Liberation Square , was once again filled . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : They 're calling for freedom and change and justice . Those are the words you will hear a lot . And they 're saying that their demands have n't changed , they want Mubarak out . -LRB- voice over -RRB- : Defying Mubarak , defying the curfew , thousands showed up shouting into the night . COOPER -LRB- on camera -RRB- : What 's remarkable about this is -- for those of us who have reported from Egypt over the years is before , anytime you brought out a camera , instantly police would be all over you , stopping you from shooting , checking your papers . We have a camera out . Nobody is stopping us . And people are voicing their opinion . -LRB- voice over -RRB- : There is no one organizer of these protests . But tonight , Mohamed ElBaradei showed up to try to talk to the crowd . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : ElBaradei is right over there the crowd . Everybody wants to get a look at him , wants to hear anything he might have to say . -LRB- voice over -RRB- : The crowd rushed forward , and ElBaradei spoke briefly through the bullhorn . MOHAMED ELBARADEI , EGYPTIAN OPPOSITION FIGURE -LRB- through translator -RRB- : Today , you are an Egyptian demanding your rights and freedom , and what we started can never be pushed back . COOPER : His words were eloquent but few heard what he said . And the noise in the Square was simply too great . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : What is your message to President Mubarak ? COOPER -LRB- voice over -RRB- : Soldiers on tanks watched and waited . There were no police to be seen in the Square on this night . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : Are you scared to be here ? There 's no -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- , so nothing to be scared of . COOPER -LRB- voice over -RRB- : There 's no telling how much longer this can go on for six days into the crisis and there is still no clear way for it to come to an end . COOPER : And Nic Robertson has been reporting from Alexandria . He was out today with protesters in the streets , where the soldiers were shooting overhead . Did n't seem to have much impact , though , on the crowd . Again , the crowd is defying curfew to voice their opinions in the streets of Alexandria . Nic also looked into -- trying to get an understanding of how these protests are being organized and coordinated with Internet service shut down in many places . It is a very difficult task . Here 's what he found . -LRB- BEGIN VIDEOTAPE -RRB- NIC ROBERTSON , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT -LRB- on camera -RRB- : We 've come to this apartment building because it is where a secret meeting is taking place . The people that helped organize the demonstrations are now having a meeting to try and organize security here and we 've been brought into this secret meeting . Hello , how are you doing ? ALI REGAL , STUDENT ACTIVIST : Nic , how are you ? ROBERTSON : English would be great , yes . REGAL : Now we are trying to make a plan , strategic plan for -- to close all the borders of Alexandria and the places where we are seeing -- the districts where we are seeing well-structured -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- and vehicles and all this stuff we are hearing in the news . ROBERTSON : To protect the -- to protect the population , yes ? REGAL : Yes , to protect the population . Now , there are a lot of popular committees everywhere , as you can see . But we are trying to close some critical points on different places on the borders . ROBERTSON : How is it going so far ? REGAL : Well , so far , it 's starting to develop , so we hope we can finish it by 5:00 or 6:00 . ROBERTSON : And what about the Army ? Are they -- are you working with the Army ? REGAL : Yes , the Army is very helpful and working with us and it 's a great cooperation between the masses and the Army . ROBERTSON : Do you feel that the Army is on your side or the president 's side at the moment ? REGAL : Look , I can not be sure of this . But what I 'm very sure is there is a strong cooperation between the masses and the Army . That 's what I can tell it so far . COOPER : Nic joins us now from Alexandria . I 'm amazed at how brave these people you spoke to seem to be . I mean , they do n't seem to be frightened . We are having a problem with Nic 's connection . We are having a problem with Nic 's connection . We 'll try to link up with him a little bit later on throughout this hour . But again , the ability for protesters to try to communicate and organize , it is a very difficult thing . Mohamed ElBaradei , who returned to this country on Thursday , said that he is in touch with some of the protest organizers and in communication with them , has been working with them and that they 've all agreed on the need to form some sort of a national unity government or transitional government if and when Hosni Mubarak steps down . But again , there is no sign of that . No indication that the president of Egypt , who has been the president for some 30 years now , is willing to do just that . We 're going to continue our coverage throughout this hour . Let 's check in with Wolf now in Washington . WOLF BLITZER , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Anderson , thanks . As the protesters are organizing , analysts are trying to figure out what happens next . What would President Mubarak 's departure mean for Egypt 's peace with Israel , for example , and how would U.S. - Middle East relations be impacted ? Samer Shehata is an assistant professor of Arab politics at Georgetown University here in Washington . He is joining us now . How popular is Mohamed ElBaradei in Egypt ? Could he emerge as the next leader if Mubarak goes down ? PROF. SAMER SHEHATA , ARAB POLITICS , GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY : He certainly could emerge . As far as his popularity , he has a wide - ranging popularity among intellectuals , among some elements of the middle classes . He 's relatively unknown among broader segments of the society . But something very interesting happened yesterday . The Muslim Brotherhood announced that they were supporting Mr. Baradei as an interim leader for Egypt . That , I think , is very , very significant , because before these events , before last Tuesday , they were considered the largest opposition movement . So I think he is emerging , certainly , as one of , if not the most important potential leaders in a democratic Egypt in the future . BLITZER : He is well-known to a lot of us . I 've met him on many occasions . Former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency . Would he -- assuming Mubarak goes down and everybody seems to think it 's only a matter of time , would he likely emerge ? Would Omar Suleiman , the new vice president , emerge ? SHEHATA : Well , it depends how Mr. Mubarak goes down . If Mr. Mubarak simply resigns and then Omar Suleiman takes over as president . Mr. Baradei still excluded . The regime can still try to maintain itself . Can say that we 've made a concession , we 're moving forward . I do n't think that would be accepted . People are calling for the removal of Mr. Mubarak and a change of regime . Freedom , change and social justice . So -- however , If the entire regime were to collapse , if the protest were to continue and overwhelm the regime as it were , then I think you would have an interim government and Mr. Baradei would certainly be a part of it . BLITZER : I 've heard that Mrs. Mubarak has already left Egypt , maybe in London , that Gamal Mubarak , the son , already in London . I do n't know what you 've heard but there are a lot of reports out there that they have left . What are you hearing ? SHEHATA : I 'm hearing the same thing and I 'm hearing the same thing from multiple sources , from British sources as well as Arabic satellite sources , that they are in London right now . And we also heard yesterday and this , I think , was confirmed that there were 17 or 18 private jets that departed from Egypt and landed in the Emirates and they included a number of very prominent Egyptian businessmen , including Naguib Sawiris , the 64th richest man in the world , telecommunications mogul , as well as Ahmed Ezz , a hated National Democratic Party figure who resigned several days ago . BLITZER : If President Mubarak steps down and everybody seems to think that 's going to happen , could he stay in Egypt or would he have to flee , go to London , or go to the Emirates , go to Saudi Arabia , someplace else ? SHEHATA : Well , again , it depends on what happens next . If Omar Suleiman becomes president and somehow the regime can maintain itself , and I do n't think that 's a likely scenario , then Mr. Mubarak would have the cover of Omar Suleiman being president . It would be somewhat like -- and this analogy is n't perfect - a Gerald Ford - Richard Nixon moment . However , if the protesters continue , and I think this is more likely , and it overwhelms the state , then Mr. Mubarak will have to flee for his life and -- but the point is that people now are saying that he needs to be held accountable . He needs to be held accountable not only for 30 years of authoritarianism but for the damage that he has caused Egypt and the lives that have been lost over the last few days . BLITZER : Samer Shehata of Georgetown University , thanks so much for coming in . BLITZER : I know you 're watching this especially closely because you still have family , a lot of family in Egypt right now . We hope all of them are OK . SHEHATA : Thank you . BLITZER : Thanks so much for joining us . Isha , this is a story with a lot of developments happening right now , and I know you want to update our viewers on what we know . ISHA SESAY , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Yes , absolutely . Wolf , thank you . Here is what we know . For American citizens who want out of Egypt , help is on the way . U.S. State Department says chartered evacuation flights will start taking off soon . Anybody taking one of those planes will have to reimburse the cost of their seat . Several other governments are also scrambling to get their people out . U.S. officials are monitoring the situation but treading carefully . Defense Secretary Robert Gates spent part of his weekend on the phone with his counterpart in both Egypt and Israel . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pointed to President Mubarak 's speech a few days ago , saying it 's time to back up his talk of democratic and economic reform with action . And we 've seen the protests recently out of Tunisia , Yemen and now Egypt . So , where could this anti-government sentiment spread next in the region ? That is the big question . The next domino could be Syria where a very restrictive Ba'athist regime has been in charge for four decades now . I think you can bet Syrian leaders are watching events in Egypt very carefully tonight . Now , back to Anderson in Cairo . COOPER : Isha , we show a force today by the Mubarak regime . Fighter jets flying low over Liberation Square at the beginning of curfew around 4:00 this afternoon . We 'll show you what impact it had on the protesters in the Square , probably not the impact President Mubarak had hoped it would have . Also in the hour ahead , we 're going to look at the roots of this uprising , roots that started not in Egypt but elsewhere in the region . We 'll explain ahead . You have also two choice . The first choice , Mubarak leave , and the second choice , we die here . We have no choice . COOPER : Just one of the many voices we have heard today . Nic Robertson , now we lost communication with him a short time ago . We 've re-established it . He 's joining us now from Alexandria , which is to the north of where we are in Cairo . Nic , you spent time with some of the protest organizers over the last 24 hours . How are they organizing thing ? How are they handling this protest , getting the message out because Facebook , Internet is shut down in most places ? ROBERTSON : You know what 's incredible , Anderson , these guys are a bunch of young students , some of them lawyers , some of them studying such things as security in society . They 're reduced to drawing maps on pieces of paper to try and figure out who gets to guard which neighborhood , how long they should be there , those sorts of things . So they 're trying to be effective but the mechanism , the Internet that they used to spread the word before to build these protests and get them out on the streets , they do n't have access to that . You have a lot of groups now competing within the different neighborhoods for sort of dominance . You see , you have this sort of intellectuals , if you will , the students , you have the Muslim Brotherhood , who you 'd see now corralling the demonstrations , a bigger presence in the demonstrations . And even one neighborhood , and I show you this here that we picked up , a flyer , driving through one of the neighborhoods past the vigilante group . They handed this out to us this evening . And this is from a group , an Islamist group more radical , way more radical than the Muslim Brotherhood . They 're demanding an Islamic state in Egypt . So you have all these different groups . And it 's quite clear that over time , a struggle is going to evolve between them . Who controls what , where ? Who has the power ? That is something that appears to be coming down the line , Anderson . COOPER : And President Mubarak has certainly used concern in the West and even concern here about Islamic fundamentalists to his advantage over these last 30 years as a way to stay in power . On the streets here though , there has been an uptick in the involvement of folks from the Muslim Brotherhood and other organizations . It does not seem to have a very religious cast to it . You see a lot of young students , a lot of people who are talking about freedom . Do you see -- is that the way it is in Alexandria as well ? ROBERTSON : You know , I think what you 're seeing here is the -- what the Muslim Brotherhood are doing is keeping the demonstrations peaceful . They 're keeping -- when the demonstrators are out on the main roads here , they 're keeping one side of the road open for traffic , keeping the demonstrators on one side , keeping it under control . Why is the Muslim Brotherhood doing this ? Well , there really are no sort of strong opposition groups that have the organization and influence that they do . So they are really stepping in to fill a vacuum . And they say themselves very clearly that they are moderate Islamist group , non-violent . But , of course , they 're policies in the region are vastly different from President Hosni Mubarak 's . And they do look at the United States and they do look at Hosni Mubarak as sort of being side by side in a policy that keeps , they feel , the Palestinians down . So , they are voicing on the streets now . We 're seeing for the first time today here , very loudly , really , an anti-U.S. sentiment and we have n't seen that up to now . But that is sort of emerging , Anderson . COOPER : And you can -- I do n't know if you can hear in the background now , call to prayers . It is just after 5:00 a.m. here , day seven of this uprising . One of the more dramatic moments that we talked about a little bit ago was when F-16 fighter jets flew low over Liberation Square around 3:00 or 4:00 on Sunday afternoon . Our Ivan Watson was actually there on the ground when they flew over . Here 's what he saw . IVAN WATSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : This is an unmistakable show of military force , fighter jets flying low over Cairo 's Tahrir Square , Liberation Square , which has been a symbol of defiance . COOPER : And Ivan Watson joins us now . And we said it before , but that did not have probably the impact or the effect that whoever ordered those planes to fly overhead wanted . If anything , people said they were not going to be intimidated . If it was a means to try to intimidate people , though , you know , there were the soldiers in the Square at the same time , and the demonstrators were handing out sandwiches and bananas and tea and taking photos with them on their tanks . So , perhaps getting mixed messages from parts of the Egyptian military right now . COOPER : You know , before I came here , you hear , well , look , there 's a curfew at 4:00 . You kind of surmise -- that means there 's an effort to impose that curfew . It does n't seem like seeing the soldiers are really trying to impose the curfew . WATSON : And they 've been -- they 've been a little bit more forceful , I think , and they were not allowing people to demonstrate here the way they had done two days ago , let 's say . But so far , they are allowing people to move around . I think what 's interesting , again , is the neighborhood watch groups that have sprung up , who have taken upon themselves to stop cars , to search them . And now in the second vigil night that they 're doing this , they have -- again , these are not people who are trained to be security officers . They 're doing things like setting up their own signal systems , using whistles , for instance , so that they can call for help from one block to another . And I was talking to one man who said they had already been attacked around 9:00 p.m. People trying to climb over the walls of their compound and break in and they were actually scaring off these types of criminals . COOPER : We 'll have more from Ivan throughout this hour and then obviously in the days ahead here in Cairo . We 're also , of course , joined throughout this hour by Wolf Blitzer in Washington and Isha Sesay in Atlanta . Well , the uprising in the Middle East did n't begin in Egypt but it was spread across several Arab countries . We 'll take you through events over the last several weeks . BLITZER : And we 'll also hear from our own Ben Wedeman , who lives in Cairo with his family , has been on this story from day one . He 's got a dramatic story to tell . -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- We need freedom . All these people need freedom . And we need you to support us in our situation . COOPER : A lot of anger , a lot of frustration and also a lot of pride . You hear people say that a lot . They 're very proud to see their fellow Egyptians out on the streets , calling for freedom , calling for an end to the Mubarak regime . Again , what can of an impact that will have , how long these protests can continue before something gives is not clear . Day seven has already begun here and no one can really anticipate what the next 24 hours will bring . Joined again by Wolf Blitzer in Washington , Isha Sesay in Atlanta . SESAY : Anderson , there 's no doubt about it . Events unfolding in Egypt at lightning speed . But the seeds of unrest were planted long ago . BLITZER : And indeed , within a span of only four weeks . revolt has spread across three Muslim countries in the Middle East . CNN 's Suzanne Malveaux tells us where the spark was lit . SUZANNE MALVEAUX , CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT -LRB- voice over -RRB- : Starting with Tunisia , where an unemployed graduate student sets himself on fire after a city inspector confiscates his unlicensed fruit card and then allegedly slaps him . His death sparks unprecedented fury and protests against the government , forcing Tunisia 's longtime president to flee . In Algeria , riots break out over rising food prices and a housing crisis . In Yemen , students take to the streets . Emboldened by its neighbors in the region , on Tuesday , Egypt erupts . Angered by the alleged corruption , police brutality and lack of reforms in their own country , thousands pour into the streets , demanding Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , who 's held power for nearly three decades , resign . Protesters are met with tear gas and violence . The next day , the violence escalates as Egyptian security forces turn water cannons and tear gas on the growing angry crowds . The Egyptian military urges calm . Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter report that they 're being blocked by the government . Thursday , a leading Egyptian opposition figure , Mohamed ElBaradei returns home from Europe , vowing to back the protesters . The Egyptian government then arrests a prominent leader of country 's largest opposition group , the Muslim Brotherhood . The Obama administration is alarmed by the growing intensity of the crisis but reacts with caution . BARACK OBAMA , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : I want to be very clear in calling upon the Egyptian authorities to refrain from any violence against peaceful protesters . MALVEAUX -LRB- voice over -RRB- : As the unrest spreads beyond Cairo in the days to come , protesters take to the streets in Qatar and Jordan to show demonstrators their support . Mubarak goes on national television to tell Egyptians his government will resign but he will stay in power . His offer does not quell the angry and growing crowds . A thousand inmates break out of a prison outside Cairo . Looters ransack prison buildings and businesses . And vandals tear off the heads of mummies at the Egyptian museum . Journalists report a dangerous power vacuum . BEN WEDEMAN , CNN SR. . INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : The Army is sort of controlling the streets . Politically , there 's a complete vacuum . MALVEAUX -LRB- on camera -RRB- : President Obama is trying to focus on some key domestic issues this week , including immigration and education . But senior administration officials are keeping a very close eye on what happens in the Egyptian streets and whether or not President Hosni Mubarak survives . COOPER : That is obviously a very open question -- whether or not he can survive . He has survived for some 30 years . He has many cards in his deck . We have yet to see him play his full hand . We 're going to have our continuing coverage . When we come back , we 'll talk with Ben Wedeman who is in the neighborhood . He actually lives in here in Cairo , trying to literally protect the street that he lives in , along with his neighbors . He went out on an armed patrol with his neighbors , something that is happening on just about every block in nearly every neighborhood that we have driven through . People manning checkpoints by themselves with knives and clubs to protect from the concern about looters . We 'll talk to Ben in his home , coming up . UNIDENTIFIED MALE -LRB- through translator -RRB- : Security forces fired at us and shot tear gas at us . More than 15 people lost their sight and vision . One was shot at right here . COOPER : One of our reporters , Ben Wedeman , the best reporter we have in this region , has been covering this from day one . I want to show you -- we 're going to talk to him . He 's actually in his community , the neighborhood where he lives in Cairo , concerned about the security of that neighborhood and actually went out on patrol with some of his neighbors who have taken matters into their own hands to protect the block that they live on . But I just want to show you some of his reporting from way back on Tuesday . Seems like a long time ago , but it was just seven days now . This is some of what he saw then . BEN WEDEMAN , CNN SR. . INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT -LRB- via telephone -RRB- : This unrest is obviously going to have to cause some new calculations , political new calculations . Anyway , right now , I 'm overwhelmed with tear gas . VOICE OF UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Are you able to carry on or do you want to get to a place of safety , Ben ? WEDEMAN : I 'll do my best , Martin -LRB- ph -RRB- , I 'll do my best . I just have to keep my one eye open . COOPER : Ben Wedeman joins us now . Ben , I do n't know if that seems like a long time ago to you or short time ago to you . It was just seven days ago . What surprises you most about what 's happening right now ? WEDEMAN : The speed of it , Anderson . It 's been so fast , so dramatic , that really initially all of us , the press , the protesters , the government , police , everyone has been taken utterly by surprise simply how fast all of this has happened . And I was -- in fact , I was having dinner at somebody 's house just across the street from Tahrir Square the night before the first protests , and most of us seem to be of the belief that this would be a day of some protests , but life would go on . Life has just completely changed for everyone in Egypt since then . And we 're slowly starting to digest the significance of it all . But it does seem that we 're coming to the end of an era here in Egypt . Most Egyptians I have spoken to say it 's just impossible for President Hosni Mubarak to carry under the pretense that he 's the president of all Egyptians -- Anderson . COOPER : Uniformed police have been off the streets . There is a report that police may come back tomorrow on Monday on the streets here . We 're going to have to wait and see on that . Are the secret police , the plainclothes police , the ones who roughed you up several days ago and have roughed up a lot of people and dragged people away , are they still out on the streets ? WEDEMAN : It appears they are , although I think they 're keeping a fairly low profile and aware at this point that Egyptians have learned that they are powerful , too , and that they can fight back . In my neighborhood , speaking to my neighbors , there 's a new awareness that what the police did , ordinary citizens can do , that is maintain security without the kind of petty corruption , without the police brutality that created such a negative aura around the police . As far as the secret police is concerned , they 're not as apparent on the streets as before . But , of course , the worry of many people is that given the orders , they can go back and create the same kind of havoc that we saw them doing during the days of protest -- Anderson . COOPER : Just one final question , Ben . In the United States , there 's concern among some quarters about Islamists gaining power , taking control here in Egypt if Mubarak left . That is certainly something President Mubarak has used over his reign to continue Western -- to support Western support and to garner support here . How realistic is that ? What sort of power do they have here in and , moving forward if Mubarak left , what sort of power would they have ? WEDEMAN : Most Egyptian analysts believe that if there were free and fair elections , that the Muslim Brotherhood and similar groups would win around 30 to 35 percent of the vote . But certainly not only has the Mubarak government exaggerated the so - called Islamic threat in Egypt to the United States , but they did that to a great extent with the Egyptian people as well . Every time elections would come around , they would send out a message , either you vote for Mubarak , who will protect secular liberal Christian Egyptians or you vote for the Muslim Brotherhood and you will pay the price . But that sort of blackmail , so to speak , does n't really work anymore among ordinary Egyptians . They see that the -- that the Muslim Brotherhood is n't the sort of threat that President Mubarak and the government always said it was -- Anderson . COOPER : Ben , we 'll continue to check in with you . Now let 's go to Wolf in Washington . BLITZER : Anderson , American diplomacy right now facing a tough , tough test . U.S. strategic interests are colliding with the political uprising fueled by anger at a U.S.-backed president in Egypt . Nick Burns is an expert at navigating global crisis . He 's a former U.S. diplomat , was the undersecretary of state . He 's now a professor at Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government . In terms of -- on a scale of 1 to 10 , Nick , 10 being the worst crisis , where would you rate this one ? NICHOLAS BURNS , FORMER U.S. UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE : This is up to 8 or 9 already , Wolf . You know , the consequences of instability in Egypt to the United States are really , really important . This country , I think , is the most important U.S. partner in the Middle East . And so , as you rightly said , the strategic interests here of the United States are on the line . But , as you know , and as President Obama and Secretary Clinton have been saying , we are a democratic country , we affirm our own democratic values , we have to support the right of Egyptians for freedom of speech and assembly , to demonstrate peacefully . And so , we 've seen a very difficult balancing act for the United States over the last seven days . BLITZER : Should the president of the United States pick up the phone and call President Mubarak and say , guess what , it 's over , it 's time for you to leave , begin that process ? BURNS : You know , I thought when President Obama spoke on Friday night , he got it just about right . He made a quite forceful statement , for change in Egypt , for the government to open up , to allow reform , to move forward . I also thought it was appropriate for the president the other night not to call publicly for President Mubarak to resign . BLITZER : I 'm not saying publicly , I 'm saying -- I 'm asking privately . Should the president tell Mubarak privately it 's over ? BURNS : I was just going to say , Wolf , this is not all about us . It 's really about the Egyptians . They 're the ones who have to steer this forward . I think that President Mubarak seems to be losing control of the streets of Alexandria and Cairo . The shocking absence of security forces , the disorder and the mistakes that President Mubarak made last week in using excessive force against the demonstrators . So I think it is appropriate at some point in the next day or two for the U.S. to be saying privately that the government has to move forward . That means that President Mubarak has to declare publicly , I think , that he 's not going to run in the September elections nor is his son , Gamal , that he 's going to open up this process to a truly -- in a truly democratic way to allow people like Mohamed ElBaradei , whom you saw on the streets of Cairo today , to contest these elections . And I think if he does n't do that , we 're going to see rapid change on the streets and rapid change politically in Egypt . BLITZER : Is it your sense that the longer he delays that , the worse potentially it is for everyone ? BURNS : My sense is that President Mubarak -- President Mubarak is a very serious , sophisticated , experienced person . And I had hoped that he would see the need last week to allow for a process of reform to begin . He has n't done that . By appointing Omar Suleiman as his vice president is really just more of the same , it 's military power . The military is an important institution in Egyptian society . We should hope that the military will back a period of transition , a period leading to elections and hopefully allow for civil society to grow in Egypt as the country has never known democracy in its entire history , to give the Egyptian people a chance in an orderly , peaceful way towards an election . Wolf , that 's the best thing that I can see happening now , but the government of Egypt needs to get behind that and make it absolutely clear that it favors reform . It has not done that yet , and you see the crowds growing in the streets of Cairo and Alexandria . BLITZER : Yes , that would be the best-case scenario if in fact that happens from the U.S. perspective and from the Egyptian perspective . But at least as of right now , everything that President Mubarak is saying does n't indicate he is ready to give up , at least not yet . Nick , thanks very much for joining us . BLITZER : Isha , let 's get back to you . ISHA SESAY , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Wolf , coming up , a walk through the dangerous streets of Alexandria and Cairo . Our CNN reporters take you straight to the scene of what is becoming a lawless situation with looting and gunfire . SESAY : Plus , CNN senior international correspondent Nic Robertson is in the ancient port city of Alexandria , where Egyptians marched through the streets after curfew with gunshots providing a scary soundtrack . This is the start of the rest of my life , the new happy life , honestly , as cheesy as it sounds , that 's exactly how I feel right now . SESAY : I 'm Isha Sesay at CNN headquarters in Atlanta , joined by my colleagues Wolf Blitzer in Washington D.C. and Anderson Cooper , who is in Cairo . We continue to cover the events in Egypt , where social order is collapsing with frightening speed . Reports of widespread looting and lawlessness are rampant . Late Saturday night , we received word of a massive prison break near Cairo . CNN took a flight and went there Saturday to investigate what was clearly a dangerous and deadly situation . FREDERIK PLEITGEN , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- voice over -RRB- : When we got to the prison in Abu Zaabal , a gun battle was still raging inside . The residents advised us to leave . Inmates had escaped , they told us , and stolen many weapons from the building 's arsenal . The problem is not just that the prisoners got out , this man told us . The problem is the prisoners got out and took all the weapons with them . The townspeople later told us looters later stormed the prison and went on a shooting rampage and that there were still dead bodies on the premises . And no police around . A total breakdown of law enforcement . We came past half a dozen abandoned police stations looted and torched . Local citizens are banding together , arming themselves , trying to protect their neighborhoods . In this neighborhood , they stopped a stolen car full of armed men , one carrying an automatic weapon . One of our -- one of our friends hit them with a stick . The guy with the machine gun . So he starts shooting everywhere and then they fainted . PLEITGEN : Irrigation engineer Ahemd Abdul Latif and his son are part of a community defense force . Recently , they 've gotten help from the Army . Latiff says his wife and daughter are scared and did not want to be filmed . AHEMD ABDUL LATIF , IRRIGATION ENGINEER : I protect myself with anything I have , anything I have in my hand , anything , tools , my car tools , I used my car tools . PLEITGEN : He blames one man for the upheaval overtaking his country . LATIF : Thank you , Mr. Mubarak . I want to thank him very much for this situation we are in . We want to -- we want him -- please , Mr. Mubarak , please , thank you very much . PLEITGEN : Latif and the others will probably have to spend more nights with their clubs defending their houses . Still , they say , these days are days of hope , even as chaos seems to reign . Fred Pleitgen , CNN , Cairo , Egypt . COOPER : It is incredible just how , you know , you drive through neighborhoods and literally every block , you are stopped by six , a dozen young men , old men , armed with all sorts of weapons , makeshift weapons , clubs , kitchen knives , they check out who you are , they want to see some sort of identification . And then , when they realize you 're not a looter , they 're generally friendly and tell you to move on . But it 's block after block after block . It 's very difficult now just even getting anywhere in Cairo because of the time it takes to get through all these -- all these roadblocks . We 're going to have our continuing coverage all the way through this evening . When we come back , we 're going to take a look at what happens if President Mubarak does step down and does leave Egypt and what happens if he does n't . ROBERTSON : The demonstration is getting much closer to one of the Army post . So the gunfire that we can hear rocketing through the air , the demonstrators say that 's the Army firing to warn them to stay away . It 's long ... ROBERTSON : More gunshots . It 's long after curfew right now . And if the government was controlling the situation ... ROBERTSON : Trace of fire flying in the air . These people - BLITZER : Nic Robertson doing some amazing reporting for us from Alexandria . With Egypt appearing to be on the brink of new leadership , right now analysts are trying to connect the dots on how it will impact the new future if President Mubarak is out and everyone seems to think he will be out , it 's only a matter of time . What will happen to Egypt 's peace with Israel , for example . If a new president comes in , how will that affect U.S. relations throughout the region ? Let 's discuss with Professor Fouad Ajami He 's professor of Middle East Studies at the Johns Hopkins University 's School of Advanced International Studies . Professor Ajami , if the president of the United States called you right now and said , Professor Ajami , what should we do , what would you tell President Obama ? PROF. FOUAN AJAMI , MIDDLE EAST STUDIES , JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV. : Well , I have a feeling this president would not call me because I have been very critical of him . I think there is something wrong with our posture toward Egypt . There is something wrong with the American inability to connect with the aspirations of the Egyptians for a change . There is something wrong with our secretary of state saying that the Egyptian regime is stable when she knew better . There is something wrong with our Vice President Biden saying that Hosni Mubarak is not a dictator when every child in Egypt that we see and every reporter is showing you insists that Hosni Mubarak is a dictator . So I think there is some real chaos . Not only there is chaos on the streets of Cairo but there 's really chaos here on our end -- what to do about Egypt and how to understand Egypt . BLITZER : So what should the U.S. do ? AJAMI : Well , I think , look , it 's a long story and we have come to this -- I mean , this Egyptian protest is happening without any inspiration from the United States . I mean , if you really look at what 's happening , not only in Egypt but if you widen the lens , and you take a look at the Arab world as a whole , you see that there is a kind of irrelevance of American power because , in fact , the message was sent out early on in the Obama administration , that we do not interfere in the internal affairs of this autocracies but we are invested in these autocracies . Our treasure is invested in Egypt , and we have this longstanding interest in Egypt , and we are very timid because we insist that should the despot fail , should the despot be removed , should he and his family leave , we insist that Egypt has no other option but Islamic fundamentalism . It 's a kind of intellectual poverty , and it 's hard . BLITZER : If President Mubarak were watching CNN International right now and he might be , we do n't know if he is , but look in the camera and talk to President Mubarak and what would you say to him ? AJAMI : Well , look , President Mubarak had -- he 's been in power , as we all know , 30 years . I think he had 12 good years . He was the son of Egypt . He was a man who rose from the Armed Forces . He cared about his country . He was a modest man . There is a general who was of Mubarak 's generation and Mubarak 's class , if you will , in the military , who described Mubarak to me as a civil servant with the rank of president . This is long gone now . So , 12 good years he rendered service to the Egyptians , then finally he put together this unbelievable autocratic state . The Ministry of Interior has 1.7 million people working for it . The whole treasure of Egypt and the effort of Egypt and the effort of Mubarak has not been about developing Egypt , solving the poverty of Egypt , dealing with the problems of Egypt . It 's been about simply the police state that he has put together , and there was a demeaning of Egypt to insist that a son of his would have to be president . I mean , to be tempted to go that dynastic route , over 80 million people , the pact between Mubarak and his people has really been severed and broken . He can only do one thing now for the Egyptians . He can simply step aside , as the Egyptians over and over again , when you hear , when you see these crowds , they 're saying one word , derhal -LRB- ph -RRB- , which means just be gone , leave . And this is really what -- there is -- the moral pact of Mubarak is severed . BLITZER : Tunisia , Egypt , what 's next ? The next six months , look ahead for us , Professor Ajami . What do you see ? AJAMI : Well , you know , it 's very hard . As someone said , it 's hard to predict particularly the future . We do n't really know . We do n't even know if this upheaval , this tsunami that hit the Arab world -- look a man in Tunisia sets himself ablaze in a forgotten , forlorn Tunisian town and then you see the envy of Tunis , the Tunisia envy , if you will , in every Arab county . What you have are these decadent regimes , autocratic regimes ruled by old men , ruled by people who loot these countries , whether it 's Libya , whether it 's Syria , whether it 's Algeria , whether it 's Tunisia , whether it 's Egypt . Those are a band of regimes ruled by a man at the top with dynastic ambitions for their families , an incredible access to the treasures of the land , and a kind of cruelty toward the people . And I think the discrepancy between these young sophisticated people in the streets and these old autocrats , we are seeing a crisis of the civilization in front of us . BLITZER : Fouad Ajami knows a lot about the Middle East for disclosure . He was my professor of Middle East Studies at Johns Hopkins University . Professor , thanks so much . We always learn from you and we hope to be learning for many , many more years . Thanks very much for coming . AJAMI : Thank you very much , Wolf . BLITZER : Let 's go back to Anderson . Anderson , you 've been there now , what -- only a few hours , but give us your biggest impression . We flew in this morning . And it was interesting just flying in , obviously the airport is congested with people trying to get out . It 's a little surreal to me coming into the place that everyone is trying to leave from . It 's sort of -- I guess we 're all pretty used to it here at CNN though . But I talked to an American couple there who had been stuck for 48 hours . They were trying to get a flight to India . Finally , they just gave up . They were trying to -- decided to just go back into the city of Cairo . Not sure what they are going to do or how they are going to get out . We now know the U.S. is going to start voluntary evacuations of American citizens on this day , on Monday , but again the organization is unclear . And it 's really unclear , Wolf , what 's going to happen over the next couple of hours . Really , as Ben Wedeman said earlier , this is happening so fast , no one can really predict , Wolf . BLITZER : It 's really going to be fluid and we 're going to watch it every step of the way . CNN will have complete coverage . CNN International as well . Stay with us for all the latest developments on the uprising in Egypt . Thanks very much for watching .

We 'll ask a top executive why the Mubarak government has retaliated against the Arab satellite channel . The uprising in Egypt not only took the world by surprise , it strained the resources of a media establishment that has cut way back on national coverage in places like Tunisia and Egypt . We 'll examine the challenges of keeping pace with this fast-moving story and how Cairo 's authoritarian regime has tried to undermine the street protests by shutting down Facebook , Twitter and the Internet itself . Plus , CNN takes some heat for airing Michele Bachmann 's speech to a Tea Party group which was not the official Republican response to the State of the Union . Did she deserve the air time ? And President Obama names Jay Carney , a career journalist , as his new spokesman . Can a former `` TIME '' magazine reporter tame the jackals of the press ? I 'm Howard Kurtz , and this is RELIABLE SOURCES . There are fewer Western journalists in the Middle East today than a decade or two ago , but that 's not the only reason the political explosion in Egypt took just about everyone by surprise . Hosni Mubarak 's regime has always been portrayed in the press as stable . The country never before seen as a simmering -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- of tension . But as tens of thousands poured into the Cairo streets , news organizations tried strenuously to cover and make sense of the fast - moving events . That challenge made considerably harder by the government shutting down Internet and , for a time , limiting satellite and cell phone service . An Egyptian journalist for the BBC describes what happened to him . ASSAD SAWEY , REPORTER , BBC ARABIC : They were targeting journalists deliberately . They took my camera . And when they arrested me , they started beating me up with steel bars , the ones used here for animals , for slaughtering animals . And it 's been really , really brutal . Police are very , very brutal . I 'm going to hospital shortly . KURTZ : NBC 's Richard Engel had an unexpected visitor during a live shot . RICHARD ENGEL , NBC NEWS CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT : We have now reached the main square here in downtown Cairo . People are being injured . We 've seen several collapses so far today like this man . KURTZ : Joining us now to talk about the coverage of this breaking story and the role of the social media networks , here in Washington , Jeffrey Goldberg , national correspondent for `` The Atlantic '' ; Laura Rozen , of Politico , who writes the blog on foreign policy . In Atlanta , Mohammed Jamjoom , international correspondent for CNN ; and in Zurich , Jeff Jarvis , who runs the blog `` Buzz Machine '' and directs the Interactive Journalism Program at the SUNY University of New York . Jeffrey Goldberg , as I said , this uprising in Egypt seems to have taken even veteran foreign correspondents by surprise , now trying to put together the pieces of something that almost no one saw coming . JEFFREY GOLDBERG , NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT , `` THE ATLANTIC '' : It 's actually unbelievable , because long term , everyone knew that this regime was n't viable , and yet -- KURTZ : But I did n't see that reflected in the coverage . GOLDBERG : It 's interesting , is n't it ? I think part of it goes to your point about not having a -- the numbers of reporters that we used to have in the Arab world in the Arab world . And also , by the way , because of that , and partially because of that , you do n't have the same amount of coverage on the nightly news , you do n't have the same amount of coverage in newspapers anymore . So , I mean , most things are going to come to us as surprises these days . KURTZ : Laura Rozen , you ca n't predict the unpredictable , of course , but with these cutbacks , especially at the networks , news organizations just have fewer boots on the ground in places like the Middle East . LAURA ROZEN , `` POLITICO '' : Right . And it 's a vacuum that Al Jazeera English has totally stepped into , with many of us having it live-streaming from events in Cairo on our computers Thursday , Friday and Saturday , transfixed . KURTZ : That addiction may end because of Egypt now trying to kick Al Jazeera out of the country . We 'll talk to the Washington bureau chief in just a moment . Let me go to Atlanta , Mohammed Jamjoom . This battle , of course , playing out in the streets . We 've all been watching this , glued to our sets . But playing out on the Internet as well . And when the Egyptian authorities crack down on the Internet -- and I have read estimates that 93 percent of Egyptians can no longer get online -- how effective has that ban been ? How is it that some people , for example , are still managing to send Twitter messages ? MOHAMMED JAMJOOM , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , Howard , it 's been fascinating to see basically what the reaction was after the shutdown , because what you were seeing was not just people in the region , but people worldwide , online activism movements that were basically tweeting out and putting out social media messages for the Egyptian people on how they could circumvent the Internet blockage , because as you said , it 's about 93 percent blocked , it has been since Thursday , in the overnight hours , and it does n't look like it 's getting better any time soon . We were seeing people tweeting from places like Yemen , where there is n't a lot of Twitter activity , giving numbers for ISPs in France so that people could use dial-up modems to get back online . A lot of online activists have been putting out messages on other ways they can do it , maybe even using Ham radio technology so that people in Egypt could continue to get the message out via social media even though the Internet was blocked . So it 's just been absolutely fascinating to see this -- Howard . KURTZ : People can be very inventive when they need to be . Jeff Jarvis , we 've reached a point where Hillary Clinton urged Cairo not to shut down social media , and Robert Gibbs , the White House spokesman , tweeting the other day , `` Government must respect the rights of the Egyptian people and turn on social networking and the Internet . '' So , is Internet access now a human right ? JEFFREY JARVIS , `` BUZZ MACHINE '' : I think it 's exactly that , Howard . And it 's somewhat ironic in the fact that the U.S. government has been trying to shut down WikiLeaks . I think that the right to connect now becomes a fundamental human right , and the problem here , as we see , that government is the single point of failure for the Internet , whether that 's the kill switch , as Egypt has used it , or whether that 's the fact that they control the structure for the Internet . And so our future , the means by which we 're going to build the next society , is vulnerable here , and that worries me . At the same time , I celebrate the fact that our people in a nation can use these tools to take charge . GOLDBERG : But Howard , there 's something very interesting going on here , which is I think the moment that the Egyptian government lost its international credibility was when it shut down social media . I mean , I think this is -- KURTZ : The Twitter factor , is that important ? GOLDBERG : I think the Twitter factor is actually important in people 's understanding around the world . In other words , trying to suppress this revolution by shutting down Twitter , they completely undermined whatever legitimacy they had internationally . I think it was a turning point . KURTZ : You are certainly familiar with the region . You 've been to Egypt . In fact , I 'm told 11 years ago , you witnessed some violence in Egypt while you were there . GOLDBERG : No , no , no. . I got caught up in a riot 11 years ago during the Arab League summit . And it 's not a fun place to be , during an Egyptian riot , because the police , not the army , but the police are quite brutal , and they are very , very quick with tear gas . There were a lot of reporters tear-gassed the day I was there . I escaped into a Kentucky Fried Chicken which was then looted . That was the only reason I stayed out of the tear gas at that moment . KURTZ : It sounds like a harrowing moment . I want to ask you , Laura Rozen , about now that this has become the story dominating television and everywhere else , we have people with shows who maybe are not Middle East experts talking about what they think . Let me play a clip from `` The O'Reilly Factor '' from the other night on Fox . LT. COL. RALPH PETERS , FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR : Mubarak has conned us . He 's done stuff for us , but we 've done a lot more for him . We 've helped him stay in power . And he 's going . Whether or not he survives this immediate crisis -- BILL O'REILLY , `` THE O'REILLY FACTOR '' : No , he 's going . PETERS : -- he 's a dead man walking . KURTZ : Now , I do n't know what 's going to happen in Egypt . Should pundits be speculating like it was some presidential primary about whether Mubarak is going to be toppled or not ? ROZEN : Well , it has been striking how this has become -- this international story has become the major domestic political story of the past four days . And you 've seen , you know , normal punditry talking about domestic politics and the State of the Union , turning their attention to the political dynamics of Cairo , which they may not know as much about as some of the experts you 've had on . So it has been striking . KURTZ : Let me go back to Mohammed Jamjoom and ask you this question . You know , it is easier for those of us who are not there , for those of us who are sitting at computers , to follow some of this story on places like Twitter and Facebook , despite the crackdown , despite the reduced traffic . I wonder if that maybe leads us to overestimate the role that these social networks play in what 's going on there . For example , it 's not a representative sample of the country . People on Twitter are probably younger , more activists , perhaps more anti- government . JAMJOOM : Oh , that 's right , Howard . And that 's a debate that has been going on for days now . And it started with what went on in Tunisia . A lot of people have been asking in the region and outside the region , does social media really play an integral factor in this ? What we can say is that in the case of Egypt , it really played a critical factor in getting out the word on how to organize , on how to meet up . People were using Twitter and sites like Facebook to organize . There was one group in Egypt that was one of the key groups getting people out in the streets . Last week , in a matter of days , they went from 20,000 fans of that page to 80,000 fans . That 's just in one day , the traffic increased that much . Now , we can see these sites were used in order to get the word out how to bypass checkpoints , how to get across bridges , how to get to places where people wanted to demonstrate . So it was a critical tool in getting people out into the streets , getting supporters of the movement out there . But as you see , even after the Internet shutdown , people are still out there en masse . It 's growing day by day . Clearly , a popular uprising , a lot of anger . And the fact that the Internet was shut down added fuel to the fire . But people are angry with the regime there , they are getting out . So we ca n't say yet that it 's the whole reason that this is happening , but obviously it played a big role in getting people out there , getting the message across . ROZEN : Similarly , Al Jazeera was reporting on Friday that 60 percent of its traffic was come from the United States on Friday , people watching the Cairo uprising . And you could see -- sorry . The only point I would make in response to that is we 've had revolutions before Twitter -- KURTZ : I was about to ask that . GOLDBERG : -- and Facebook . The Iranian Revolution , 1979 . The American and French revolutions , by the way , no technology whatsoever . KURTZ : No Twitter then , no Facebook . GOLDBERG : No Twitter in 1789 or 1776 . So -- JARVIS : Howie , can I jump in there ? KURTZ : Let me get Jeff Jarvis in there . JARVIS : Well , you know , I 'm researching my next book called `` Public Parts , '' and I 'm finding this debate about the chicken and egg question of Twitter and revolutions is not unlike that around Gutenberg 's press and the Reformation . It 's really a rather meaningless debate . The point is , if the Internet did n't matter , the Egyptian government would n't have been fueled necessarily to shut it down . China would not have today blocked Twitter-like searches for the word `` Egypt . '' It 's not as if -- as a blogger said in Egypt on Al Jazeera , `` Twitter did n't attack the police , the people did . '' People -LRB- AUDIO GAP -RRB- tools of transparency and organization are unquestionably having a role . KURTZ : Let me ask you , Jeffrey Goldberg , before we go to break , do you have a sense in this media coverage that journalists -- and it 's subtle , but that journalists are kind of rooting for the protesters , there 's not great sympathy for Hosni Mubarak , and perhaps not fully examining that , depending on how this goes , we could end up with an Islamic regime in Egypt that we might like less than Mubarak ? GOLDBERG : Well , we 're completely in uncharted waters right now . I do n't necessarily think that we 're going to end up with the Muslim Brotherhood regime . They only have the support of a minority of Egyptians . On the other hand , no one knows what 's going to happen . You asked about punditry . It 's very dangerous to punditize at this moment , because the Egyptians are in uncharted waters . It 's a chaotic situation . GOLDBERG : And yes , of course people are sympathetic to the underdog . I mean , that 's -- look , let 's not make believe that journalists do n't axiomatically side intuitively or emotionally with the underdog . And these people on the streets seem like the underdog . And especially , they 're going up against the guy who has forcibly held power for almost three decades . GOLDBERG : For Americans , 30-year presidencies do n't sit well with us . That 's not a good American idea . KURTZ : All right . Let me get a break . Coming up at noon Eastern , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will talk to Candy Crowley to give the administration 's view of these fast-moving events . We will be back to talk about just how much interest there is in this country in international events , at least when there are n't riots in the streets . KURTZ : We are continuing our coverage of the uprising in Egypt . And Jeff Jarvis , in Zurich , when Tunisia 's president was forced from office just about 10 days ago or so , it got a lot of newspaper coverage . I would n't say it was a huge television story . And I 'm wondering what you think about this . Do most television executives and producers believe that Americans do n't care about international events unless there 's riots in the streets or American troops are involved or American hostages are involved ? JARVIS : Well , Howie , I like what I just heard a moment ago , that it 's hard to punditize in these uncharted waters . I think part of the problem in this story , or these stories , is that the normal structure we know is n't what 's leading the story . It 's not a government media structure . It is an entirely new kind of power structure , quite uncharted , that comes out of the this ability of people to organize . And I think that story will become so compelling to people , and the debate around who 's really in charge , that it will become more important . JARVIS : Yes , I think it is a failing of national -LRB- AUDIO GAP -RRB- care about the world , we do . KURTZ : Do you think , Jeffrey Goldberg , that Americans and journalists , Western journalists , do care more about Egypt not only because it 's a big and important country , but because of the peace treaty with Israel and how that could be in play , depending on what happens here ? GOLDBERG : Look , Egypt is the center of the Arab world . It 's the most populated country . It 's a country we understand historically . We 've been engaged there for a long time . And yes , I think when people think about it for 10 seconds , they understand that the entire stability of the eastern Mediterranean is due , in fact , to the Israel\\/Egypt peace treaty , which was , of course , brokered by the United States . We know what happened -- you look at that area of the Middle East in the last 30 years , versus the Persian Gulf area , Iraq , Iran , and you can say , wow , the stability -- maybe artificial stability we 've had -- has been hugely important to us , and now we 're headed kind of off a cliff . We do n't know where we 're going . KURTZ : Come back to your point earlier about -- you said it was pretty obvious that at some point , Mubarak would not be able to hold on to power . I 'm not talking about this week . And yet , at the same time , I read all these stories , I watch television , and I have very rarely seen even hints of that . Is there a fear of going out on a limb ? GOLDBERG : It 's a fear of going out on a limb . Also -- but this goes directly to your point about the lack of foreign coverage . To me it 's interesting , to you it 's interesting , to Laura it 's interesting to go out and interview jobless Egyptians , and look at the youth bulge in Egypt , and talk about how young men are so frustrated , they do n't have enough money to get married . But that does not make compelling television , for one thing . That 's a serious kind of long , investigative , almost , sort of story . That 's not going to -- that kind of story does n't sail too well anymore . KURTZ : And it 's a gray area . It 's not heroes and villains . It 's not a clear plot . I mean , except now , when you have -- KURTZ : How difficult has it been , Laura Rozen , as a reporter covering the story here in Washington , to find out what they are really saying and thinking and planning and strategizing at the State Department , at the White House , which seems to be reacting to events in the last 72 hours ? ROZEN : Very much . I mean , it 's been quite interesting . There actually have been a group of Middle East experts and foreign policy establishment figures who , for a year now , have been pushing the Obama administration to prepare for the post-Mubarak era , and senators who have been trying to push Egypt for reforms . And it 's gotten stories , but it does n't rise to the top of the agenda until you have a drama like this . KURTZ : And when you 're in a drama like this , how hard is it for you to -- do they want to push a message out ? How hard is it for you to find out what officials are saying privately ? ROZEN : Their message is we 're meeting on it . You know , Obama met for an hour yesterday . The national security principals met for two hours yesterday . We 're on it . They 've been trying to be neutral in an event where it 's very hard for the United States to look neutral because they give so much -- you know , $ 1.5 billion a year to Mubarak . KURTZ : Is this not calibrating a little more distance from the Mubarak regime than at the beginning ? ROZEN : Either giving -- you can see every day , similar to the Iran protests a year and a half ago , that the administration 's getting pushed now to distance themselves from Mubarak . KURTZ : And before we go , Mohammed Jamjoom , let me come back to the question of social media networks . `` The New York Times '' had an interesting piece this weekend saying that just as Twitter or Facebook can be very effective as an organizing tool , it makes it easier for an authoritarian government to track down dissidents by following the electronic trail . JAMJOOM : Oh , that 's right , Howard . And that 's one of the things that 's key in trying to cover this , is trying to focus on if these people that have been tweeting out , or using Facebook , being online activists in the region , if they are being harassed -- I mean , we have seen many times in the course of the past few years groups like the Committee to Protect Journalists or Human Rights Watch really condemning authoritarian regimes in that region for their mistreatment , alleged abuses of bloggers , of social media users . We 've seen it repeatedly happen in Saudi Arabia . We 've seen a lot of allegations of abuse in Egypt as well . And so there 's a real risk for these people that are out there . Even though they might be caught up in the moment , and even though a lot of the bloggers that are in Egypt that have been utilizing Twitter so much have been saying this is our moment and we need to go out into the streets as much as possible now , even though we 're in danger , the fact of the matter is they could be in danger -- Howard . KURTZ : All right . Thank you very much , Mohammed Jamjoom . Jeff Jarvis , over in Zurich , Jeffrey Goldberg , Laura Rozen , thanks for joining us . Ahead , we 'll talk to the Washington bureau chief of Al Jazeera about the sudden ban by Egyptian authorities in that country . And we 'll also talk some political coverage , State of the Union , Michele Bachmann . It 's all ahead on RELIABLE SOURCES . KURTZ : Since the crisis in Egypt erupted , one network has provided more exhaustive coverage than anyone else . That would be the Arab satellite channel Al Jazeera . That may be about to change , getting word this morning that Egyptian authorities trying to basically kick Al Jazeera out of the country , close its offices , yank its accreditation . Here 's some of what Al Jazeera 's coverage has looked like on the air . DAN NOLAN , AL JAZEERA ENGLISH : Down here , on the grounds of this compound , you can see that every vehicle in sight here has been set alight by protesters . They stormed this compound last night , they did n't spare any vehicle . There must be 50 vehicles in total . All of them have been torched by protesters furious with President Mubarak . KURTZ : That clip obviously from Al Jazeera English . And joining us now to talk about these developments is the Washington bureau chief , Abderrahim Foukara . Thank you very much for coming in . ABDERRAHIM FOUKARA , WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF , AL JAZEERA : Nice to be with you . KURTZ : Why was Al Jazeera singled out by Egyptian authorities ? I mean , the BBC is there , CNN is there , there are other television operations there . And yet , they are trying to -- Egyptian authorities are trying to basically exclude you from any further coverage . Well , Al Jazeera 's coverage of these events is , as you said in your introduction , the most comprehensive in the region . We 've seen a similar situation in Tunisia . The coverage of recent events in Tunisia has really provided millions and millions of people around the region to see what was actually going on in Tunisia , and taking into consideration that what 's going on in Egypt was actually , in some ways , sparked by what was going on -- what happened in Tunisia . And then you begin to get the picture of why the Egyptian government has done what it 's done . KURTZ : The state-run television in Egypt has said that Al Jazeera has been lying , exaggerating . The number of protesters , for example , that we 're seeing this morning at Tahrir Square , they 're saying there are really only hundreds there , though the CNN estimate was 10,000 . So you 're being attacked on journalistic grounds . FOUKARA : Well , I mean , this is not a new situation with Al Jazeera . We 've seen this in many different parts of the Arab world , where the governments of various countries go in one direction , but the viewers in that same country go in a different direction . Al Jazeera has been accused of incitement , for example , in Iraq in 2004 , and the U.S. offices were closed down . They continue to be closed down . Now we 're seeing this in Egypt . The fact of the situation remains that for Arabs , for more than any other viewership in the world , this is a crucial story . And for the Egyptian government , no matter what its grievances are with Al Jazeera , to shut down its operations in Egypt , it 's something to seriously think about . KURTZ : You talk about incitement . Bill O'Reilly , on Fox News the other day , said that Al Jazeera is spurring on this revolt and encouraging uprisings all over the Muslim world . FOUKARA : Well , look , what 's -- the coverage of Al Jazeera is being criticized by some governments , it 's being criticized by people outside of the United States . But to the people who are actually demonstrating , whether in Tunis or in Cairo or in Yemen or in Jordan , is a source of reliable information not only if what goes on in their own countries , but what goes on in the neighborhood . So we may differ with certain governments on the definition of what trustworthy coverage is . The fact of the situation is that the viewership , the people who are directly involved in these events , they come to Al Jazeera because that 's where they feel with some trust they can air their grievances and their aspirations . KURTZ : Ironically , one of the reasons that Al Jazeera is barely a presence on the airwaves in the United States is because of criticism that it 's been pro-Arab and anti-American . I 'm sure you would reject that , but , of course , the Arab position is not always uniform , as we 're seeing in Egypt . Is it fair to say your journalists are not only better connected with , say , those involved in this Egyptian protest , but are sympathetic to those who are trying to topple what has been an authoritarian regime for nearly three decades ? FOUKARA : Well , the viewership , but certainly the protesters -- look , Al Jazeera has invested in gaining the trust of its viewers around the Middle East for over a decade . KURTZ : You 're there all the time , not just -- FOUKARA : We 're there all the time . In times of crisis , I mean , even in Egypt , you would see that local television stations can compete and have been able to compete with Al Jazeera in normal times . But in times of crisis , whether it 's the situation in Tunisia , or in Gaza , or in Iraq , most of them flock to Al Jazeera . KURTZ : What about my question about whether your journalists are sympathetic to people who are trying to gain some measure of freedom ? FOUKARA : Well , the message of Al Jazeera has been that we are actually going to provide a platform for people who want to air their grievances and their aspirations right across the spectrum . Al Jazeera would tell you -- and the coverage shows , too , whatever extent you want to determine it -- that they also give a platform to people who want to criticize it ; namely , governments in the region . KURTZ : And these are people who often do n't have a platform , which is why folks like the authorities in Egypt seem angry at Al Jazeera . I mean , it 's just a question of who do you trust ? Obviously , governments do not trust Al Jazeera much . But the people , the viewership , and now , especially , the protesters , they certainly do see in it a way of getting the message across not to their fellow citizens -- not just to their fellow citizens , but to Arabs elsewhere in the region . KURTZ : I 'm coming up on a break . But I 've got to ask you , to what extent will Al Jazeera be able to continue to cover this crisis in Egypt if the offices are closed , the phone lines are cut , if the satellite privileges are denied ? FOUKARA : It is a problem , but it 's -- as I said earlier , it 's a problem that Al Jazeera has experienced in the past , and it learned to adapt to it . Al Jazeera will continue to cover events in Egypt either by inviting people from outside of Egypt to come and give their opinions on what 's going on , but it 's also through its network of contacts inside Egypt who may not necessarily provide information on air , but they will provide it off air . KURTZ : Abderrahim Foukara , thank you very much for coming in this morning . Coming up in the second part of RELIABLE SOURCES , we 'll look at former `` TIME '' correspondent Jay Carney taking on the job of White House spokesman . Plus , Michele Bachmann gets almost as much attention after the State of the Union as President Obama . And CNN is getting flak for airing her response . Later , we 'll take a break from protests and politics with this story -- why did sportswriters rough up a Chicago Bears quarterback who insisted he was hurt ? KURTZ : When it comes to cable news , all members of Congress are n't created equal . On the left , Democratic Congressman Alan Grayson , who just lost his seat , got plenty of exposure on MSNBC for saying such things as the Republican health plan for sick people is `` die quickly . '' On the right , Republican Congresswoman Michele Bachmann became a Fox News star -- she occasionally pops up on other channels as well -- for saying such things as Barack Obama may have anti-American views . But more incendiary is why the bookers go after them . So when a brainy , budget-cutting hawk , Paul Ryan , delivered the official GOP response to the president 's State of the Union , it was Bachmann who made news by making a video appearance for the Tea Party Express thanks , in part , to this network . WOLF BLITZER , CNN ANCHOR : I just want to remind our viewers , the only place they 'll see on television that speech live , Michele Bachmann 's Tea Party speech , will be right here on CNN . REP. MICHELE BACHMANN -LRB- R -RRB- , MINNESOTA : After the 7 $ 700 billion bailout , the trillion-dollar stimulus , and the massive budget bill with over 9,000 earmarks , many of you implored Washington to please stop spending money that we do n't have . RACHEL MADDOW , MSNBC : But tonight , inexplicably , a national news network decided that they would give Michele Bachmann a job that her own party never did . CNN ran it live on their network . They aired it on national TV . A remarkable act of journalistic intervention to elevate , in effect , at group with which they are cosponsoring a presidential debate , to elevate that group to the level of the major parties in this country . KURTZ : So what did the good folks at MSNBC spend the next day talking about ? I 'll give you a hint . It was n't Paul Ryan . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Everybody in this room has probably looked at the wrong camera . LAWRENCE O'DONNELL , MSNBC : You know , I 've got a room full of cameras here , and I feel like this could happen to me at any moment . CHRIS MATTHEWS , MSNBC : Did she skip the entire financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 ? KURTZ : So did CNN make a mistake in airing Bachmann 's speech ? Joining us now to talk about that , and the way most pundits handled the president 's State of the Union , Margaret Carlson , columnist for Bloomberg News and Washington editor of `` The Week '' magazine ; Michael Shear of `` The New York Times , '' the lead writer for `` The Caucus '' blog ; and Jim Geraghty , contributing editor at `` National Review . '' So , Margaret , did CNN elevate Bachmann unfairly , as Rachel Maddow says ? MARGARET CARLSON , BLOOMBERG NEWS : Well , Bachmann makes herself news . I mean , she 's -- the Republicans create people like Michael Steele and Sarah Palin and Bachmann . She belongs to the Bachmann party . She is on her own . She always makes news . She 's always colorful . She 's always incendiary . And we cover news , and she 's always willing to make it . KURTZ : Jim Geraghty , if journalists are going to talk about Bachmann all the time , then what 's the big deal for CNN to give her five minutes for that video so that people could see what it is they would then be debating ? JIM GERAGHTY , CONTRIBUTING EDITOR , `` NATIONAL REVIEW '' : Well , I think it 's worth noting , this is really the first year -- maybe you could argue last year -- that any type of Tea Party response would be justified . Before then , there just was n't this kind of social movement . I think if nothing else , novelty justified putting it on the air and just seeing how people responded to it . Now , my fear is , you know , a year from now , the Coffee Party will want to have its response , the progressive -- everybody and their brother -- GERAGHTY : Exactly . Everybody and their brother will say , well , look , I represent a separate faction that my own party does n't speak for me . Thus , I 'm going to need my own separate five minutes . And before you know it , it will be a weeklong celebration of State of the Union responses . KURTZ : Well , good luck with that . CNN saying in a statement , `` The Tea Party 's become a major force in American politics , '' to your point , `` and within the Republican Party . So , therefore , hearing the Tea Party 's perspective on the State of the Union was something that would benefit viewers . '' And I do n't disagree with that at all . But what explains this media fixation with Michele Bachmann ? She 's not part of the leadership . She is colorful , to be sure . MICHAEL SHEAR , `` THE CAUCUS '' BLOG : Look , I think , you know , I , as all journalists , love the fascination of waiting to see what she might say , and that it might be newsy and over the top . But I think there 's a serious point here , too , which is that she represents what is a broader story about the divisions within the Republican Party . And there 's serious divisions . It 's going to be a story from now and throughout the 2010 campaign , and I think showing that helps readers , reviewer understand what that division might be . KURTZ : And Paul Ryan , who actually has a serious and controversial deficit-cutting plan , nobody was talking about him for the next 48hours . He 's probably not that happy . Turning now to the State of the Union , I want to show you some of the pundit reaction . And I would have to describe it as tepid . MADDOW : The mood of tonight 's speech was somewhat subdued right from the start . CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER , FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR : It was like late Clintonian minimalism . This , I think , was one of his weakest speeches . He tried hard , but it was flat , I thought , uninspired . ROLAND MARTIN , CNN POLITICAL ANALYST : Not one mention of the poor in this speech . Not even a mention of the middle class in this speech . KURTZ : So , Margaret Carlson , the pundits , on balance , were pretty unenthusiastic , but the public loved it , 84-93 percent in a CNN and a CBS poll , giving positive marks to the president . What accounts for that split ? CARLSON : This is a split you always get . Remember , during Clinton , every speech was a laundry list . The public wants to know , oh , what 's going to happen to my mortgage ? Oh , what 's going to happen to my -- they like specifics . On this one , the same thing happened , although I did n't find this -- if you 're judging this within State of the Union , it was n't a bad speech . It had a beginning , a middle , and an end . The ending , I thought , was really quite good , where he talks about the small businessman who builds the drill , takes it to Chile , it rescues the miner , but the guy who did it left because he did n't want to take attention away from the miners . And he used that to say we can do big things . And then he did that refrain . And it ended unlike Paul Ryan , on this upbeat note . I thought it was one of the best State of the Unions I ever heard . KURTZ : Jim Geraghty probably not going to endorse that view . But I 'd like to know your thoughts on why it seems that people often like these speeches -- and this was true under Bush as well -- a lot more than the professional commentariat . One of my old mentors who I nicknamed `` Obi-Wan Kenobi '' says Americans like to see the president being the president . Go out in the Rose Garden , go out and address whatever major issue of the day it is . When you give the State of the Union , everyone 's standing , they 're applauding . They 're reacting to you as if you 're presidential leadership , even if the speech is flawed . Now , even if you like it , I 'm going to ask you whether anybody 's going to really remember anything two weeks from now , or it will all be overtaken by what 's going on in Egypt , because Candy Crowley got her power back on , or whatever crisis of the day . I think people -- KURTZ : Well , it was a crisis when I did n't have my power on this week after a five-inch snowstorm here in the capital . But Michael Shear , you know , it seems to me you ca n't win . The pundits , before the speech , said these speeches are always a laundry list . We do n't want a laundry list . Well , Obama did n't really do a laundry list . He did a more thematic speech , and the reaction in some corners , as well , was , too vague , he did n't have any specifics . I mean , in some ways , it was the Obama administration 's attempt to move to the middle not on the political spectrum , but on the spectrum of how these speeches are traditionally done . And so it was kind of a little bit of specifics , enough to satisfy the public , a little bit of thematic , enough to kind of step back a little bit and be above it all . KURTZ : But maybe it was also a slight move to the middle politically , five-year spending freeze , talking about torte reform and medical cases , and maybe the liberal media did n't like it that much . SHEAR : Well , although , interestingly enough , if you talk to the right , they do n't see it as I 'm sure -- CARLSON : Yes . KURTZ : But it 's different than in good times , when you stand up and you say , I say we go to the moon and we have lots of new expensive programs . Well , the person who will be defending the president in just a couple of weeks is Jay Carney , former `` TIME '' magazine correspondent , now the communications director for Vice President Biden . Here 's what he had to say a while ago about the job he 'll now be inheriting . JIM CARNEY , INCOMING WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY : The best press secretaries were very deft at serving both their boss , the president , the White House , the administration , and the press , and not -- it 's a tricky job . I 'm sure I would n't be any good at it . KURTZ : Margaret Carlson , you 're a former colleague of Jay Carney 's . You 're a friend of his . Will he be any good at it ? Well , I know Robert Gibbs , and he 's no Robert Gibbs . And he will be able to cross over a bit . I mean , he will be able to straddle these two worlds , as he has shown he can do with Joe Biden . He 's almost , like , too nice to be in journalism . And people do like him almost inordinately . I think he 'll do it really well , just the way he did Biden . KURTZ : But can a career journalist be partisan enough ? Because people in the White House , undoubtedly , when there are leaks , will suspect him of being a media sympathizer . GERAGHTY : Linda Douglass did it . There are plenty of former reporters who have ended up on this . And I 've got to say , you know , can he handle the pressure or the stresses of the job ? I figure at some point , being Joe Biden 's press secretary was going to show up on Mike Rowe 's `` Dirty Jobs . '' In other words , if you can handle cleaning up the messes or the inevitable PR explosions that occur when Joe Biden goes before the cameras , I imagine this is going to be the truest kind of step into a more relaxing role as White House press secretary . KURTZ : But as White House press secretary , this is really the first working reporter since Ron Nessen was named by Gerald Ford in 1974 . Tony Snow was a commentator . Usually , presidents like political PR professionals . So this is going to be a different experience for the press ? I mean , from all we can tell , the White House specifically wanted a journalist . And Bill Daley , the new White House chief of staff , wanted a journalist . And there have been a lot of grumblings in the White House , as there always are in the press corps , about relations with the White House press office . And so this is going to be a different approach . And he 's going to have to prove to the press corps that he 's got the kind of access , that he knows what he 's talking about . He 's not really an Obama intimate , and so he 's going to have to get into that mix and show that he can -- KURTZ : I want you all to call me when Carney starts yelling at you about your stories , and we 'll know he 's made the transition . Jim Geraghty , Michael Shear , Margaret Carlson , thanks for joining us . Coming up at noon Eastern , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will talk to Candy Crowley about the unfolding events in Egypt . Coming up next on this program , roughing the passer . Sportswriters slammed Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler for taking himself out of a championship game . It turns out they were dead wrong . I 'll throw the flag on this one . KURTZ : Professional sports tends to be a macho world , especially pro football . And most especially with the Super Bowl on the line . So when quarterback Jay Cutler took himself out of the Chicago Bears lineup in last Sunday 's NFC championship game against the Green Bay Packers , the sportswriters and commentators practically booed him off the field for saying he was injured . `` The San Francisco Examiner '' : `` Many Bears fans in the Windy City are giving Cutler the one-finger salute , and it ai n't with a pinky . '' Yahoo Sports : `` He walked onto the field in the second half after he supposedly injured his knee . So was he hurt ? Unless an MRI scheduled for this week says his ACL is torn to shreds , it 's going to be hard for Bears fans to believe he was . '' Well , the MRI exam showed that Cutler suffered a serious knee injury . What does that say about the sport 's loudmouths ? Joining us now from Las Vegas , Jason Whitlock , national columnist for FoxSports.com . And Jason , let me read from your column . You say , and I quote , `` I apologize . I 'm at guilty as anybody . '' What are you pleading guilty to ? JASON WHITLOCK , FOXSPORTS.COM : Well , that column was about not lifting the conversation about Jay Cutler where it needed to be . I think that the initial criticism of Cutler was about toughness , and I think the kid had already proven his toughness . The conversation needed to focus on his mental makeup and whether Jay Cutler has the right mental frame of mind to be a quarterback in the NFL . Because even with the injury that he had , other players , other quarterbacks have found a way to gut it out , give a better effort , and try to play in that game . And Jay Cutler seemed to appear to mentally check out of that game . And so I was apologizing for not taking the conversation to a higher level . KURTZ : All right . You know , we talked earlier on the program in a much more serious context about the role of Facebook and Twitter in the Egyptian uprising . You bring up Facebook and Twitter in this same column . You say that `` Cutler got overrun by a social media flash mob . '' In other words , he was getting savaged on these social media sites . I think that 's where we 're at in the sports world . I think it happened to LeBron James after his off-season decision about going to the Miami Heat . People take to Twitter . Athletes -- Jay Cutler 's peers in the National Football League took to Twitter and savaged him over Twitter . And I think we need to be careful in the media in taking athletes or anyone at their exact word on Twitter . It 's only 140 characters . You ca n't express a full opinion . You ca n't really express half an opinion . Twitter is easily misinterpreted . We have people that are n't seasoned communicators on Twitter saying inexact things , not really what they really mean , but all they can think to say at that time . KURTZ : But you 're on -- WHITLOCK : And so sometimes in the media we have to step back . KURTZ : But you 're on Twitter all the time . Are you expressing one quarter of opinions given the space limitations ? I tell people , you know , enjoy my Twitter feed , judge my columns . Because in my columns , I can say what I really think . Over Twitter , you really only have a chance to be sarcastic or snarky . It 's not a place to express full opinions . KURTZ : All right . Well , whether it 's on Twitter , or in a column , or on television , the fact is the sportswriters here were wrong . People were piling on this guy , saying he was n't really injured , and he was injured . And I have n't heard anybody apologize to him . WHITLOCK : Well , I do n't think people were saying he was n't really injured , because , trust me , in the National Football League , guys play hurt all the time . I think people -- there is a difference between being injured and being hurt , and I think people were saying maybe Jay Cutler was just hurt and he should have figured out a way to keep playing or give a better effort to try to keep playing . Listen , guys in the National Football League , guys in NBA , guys in Major League Baseball play with hurt all the time . They play with slight MCL , ACL sprains all the time . KURTZ : And on that point -- WHITLOCK : I think some of his -- KURTZ : On that point , before we go -- I did n't mean to cut you off there -- I mean , you played football at Ball State . And you were -- once played 11 games with a torn ACL . KURTZ : Did that influence your view of the Jay Cutler situation with the Bears ? WHITLOCK : It influences my view in terms of I 'm -- just because the Bears have come out and said he had a grade 2 MCL tear , I 'm not going to just take them at their word . You know , team doctors -- any time you 're playing sports for a lot of money , there is a lot of pressure on the guys to get back out on the field . There 's a lot of pressure on the doctors to get players back out on the field . And so my situation as a college football player makes me skeptical of anything that a doctor says . Always get a second , third , fourth opinion . I 'm just not going to accept what a team tells me . KURTZ : All right . Got to get you off the field now , but Jason Whitlock , we appreciate your getting up early to talk to us about this a week before the Super Bowl . KURTZ : Still to come on RELIABLE SOURCES , Salon fesses up to an error , a long-ago error . And can everyone please just stop with the Nazi analogies ? Bill O'Reilly versus Jon Stewart in our `` Media Monitor . '' KURTZ : Time now for the `` Media Monitor , '' our weekly look at the hits and errors in the news business . Here is what I liked . Salon stepping up to the plate and correcting an error , even if is five years late . The piece was by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , and it argued that a compound of vaccines was dangerous and linked , in his view , to autism in children . Days later , the Web site ran five corrections , but now the liberal site has deleted the piece entirely . This , in response to a book by Seth Mnookin called `` The Panic Virus . '' `` Rolling Stone , '' which published the same article in print , has also deleted it online . Salon 's new editor , Kerry Lauerman , made the decision , and former editor Joan Walsh was quoted as saying , `` I regret we did n't move on this more quickly as evidence continued to emerge debunking the vaccines and autism link . But continued revelations of the flaws and even fraud tainting the science behind the connection make taking down the story the right thing to do . '' I 'm not sure that digitally erasing the story is the right move . Maybe people should be able to look up the discredited article . And I 'm not taking a position here on the thorny autism debate . But I 'm glad Salon did n't sweep this one under the proverbial rug . Here 's what I did n't like . I thought media gave much of a pass last week to Democratic Congressman Steve Cohen when he used a most unfortunate historical analogy to describe the Republican attacks on Obamacare . -LRB- BEGIN VIDEO CLIP -RRB- REP. STEVE COHEN -LRB- D -RRB- , TENNESSEE : Just like Goebbels , you say it enough , you repeat the lie , you repeat the lie , you repeat the lie , and eventually people believe it . KURTZ : Yes , he went the Nazi route . But did you see a lot of reports on his inflammatory language ? I did n't either . MSNBC , which is so interested in Republican incivility , did n't do much , although Ed Schultz interviewed the Tennessee congressman , who eventually apologized . The network that really bashed Cohen by bringing up the Holocaust was Fox News . And I have no problem with that . But Jon Stewart did , especially after Fox anchor Megyn Kelly challenged the guest , who said such analogies were hardly unusual on Rupert Murdoch 's network . MEGYN KELLY , FOX NEWS : I do n't know if you sit and watch our programming every night , but I watch it every day , and you 're wrong . GLENN BECK , FOX NEWS : The real answer is the Nazis were using early American progressive tactics . And that 's not my opinion . That 's historic fact . O'REILLY : If you look back at what happened in Germany , you can not escape the similarities between what Hitler and his cut throats did back then and the hate-filled blogs , what they are doing now . JON STEWART , `` THE DAILY SHOW '' : Oh , Roger Ailes did it in a print interview , saying of the NPR executives who fired Juan Williams , `` They are , of course , Nazis . They have a kind of Nazi attitude . They are the left wing of Nazism . '' KURTZ : I remember that one since I did the interview . O'Reilly responded that `` The Daily Show '' selectively edited the clip , failing to show that he was responding to an ugly remark about Nancy Reagan by some commenter on `` The Huffington Post . '' O'REILLY : If he were a journalist , I would pound him into pudding . But he 's not . He 's a comedian . And as such , has license to take things out of context for entertainment purposes . STEWART : Hey , why do you use the Nazi reference ? It does n't really matter in this . The segment was to show , contrary to Ms. Kelly 's statement that it 's not the type of rhetoric used on Fox News , that it actually does appear quite frequently . That 's all it was . KURTZ : I , for one , would be much happier if everyone , pundits and politicians , just would swore off these Nazi analogies . By the way , MSNBC taking a step towards civility after Keith Olbermann 's departure . The network is ending Ed Schultz ' `` Psycho Talk '' segment in which the host accuses various conservatives of being kind of crazy . This was n't voluntary .

Welcome to all of you in the United States and around the world . I 'm Fareed Zakaria . We are devoting the entire show to Egypt today . Coming up in just minutes , we have an interview with Mohamed ElBaradei , the Egyptian opposition leader , Nobel laureate , who remains under house arrest . We 'll check in with reporters from around the region for the latest . And we have a terrific panel of diplomats and scholars to put it all in context . Plus , an exclusive , the British Prime Minister David Cameron 's thoughts on the events in Egypt . Now , first , let me give you my take . Egypt is one of the oldest countries in the world . It 's had roughly is same borders and capital city since 3,000 B.C. And it has always seen the embodiment of stability , a state ruled by pharaohs , with the bureaucracy that never budge . Now , Egypt is in the midst of enormous change . This may not be a revolution in a sense of a massive social transformation , but it is a revolt . The first Arab revolt was in 1916 against the Ottoman Empire that ruled most of the Arab lands . What is going on today in Tunisia and now Egypt is the second Arab revolt against the strong men who have ruled these lands for decades . Tunisia was the spark that led the fire . Television and the Internet and social media amplified and accelerated the forces of change . But in a strange sense , these forces might have been set in motion by the successes of the Tunisian and Egyptian regimes in recent years . You see , Tunisia and Egypt had been reforming their economies . This stimulated growth as a consequence . Tunisia have been growing at 5 percent a year and Egypt much faster than that . Economic growth stirs up expectations . It is this revolution of rising expectations that often undoes a dictatorship , because it is unable to handle the growing demands of its citizens . In Egypt , Hosni Mubarak 's regime had moved forward economically , but actually moved backward politically , rigging elections , jailing the opposition and signaling that the 82-year-old ailing dictator intended to stay in power for years . What should the United States do ? Many journalists and intellectuals are urging much stronger support for the movement on the streets and , obviously , we are all thrilled by the sight and sounds of the people on the streets of Cairo and Alexandria and all over Egypt demanding freedom . Everyone wants democracy and democracy in Egypt could be an earthquake in the Arab world . But President Obama does have to balance his support for democracy with the reality that Egypt has been a partner with America for over 30 years . Imagine the alternative -- that the first signs of street protests , the U.S. unceremoniously dumps a stalwart ally that has made peace with Israel , fought al-Qaeda , tried to moderate Hamas and brokered deals for the Palestinians . My solution would be that President Obama clearly and firmly , but privately , tell President Mubarak that he must resign , perhaps not immediately , but soon . His vice president must organize a new constitutional body to write a constitution for Egypt , with strong protections for individual rights , minority interests , freedom of the press , and then carefully set up a process for national elections . Obama does not need to call publicly for Mubarak 's resignation , but he does need to get him to go . America has been urging the Egyptian regime to reform for years , even decades . Hosni Mubarak never took these calls seriously . Had he done so , had he come out in front of these changes , had he come out in front of his people , he could have avoided this revolt . But that is the story of dictators . It is often too little too late . ZAKARIA : Mohamed ElBaradei is , perhaps after President Mubarak , the crucial figure in this story . After his leaving his post as head of the world 's nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency , he has devoted himself to agitating for change in Egypt , his home country . And how he is the most high-profile leader of the opposition movement in Egypt . He was put under house arrest on Friday , but is able to join me now from his home in Cairo . Thank you for joining us , Mohamed ElBaradei . MOHAMED ELBARADEI , FORMER IAEA DIRECTOR : It 's always a pleasure to be with you , Fareed . ZAKARIA : Mohamed , what do you make of the most recent moves by President Mubarak , appointing Omar Suleiman as his vice president , appointing another former army officer as the prime minister , the former aviation minister . What is your reaction ? ELBARADEI : Well , Fareed , I think this is hopeless , desperate attempts by Mubarak to stay in power . I think it is loud and clear from everybody in Egypt that Mubarak has to leave today , and it is non-negotiable for every Egyptian . People have been saying or demonstrating for his -- for him to leave . Today , the demonstrations say that he should be put to trial . If he wants to save his skin , if he has an iota of patriotism , I would advise him to leave today and save the country . ZAKARIA : And what would you like to see happen after that ? Let us say Mubarak resigns . What is the -- what are the next steps that must happen in Egypt ? ELBARADEI : Well , the next step , Fareed , as everybody now agrees on , is a transitional period , a government of national salvation , of national unity , and that will prepare the ground for a new constitution , free and fair election . These are the three basic demands , what every Egyptian is agreeing upon . And of course , you know , hoping that the army will be able to control the situation . Right now , Fareed , the country is ablaze . Disbanded police forces that were disbanded for -- nobody knows how they were disbanded -- are looting around the country . The army is not able to control things . Millions are in the streets . This is a country that 's falling apart , and the -- he needs to leave today . That will hope help -LRB- ph -RRB- , at least 70 percent , to be followed by a smooth transition of a national unity government , to be followed by all the measures set in place for a free and fair election and democratic constitution . Egypt needs to catch up with the rest of the world . We need to be free , democratic , and -- society where people have the right to live in freedom and dignity . That 's what you get after 30 years , Fareed , of utter brutal dictatorship supported by everybody in the name of pseudo-stability . ZAKARIA : You mention the army , Mohamed . Talk about that , because Omar Suleiman is himself a former -- a member of the armed forces . The new prime minister is . There is speculation that the army is backing these moves by Mubarak and has in effect taken control of the country . ELBARADEI : Well , I do n't think that the army has taken control of the country , Fareed . If you -- if you look around , there 's half million people everywhere , in the middle of Cairo , in the middle of Alexandria . Omar Suleiman is a person I know . I have respect for him . But the army is -LRB- inaudible -RRB- not change of personalities . We need a change of system . We need to have substantive , drastic shifts from a dictatorship into a democracy , like the rest of the world . What I have been authorized , mandated by the people who organized these demonstrations and by many other parts of the Egyptians , to agree on a national unity government . And I hope that I would -- I should be in touch soon with the army , and we need to work together . The army is part of Egypt , and we have the highest respect for them as civilians , and we need to work together to get Egypt -LRB- inaudible -RRB- . What do we have today ? A country that 's falling apart . ZAKARIA : You say you are -- you hope to be in contact with the army . Have they reached out to you ? Do you intend to reach out to them ? ELBARADEI : Not yet , Fareed . I mean , the whole situation has been moving very , very fast , and -- but today there has been a number of declarations by different parts of the Egyptian society , from right , left and center , mandating me to work in -- with them , with the army , with everybody in Egypt , with outside world , to ensure smooth transition . ZAKARIA : You 've heard President Obama 's statements in which he says he has asked President Mubarak to act on his promise to change , to bring democracy to Egypt . Do you think -- do you want him to do more than that ? ELBARADEI : Of course I do . I have , as you know , the utmost respect for President Obama as a person . I worked with him during my time at the IAEA . I have a lot of admiration for him . But I can tell you , honestly , as a friend of the U.S. , that your policy right now is a failed policy , is a policy that is lagging behind , is a policy that is -- is -- having the effect here in Egypt that you are losing whatever left of credibility . And -- however , this is -- this has been -- will be overtaken by events , and I want you to be on top of things . Your policy right now -- and this is an honest advice , Fareed -- is absolutely has no credibility here in Egypt . That is -- that is coming from a friend of the U.S. , somebody who lived in 15 years in the U.S. and worked for throughout my life in the U.S. I would like to see a democratic Egypt , continued -- a democratic Egypt that is able to have a friendly relationship with the U.S. . We have always had a lot of common interests , and there is nothing to believe that a democracy here will not lead to a better relationship with the U.S. , based on respect and on equity . ZAKARIA : Do you want President Obama to come out and publicly ask President Mubarak to resign ? ELBARADEI : I -- I mean , obviously , that is going to happen , I think , Fareed , if not today , tomorrow , you know . It will happen that he has to leave the country within the next three days . That is -- there is no way out , as I see it . It 's better for President Obama not to appear that he is -- he is the last one to say to President Mubarak , it 's time for you to go , leave in dignity before things are going out of hand . We have seen the fate of many dictators . I do not want to see that happening in Egypt . ZAKARIA : Mohamed , one of the visions that haunts Americans is of the Iranian revolution , where a dictator , pro-American dictator , was replaced by an even worse regime that was even more anti-American and more threatening to the region . People worry about the Muslim Brotherhood . Are you confident that a post-Mubarak Egypt will not give rise to some kind of Islamic fundamentalist force that will undermine the democracy of Egypt ? ELBARADEI : I 'm quite confident of that , Fareed . This is a myth that was sold by the Mubarak regime , that it 's either us , the ruthless dictators , or above -LRB- ph -RRB- them the al Qaida types . You know , the Muslim Brotherhood has nothing to do with the Iranian model , has nothing to do with extremism , as we have seen it in Afghanistan and other places . The Muslim Brotherhood is a religiously conservative group . They are a minority in Egypt . They are not a majority of the Egyptian people , but they have a lot of credibility because all the other liberal parties have been smothered for 30 years . They are in favor of a federalist -LRB- ph -RRB- state . They are in favor of a wording on the base of constitution that has red lines -LRB- ph -RRB- that every Egyptian has the same rights , same obligation , that the state in no way will be a state based on religion . And I have been reaching out to them . We need to include them . They are part of the Egyptian society , as much as the Marxist party here . I think this myth that has been perpetuated and sold by the regime has no -- has no iota of reality . As you know , Fareed , I 've worked with Iranians , I 've worked here . There is 100 percent difference between the two societies . ZAKARIA : And finally , would you be willing to serve as a president , as an interim president , if Mubarak were to step down ? ELBARADEI : I 'm willing to do whatever I can do to save this country , Fareed . You know , this is not my priority . I have a lot of interests in global issues , as you know , humanity , inequity , arms control , and I continue to be active on all these issues . But if my people here , the Egyptian people want me to serve as a bridge from authoritarian system into a democracy , I will not let them down . That is -- I owe it to them here . ZAKARIA : Mohamed ElBaradei , pleasure to have you on , and I hope we 'll have you on again soon . ELBARADEI : Pleasure to talk to you , Fareed . ZAKARIA : When we come back , the latest live from Alexandria and Cairo , in a moment . ZAKARIA : The ancient city of Alexandria has seen some of the worst violence in the nation during this period of chaos . At least 31 are said to have been killed there . And during the demonstration earlier today , anti-American anger was palpable . Nic Robertson was at that demonstration and joins me now . Nic , so far , America has not played a very large role in the street protest . What do you think changed ? And describe what you saw . NIC ROBERTSON , CNN SR. . INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : I think the frustration level has gone up because the crowds are clearly not having their voices answered . President Mubarak stays in power . People are listening very , very attentively . And , remember , many of the people behind these demonstrations are young students , university students , young lawyers , as well as people from all walks of life , but they listen very attentively -LRB- AUDIO BREAK -RRB- President Obama has said . And the growing feeling here has been that President Obama has shaded his response too much sort of in the middle , if you will , siding perhaps with President Mubarak , and not enough coming out in support of the people . This has n't been a central theme of the demonstrations until today . Today , it was . I really heard very loud and clear , and there were banners proclaiming it , that people feel that United States is a supporter of President Mubarak . This plays , if you will , to American fears that they wo n't complete change , that they feel President Mubarak has been propping up policy in the region with respect to Israel , that wants to see a complete change from that , and that anger and frustration present in the demands for Hosni Mubarak , President Mubarak to step down is now being transferred and filtered to the very behemoth anger of the United States for not coming out more strongly in the favor of the people . We 're also now hearing that people are opposed to United States policy in the region , particularly towards Israel -- Fareed . ZAKARIA : Thank you , Nic . We 'll have you back soon . Coming up : a great panel to put this all in context . ZAKARIA : Joining me from Cairo 's largest public square , Ivan Watson , where about 10,000 people are gathered despite it being after the curfew . Ivan , what can you tell us ? IVAN WATSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Fareed , I 'm afraid I 'm having some audio problems and I 'm not hearing you right now . If you can hear me all right , we 're in Cairo 's Tahrir Square . It 's after 5:00 at night . The sun is rapidly setting over the Egyptian capital . I 'm going to step out of the way . We 're more than an hour after curfew and as you can see , thousands and thousands of people out here , and are showing their ongoing defiance to the government of President Hosni Mubarak . And this despite the fact that there was a show of force , two fighter planes flying so low over this square less than two hours ago , just at the start of curfew that I could actually see into their cockpits . Despite that , -LRB- AUDIO BREAK -RRB- and waving the real symbol of this movement so far , the Egyptian flag . This has been a movement that has been wrapped up in patriotic pride for Egypt . People saying they want to stay after 30 years in their own government and who will lead their country and make -LRB- AUDIO BREAK -RRB- decades replaced . One big question -- no one can tell me who they would like the next president to be -- Fareed . ZAKARIA : Thanks , Ivan . We 'll be back to you as well . So , what was going on ? What is the end game ? And what role should the United States play in all of this ? These are just some of the things I want to talk about with a great panel we have , all long time , Egypt hands . Martin Indyk spent his entire career as a U.S. diplomat in the Middle East , everything from assistant secretary of state for Middle Eastern affairs to U.S. ambassador to Israel . He 's currently senior adviser to George Mitchell , the special envoy for the Middle East peace process . Richard Haass was senior director for policy planning of the State Department under George W. Bush and senior director for Middle Eastern affairs at the National Security Council under the elder Bush . He is now the president of the Council on Foreign Relations . On the scholarly side : two men who are both just back from Egypt . Tarek Masoud is of Egyptian origin , is an assistant professor at Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government . And Steven Cook is a senior fellow at the Council of Foreign Relations , where he 's writing a book on Egypt . Tarek , explain your -- you have family in Egypt . You have many friends , you were just there . What is the looting about ? Why is there looting taking place if these are protests against the government ? TAREK MASOUD , HARVARD UNIVERSITY : Well , it 's not the protesters doing the looting . In fact , this , I think , indicates the quality of this regime because by all accounts that we 're hearing , these are thugs that the regime used to rely on to crack down people during elections . They 've let them loose . They 've opened up the prisons and allowed criminals to roam the streets , and then they pulled out the police and the security forces that are under the Ministry of the Interior . And this , I think , was to demonstrate to Egyptians , OK , if you want to protest this regime , look at the chaos that will follow . And their gamble is that the desire of normal middle class Egyptians for security and for stability will cause them perhaps to welcome a crackdown and a restoration of order . I do n't think it will work . ZAKARIA : Richard Haass , what should the army do ? Because this is the key institution in Israel . The police widely hated . If anyone can restore , you know , and the cycle Tarek is describing , it would be the army . What should they do ? RICHARD HAASS , COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS : You 're exactly right . The army has to avoid looking tactless , which is what it 's looking like a little bit now . On the other hand , it does n't want to use lethal force on behalf of Hosni Mubarak . What this tells you as quickly as possible , behind the scenes , and I emphasize that , behind the scenes , the army has to push for political change so then it can assert itself not on behalf of Mubarak , but on behalf of Egypt . The army now , which really is in control politically , has to see that through and bring about a political change . ZAKARIA : Steve Cook , you wrote a book about the Egyptian army . What is -- what do you think they 're going to do ? Are they -- would they be willing to actually take charge of the government ? Or do they really want to be behind the scenes ? STEVE COOK , COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS : They want to be behind the scenes . At one time , were in charge of the government and were burned by it in 1967 . What they want to do now is save the regime from which they benefit and they want to push Mubarak out slowly . That 's why you see the handoff to Omar Suleiman , the intelligence chief , who is a military officer . ZAKARIA : You met with him when you were in Egypt . Did you he have any clue about these protests ? COOK : Well , we did ask him about the upcoming Police Day protests , and he insisted that Egypt was not like Tunisia , that , in fact , the police had a strategy and that President Mubarak was strong . He turned out to be wrong on both accounts , which does n't inspire a lot of confidence going forward . ZAKARIA : Martin Indyk , listening to all of this . Do you think that the United States is playing this right ? MARTIN INDYK , BROOKINGS INSTITUTE : Well , events are unfolding , Fareed , at a dizzying pace and the U.S. government is trying its best , I think , to keep up . But I do n't think that they have yet made the transition in their own minds that essentially , the compact between Mubarak , the pharaoh , and his people has now be broken and therefore , as you -- you so far viewed it 's time for him to go and the focus should now be on transition . They can not be seen to be pulling the rug out from under him . But I think that they have got to start to put in place the basis for the very kind of constitutional process that you describe and that Mohamed ElBaradei embraced . ZAKARIA : Richard , when we were talking earlier , you felt , though , that they were publicly be too critical of Mubarak . HAASS : All the calls for restraint seem to be siding a lot with the protesters . The comment by the White House spokesman the other day threatening to review U.S. assistance to Egypt , that 's sending the message around the region . I just came back from Davos , as you did you . And a lot of people from elsewhere in the region were very concerned that this was raising questions about the reliability for the United States . If they were that quick to distance themselves from a friend of three decades , what would that mean in Jordan ? What would that mean in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere ? So , the administration , in a funny sort of way , I think needs to do less publicly and more privately . Because the more it does publicly , and we 've seen , it will make nobody happy . Whatever they say will not be enough for the protesters and it will be too much for our friends throughout the region . I would put the emphasis on what the United States says and more important , does privately . ZAKARIA : All right . When we come back , we will talk about what effect Egypt will have on the rest of the Middle East . We have somebody from Beirut to talk to . -LRB- COMMERCIAL BREAK -RRB- \\* -LRB- COMMERCIAL BREAK -RRB- ZAKARIA : All right , and we are back with our panel of experts , Tarek Masoud from Harvard , Steven Cook from the Council on Foreign Relations , Richard Haass , the president of the council , and Martin Indyk , former U.S. diplomat , currently adviser to George Mitchell . Tarek , you were disagreeing , I could see , with Richard Haass . Richard Haass says if we pull the rug from under Mubarak , it sends a signal to every regime in the Middle East , if you have street protests , United States is going to dump you . What do you say to that ? MASOUD : I think that 's not a bad signal to be sending . I think -- look , our policy for the last 50 years has be a policy that has favored stability over democracy , and that would be fine it if actually produced stability . But I think what these protests have shown is that they do n't and that we ca n't keep these people in power , and we 're in a real risk if we follow Mr. Haass 's suggestion of going soft on Mubarak and not taking the side of the protesters . We are in huge danger of being on the wrong side of history not just in Egypt , but in the rest of the Middle East , as well . ZAKARIA : Martin , which side of history are you on ? INDYK : I agree completely with Tarek , although I think Richard 's on the right side , too . He just wants to walk softly . The basic point , as I said before , is the compact is broken . This is over for Hosni Mubarak , and the question is now how to ensure , if possible , a stable transition to democratic government in Egypt . That is a huge deal . It will have huge ramifications for the whole region . No doubt , every Arab autocrat is now shaking , and most of them are our friends . And obviously , we have to be concerned about the signal we send . We have to be concerned about the Egypt-Israel peace treaty , as well . But it does n't get resolved by clinging to a leader who no longer has any legitimacy with his people . And we can see that in these street scenes . So we 've got to get on the side of history , and we need to do that quickly because it 's moving very quickly . ZAKARIA : Steven Cook , do you dare disagree with your boss ? COOK : What I would say is that there is n't really a lot that the United States can do . Egyptians are now writing their own history , their own narrative . It started with Tunisia . It 's now with Egypt . Arabs throughout the region are now getting the message that the dictator can be dislodged . That 's what Tunisia taught them . There 's very little that we can do to shore up these regimes . The region is changing . We should be on the right side of history . We should be saying strong things about the rights of people because we 're going to play this out for the next decade , 20 years . And Arabs will remember . You saw Nic Robertson 's report from Alexandria . The first week of this was not about the United States . But central to the opposition to Mubarak is his alignment with the United States and the perception that he has warped Egyptian foreign policy and has done damage to Egypt 's regional standing . HAASS : First of all , our policy has produced stability for decades . We would not have made the progress , among other things , between Israel and the Arabs that we did had we not supported some of these governments . Second of all , behind the scenes , we should be pushing for change . Publicly , we should be very careful about what it is we -- what it is we say and what it is we do . In many of these places , to go from where we are to quote , unquote , `` democracy '' sounds good . Bringing it about will be extraordinarily difficult . It 's one thing to say out with the old , something very , very different , to bring in the new and the new be better . We have got to be very , very careful . The time to make political change is very rarely when the crowds are in the street . It 's the sort of thing history shows from other parts of the world , historically , over the last few centuries , you 're much wiser to push gradually for political change when things are calm . If you wait until the people are in the streets , be careful . You feed the beast . And it 's not clear that at the end of the day , you will set into motion a set of events you can control . There are alternatives that are worse to Hosni Mubarak and the status quo . Does n't mean you support him uncritically , but we 've got to be very mindful we can bring about things that are worse . ZAKARIA : When we come back , we 're going to talk about the broader implications of all this , and we will go to Beirut . We 'll be right back . -LRB- COMMERCIAL BREAK -RRB- ZAKARIA : What effect will Tunisia and now Egypt have on the rest of the Arab world ? Michael Young is one of the best reporters I know in the region . He 's the opinion editor of `` The Daily Star '' in Beirut . He joins me now . Michael , what is the answer to -- what do you think the repercussions of this are outside of Egypt ? MICHAEL YOUNG , `` THE DAILY STAR , '' LEBANON : Well , I think , at this point , we have to already -LRB- ph -RRB- see what the message is in Egypt , whether the army takes over or some other message . But in terms of the Middle East , I think it 'll be very varied . These are very different systems . I do n't really see , for example , the same thing happening a country like Syria or in Saudi Arabia . Even in Jordan , I think this may be difficult -- this kind of movement will not take place , I feel . And look at what happened in Lebanon in the last week . Essentially , in 2005 , the departure of -- the assassination of Hariri led to a Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon and a relative weakening of Hezbollah , at least politically . Well , in the past week , essentially , the Syrians have reimposed themselves in Lebanon and Hezbollah . So I think it 's a -- it 's a very different image . I am a bit uncomfortable with these meta-narratives of the region going towards greater freedom . ZAKARIA : Tarek Masoud , one thing that people are worried about -- I mentioned it in the interview with ElBaradei -- is the Muslim Brotherhood . The idea here is this would be a replay of the Iranian revolution . You 've studied the Muslim Brotherhood . What do you think -- do you think that they 're -- A , could they come to power ? B , if they come to power , is it an Islamic Egypt ? MASOUD : I think we 've long overestimated the Muslim Brotherhood , and I think in part , as Dr. ElBaradei said , this was because the regime wanted us to be fearful of the Brotherhood . If we look at the protests now , if the protests are a kind of indication of the relative balance of political forces in that country , the Muslim Brotherhood are present . They 're certainly participating in the protests . They 're also organizing local defense groups . But they 're not in the lead . Now , they 're the most organized political party . It 's possible that in an election , particularly depending on the electoral system , that they do very well . But I also think there are other forces in Egyptian society , and these protesters show that there 's a great demand for liberal politics . So I do n't think that the Muslim Brothers would take over . Our worry is not so much the Iranian revolution as it is the Russian revolutions of 1917 . Remember , there were two , right ? So in February , it was n't the Bolsheviks . It 's only in October that the Bolsheviks take over . And that 's the worry that might happen here . But I think the evidence is that the Brothers are very cautious . They 've not tried to take the lead on this . And I think that 's because they ca n't . So I do n't think we need to worry as much Mubarak would like us to . ZAKARIA : Martin Indyk , do you think that we could live with a more democratic Egypt ? It 's probably going to be more hostile to Israel . It 's probably going to be more retrograde in certain social ways , you know , the veil and things like that . It sort of , I guess , would look more like Turkey . Or could it be a lot worse ? INDYK : I think the key , Fareed , here is the role that the military plays . As we 've already discussed and as Mohamed ElBaradei indicated , he 's looking to the military to restore order and essentially to hold the ring so that a democratic process can unfold , so that the risks that Richard Haass was talking about are minimized , and indeed , on the Turkish model , so that the Muslim Brotherhood is restrained . I 'm not quite as sanguine as Tarek about them , but I do think that if the military plays a democratizing role here , rather than sticking with Mubarak and going down with him , the situation may not devolve into the kind of chaos that we 're witnessing at the moment in the future . Now , the military has a strong reason for maintaining the peace agreement for Israel . It serves its interests very well , including all of the aid it gets from the United States because it 's at peace with Israel . And so therefore , where the military goes will have a big impact on what the relationship is between Egypt and Israel in the future . COOK : Fareed , let me get in on this -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- Let 's get to some facts about the military . When Gamal Abdel Nasser came to power in 1952 , they were going to return power to a clean parliamentary system . This military is the descendant of that military . They created this monster . We should not be so confident that the military will return democracy . They have their skin in the game . They have become wealthy . They have benefited from this regime . They may be pushing Mubarak out just to reconstitute the regime in a different way under Omar Suleiman , under Ahmed Shafiq , under the chief of staff , Sami Enan . We must look at the military not necessarily as a progressive force here . Like I said , this is the military 's regime , and it 's a monster that has created the archetype authoritarian system in the Middle East and has spun out transnational jihadism , as well . ZAKARIA : We 're going to have to go . When we come back , David Cameron with his thoughts on the events in Egypt , and a bit more from our panel . ZAKARIA : Some of you may have tuned in today expecting our exclusive interview with the prime minister of the U.K. , David Cameron . We will play that interview in full next week . But here is what he said to me on Friday in Davos , Switzerland , at the World Economic Forum , about Egypt . ZAKARIA : You 've been watching the events in Egypt as a follow-on to what 's happened in Tunisia . Do you believe that Mohamed ElBaradei , the former director general of the IAEA who 's now become one of the leaders of the opposition movement , is correct when he says that President Mubarak should resign ? DAVID CAMERON , BRITISH PRIME MINISTER : Well , I think what we need is reform in Egypt . I mean , we support reform and progress in the greater strengthening of the democracy and civil rights and the rule of law . Clearly , there are grievances that people have , and they need to be met and matched . I do n't think it 's right for us to point at a particular politician or a particular leader . I 'd like to see that progress take place . I do n't think it 's in anyone 's interest that people are being killed on the streets of Egypt as we speak at the moment . And so I hope the violence will cease . But clearly , you know , when you have people that have grievances and problems , that want them responded to , it 's in all our interests that these countries have stronger rule of law , stronger rights , stronger democracy . But the argument I would make is I think , in the past , sometimes we in the West have taken rather a simple view that what matters is just the act of holding an election . Real democracy is actually about the building blocks you put in place , about the rule of law , the rights , the strength of your civil society , the freedoms you have in that country . And I think we need to take a more mature and thoughtful approach to these countries and recognize it 's those building blocks that , in the end , make your country democratic , strong , accountable , all the things we believe in the West , rather than simply believing democracy is just the act of going to the polls . It 's so much more than that . We know that from our own history , as you do in America . And we need to apply that thinking to other countries , too . ZAKARIA : When Hillary Clinton made some similar-sounding statements , ElBaradei -- again , who 's become a leader of the opposition -- said , You are effectively supporting 30 years of martial law and repression in Egypt . CAMERON : Well , I do n't believe that 's the case , as I said . What we support is evolution , reform -- not revolution , but evolution and reform so that people who have grievances get those grievances met . I think that the world would be a safer , stronger place , we 'd all be better off , if there were more countries with more democratic institutions . But let 's recognize those institutions need to be built from the bottom up , not always sort dropped in from the top down , if I can put it that way . ZAKARIA : Is Mubarak a friend of Britain ? CAMERON : He is a friend of Britain . Britain has good relations with Egypt . We 've worked together over many issues that cause concern , not least the Middle East , where we want to see progress , not least the need to combat Islamic extremism . And as I say , in those countries , particularly those countries that have potential problems in terms of Islamic extremism , it seems to me the building blocks of democracy -- the rights , the rule of law , the independence of the judiciary , making sure the army plays a proper role in society -- those building blocks are even more important in countries prey to Islamic extremism , and in other countries . But frankly , they 're essential to all countries , and it 's those building blocks that I think we should focus on . And in the relations we 've had with Egypt , we 've always made that point to Egypt 's leaders that believe in that sort of reform and progress and making sure that grievances are met and dealt with . ZAKARIA : Richard Haass , you heard David Cameron . He 's trying to do that balancing act that you were describing . HAASS : It 's a warning to countries where the degree of economic reform gets out of sync with the degree of political reform . And I expect in countries as far afield as China , they 're watching closely what 's going on . Economic growth in China has far outpaced , if you will , political reform . To the United States , the message is , you 've got to push for gradual political change , exactly as the prime minister said , all the basics , the difference between , if you will , democracy promotion and elections promotion . We 've got to get that right . We 've also got to keep all sorts of ties to militaries . In many of these countries , like in Egypt , the military will probably play a central political role . It makes a real case for continuing to educate these young military officers in American staff colleges because right now , the principal leverage the United States perhaps has over Egypt is privately what they can say to people like Omar Suleiman , the vice president , to get him to begin to move the country in the right direction . ZAKARIA : Tarek , I 'm guessing David Cameron 's comments disappointed you . MASOUD : No , they do n't disappoint me , they 're just not surprising . I think , look , President Obama has a unique opportunity here . He needs to get out in front of the Arab world and utter `` F '' word , freedom . And I think that will have a tremendous effect in reversing a whole legacy of bad policy towards this part of he world . Now is the time . This is the game changer . ZAKARIA : Quick last thoughts , Martin Indyk ? INDYK : Well , what you heard from David Cameron was yesterday 's language . The talking points of reform and building blocks are all very fine , but Cairo is burning and the focus now is no longer Hosni Mubarak . He is , in effect , a dead man walking . I think that the critical issues now relate to how can a constitutional process be put in place , if at all , to prevent chaos and anarchy and restore some semblance of order . I think the Egyptian people have an innate willingness for a stable process . They 've had 3,000 years of obeisance centralized rule . But it needs to be democratic rule . That 's the 21st century Egypt that we have to help bring into being . ZAKARIA : Final thoughts , Steven Cook ? COOK : I think , broadly , in the region , the United States needs to use its diplomatic tools and political skills to accommodate itself to a changing region , rather than trying to change it or engineer transitions . This is something that the Egyptian people are going to do . This is something that the Tunisian people are going to do . We can play a role at the margins , but ultimately , it 's going to be up to them and it 's going to vastly change the Middle East , perhaps for the better . ZAKARIA : And finally , Michael Young from Beirut ? Your final thoughts on all of this ? YOUNG : Well I 've noticed that we 've not mentioned in this conversation Iraq . You know , all this talk about gradual change -- well , the fact is , sometimes societies do n't have a chance to engage in gradual change , either because there are revolts or because there are invasions , as the case is in Iraq . I think today Iraq is a dysfunctional democracy . No doubt about it . Cameron is right when he says there is more to democracy than just elections . But at the same time , I also think there is a genuine change , a genuine progress with respect to Saddam Hussein in Iraq . And I think it 's incumbent upon countries like the United States and the other democracies to help countries that have managed to put in some kind of a democratic system -- dysfunctional , sure -- but sometimes you say , Well , all right , gradual -- it 's over . We ca n't go for gradual change now , so you know , let 's at least help these societies advance towards something more functional rather than dysfunctional . ZAKARIA : Thank you so much . Richard Haass , Steven Cook , Tarek Masoud , Martin Indyk , Michael Young . And we will be back with Nic Robertson and more live from Egypt . ZAKARIA : And we are back , and we 're going to Alexandria , Egypt , where Nic Robertson is joining us live . Nic , one of the things that has come out in our discussion here is the key role of the army . From where you are , what do people on the street think the army is doing ? NIC ROBERTSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : There 's a really mixed feeling about it , and a sense of confusion , as well . They 're not sure if the army is here supporting President Mubarak -- the army is on the streets guarding government buildings in the city -- or if the army is actually here to support the people and provide security . And the impression they 're getting is that the army is not providing security in their neighborhoods , and therefore , the army is on the streets for President Mubarak . The verdict 's out on it . There have been very good relations between the people and army so far , but it 's really a very -- a source of serious concern for people when we talk to them which way the army will go , because they sense here that at some point , the army will be forced to make a decision by the dynamic of what happens on the ground . They will be forced to make a decision . Are they with the people or the president ? Will they shoot on the people or will they not ? That 's what worries them right now , Fareed . ZAKARIA : And what about these vigilante groups that are forming ? Are they -- again , are they -- how should one read them ? ROBERTSON : It 's a very random group , and really , depending on the neighborhood , that will depend on the group . in the sort of lower class neighborhoods , if you will , it 's a very sort of uneducated group of people that are providing this sort of vigilante lookout . But we went to a secret location in the city here today . We were taken there , not allowed to film on the way there , into an apartment building where young students and lawyers are planning up -- planning , dividing up the city , who should have -- form checkpoints on what corners , trying to put in place safety and security measures for the population , Fareed . ZAKARIA : Thank you very much , Nic . And thank you to all of you for being a part of my program this week . I will see you next week , and we will then have the entire interview with British prime minister David Cameron on Egypt , but also on budgets and all kinds of other things .

With unprecedented numbers of protesters on the streets of Egypt calling for President Hosni Mubarak to resign , what clues do earlier demonstrations in the region offer about what will happen in Cairo ? Tunisia , a relatively small and apparently stable country on the Mediterranean , triggered the current wave of anti-government protests across the Middle East . It had been ruled by President Zine El Abedine Ben Ali for 23 years and was seen as a well-established police state . But in December 2010 , a fruit seller named Mohamed Bouazizi , 26 , set himself on fire in protest after police took away his fruit cart . The profoundly symbolic act of protest awakened a suppressed fury in the population . President Ben Ali visited Bouazizi 's hospital bedside -- the college graduate lived for three weeks before dying January 4 -- but he was unable to assuage the nation 's rage at decades of corruption , low living standards and grinding repression . After weeks of protests in which more than 100 people died , according to the United Nations , Ben Ali fled the country on January 14 . Longtime Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi took the reins of power and created a national unity government , including both members of the old guard and opposition . But the people demanded fuller reform , and Ghannouchi has continued to shuffle the government to try to appease an angry populace . New presidential elections have been promised within 60 days of Ben Ali 's flight . That 's a dramatically different outcome from what happened in Iran a year and a half earlier , when huge protests erupted after presidential elections in June 2009 . Many Iranians expected the defeat of incumbent hardline President Mahmoud Ahamdinejad , but official results showed him as the winner . Incredulous at the outcome and determined to overturn it , Iranians took to the streets , declaring that a `` Sea of Green '' -- the color of Islam -- would force Ahmadinejad out of power . The apparent revolution captured the imagination of the world , especially after a young woman , Neda Agha-Soltan , was killed by a bullet to the chest during a demonstration . The last moments of her life were caught on a shaky video that was seen by millions after it was posted online . But Iranian security forces cracked down hard . The government-backed plainclothes militia known as the Basij waded into demonstrations with motorcycles and clubs , and untold numbers of protesters were rounded up and thrown into prison .

CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : It is the very last day of January , but the very first day of a new week of CNN Student News ! I 'm Carl Azuz . If you took a look at the news at all this weekend , you probably know what our top story today is . The world is watching as a political crisis engulfs the north African nation . Protesters have been marching through the streets for days . They 're speaking out against the Egyptian government , and specifically against long-time President Hosni Mubarak . The protesters say they have two demands . One : They want President Mubarak to leave office and to be put on trial . Two : They want to change the country 's constitution . The government has been trying different ways to get these protests under control . It 's established a curfew ; it 's sent out fighter jets and thousands of security troops . As you can see , it does n't seem to be making any difference . The protests lasted through Sunday night and looked like they could keep going for a while . In different cities around the world , other people are holding rallies in support of Egypt 's protesters . Businesses and governments that have offices in Egypt are working to evacuate their citizens and clients from the country . President Mubarak went on TV over the weekend to talk to the people of Egypt . He said he understands why they 're upset , including their concerns over alleged government corruption and desire for better living conditions . Mubarak asked his government ministers to resign , but said he plans to say in power . But that 's not enough for the man you see here : Mohamed ElBaradei , a prominent Egyptian and holder of a Nobel Peace Prize . He 's a leader of the largest group that 's against President Mubarak . And on Sunday , he urged the Egyptian president to `` leave today and save the country . '' ElBaradei says the push for Mubarak to step down is `` non-negotiable . '' AZUZ : All right , we 're gonna talk about some of the major players in all of this in today 's Breakdown . First off , Egypt 's leader , Hosni Mubarak . He 's been the country 's president since 1981 . Egypt 's president serves six-year terms with no term limits , which is why he 's been in power so long . The country is a republic , with the president chosen by popular vote . But here 's the kicker : Until 2005 , Mubarak was the only candidate on the ballot ! In 2005 , Mubarak beat out a couple other candidates when he got almost 90 percent of the vote . Another election is scheduled for later this year . The country Mubarak leads has 80 million people ; it is the largest population in the Arab world . And that 's put a strain on the government because many of the people feel it 's unable to meet their demands . 20 percent of Egypt 's population lives below the poverty line . And one more point , here : the Muslim Brotherhood . This is a group that 's been very vocal in encouraging people to protest . And it 's technically illegal ! Egypt 's constitution does not allow religion-based political parties . But the Muslim Brotherhood has been somewhat tolerated by President Mubarak . I say `` somewhat '' because members are allowed to run in local elections , but they 're not allowed to have seats in the country 's government . Now , I 'm gonna turn it over to Don Lothian to show you why what happens in Egypt is so important to the United States , as well as countries near Egypt in the Middle East . DAN LOTHIAN , CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT : As tensions rise in Egypt , the White House is ramping up its response . U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : When President Mubarak addressed the Egyptian people , he pledged a better democracy and greater economic opportunity . I just spoke to him after his speech , and I told him he has a responsibility to give meaning to those words , to take concrete steps and actions that deliver on that promise . LOTHIAN : Secretary of State Hillary Clinton weighed in too , voicing concerns over the violence directed at protestors by police and security forces . U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON : We urge the Egyptian authorities to allow peaceful protests and to reverse the unprecedented steps it has taken to cut off communications . LOTHIAN : The Obama administration has been pushing President Hosni Mubarak privately and publicly to implement reforms . A delicate dance as cables released by Wikileaks revealed . In a 2009 dispatch over concerns about human rights abuses , U.S. Ambassador Margaret Scobey is reported to have written , `` Mubarak takes this issue personally and it makes him seethe when we raise it , particularly in public . '' U.S. officials have also resisted calling for regime change . JON ALTERMAN , CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES : I think the administration is going to try to appeal to the best instincts , and ultimately will work with whoever is in power in Egypt . PROTESTERS : Hey Hey ! Mubarak has to go ! LOTHIAN : Even so , outside the White House , pressure from protesters looking for change . Egypt has been a key U.S. ally for years , working to bring Israelis and Palestinians together , being a stable partner in the region , and supporting the international effort to reign in Iran 's nuclear ambitions . ROBERT GIBBS , WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY : And that 's important , but there is a responsibility that is had by the government of Egypt , regardless of the role that they have played internationally or regionally , over the course of any number of years . They also have to address the grievances that have built up for those same number of years within the country of Egypt . LOTHIAN : Officials here at the White House are also discussing the assistance that the U.S. gives to Egypt , including more than a billion dollars each year . They 'll be reviewing over the next few days how the government deals with unrest on the ground and how that might impact that aid . Dan Lothian , CNN , the White House . TOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Today 's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Barnes ' and Mrs. Rumbarger 's STEM classes at Petal High School in Petal , Mississippi ! What U.S. government program provides money to retired workers ? Is it : A -RRB- HUD , B -RRB- Social Security , C -RRB- CDC or D -RRB- Peace Corps ? You 've got three seconds -- GO ! The Social Security program gives money to Americans who are retired , disabled or in need . That 's your answer and that 's your Shoutout ! AZUZ : It was 71 years ago today that the first Social Security check was issued ! The person who got it ? Her name was Ida Fuller ; she received a check from the government for $ 22.54 . During the two years before that , Fuller had paid money into the system . That 's how Social Security was designed to work : People who are working pay money in ; people who are retired get money out . If any of you have jobs , you 're part of this , too . There 's a line on your paycheck for how much money is taken out for Social Security . But there 's a lot of debate around Social Security and concerns that this fund might run out some day , and maybe in the not-too-distant future . People are living longer than they used to , so they 're getting more money from Social Security . And by the time people who are currently putting money into the system are old enough to take money out , there might not be anything left for them . AZUZ : Now personally , I write in cursive when I 'm taking notes , because that 's what I learned in school . But I also know how to type , too , and I learned that as well . What we 're asking on today 's blog is : Do you think it 's important to preserve the old-school cursive , or should schools focus on skills you 'll need later in life , like typing ? You know where to go to talk to us : CNNStudentNews.com ! AZUZ : And finally , we 're right on time for today 's Before We Go segment . It may look like a normal cuckoo clock , until you realize that the cuckoo coming out 's a person ! This thing actually is the world 's largest cuckoo clock . At least , that 's what the creators were aiming for . They unveiled this 66-foot tall , 28-foot wide clock this weekend . Every hour , the bells brought out an actor who gave a performance . AZUZ : Some people may think it sounds a little ... you know . But you 're welcome to chime in with your own thoughts . And we are just about out of time . Today 's sign-off line comes from Nick : He says anything unrelated to elephants is irrelephant . Whether it 's a pun or whether it 's just a creative goodbye , we 're gonna look forward to it , and we 'll see you right back here tomorrow when CNN Student News returns .

CANDY CROWLEY , HOST : There is chaos and confusion in Egypt . State-run television is reporting at least 38 are dead following massive protests demanding the end of the 30-year rule of President Hosni Mubarak . Witnesses describe a scene that suggests anarchy . One man said people are parading the streets , walking around with baseball bats and knifes . It 's a situation that has enormous implications not just in Egypt , but in the entire Middle East and the U.S. CROWLEY -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Today , dissecting the crisis in Cairo with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . CLINTON : We support the universal human rights of the Egyptian people , including the right to freedom of expression , of association , and of assembly . CROWLEY : Then , former U.N. ambassador and Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte , and former Ambassador to Egypt Edward Walker , and senior senators Republican John McCain and Democrat Chuck Schumer . I 'm Candy Crowley , and this is `` State of the Union . '' CROWLEY : The crisis in Egypt has left the Obama administration in a delicate position . Joining me from the State Department , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . Madam Secretary , thank you for being here . CROWLEY : It seems to me that when this started out and we saw the signs and the protesters in the street , they were anti-Mubarak . Now , if you are watching , we are seeing signs that say `` U.S. , stop backing Mubarak . '' What side is the U.S. on , Mubarak or the people in the streets ? CLINTON : Well , there 's another choice . It 's the Egyptian people . We are on the side -- as we have been for more than 30 years -- of a democratic Egypt that provides both political and economic rights to its people , that respects the universal human rights of all Egyptians . And that is the message that every ambassador , whether Republican or Democratic president , everyone has conveyed for over 30 years . What happens is truly up to the Egyptian people . And what the United States is doing is sending a very clear message : We wish to see everyone refrain from violence . The army is now fulfilling security responsibilities . They 're a respected institution in Egyptian society . And we know they have a delicate line to walk , because they want to protect peaceful protests , but they also do n't want to see any city descend into chaos with looting and criminal activity . And we are encouraging a very -- a very careful approach that respects the rights of people . We are also very much behind the kind of concrete steps that need to be taken for economic and political reform . We have , over the past 30 years , supported civil society groups . We have supported women 's groups . We have tried to help build up a lot of the elements within Egyptian society that are going to be necessary when there is a national dialogue as we are urging to determine the path forward . And clearly , Candy , this is a complex , very difficult situation . Egypt has been a partner of the United States over the last 30 years , has been instrumental in keeping the peace in the Middle East between Egypt and Israel , which is a critical accomplishment that has meant so much to so many people . So I think we have to keep on the message we 've been on , convey that publicly and privately as we are doing , and stand ready to help with the kind of transition that will lead to greater political and economic freedom . CROWLEY : The president 's remarks , in which he said much of what you just said , warning against huge crackdowns against peaceful protesters , saying we 've got to see some concrete steps towards opening up political reform and advancing it , it 's been interpreted here by many and some overseas as a beginning to back away from President Mubarak . Do you argue with that translation ? CLINTON : We -- we do not want to send any message about backing forward or backing back . What we 're trying to do is to help clear the air so that those who remain in power , starting with President Mubarak , with his new vice president , with the new prime minister , will begin a process of reaching out , of creating a dialogue that will bring in peaceful activists and representatives of civil society to , you know , plan a way forward that will meet the legitimate grievances of the Egyptian people . There is a -- there 's no easy answer . And , clearly , increasing chaos or even violence in the streets , prison breaks , which we 've had reports about , that is not the way to go . We want to see this peaceful uprising on the part of the Egyptian people to demand their rights , to be responded to in a very clear , unambiguous way by the government and then a process of national dialogue that will lead to the changes that the Egyptian people seek and that they deserve . Now , that will take time . It is unlikely to be done overnight without very grave consequences for everyone involved . So what we want to see is , as we 've said over and over again , the concrete steps taken . You know , it took 30 years to have a vice president appointed . We want to see both the existing and any new members of any government continue to put real life into what President Mubarak himself said , which were concrete steps toward democratic and economic reform . CROWLEY : If I could , the people that we 're seeing and certainly that you 're seeing do n't seem like the type that want to wait another 30 years for full democracy . CLINTON : Oh , of course not . CROWLEY : So when -- when we look at these demonstrations , when we talk to some of the people involved in it , it does not seem that even if President Mubarak were to do everything you have now laid out that he is at all acceptable . Do you think that President Mubarak can survive this ? CLINTON : You know , again , Candy , this is going to be up to the Egyptian people . But let 's look at what we have . We have a calendar that already has elections for the next president scheduled , so there is an action-enforcing event that is already on the calendar . Can there be efforts made to really respond to the political desires of the people so that such an election is free and fair and credible ? There are many steps that can be taken by reaching out to those who have advocated a peaceful , orderly transition to greater democracy where the Egyptian people themselves get to express their views . That 's what we wish to see . CROWLEY : But from what you 've seen -- from what you 've seen , will that be enough ? If he takes those steps and says , `` Hey , we 've already got prescheduled elections coming up , '' is that enough to keep him in power ? CLINTON : Well , no. . Much has to be done . And we 're not advocating -- we 're not advocating any specific outcome . We are advocating that the government , the representatives of the civil society , the political opposition and activists begin a dialogue to chart a course . Egypt is a large , complex , very important country . I do n't think the Egyptian people want to see what is a very clear effort to obtain political and economic rights turn into any kind of new form of oppression or suppression or violence or letting loose criminal elements . That 's not what they 're in the streets protesting for . So how do we get from where they are today to where they would like to be ? It needs to be done immediately with a process that brings people to the table and that the Egyptian people can see , `` Oh , I know so-and-so . He represents a group that has been advocating for democracy for many years . '' This is going to be a legitimate effort that is going to result in changes that will have responded to the needs and the voices of the people who have been protesting . CROWLEY : Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , a busy woman these days . We thank you for your time . CROWLEY : Coming up , two former State Department officials on how the U.S. should respond to the ongoing crisis in Egypt . CROWLEY : When it comes to international policy , you deal with the foreign leaders you have , not the ones you might want . What the U.S. has in Egypt 's Hosni Mubarak is an invaluable , imperfect ally , the kind of repressive authoritarian Americans typically chide . GEORGE W. BUSH , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : America 's belief in human dignity will guide our policies , yet rights must be more than the grudging concessions of dictators . CROWLEY : One of the most recent prodemocracy speeches from a U.S. president came in mid 2009 in the heart of Cairo . A pointed bit of geography , but no names mentioned . OBAMA : You must maintain your power through consent , not coercion . You must respect the rights of minorities and participate with a spirit of tolerance and compromise . CROWLEY : Yet , Mubarak , head of a secular government , has been a reliable ally , a conduit for the U.S. to other Arab nations . He has maintained a cold peace with Israel , been helpful in the war on terror and opposed Iran 's nuclear program . Cables recently part of the WikiLeaks release showed what sticky business diplomacy can be when a country 's interests run afoul of its values . U.S. Ambassador Margaret Scobey warned Secretary of State Clinton not to be too confrontational on the issue of human rights . Mubarak takes this issue personally , she wrote , and it makes him seethe when we raise it , particularly the issue in public . We will talk about the limits of U.S. influence and what a fallen Mubarak would mean for the region and the U.S. Ambassador 's Negroponte and Walker are next . -LRB- COMMERCIAL BREAK -RRB- CROWLEY : Joining me now here in Washington , Edward Walker , former U.S. ambassador to Egypt during the Clinton administration and John Negroponte , former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. under President George W. Bush . Gentlemen , thank you both for bringing your expertise to the table . Let me ask you -- since you are no longer in office and can move international diplomacy with a single word , as obviously the secretary can , is the Mubarak era coming to a close ? WALKER : I firmly believe it . I think if you listen to the street , they are not asking for democracy , they are not asking for anything except the removal of Mubarak . He 's become a symbol for everything that they find objectionable . It does n't mean it ca n't be a transition as orderly and I certainly hope it is . But he is a symbol now and you 've got to change the symbol . CROWLEY : Do you agree ? NEGROPONTE : I agree . But I think it 's about how that era comes to a close . I think it 's all about the nature of the transition and how that 's arranged . CROWLEY : So now a Vice President Suleiman . Both of you know him . Is this a good -- we were just talking earlier . It just does n't seem to me that he will be acceptable to the street protesters either . NEGROPONTE : I think what the secretary said was important : that this is something for the Egyptians to decide . But one of the questions you 'd have to look at is this the first step or the last step ? And it seems to me what the secretary was encouraging is that civil society in Egypt sit down with the president and the government and talk about the ways in which to organize the transition . What 's the nature of the upcoming presidential election going to be ? Who is going to be allowed to run ? Will international observation be permitted ? It seems to me those are the kinds of issues that have to get on the table . CROWLEY : And when you look at this , I think what the unspoken fear of Americans is , if suddenly there should be a departure of Mubarak , for 30 years he 's run this country . There is no real secular power that has been allowed to rise up to kind of be against him . So it seems to me what you have is the Muslim Brotherhood and the army . And so they would fill any vacuum . And is n't that -- either one of those a not comfortable prospect for the U.S. ? WALKER : Candy , you also have an enormous bureaucracy that has been built up over the years that hags a stabilizing factor -- sometimes too stabilizing . It has n't helped with reform . But it 's hard to move Egypt into a violent kind of opposition . And I certainly do not think the Muslim Brotherhood has the wherewithal or the leadership to do it . They do n't have charismatic leaders in the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood . They do n't have a Nasrallah , they do n't have Ayatollah Khomeini . So I -- yes , they will be a part of the political landscape , but they will not be a dominant part . CROWLEY : Do you agree with that ? I mean , what do you see -- how does this shake down ? NEGROPONTE : Well , I mean , one of the most bedeviling aspects of foreign policy and politics per se especially in an authoritarian environment is how , does one arrange for a peaceful and constructive transition to whatever it is that follows ? We have a lot of examples of the disasters that have followed after the demise of an authoritarian leader , not that many good examples of constructive outcomes . So , we all need to think very carefully about that as we look at this question . CROWLEY : Certainly not for the U.S. . You know , in Iran and the Philippines , the Philippines sort of roughly turned out okay . NEGROPONTE : Well , I was ambassador to the Philippines subsequent to that . I mean , I would rate it as a success . People power , minimum of violence and today have a democratic government . But Iran , of course , is a very bad outcome . CROWLEY : Went the other way . I wanted to show you a poll that Pew recently put out . It 's on global attitudes . CROWLEY : And this was in Egypt . And the question was , do you have a favorable or an unfavorable view of the U.S. ? Favorable , 17 percent , Unfavorable , 82 percent . Can we expect anything other than kind of a troublesome era because no matter what else he was -- and I said in the little thing we did before this , you know , you deal with the foreign leader you have , not the one you would like to have . We have dealt with Mubarak . He has been a very strong ally . He has helped in the war on terror , helped in a number of things . With him going and this sort of attitude , the U.S. is in for a rough go now . We are losing our closest Arab ally , are we not ? WALKER : Not necessarily . What 's important to us is Egypt , it 's not Mubarak . And Mubarak is not Egypt . CROWLEY : But Egypt does n't seem to care for us . WALKER : Egypt does n't care for us for a whole host of reasons , but it has to do primarily with the Palestinian issue . It has to do with the fact that we have talked about democracy and yet we do n't seem to be supporting it . And they have been disappointed . They look to us for leadership . And so the people of Egypt want the United States to be powerful but do n't feel it has been . CROWLEY : What about Israel ? Let 's bring Israel into the mix , which we ca n't ignore here , I mean ... NEGROPONTE : It is a critically important country in the Middle East peace process , has been for 30 years , a stalwart ally on that subject , one of only two Arab countries that has relations with Israel . And I guess the way to put the question seems to me would be imagine Egypt -- Egypt 's government in the hands of a government hostile to the United States ' interests in the Middle East . That would be a very , very negative situation . CROWLEY : And I guess what I 'm asking is , what are the chances that might happen ? It seems to me , if not hostile , certainly not as open to the U.S. as Mubarak has been . WALKER : Well , I think that the street opinion insofar as it 's going to have an impact or any kind democracy , is certainly not going to be as favorable to Israel as we would like to see it . Part of that reasoning is the way Israel reacts . It 's up to Israel actually to make its case for a good relationship with Egypt . It 's not really up to us to do that . CROWLEY : I 've heard a lot of people say in the past couple of days , I really do feel as though this is Iran all over again , where we , you know , did n't say , look , you have got to tamp this down and then we got the government we now have in Iran , which is seen as a security threat to the U.S. Are there parallels here or is that an overreach ? WALKER : I 'm convinced it 's a way overreach , because you had an extraordinarily dynamic situation in Iran . You had a very , very repressive , torturing , all kinds of things , which everybody knew about . You had a very charismatic leader who was in France who brought -- came back and just took charge , and took the country by storm . Where is the parallel ? There is no parallel . CROWLEY : Do you see it ? NEGROPONTE : Well , there are some disturbing analogies in the sense that if this goes wrong it could be very bad for our interests and also for the people of Egypt . But I think the one cautionary note here is I do n't think we should be in that big of a hurry for the regime to change . I think what we need to ... CROWLEY : And the secretary did n't sound like we were . I think what we need to focus on is the path forward and that it be constructive and that it be responsive to people 's needs . But it does n't have to be tomorrow , it just has to -- a path has to emerge as quickly as possible . CROWLEY : And yet , when I look at those streets , you think , boy , it kind of does have to be tomorrow . I mean , it seems to be a very impatient -- I mean , it seems to have burst . WALKER : Yes , it has . I do n't think we can control the pace . That 's one of the real problems . If we could control it , I would agree 100 percent that , you know , let 's take it step by step , do it in an orderly fashion . You look at the street out there , and you look at where the military is and what it 's not doing , and you wonder , do we have that kind of time ? NEGROPONTE : Well , but I think it 's the role of governance to try and introduce a measure of moderation into these kinds of situations . The street is not the government . The street is not democracy . Let 's not forget that . CROWLEY : But they do n't seem to be listening to Mubarak at this point , I guess . And he seems to be the one at least somewhat in charge still . WALKER : I think the important thing is that the army still has respect and the street has respect of the people . It is the right move to have brought the army in and to take the blackshirts out . And I think they have an opportunity now to move forward , but I think you 've still got that symbolic problem of Mubarak himself . CROWLEY : Let me ask you as a final question , what is your worst - case scenario ? WALKER : My worst-case scenario is that this thing drags on , it gets to be some real leadership of the opposition , the Muslim Brotherhood comes together , they find some charismatic leaders , and the next thing we know we have got an Islamist government . CROWLEY : Is that your -- would you ... NEGROPONTE : Well , either that , or through a process of oppression and control that the president simply carried on as before , presented himself for election again in 2012 . That 's another -- that 's the other extreme . WALKER : Ah yes , the other extreme . CROWLEY : John Negroponte , Ed Walker , thank you both so much for joining us . CROWLEY : Up next , we 'll talk to CNN 's Fareed Zakaria , who just interviewed Egyptian opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei CROWLEY : Joining me now from our New York bureau , Fareed Zakaria , host of CNN 's `` FAREED ZAKARIA : GPS . '' Fareed , I know you just got off the phone with Mohamed ElBaradei . Tell us what he had to say . He 's just newly back to Egypt at this point . FAREED ZAKARIA , HOST , `` FAREED ZAKARIA : GPS '' : He 's back . He seems to have emerged as the kind of leader of the opposition . It 's tough to tell exactly why . Probably because he 's so high profile , former Nobel Peace Prize winner , that it would be very difficult for the regime to do anything to him . He 's being very tough . He 's sticking by his guns and saying Mubarak has to resign . In fact , he said to me , he has to leave the country within three days . CROWLEY : So did he give you any hint about whether he -- what he sees would fill that vacuum ? Because I think that 's what -- I think a lot of people think Mubarak has to go at some point if not within that particular time frame . ZAKARIA : He did lay it out . He imagines a one-year transition during which he said he would be happy to serve as the interim president , during which Egypt would write a new constitution and plan for national elections . So he is not calling for something drastic and , you know , for it to happen tomorrow , but for a process to begin that would turn Egypt into a democracy . CROWLEY : Now , he sort of came in -- I mean , this revolution , these huge protests started before he got back into the country . So he 's sort of riding on it . Is there reason to believe that he would be an acceptable person in that interim ? ZAKARIA : I think it 's a good question . My guess is that he would not be the choice of the Egyptian people in a national elections just because he is an international bureaucrat . ZAKARIA : He 's not really a politician . But it is conceivable that he would be somebody that all the parties would agree on as an interim president simply because he 's respected , he is a man of high integrity and in a sense , each one is going to want his own person . And the one thing they can agree on is that he would n't be a threat to them politically , particularly if he were to agree not to run in any further election . In other words , if this were to be a temporary caretaker type position . CROWLEY : Fareed Zakaria , thank you so much . We will look forward to that interview and everything else in the next hour . Fareed will have more on the crisis in Egypt at the top of the hour on Fareed Zakaria , GPS . We want to get an update on the latest developments in Cairo now with CNN 's Frederik Pleitgen . Fred , just give us a sense of what 's going on now . FREDERIK PLEITGEN , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Hi , Candy . Well , just a couple minutes ago a curfew went into effect in Cairo , so some of the people close to our building have left the street . However , there still appear to be 10,000 people in Tahrir Square which is around the corner here . And we are getting information from our cameraman Joe Durran -LRB- ph -RRB- that there 's been some interaction there . A helicopter is going overhead . There 's been interaction there between the military and protesters where a man attempted to run an army barricade and was then shot overhead . You see the helicopter overhead right there , landing right behind me . That 's what 's so loud . So there appears to be some interaction between the protesters and the military there , although so far what we have seen between the protesters and the military have been almost cheerful scenes between them . And I was actually on the scene in one place where the military and regular people were working together to try and keep their neighborhoods safe -- Candy . CROWLEY : So let me ask you first was that Egyptian army helicopter and are they patrolling the city from overhead ? And , b , do you sense that there 's been a lessening of tensions from , say , when this started to now ? PLEITGEN : Well , the tensions are different . First of all , yeah , I think it is an Egyptian army helicopter . There have been Egyptian army helicopters flying overhead here for the better part of the day . They actually also just a couple minutes ago had two F-16s from the Egyptian air force flying overhead . The tensions are different now Candy than they were before . Beforehand we had a lot of police forces on the street that were really something of a lightning rod between them and the protesters and what was going on was that there was a lot of rioting on the streets . Now the military is here . It appears as though the situation between the military and that protesters are much better , they seem to get along well . However , because there is no more police force within basically all of Cairo there is a lot of lawlessness . I was on the scene just a couple of minutes ago of a prison break just outside of Cairo where inside the prison there was still a shootout going and many people told me that the prisoners had escaped from that prison with weapons . And there simply are no police officers . We also went by about six or seven police stations which had all been abandoned , which were all looted and all torched . And so you look here , you go into the night which is about to fall here in Cairo , people are actually banding together , and creating vigilante militias to try and protect what they have -- Candy . CROWLEY : Fred Pleitgen has been on the ground for us in Egypt . Thank you so much . We will be back to you . Up next , we 'll get reaction from the Senate 's ranking member on the armed services committee , Republican John McCain . CROWLEY : Joining me now in Washington , Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona . We are at the point in foreign policy where our values are just running headlong into our strategic interests . I asked Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , who do we back ? Do we back Mubarak or do we back the people on the street . She said , well , we back the Egyptian people which was a little different to her from the people on the street . Is it time to cut him loose ? MCCAIN : Not cut him loose , but also I think one of the lessons here is that we need to be on the right side of history in these countries and we need to do a better job of emphasizing and arguing strenuously for human rights . I understand how important -- and I hope we all understand how important Egypt is as an ally , as a center of culture . And one out of every four Arabs in the Middle East live in Egypt and how important they are . But it was clear for a long time that the kind of repressive regime sooner or -- that Mubarak controls , sooner or later there is going to be great difficulties . Good news I think is that the army is playing a very constructive role . So I think what we need to do now is to lay out a plan for Mubarak to lift the state of emergency , announce that elections -- free and fair -- will be held in September , which were already planned , allow an open and free democratic process , which I think we could have some confidence if it was an open process that you would see a free and fair election and that we make sure that the aspirations of the Egyptian people are realized finally . And it 's fraught with danger , as you earlier guessed : the Muslim Brotherhood , the Iranian example and others , but there is also a good chance for a real functioning democracy and arguably the most important nation in the middle east . CROWLEY : But , you know , for 30 years Republican and Democratic presidents have publicly at times , most privately as we saw in some of those leaked WikiLeak cables from the diplomatic cables , they said , you have to do something here , you ca n't be an authoritarian . It did n't work . It was 30 years of -- I mean , he 'd do something and we 'd say , okay , thanks and then we 'd sort of retreat . So what else could have been done ? Is n't he too important to us ? MCCAIN : Madeleine Albright and I sent a letter before the last election saying allow observers in . Russ Feingold and I sponsored a resolution calling for more respected human rights . You ca n't -- you can not over -- is n't it a lesson of history you can not have autocratic , regimes last forever . And the longer they last , the more explosive the results . And that 's a lesson we have to learn that all of these rights that individuals have is not confined to the United States of America and our allies . And so I still think we have a real opportunity to see a democratic transition . And by the way , could I also mention , Jordan is a very serious situation . Yemen is a country that 's fraught with more problems than we can take the time to describe on this program . Even as far away as Libya . So this is a very critical time . MCCAIN : What happens in Egypt will directly and dramatically effect what happens in these other countries . There is a real awakening going on . CROWLEY : And -- but we are talking about other U.S. allies in the area who we have joined forces with and they are not exactly democracies -- Jordan , Saudi Arabia , places like that . I mean , on Capitol Hill you all have the ability to cut aid to these countries , but Egypt is number two in foreign aid after Israel . And I think that we have to say that everything is on the table and encourage and help and assist , you know , a process that leads to a free and fair election . I have confidence in the Egyptian people that they are not going to elect an extremist . They are not going to allow an extremist group to hijack their country and that can be prevented if we have a fair , open process beginning now between now and September , you could have the rise of political parties . You could have a real democratic process that could be celebrated throughout the region and a model for the rest of the region . The other is , of course is hang on , more demonstrations . The army turns one way -- there is all kinds of bad scenarios here and really only one good one . But I would say I think the president 's statement was correct . Now we need to take it a step further and we 've got to be on the right side of history here . CROWLEY : I guess the problem is that if we have been at them for 30 years to change , I wonder why they would listen to us now -- why Mubarak would listen to us now ? MCCAIN : Well , obviously he 's in an extremist position . The army is now the critical institution . The police , as we all know , have disappeared . It 's the only real stabilizing force in the country right now . Fortunately , we have had close relations with the Egyptian military . There are a lot of very good , strong people there . So -- and also I think that President Mubarak , he knows what 's going on in his own country . It 's up to the United States to be a helpful , assisting but insisting partner . And by the way , we can not afford a Tiananmen Square in Cairo . CROWLEY : And that 's the question , I guess . When you look at these streets throughout Egypt , not just in Cairo , do you see a group willing to wait until September to get rid of Hosni Mubarak ? MCCAIN : I think that the group -- and I do n't know the sentiment on the street , but it seems to me logic if Mubarak said , I 'm not going to run again . I am turning over this government to a caretaker that you can trust probably with the army involved , they are not going to have any further political aspirations and we 'll set up a process for a free , open , transparent election in September . I think you could do that . But this is a narrow window of opportunity . The longer the unrest exists , the more likely it is to become extreme . CROWLEY : Tell me how you think the president has done so far . Sounds like you think he 's done pretty well . And what do you want him to do next ? MCCAIN : I think the president should get a little bit more out ahead . I think his statement that he made day before yesterday was good . MCCAIN : Well , I think in other words lay out a scenario of what we think the Egyptian people should have every right to expect , the kind that I just described . The past performance of this administration has n't been great . They cut off some of the money for democratization , et cetera . But we can review that at a later time . The important thing is I think the president made the right statement . I think that the secretary of state made a good presentation to you . I just want to see her go a little bit further . And let 's get out in front on this issue on behalf of the things we have always stood for and believed in . And every time we have been on the right side of history it 's usually turned out okay . CROWLEY : What is your -- I asked Negroponte and Walker before you , what do you fear the most watching this ? Because there is so much uncertainty right now that we really do n't know which way it 's going to go . MCCAIN : My great fear is , obviously , a radical Islamic extremist -- the Iran scenario versus the Philippines or other scenario . That 's all of our greatest fear , but the longer this unrest , the more likely the radicals see openings to take power -- the Lenin scenario . So that 's my greatest fear . My second greatest fear , of course , started in Tunisia . Egypt , we see problems in Yemen ; Jordan , our dearest , most important -- very important ally . This could be a really seminal moment in history of the Middle East . And the question is , is does that turn out good or does it turn out to the advantage of radical Islamic extremism ? And I do n't know the answer yet . CROWLEY : I do n't know either ... MCCAIN : Egypt will be key though . CROWLEY : We will have you back when the answers become clearer . Thank you very much . Up next , we want to speak to Senator McCain 's Democratic colleague , Senator Chuck Schumer of New York . CROWLEY : Joining me now from our New York bureau , Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer . Thank you for being here . Obviously the story of the day and what 's going on in Egypt . Let me get your take now on really what now seems to be the key question : can President Mubarak survive this long enough for there to be some sort of transition to something else ? SCHUMER : Well , that is -- the hope is that there will be a transition to something else . I agree with the thrust of Senator McCain which is quite the same as the thrust of the president . The bottom line is this , there are some good signs here . It 's not all terrible . The fact that the army is in control , the army is a respected institution in Egypt . The people like it . You can see even in the pictures the army and the protesters joining together to protect neighborhoods . And thus far most , not all , but most of the protesters have been focused on economic and political freedoms . It is not an anti-U.S. message primarily nor is it a fundamentalist , radical Islamist message but a secular message . We want economic and political freedom . If the energy can be channeled constructively into free and open elections in September where there is some time for some secular opposition parties to germinate , that 's probably the ideal outcome . It 's hardly a certainty , but it 's certainly a real possibility . CROWLEY : Well , Senator , I -- I agree with you that , when we first started this earlier this week , it was very definitely an anti- Mubarak protest across the country . But we 've been noticing in the past couple of days that we are seeing more signs directed at the U.S. . One of those , just recently , in the past hour or so , caught our attention and I wanted to show it to you , a young man holding up the sign that says , `` USA , we hate your hypocrisy . '' My larger question to that is , is n't there a real chance here that the U.S. 's strongest ally , next to Israel , of course , or after Israel , in that region is Egypt , and we may be about to lose that ? SCHUMER : Well , that 's a real worry . And there are no really excellent solutions here . The best solution would be channeling legitimate protests and hurts of the people , both economic and democratic , into a democratic election . And if that can happen , there 's a chance , as Senator McCain said , for a decent outcome , maybe even a model for the rest of the Middle East . There is some anti-Americanism in the protests , but by and large , they still are basically , you know , a college student -- a college graduate who has n't been able to get a job for five years . That 's what the people really want changed . And we believe , as we always have , that democratic government is the way to go . And hopefully , it can be channeled in that direction with the Army , sort of , as a guiding hand . CROWLEY : Last question on this , because I do want to turn you to some domestic questions . But this has the potential of rocking the peace process . And I wonder what you think the threat to Israel is now -- not -- I do n't mean physical threat , but the threat to peace and stability in the region as a result of what 's going on right now . SCHUMER : Well , Egypt , by and large , has been a stabilizing force , obviously , recognizing Israel 's right to exist . Even after the assassination of Sadat , that continued . And so it is a very stabilizing force . My hope is that Egyptian politics , which has tended to be secular , certainly wanting more rights and deserving more rights , both economic and political , takes root in that country now . And maybe we 're at the time where it can . You know , not every country can become a democracy at the snap of a finger , but Egypt might well be ready for it . And that would be the best outcome , as I say , of a lot of bad choices . Mubarak can not continue in the long term with the oppressive regime he 's had now . The demonstrators have shown that . CROWLEY : Let me turn you to domestic policy because it is budget season . It is time to raise the debt ceiling . Otherwise the U.S. is going to lose its ability to pay its debts . Where do you see this fight going now ? Because , basically , we have a very determined bunch of Republicans right now , particularly on the House side , saying , no way we 're going to raise this debt ceiling until we start doing some cutting . SCHUMER : Well , there 's even a problem before the debt ceiling . On March 4th , the government funding resolution expires . And it seems that a lot of Republicans in the House want to risk a shutdown of the government if they do n't absolutely get their way . That was a mistake when Newt Gingrich tried it in 1995 . It will be a bigger mistake now . It 's really playing with fire because , if they were to shut down the government , not only would horrible things happen like an inability of people to get Social Security checks , you ca n't fund the military , but ultimately , it risks the credit markets . They are getting wary because of the large debt we have , which we have to get down , but if they feel that people are willing to shut down the government , you could risk the credit markets really losing some confidence in the United States Treasury , and that could create a deeper recession than we had over the last several years -- God forbid , even a depression . So I would urge my Republican colleagues , no matter how strongly they feel -- you know , we have three branches of government . We have a House . We have a Senate . We have a president . And all three of us are going to have to come together and give some , but it is playing with fire to risk the shutting down of the government , just as it is playing with fire to risk not paying the debt ceiling . CROWLEY : So , Senator , just quickly in the minute we have left , where do you see this going ? Because it is not an unpopular position at this point for a politician to say , we 're spending too much , and if you ca n't come to an agreement with the Democratic Senate or the Democratic White House , why would it be so unpopular to say , fine , you know , if you guys wo n't agree , let 's just stop spending and see what happens ? SCHUMER : Well , let 's say two things . First , certainly , we in the Senate and the president believes we have to rein in spending . The president called for a five-year freeze on spending . That 's rather significant . It saves $ 400 billion . But you ca n't just demand your position , particularly the position has kept getting more and more and more over to the right . Originally , they wanted to go down to the 2008 levels , now down to the 2006 levels . That would cause huge problems . Just one little example : 3,000 food inspectors would be fired , risking the health of our food ; 4,000 FBI agents , risking both safety on the streets and antiterrorism . So what government is all about is having strongly held views , but when not everyone agrees with you , coming to a reasonable position . We can come to a reasonable agreement that curbs spending . We Democrats showed that when we supported the bipartisan session , McCaskill 's proposal , in the last -- in the last budget . But to just stay in your corner and say , `` It 's my way or I 'm shutting down the government , '' that could lead to terrible , terrible problems . And I would plead with my new Republican colleagues in the House who seem to want to do this , that that is playing with fire . Please do n't do it . CROWLEY : Senator Chuck Schumer out of New York , thank you so much for joining us today . We really appreciate it . Next ... CROWLEY : CNN will continue to cover this developing story in Egypt and elsewhere and bring it to you , the latest , as it happens . Thank you so much for watching `` State of the Union .

Whether on the East Coast or the West Coast , crowds carried banners , flags and signs as they chanted , hoping their support could be felt thousands of miles away in Cairo , Alexandria and other Egyptian cities . In San Francisco , demonstrators gathered at a corner on Market Street and quickly packed the sidewalk , waving Egyptian and American flags . Participants seemed to represent a rainbow of backgrounds and ages . There were elderly couples , teenagers and children with Egypt 's colors painted on their faces . Many Egyptian-Americans were there , enlivening the chants with Arabic phrases . But plenty of people of Latin , Caucasian and Asian descent also turned out to march , support Egyptian demonstrators and demand the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak . Among the call-and-response chants came a reference to recent protests in Tunisia : `` Oh Mubarak , ca n't you see ? Time to join Ben Ali . '' In Seattle , traditional Egyptian melodies were heard among the chants and slogans . One man who led the chorus of old songs was impressed by the Egyptian movement 's use of social media . `` Thanks to new technology and new communications , the people from Facebook and Twitter , we are able to come together and make this happen . All the young people ... they feel like sometimes there is no chance . But you see this and think ... there is a chance .

It seemed to be a family affair , with small children flashing peace signs as their families waved flags and signs . `` They need everyone to hear them , '' one demonstrator told CNN affiliate KIAH . `` That 's the only way we can get change . It 's not going to come from within , it 's going to come from outside . That 's why we 're out here now . '' Egyptian-Americans gathered in Toledo , Ohio , too . They waved Egyptian flags and carried signs that read `` Defend Democracy '' and `` Defend Human Rights . '' Although only a handful of people braved the cold , nearly every passing car honked in support . On the East Coast , hundreds gathered outside the United Nations in New York . They held up signs that read : `` Mubarak Regime MUST GO , '' `` Egypt 's Struggle Is Our Struggle ! '' and `` Egypt -- We Hear You ! '' Meanwhile , they yelled out in unison , `` Hey ! Mubarak must go ! '' The United States can urge Mubarak to step down . ... Go to Switzerland . Go to South Africa . Go to the moon . We do not want President Mubarak . Sharif Sadek , a young Egyptian-American filmmaker in the New York crowd , said the ouster of the Egyptian leader is the only acceptable outcome . He urged U.S. leaders to make this happen . `` The United States can urge Mubarak to step down and leave the country . Go to South Africa . Go to the moon . We do not want President Mubarak , '' Sadek said . In Washington , protesters assembled outside the Egyptian Embassy before heading to the White House . One protester held up a cardboard sign that read : `` Pharaoh ! Let the people go ! '' Sam Abouissa , a protest organizer who said his brothers were arrested in Egypt while protesting , said he walked door-to-door in the capital to solicit support from fellow Egyptians . `` We need freedom . We need freedom on the Internet . Freedom of expressing our opinion . Freedom of choice , '' Abouissa said . `` We have to choose . We have to be free to choose .

With massive protests against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak entering their seventh day and a major opposition leader addressing demonstrators in Cairo , this week is shaping up to be a pivotal one for the country 's future . The unrest is starting to affect Egyptians ' food supplies and the United States is calling for a peaceful transition in Egypt to democracy . Governments of countries near Egypt are no doubt concerned about to what extent the unrest will spread to them -LRB- after all , Egypt 's protests came days after Tunisia 's president fled protests there -RRB- or how it will affect their long-term security . What will Mubarak do , and on what side will the Egyptian army fall ? Here 's a look at this and some of the other stories we plan to follow this week : Will Mubarak cling to power in Egypt ? Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Egypt 's major cities last week to demand an end to Mubarak 's 30-year rule , prompting the government to deploy the army to deal with civil unrest for the first time in a generation . The protests came after similar disturbances in Tunisia forced then-President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to flee the country . Both Egypt and Tunisia have seen dramatic rises in the cost of living in recent years and accusations of corruption among the ruling elite . Demonstrations also have taken place in recent weeks Algeria , Yemen and Jordan . -- -LRB- Update 2:04 p.m. Cairo , 7:04 a.m. ET -RRB- Protesters gathered in Cairo 's Tahrir Square said Monday that they were organizing a `` million man march '' around Cairo for Tuesday . -- Demonstrators also told CNN that they are organizing a `` million man march '' in Alexandria , but can not confirm when they will start . -- Tony Blair , Middle East peace envoy and former British prime minister , told Sky News Monday that the developments in Egypt have `` vast implications for the state of Israel , the Palestinians and the state of the peace process . '' He also said there are n't just two elements - a government that has long been in power and a movement for democracy - in the situation . `` There are three elements , because there is also a very strong Islamist movement in Egypt through the Muslim Brotherhood ...

The warm embrace that demonstrators gave troops this week illustrated the military 's respected and central role in Egyptian society . This fact makes the armed forces potentially a kingmaker in the current crisis , while also showcasing its challenge to somehow re-establish security without undermining its popularity . `` How they behave on the streets is going to matter a whole lot , '' said Shibley Telhami , a Middle East expert and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank . `` That 's going to be the dilemma : Can they maintain the order without antagonizing the public that they need ? '' The ascendance began in 1952 , when the military helped overthrow Egypt 's ruling monarch . Its support for a constitutional democracy and its performance in various wars and battles earned it the admiration of many Egyptians . Celebrations mix wth violence in Cairo `` There 's a good reason that the Egyptian military is held in pretty high esteem , '' said Peter Bergen , a CNN national security analyst , author and fellow at New York University 's Center on Law and Security . `` The army has done relatively well . '' All males between ages 18 and 30 must serve one to three years , as the CIA World Factbook notes , meaning almost every family in Egypt has some personal connection to the military .

The U.S. State Department has frequently blasted Egyptian police for torture and otherwise depriving citizens of their civil rights , including in its most recent 2009 Human Rights Report . `` They 're held in great disdain by their own population , for very good reason , '' Bergen said . `` They know that security forces have tortured literally thousands of people ... for almost any reason . '' This animosity boiled over this week , when angry demonstrators burned and ransacked police stations . On Friday , there were reports of casualties after police fought back citizens ' attempts to take the Interior Ministry in Cairo , the security forces ' headquarters . Just blocks away , in Tahrir Square , it was a very different and far more festive scene : Joyous demonstrators gathered near troops and embraced them , sometimes literally . This showering of love on the military , which were deployed Friday to patrol the streets for the first time since the mid-1980s was repeated many times over throughout Egypt . Video footage from Cairo showed some protesters celebrating by scaling tanks , with no repercussions . Many of them smiled and shook hands with troops on patrol , with one soldier even cradling a baby and posing for a picture . In Alexandria , where at least 2,000 gathered in Raml Square on Saturday , protesters chanted , `` The military and the people together will change the regime . '' That said , these same demonstrators were demanding the overthrow of President Mubarak -- a former hero in the Air Force and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces . He has largely surrounded himself politically with other veterans , including Saturday 's appointment of Omar Suleiman -LRB- a former lieutenant general in the army -RRB- as vice president , the first time Mubarak has tapped someone for that role in his 30 years in power . Experts are n't surprised Mubarak has moved to align himself with the military even more so , recognizing the armed forces ' place in Egypt . Still , by doing so , he also created a quandary for the military : Do they back Mubarak , whom they report to ? Or do they support the people , having largely been among them not long ago and wanting to preserve their reputation ? Andrew Pierre , a senior fellow at the U.S. Institute of Peace , said he expects top military officials to remain loyal to the president . But the rank and file are a different story , especially if they are called on to beat back civilians . `` They 're military people for two years or so , and I do n't know that they will be willing to shoot their brothers and sisters and families on the streets , '' Pierre said , adding that midlevel officers may be most torn and ultimately determine what happens . Through the first five days of the crisis , the 450,000-strong armed forces appeared to trying to have it both ways : refraining from acting against demonstrators , but at the same time vowing to bring order . Still , even as it vowed to enforce a curfew from 4 p.m. Saturday to 8 a.m. Sunday , there were no signs of the military doing anything to the hundreds who roamed the streets regardless . Telhami , though , thinks that ultimately the military may have to decide where it stands : behind Mubarak or the protesters . And their decision , many believe , will determine Egypt 's future . `` It 's all going to depend ... on where the military will be , '' he said .

Egyptians press for freedom on the 6th day of demonstrations . Social media proved to be vital in spreading the word to protestors across Egypt . Khaled Said became a symbol after allegedly being tortured to death on the hands of police in Egypt . President Mubarak demanded the government to resign after continuos criticism from demonstrators . January 30th , 2011 12:47 pm ET Americas puppet dictator Mubarak looks like he will not survive a call for democracy from the people of Egypt . In response America immediately sends in the puppet ElBaradei as a supposed representative of the Egyptian people . Egypts freedom movement is being co-opted quicker than the Tea Party . And the usual suspects in America are pulling the strings of corruption . But here is a fact that America politicians may find hard to swallow . Whats happening in Egypt is in fact happening all over the world . Belgium has not had a government for nearly one year . The people are sick of all sides . Americans gives a candidate a landslide victory one year and then a landslide defeat the next . Americans vote candidates out with disgust , they do not vote candidates in with belief . Britain has a coalition government as nobody has enough faith in any party . Ireland , Spain , Greece , France are subject to massive protest rallies and call for their governments to resign . Its global and the message from the people of the world is they are sick of dishonest , corrupt politicians who betray their countries , allow the banks to rape the state and then crow about democracy while they treat all regions of the world as theirs to command . January 31st , 2011 5:12 am ET Funny how you quit reporting it on Sunday night and just started showing repeats . Real nice caring job . Thanks for your support . and all the other populations subject to corrupt , dishonest dictators whose voices are muffled or whose minds are indoctrinated . One of the greatest qualities of democracy is freedom of expression but it is also one of the greatest challenges . Your opinions have long declared your distaste for democracy and it is clear that your problem is coping with anyone who has a different outlook to your own , somewhat similar to the world 's dictatorial leaders . I agree that many in the West , including governments and media are taking the wrong position in the Egyptian crisis , simplifying a process that is full of uncertainties and dangers , by promoting individuals who have specific contacts with diplomats and reporters , but unaware of the crucial importance of stability in the region . Positive change is difficult to be acheived when it is pushed by the media , whether the Muslim Brotherhood sponsored al Jazeera or the various Western owned outlets -LRB- with their own political agendas -RRB- . People need to think for themselves and initiate change at their own calling and at their own pace , not for the sake of camaras and reporters for transmission around the world which in themselves influence foreign government black and white opinions . February 1st , 2011 12:17 am ET Miriam , you are the type to repeat what you have been told on the news and then think your clever and well informed . In other words you are the perfect tool for manipulation . Its easy to manipulate you , because you cant see beyond nationalism and racism . Sadly you are the very common majority . Try to open your eyes . Look at the global corporatisation of Governments . Look at the scandal of the UN and the IMF . Look at the incremental high jacking of societies . Are you so dumb that you think the destruction of society will stop with a financial melt down in Greece , Spain , Ireland etc. . Are you so ignorant that you think that the Arab world has torn itself apart without any help . Are you so blind that you do n't see the banks gain bigger profits from all this misery . Keep waving your flag and repeating the nonsense your leaders tell you to believe . Follow them like the pied piper . But one day the troubles of Greece , Egypt and Spain will arrive at your door and you will become hungry , broke and lost . Alternatively you could become a meaningful human being , look beyond the BS in your favorite news paper and stand against the elite ruling classes who have screwed up your world . Or is it easier to attack the weak like Palestinians and blindly take all you can , until one day its your turn to lose everything . February 1st , 2011 1:30 am ET The danish government now supports democracy in Egypt , EVEN if `` the muslim brotherhood '' would be voted in . Well , do we not support democracy if the `` wrong '' people win by popular demand ? For the people of Egypt , I wish for a non-violent revolution , ending in a shape of government to their liking . The problem with modern democracy in many states around the world , is that to become a leader , you need money . A lot of money . Obamas campaign costs added up to 750 million $ ... Where is the democracy in this ? How can the working man compete with it ? Modern democracy is a pyramid of money , which looks a lot like the medieval feudal system , and until we , the people say no , it will keep looking like this . Peace to Egypt an power to the people February 1st , 2011 6:29 am ET Guys , it is not about USA or the west is particular , it is about the freedom , liberty and accountability which seem that those things are not available in the Middle East . But go back to Egypt where I came from Egyptians suffers for the last 60 years of corruption , dishonesty , suppression , manipulative media , lack of economic planning and dictatorship in each of those underqualified leaders and their regimes . The Egyptian constitution becomes an ill piece of legislation which has no relation to the fundamentals of the word constitution !! After too many changes to suit Mubarak and before him , Saddat and before Saddat was Naser , Sorry , at Naser s time there was no Constitution !! He did not need one because he knew it all and that was the beginning of the dark days for Egyptians . To John , I would like to say that ElBaradei is not a puppet to USA and he is an honest Egyptian , well educated and graduated from the law school in Cairo university and has a PhD in international law and I wish that he takes over an interim government until a proper Constitution get drafted to suit the people not the ruler !! What Egyptians need is responsible government to be accountable to its work and not a life time ruler . About the Moslim brotherhood , those people are not the as the media portraying them , it is just way of holding on power by indicating that if the Angle Mubarak goes the west will face the mighty extremists !! So the devil you know better than the devil you do not , and that is a naive approach from the west and I have to say that this is nonsense . For the rest of the Middle Eastern countries I wish you wake up too . Fortunately , in the `` world '' I live in , there is exposure to many information sources and media with every opinion under the sun . Consequently , one can develop one 's own ideas dismissing any attempt at manipulation and propaganda in the process . Those are the advantages of a democratic society with the institutions necessary to protect its citizens from descent into anarchy and chaos . February 1st , 2011 11:18 am ET Sayed K , thanks for your post . You say ElBaradei is not a puppet to USA . You say he 's only going to form a unity government until free elections are possible . My dear friend that s exactly what they said about Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan . ElBaradei is a UN man . What good has the UN been for the middle east ? Please understand the IMF ordered Egypt to cut food subsidies . They new this would cause riots . And just after they cut the subsidies ElBaradei flew in from the west . Mubarak has been a puppet for America , and he held you down with bullets made in the USA . But he is old and needs to be replaced . So in comes ElBaradei . The Muslim brotherhood has been funded by Britains MI5 since 1926 . The British and Americans want revolution to sweep the middle east . They hope your countries can be divided into smaller blocks like North and South Sudan . The want a new united Arab regime in Saudi and Egypt to fight Iran . The Egyptians on the street were never calling for ElBaradei . Most Egyptians on the street have limited access to modern communications and know little of ElBaradei . Ask the people who they want , do accept what the TV tells you is the people choice . February 1st , 2011 11:21 am ET Ask the people who they want , do NOT accept what the TV tells you is the people choice . It is quite likely that most of the 80 million Egyptians are satisfied with the Mubarak regime and are disinterested in change and anarchy . Unfortunately , they are also vulnerable to conspiracy theories . What the media is not telling you ? Inherent problems of the Arab world : - Dreaming to impose Islam worldwide by force - All the ME regimes and religious leaders brain washed peoples mind against external imaginary enemies - Investing in armies but not in future building - Increasing prices of basic food . - Inability to compete in the modern world No political movement calls to deal with the infrastructure issues ; Lessen to ME people and political declarations it is obvious that : The Arab masses want a solution to the unemployment and food problems regardless the regime type . February 1st , 2011 5:40 pm ET It is interesting that according to many media and commentators above , all of a sudden , millions of people around the world now agree with Avigdor Lieberman . Will that send them running in the other direction ?! February 2nd , 2011 12:35 am ET Several aspects need to be considered by the US and any other government , as well as anybody expressing opinions or support to Egypt : 1 . If you were in President Mubarak 's shoes , you would be scared . He fears for his life and unless a safe exit is guaranteed for him , preferably by another country , he will have difficulty acknowledging that he needs to step down immediately , for the sake of his own people . The world should not offer `` half-ass '' support and deals , as this will only breed resentment and lead to violence and a militant theocracy taking over . President Obama 's speech this evening is an example of such deal . Think : if you were an Egyptian putting your life on the line out in the streets , what impact would his message have on you ? Egyptian people need help handling the protests and the post-protest times . They have not had the privilege of growing up in a free society and being privy to peaceful and collaborative tools of resolving conflict . What is going on with this world ??? what about pease ? February 2nd , 2011 5:47 pm ET I plead all the European leaders and USA to force Mubarak to resign before the massacre among the protesters . February 3rd , 2011 1:01 pm ET noo plz not by this way if Mubarak to resign now egypt will be destroyed the people who protesters now in ELTAHRER dont representing Egyptians I plead all the European leaders and USA to ASK EGYPTIONS OUTSIDE -LRB- ELTAHER -RRB- before take any decision How about this amazing policy statement from the Quran ? `` He will teach him the scripture , wisdom , the Torah , and certain prohibitions imposed upon you . I come to you with sufficient proof from your Lord . Therefore , you shall observe GOD , and obey me . O followers of the scripture , why do you argue about Abraham , when the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed until after him ? Do you not understand ? '' That 's how we in the US can help democratize the entire Middle East . Wonder how that would sound in Hebrew , Koine Greek , even Latin which were all political before the writing of the Quran . Is n't this the highest form of freedom of speech there is ? i am Egyptian . . and now i proud February 6th , 2011 5:47 am ET Those who start protesting in Tahrir square are the young generation . It is true that many of opposition Parties try to ride the wave . But , they will not succeed as they never represented the people . As for the Muslim Brotherhood they are not welcomed by the people at all , even from religious Muslims . There numbers are not as the west think . They are not welcomed by anyone and will never take over Egypt . As for Mubarak he is trying to gain back his power over the country . He might succeed as the changes that he made are fake and all the new faces are in fact supporters to his regime . We need really the changes we claim , but the result is not clear at all ! February 8th , 2011 1:56 pm ET Learn , think and watch your steps ! The free world is advised to learn the lesson of `` Tehran 1979 , '' when a pro-Western dictator , the Shah , was overthrown by an alliance of reformists and Islamists . Shortly after the fall of the Shah , the Islamists smashed the reformists , establishing an anti-Western regime that sponsored anti liberal and democratic values using terrorism and radicalism throughout the world . The demonstrations in Tunisia and Egypt undermined the foundations of much of Obama 's approach to the Middle East . Obama administration Middle East policy is lead by the motto `` anything but Bush . '' It castigates Bush for being unrealistic regarding the promotion of democracy in the Arab world . Bush 's support for democratization led not to democracy but to the rise of Hamas Islamic terrorists - a branch of Muslim Brotherhood in Gaza . Now Obama is repeating Bush 's mistake in Egypt the leading strategic country in the Arab world . Obama calls for the inclusion of `` non-secular '' groups in the new government . Islamists anti-Western values and democratic government is deeply ideological and is not related to any American policy . Obama willingness to abandon USA allies and embrace the Islamists will harm the standing of USA allies and strengthen anti-Western Islamists across the region Comments are moderated by CNN , in accordance with the CNN Comment Policy , and may not appear on this blog until they have been reviewed and deemed appropriate for posting .

Jordan ceeded the West Bank to Isreal , is it now time for Isreal to ceed Gaza to Egypt ? Not all Crowns will fall , yet the 12 Tribes of Isreal will reunite .

U.S. armed forces leaders continued high-level talks Sunday with their Egyptian counterparts , applauding their `` continued professionalism '' and reaffirming the two militaries ' partnership , a spokesman said . U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has talked by phone this weekend with Egyptian Defense Minister Mohamed Hussein Tantawi , as well as Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak , according to Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrel . Also , Egyptian Lt. Gen. Sami Enan spoke Sunday afternoon with his equivalent in the United States , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen , according to Mullen 's spokesman . Mullen got an update from Enan on the situation in Egypt , and `` expressed his appreciation for the continued professionalism of the Egyptian military , '' said Capt. John Kirby , his spokesman . `` Both men reaffirmed their desire to see the partnership between our two militaries continue , and they pledged to stay in touch , '' Kirby added . These contacts came as Western diplomats continued to sound off on the situation in Egypt , where widespread lawlessness was reported following massive demonstrations calling for the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Sunday that Washington , among others , had `` made very clear that the concrete steps for democratic and economic reform that President Mubarak mentioned in his speech have to be acted upon . '' Meanwhile , British Foreign Secretary William Hague warned Sunday about the danger that Egypt -- should Mubarak exit , after 30 years in power -- could fall into the hands of extremists or a more authoritarian government . `` That is why the way forward is peaceful reform , '' he said . `` That requires the government of Egypt now to allow the right to peaceful protest , '' Hague urged . `` It also requires the Egyptian people to express their aspirations in a peaceful way and it requires -LRB- a -RRB- more broadly based government , the inclusion of opposition figures in the government . '' He declined to say whether Mubarak should stay in power , or whether he was capable of reform , saying it was not for the United Kingdom to choose Egypt 's leader . British Prime Minister David Cameron spoke with Jordan 's King Abdullah and U.S. President Barack Obama on Sunday , according to a spokesman for the prime minister who was not identified , in line with government policy .

CNN reporters on the scene witnessed throngs of people in Cairo march from Tahrir Square to the parliament building . Demonstrators threw rocks at police , who threw them back and shot tear gas at the protesters , who also reciprocated . While Egypt estimated that there were 5,000 to 10,000 protesters , CNN estimated that the demonstration peaked at 15,000 to 20,000 protesters . The protest 's organizers said they wanted to mirror the uprising in Tunisia , which 10 days prior had precipitated the end of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 's 23-year rule . Before the protests in Cairo , several Egyptians set themselves or tried to set themselves on fire earlier in the month , which also was reminiscent of Tunisia , where a man 's self-immolation spurred the uprising . The Egyptian protesters - who included young and old , Christians and Muslims , students , workers and businesspeople - said they were angry over the cost of living , failed economic policies and corruption . They demanded that President Hosni Mubarak , in power for three decades , follow the lead of Tunisia 's president . `` We breathe corruption in the air , '' said one demonstrator . Opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei came forward to say that the government was not stable . The Interior Ministry later said it would not allow `` any provocative movement or a protest or rallies or demonstrations . '' The protesters were undeterred . They clashed with police in Suez , and in Rafah , near the Gaza border , Bedouins tried to stop traffic by setting tires ablaze and throwing rocks at cars , according to Egypt 's state-run news agency . In a sign that social networking was a catalyst in the demonstrations , Twitter said that it had been blocked for two days and that protesters were using other applications or proxy sites to get out their message . Egypt denied the claim , saying it had not blocked Facebook , Twitter or any other website and suggesting that the sites may have been slow because of the traffic . In Washington , the White House called on both sides to refrain from violence and dubbed Egypt `` a strong ally . '' The U.S. State Department said Egypt was integral to maintaining security in the Mideast because it has diplomatic ties with Israel , has participated in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians and has aided efforts to stabilize Iraq . It also contributes to U.N. peacekeeping missions and backs the U.S. war on terror , the State Department said . The government continued to warn people against protesting as some Egyptians went door-to-door , urging their neighbors to take part in the demonstrations . Soccer matches in the country were canceled . The stock market was shut down for an hour after it fell precipitously . `` The conditions were terrible , because very few were allowed to go to the toilet , and we had to stand on the cold tiles of the floor , -LRB- which were -RRB- very dirty , '' he said . `` The barrier of fear is broken , '' he said after arriving from Europe , `` and it will not come back . '' The Muslim Brotherhood , the country 's largest opposition bloc , made its first call for its followers to join in the demonstrations -LRB- after Friday prayers -RRB- , a move that preceded prominent leader Isaam al-Aryan 's arrest . The U.S. Embassy in Cairo later issued a statement telling Americans to avoid areas where people congregate after prayer . Asked whether Mubarak should step down , U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said , `` No , I think the time has come for President Mubarak to move in the direction to be more responsive to some of the needs of the people out there . '' He further said that he felt Mubarak would respond to the `` legitimate concerns that are being raised '' and that many of the protesters were middle-class people simply looking for more opportunity . `` We ca n't understand how come this leader of the free world is looking the other way when it comes to our rights or freedom , '' he said . `` The despotic regime that -LRB- the U.S. -RRB- supports always demonizes the image of United States ... always putting blame on the United States for everything . '' Reports emerged that the demonstrations have spread across the nation , from Cairo and Alexandria to Suez and Ismailia . Soldiers and tanks rolled into major cities as demonstrators in Cairo and Alexandria torched police stations while burning and overturning police vehicles . Plumes of smoke rose over the Nile River as police fired water cannons , rubber bullets and tear gas canisters into crowds . It was the first time since 1985 that the army had been deployed to contain unrest . However , protesters said the army was far less aggressive than police had been , and in some cities , including Cairo and Alexandria , Egyptians applauded the arrival of tanks . As Mubarak imposed a curfew from 6 p.m. Friday until Saturday morning because of `` hooliganism and lawlessness , '' social networking played an increasingly important role to the uprising as Egypt continued a widespread crackdown on communications within and leaving the country . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged the protesters to be peaceful and said , `` We are deeply concerned about the use of violence by Egyptian police and security forces against protesters , and we call on the Egyptian government to do everything within its power to restrain its security forces . '' The State Department urged Americans to postpone any nonessential travel to Egypt as airlines began canceling flights into the country . The travel warning came as WikiLeaks released diplomatic cables showing that the U.S. is frustrated with Mubarak 's government but that it also considers Egypt an important and heretofore stable ally in negotiations over the Iranian nuclear program and in the handling of Hamas in Gaza . The U.S. also regards Egypt as an important player in combating Islamic fundamentalism . However , the cables show that the U.S. is troubled by the torpid pace of finding a successor for the 82-year-old Mubarak , economic reforms and Egypt 's attitude toward domestic opponents . Shortly after midnight , Mubarak asked the government to step down , saying in a televised address , '' I will commission a new government to take over tomorrow . '' Later in the day , he appointed intelligence chief Omar Suleiman as his deputy and tapped Ahmed Shafik , the civil aviation minister in the defunct Cabinet , to form a new government , state-run TV reported . U.S. President Barack Obama spoke with Mubarak after the address and told him he had a responsibility to `` take concrete steps and actions '' to deliver on the promise of democracy and greater economic opportunity that he made during his address to the Egyptian people . Tens of thousands of protesters , many of them disappointed that Mubarak did not announce his resignation during his speech , defied the curfew to continue the protests . Responding to Mubarak 's announcement , ElBaradei told Al-Jazeera that Egyptians wanted a regime change , not new personnel . `` The Egyptian people are saying one thing : President Hosni Mubarak must leave . We have to move towards a democratic state . '' With security dwindling in some neighborhoods , businesses were looted , and abandoned police stations were robbed of their weapons . In one Cairo neighborhood , roads were barricaded as residents handed out sticks and knives for protection , and armed men stayed up all night to protect their homes . One resident likened the situation to `` the Wild West . '' `` There have been no police officers on the streets since this morning . ... All the men are trying to protect the ladies , their wives and children , '' Cairo resident Sherief Abdelbaki said . `` We have all become vigilantes . '' In one instance , thousands of chanting demonstrators ransacked the headquarters of the ruling National Democratic Party and set it afire , but when they approached the state-run television building , soldiers linked arms , forming a human chain . The crowd stopped respectfully in front of the troops but continued chanting `` Down , down , Hosni Mubarak . '' But there were also instances of protesters lashing out at the army . Such was the case in Cairo , where demonstrators swarmed an army vehicle outside a hotel . At the Interior Ministry , violence erupted between demonstrators and security forces . Dr. Ragab Ali at the Ebad Al-Rahman Clinic said five people were fatally shot and another 60 were injured . At Prison Demu , near Cairo , several officials were killed when 1,000 inmates escaped the facility . In Alexandria , 31 people were killed in protests , according to officials , and chaos erupted when patients at a hospital grew angry that they were n't be treated quickly enough . As Egypt 's ambassador to the U.S. said his communication with the White House had come to a halt , British Prime Minister David Cameron , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on Mubarak to bring about a `` process of transformation '' and to hold `` free and fair elections . '' The U.S. said it was reviewing its aid policy for the north African nation . Israel remained largely quiet on the situation , and a Knesset member said he did n't believe that the protests could bring down Mubarak 's government because there were no viable leaders in the opposition . `` There is no leading figure that can lead the wave of protests till the regime falls , '' Benjamin Ben-Eliezer , who is considered to have the closest ties to Mubarak , told Israeli Army Radio . `` This is not a regime of one person , but it is backed by the army , the intelligence agencies and the secret service . '' The U.S. began flying stranded Americans out of the country as demonstrators again defied Mubarak 's curfew . The protests appeared largely peaceful as there were signs of increasing cooperation between the army and civilians , both fed up with looting and threats of violence from opportunistic criminals . More than 3,000 people , including looters and escaped prisoners , had been arrested , state-run media reported . Ali Regal , a student activist in Alexandria , said the military was working with demonstrators to coordinate security and map out a plan to set up checkpoints across the port city , but there were still signs of unrest . `` The army is very helpful and working with us , '' Regal said . `` There is a strong cooperation between the masses and the army . '' At Cairo 's Tahrir Square , crowds flanked ElBaradei , cheering his arrival . He told protesters he came `` to participate today in the lives of Egyptians . Today , I look into the eyes of each one of you , and everyone is different today . Today , you are an Egyptian demanding your rights and freedom , and what we started can never be pushed back . As we said , we have one main demand : the end of the regime and to start a new phase . '' Fatma Morayef , a Human Rights Watch researcher in Tahrir Square , said , `` The square has emptied out since the afternoon , but it 's still a great atmosphere , a sense of solidarity and very well-behaved : People are sitting around bonfires or walking around picking up rubbish , '' Morayef said . `` Crowds who find occasional looters drag them over to the soldiers and hand them over . '' Several thousand people remained in the square Sunday night , and many said they plan to stay until Mubarak resigns , Morayef said . Though Mubarak has given no indication that he intends to step down , he opened the door to `` dialogue with all the political parties , '' state-run media reported . He conceded that the protests had been peaceful but said the demonstrators had been `` infiltrated by a group of people who use the name of religion , who do n't take into consideration the constitution rights and citizenship values . '' Overall , said Sameh Shoukry , the Egyptian ambassador to the U.S. , `` The situation seems to be improving slightly in terms of security for private and public property . '' However , the ambassador said he had heard no communication from Cairo or Washington . In Israel , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he wanted peace and stability in the region and that he was `` anxiously monitoring '' the situation in Egypt . Shocking -- the inane rantings of a bunch of anti-Israel , anti-US , naive -LRB- and most likely , Muslim -RRB- morons . Oh wait -- this is CNN.com ; why should I expect anything else from a `` news '' organization made of anti-Israel , anti-US , naive morons . Such is to be expected from a person of your obvious limitations . CNN is not the right-wing Fox Network . In fact , I 'm they let moderates and liberals post here . That right is usually limited to conservative fanatics in most places . February 1 , 2011 at 3:56 am | Report abuse | There is great hype that today , one million Egyptians will protest in Cairo . It sounds a HUGE number but -- where are the other 82 million people ??? This isn ` t even 10 % and I would hazard a guess that at least half of the one million are under the age of 20 . So where is the sense in all this ?? Are reporters making a mountain out of a mole hill ? And how do you govern 82 million people ? A quick and peaceful end to this demand for freedom is made all the more uncertain by Obama 's cowardly refusal to support the people reaching out for freedom . After his Cairo speech , claiming to support democracy and freedom , he now huddles in the WH hoping to spot the winner , so that he can choose sides . The side if freedom is clear to the Egyptians who are watching and waiting to see what we do . If the choice goes to and Islamic state , we can claim a good portion of the blame by our failure to stand up with the protesters . ok ... that 's enough on egypt now . they do n't like us . let 's just stop sending money there and do n't help anyone develop anything ... they hate us . let them get themselves where they want to be . let the corporations deal with that . This guy has been president for 30 years ! Imagine Bush being the president for 30 years . Um , um , um . We need to be brave enough to say : `` We support freedom and democracy where ever and when ever it is organically derived from the will of the people . This support is unequivocal and without consideration to whether or not the will of those people will lean towards admiration or cynicism of the United States . As a Country , lets be honest enough to admit that if the Arab Street feels hesitancy towards embracing American ideals , at least some part of it originates from the fact that as a Country we have subverted many of our own ideals in choosing the political expediency of supporting dictators friendly to us rather than the moral courage of supporting the uncertainty of a popular movement . This needs to forever change . I ll let the state department write the Obama Doctrine that surely must follow . CNN : This story started 30 years ago with a US-backed puppet . This is a story that plays-out over and over . We give Mubarak hundreds of millions per year ; we have kept him in power to keep Egypt from attacking Israel . Now the whole thing is blowing-up in our faces . How will the Egyptian people deal with those who kept Mubarak in power ? I venture to say with Kensian realism . I think we give them Billions , not millions . We need to recognize that Egypt is n't Iran -LRB- although I 'm sure they 've taken note -RRB- . Religious governments are not quite known for their civil liberties , which is what this uprising is in large part about . The financial systems around the world are hanging on by a thread . The bankers are using every form of deception they can conjure up to keep it from imploding . Manipulation of metals trading shorts when they have no physical metals to back the sell -LRB- just like the paper with ink they say are `` dollars '' -RRB- , to buying Treasury Bonds from Goldman Sach 's at a higher interest rate payable by the taxpayers than buying the Treasury Bonds from the Treasury where the taxpayers would gain , instead the interest gets paid to Goldman Sach 's and the taxpayers get the bill , and the continued printing of counterfeit Federal Reserve Notes by the trillions devaluing every single note you have in your pocket . It is and always has been all throughout history the last act of a dying empire or banana republic to devalue the currency before it 's financial systems collapsed . History is upon the USA yet again . Only this time there are no forefathers to speak with intelligence and forethought , no Representation in the Government to demand it be done different , no people who can stand together without ignorance speaking to disrupt the goal , we can get 100,000 or more to go to an NFL game , but ca n't get 1,000 to stand in front of city hall and say that 's enough when they steal everything and take no responsibility . Sorry but we have become weak as a citizenry and need to wake up to the false division we have been led to believe that are not true . I wonder what the military is going to do here when they are ordered to fire on and kill all protesters when this happens here ? Will you Mister Military Guy or Gal kill your American Brothers and Sisters and Children to protect the very people who have voluntarily created and perpetrated this crime against America , the Bankers , Politicians , and the Criminals who are the Foreign Corporations who you kill for now all over the world , will you kill your own countrymen to protect them ? You will be asked to do so , if you have n't already . It 's a shame that the People allowed this to happen . It is entirely our , THE PEOPLE 's , fault ! @Vallen , so much truth to your post , but a bit unrealistic and pessimistic toward the end . There wo n't be killing of protesters here . Well , I 'm not sure I 'm as pessimistic as Vallen , but I do remember something regarding Kent State in which that very thing happened -LRB- military firing on protesters -RRB- . Perfect as clear as drinking water . No , say that instead of reaching the violent point this conflict will be settle on the table , negotiating and reaching the best solutions for all parts . There is a possibility and this is withing the hands of the educated population of Egypt who know that the best for the country is not revolution but evolution . If the government has failures those has to be corrected , if Mubarak is not a good leader then help him making the country better , if there are no opportunities , create them . Now there is a totally different reality from my standing point , but for sure Egypt deserves better responses for their problems , and more assertive solutions for their needs .

Opposition movements in Syria are calling for mass protests on Saturday against the rule of President Bashar Al-Assad . The groups are organizing on Facebook , with several pages promoting protests in Damascus , Aleppo and other cities . Protest organizers want better living standards , human rights improvements and a greater voice for youth , according to the Middle East Media Research Institute , a Washington-based organization that studies and translates news accounts and social-media postings . It 's unclear how many people might join the protests . A few thousand people had expressed their support for the movement on the Facebook pages , some of them undoubtedly from outside the country , the research institute said . On Sunday , Sudan got a taste of the protests . An undetermined number of university students and others demanded the removal of the government in Facebook-organized protests that its leaders said were inspired by the events in Tunisia . The students protested at a university in Khartoum , chanting `` No to high prices , no to corruption '' and `` Tunisia , Egypt , Sudan together as one . '' `` The people of Sudan will not remain silent anymore . It is about time we demand our rights and take what 's ours in a peaceful demonstration that will not involve any acts of sabotage , '' according an English-language version of the group 's profile on Facebook . `` We will demonstrate against the rising of the prices , the corruption , unemployment and all false practices of the government such as violence against women and lashing them in ways that breaks all laws of religions and humanity and the violation of minorities ' rights . '' The Sudan Tribune newspaper , citing a statement from police , said 70 people , 40 of them students , were arrested after the protests . Meanwhile , a Facebook page has surfaced calling for a protest Thursday in Yemen , which has been the site of a few demonstrations already . The Tunisian protests that sparked the region 's unrest sprang up after Mohamed Bouazizi , a 26-year-old college graduate , set himself on fire in protest of police confiscation of the fruit cart he had set up to make money . The protests resulted in the collapse of Tunisia 's government and inspired similar protests in other countries , including Algeria , Jordan , Sudan and Yemen . The protests have reached their zenith to date in Egypt , where untold thousands of Egyptians have ignored government curfews and clashed with police over demands that President Hosni Mubarak resign . A popular Facebook page that helped organize the Cairo protests was dedicated to Bouazizi .

It has been nearly a week since protests first erupted in cities across Egypt as people showed their anger and frustration with the Mubarak government . Tens of thousands of Egyptians have taken to the streets each day , plunging the country into a political crisis . The army was called onto the streets of Cairo in a bid to restore calm on Friday evening - a move that has n't happened in decades . While President Mubarak sacked his entire government on Saturday night , protestors were still not satisfied with that action - their primary demand is for Mubarak to resign .

January 31 , 2011 at 4:23 pm | Reply It is now or never , Our Democracy is being tested Our constitution calls for a free and democratic society , respecting human rights and freedom of speech , a message that we have been fighting to spread , and support all over the world . Today , we are going through a test , and it may be our last chance to prove that we practice what we preach , are we going to stand by our beliefs , or are we going to stand by a dictator who has held his nation under siege for 30 years . It was always clear that the Mubarak Regime was never a democratic one ; in fact , the opposite is true . It has been one of the most oppressive regimes in recent history , it wouldn t take much in the age of information technology to learn about Mubarak Regime and how bad it is , Egyptians have been living in terror and fear of the regime for decades , and US and allies of Egypt have been misled by Mubarak , and his government , believing his justification of implementation 30 years of emergency law and atrocities towards his nation is only done to protect the world from an Islamic Egyptian Government and terrorism . It is natural that we support a moderate government in Egypt , which is considered an important ally , and partner in our fight against terrorism , but we should have been more careful in believing and analyzing Mubarak Lies , our political analysts should have realized that we were being scammed by Mubarak , believing his lies , and ignoring his actions , and the frequent screams of Egyptians for freedom and democracy . Why did we wait , and why did we continue to support an 82 years old dictator against the well of his nation , soon enough his regime would have collapsed with or without an internal revolution , it is clear to anyone that the not so intellectual dictator s health is failing , he has had some serious health issues for the past few years , and despite of his jet black hair , and plastic surgeries , it is clear that age has taken its toll , Mubarak has had a hearing impairment for years , and his refusal to wear a hearing aid , has made him the joke of the media . Most recently , it is clear that he can t stand up or walk in a straight line . We should have thought and planned of what is after Mubarak , and the future of our relationship with Egypt . It is time to admit that we have been scammed by Mubarak , and in believing his lies , that we have sacrificed so much money , that never benefited the Egyptian people , and it may have been abused by the dictator and his regime , it is American technology , equipment and Military AID that is being used to suppress freedom fighters in Egypt . The US should never support governments that hold its nation hostage without phone lines , internet , and basic human rights . The Mubarak regime in a move that will go in history , and after abusing and killing demonstrators , has withdrew all security forces , including fire fighters , and traffic controllers from the streets , and has aided prisoners release so he can teach his nation a lesson they can never forget , in the hope that his secret police and released criminals will terrorize the public enough to get them distracted from their fight for freedom and democracy . It is our obligation to stand by democracy and freedom fighters ; it is our duty to support our constitution and what we really believe in , over the past few days Egyptians have been pleading for US help , and we have not taking a firm stand in supporting their cause , Indeed we may be concerned about a hard line new government that may unbalance peace and reform initiatives , but in taking a calculated risk , a peaceful revolution that is initiated by new generations of young and educated Egyptians , and through Social Media and electronic communication will never allow a hard line Islamic government to take power , Egyptians are looking for a free and democratic society that is not so different from ours , supporting their cause today , may pay off much more than what Mubarak did , as they are looking for reform and development , not war and terrorism . We hope that our government acts in a timely fashion , before it is too late , Mubarak days in office are numbered .

MESSAGE FROM AN EGYPTIAN TO THE WORLD I 'm Egyptian working as political analyst in an Arab embassy abroad in a western country , The Western World should not be misled by Hosni Mubarak regime 's eternal mistaken assumption that the Islamic extremists are the only existing alternative as a ruling party , there are A LOT of Egyptian successful opposition political figures that are NEITHER MILITARY NOR ISLAMISTS . The Muslim Brotherhood party used to be an extremist group during the 80 's , but now , they are just ordinary normal professionals , very highly educated , I think they are the most cultured , eloquent and articulated among all the existing political parties , but I have to confess that I do n't seem to like the idea of having such name to their party , it sounds that they just believe in a direct relationship between religion and politics , and for me , as Muslim and Egyptian , it 's NOT ACCEPTABLE . So I would n't feel that bad seeing their members in the parliament , but it 's quite annoying to see them ruling . The Western World should no more assign that role to Egypt as the protector and the nanny of their dear son -LRB- Israel -RRB- , Egypt is a COUNTRY FOR ITS OWN , we , Egyptians , should be -- from now on -- working HARD for our OWN GOOD , regardless to the WHOLE ZONE , including other arab countries and Israel too of course . Why should we be the `` Key Role '' `` Strategic '' spot of the middle east and everybody is counting upon our steps and so ... We EGYPTIANS MUST LIVE AND DIE FOR OUR OWN BUSINESS , as a matter of fact , I do n't really care if any arab country or Israel catch a fire or get a noble prize , WE WANT TO LIVE FOR OUR OWN GOOD . We do have the right to protect our land though against any foreign attack , from any country , no exception . Hope you guys publish my comment , and for all the world , Mubarak regime is Over and a new Egypt is to begin . you can freely keep on killing kids , women , old men and women as always , you can freely keep on expanding your illegitimate settlement , and Egypt will keep on doing nothing but CONDEMNING just like USA and EU , we do n't care anymore , BUT NEVER EVER EVEN THINK OF THE POSSIBILITY TO VIOLATE OUR LAND , WE ARE STILL THE PHARAOHS , REMEMBER WHAT OUR PHARAOH DID TO YOU 7000 YEARS AGO AND THE LATEST PHARAOHS OF 1973 ...

January 31 , 2011 at 7:08 pm | Reply As Egypt stands at the dawn of democracy , one question should not remain unasked nor unanswered . What kind of democracy can , will or should emerge , so that this democracy addresses and fulfills the needs and aspirations of its people in the best possible way ? Not only do the Egyptian people hold the opportunity to shape their own democracy , they also have an opportunity to update the very system of democracy as the world knows it . In democracies of the past there were limited means for dialogue between the people and their government . The democratic elections once every X years could therefore be seen as the only feasible way for the people to exert their opinions on how their country should be governed . Today however , we live in a vastly different world where people are increasingly more knowledgeable , connected , informed , proactive and passionate about their causes . Today , we live in a world where one uploaded video can touch the lives of millions , where one blog entry can spark a national debate and where the protest of one man in Tunisia can change the future of entire countries . Yet , despite all the technological advances and innovations that has changed virtually every aspect of our lives , the democratic system that governs many people 's lives today is largely still the same limited democracy of the past where its people can only exert their influence in a very limited way , through a vote once every X years . In light of the vastly decreased amount of transaction costs of communication between the government and its people , and in light of the vastly increased amount of valuable knowledge , skills and expertise of its people , what role can governmental crowdsourcing platforms play -LRB- both online and offline -RRB- to inventarize the needs , problems and priorities of its people , channel their aspirations and utilize their creativity and productivity to bring effective solutions towards their desired future ? With the Egyptian youth leading the protests in Egypt , mobilizing millions with social media , email , phone , text and word of mouth , has the time come for a new kind of democracy of the people , by the people and for the people ? Has the time come for democracy 2.0 ? January 31 , 2011 at 7:17 pm | Reply Somebody asked what was wrong with Islamist parties .

Well , they started with a Continental Congress , decided what type of country they wanted and then they had a revolution against the mother country , not the other way round . What they did n't do was mob the streets . People who mob the streets end up with an Islamist state or as in the case of Russia , with the USSR . When you mob and your country totters , you find yourself starving and have opened the door to the first group , no matter who they are , who offers food .

January 31 , 2011 at 7:46 pm | Reply February 8 , 2011 at 7:01 pm | Reply MUBARAK : TO BE OR NOT TO BE Mubarak did well in his past 30 year reign . He is today being accused for things that was out of his hand or out of his control , which was his inability to control the hyper inflation that is the major cause of the Tahrir upheaval . To my opinion , especially as what I have seen during the last 25 years since my return to Egypt in 1985 , . . is as follows : Egypt had gone through calm transition after President Sadat 's assassination . Things were basically calm and Egypt was a poor country coming out of a very expensive war . People were living a very basic life , with a market that still had a communist character to it ; with government cooperatives selling subsidized food to long ques of people , and government department stores selling cheap cloth and basic low quality household items . People did not own cars yet , . . and the few fortunate had televisions , telephones , and even fridges . Those who had washing machines were like living in a future world . But people were happy since their needs were very basic and food was plenty and cheap . Mubarak wanted to change all this and put Egypt into the New Modern World with a goal to bring Egypt up to the level of the developed nations , so he started a five year reform program so as to industrialize the nation . During these five years of reform that started in the mid eighties , . . the country was progressing fast , ... all levels of people in Egypt were seeing the benefits of this economic revival . There was plenty of money circulating the market , . . food was cheap , there was a boom of supermarkets , a non existent unemployment figure in the economy , a large import of luxury goods such as cars and domestic items , a booming investment market , creation of many private schools , a strong export market , and a mass exodus of Egyptian manpower working abroad returning a large remittance to Egypt 's national coffer . THEN THINGS STARTED GOING BAD in 1991 . The 5 year industrial reform program that was initiated by the Egyptian government were the heydays of Egypt . These 5 years of industrial revolution was from 1986 to 1991 , and the Egyptian population witnessed it 's best times in modern Egyptian history . Unemployment was non-existent , business and investment was booming , money was plenty and circulating on the market vigorously , those not happy traveled to find a better life and work abroad , imports and exports were exceptionally high , . In fact the remittance from Egyptians working abroad was the bulk of Egypt GNP , circa 15 billion dollars annually , surpassing the other booming national incomes such as the Suez Canal , Tourism , and Agricultural exports . The government and population was drenched with this excess wealth squandering this money like a spoilt child . In fact the government borrowed from the IMF 20 billion dollars on interest free loan , in which the Egyptian government had a plan to pay this loan back , believing that the economic boom would last . This interest free loan from the IMF or World Bank was used to build the main infrastructures needed for the industrial revolution such as electric power plants , large sewage systems for the big cities , high tech communications , roads , and certain industries . That was only the beginning of Egypt 's woes . Then suddenly out of the blue , . . comes the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the 1991 Desert War in Iraq . Circa 5 million Egyptians had to repatriate back to Egypt in a few month . A sudden invasion of returning Egyptians from Iraq , . a beginning to Egypt 's economic downfall . 15 billion dollars of income interring Egypt 's coffer , due to the remittance of Egyptians in Iraq and the heavy export of Egyptian goods to Iraq , suddenly becomes non-existent . A surprising shock not calculated in the Egyptian 's 5 year industrial reform plan , . were Egypt 's main national income which was coming from Iraq was the main remuneration needed to pay back it 's free interest loans to the IMF or the World Bank , . . plus other accrued debts with other countries and commercial institutions . Add to this miscalculated economic event are the 5 million now unemployed Egyptians returning empty handed due to the evacuation policies of Iraq . An angry and frustrated people demanding their places in an Egyptian labor market that was not ready for this exodus . A few month pass and the Egyptian economy is trying to employ these displaced Egyptians from Iraq at a heavy cost so as to quail their disappointment , but a larger problem was now knocking on the Nations door , . . repayment of the interest free loans and other outstanding debts . Since Egypt lost its main export market plus a very large revenue from Egyptian expat remittance all coming from Iraq , its GNP fell drastically . Here is one of the largest problems that is the precursor to the problems we see today , . . the IMF and World Bank demand Egypt to float the Egyptian pound due to it 's falling GNP and export losses . The floating of the pound sent the Egyptian pound falling from 1.80 L.E a Dollar to 3.25 L.E a Dollar , . . a devaluation of at least 100 percent . So these interest free loans from the IMF or World Bank now cost Egypt and its population double the price ; a repayment of 36 billion L.E pre 1991 to a shocking 65 billion Egyptian pounds post 1991 . The Egyptian government had to repay this loans so as not to default , . . its only way was by increasing prices on the local market through taxes , stamps , electricity , water , government services , . . But the people accepted the increased market prices since still the Food Prices had not reached the danger marker . But this was only one of the misfortunes , and the coming years other misfortunes were to come . Starting from 1991 with the floating of the Egyptian pound due to IMF and World Bank requirements , . . prices in Egypt had tripled during a few months . For example a car that was priced at 4,500 L.E pre1991 was now 15,000 L. E , meat that was priced at 8 L.E pre1991 was now 20 L. E , a house that was priced at 45,000 L.E pre1991 was now priced at 110,000 L.E. . So now the Egyptian market had to rehabilitate itself and stabilize to this new hyper inflation such as by increasing wages . Now that Iraq was a lost export market for Egypt , the country had to look at other world markets so as to recuperate it 's hard currency that was depleting . The problem here is that the GATT talks , that was now part of the new world order , had a certain criteria for countries to enter this global export and import network . The IMF and World Bank enters this picture again , . . demanding that Egypt has to privatize its national industries and get rid of government subsidized commodities that was essential to the low income Egyptians . So again another woe to Egypt 's economy , a very costly transition to suddenly change a whole national system from nationalization to privatization to fulfill the GATT criteria . This privatization program took a few years where gradually a large population of the labor force working in nationalized industries were suddenly asked to leave their work with a very small remittance . So gradually we have an unemployment figure increasing again due to a large labor population out of work due to the new privatization program , . . a privatization program that was formed by a world body that had not even created a labor law to protect the rights of a new labor market . Add more salt to this situation , . suddenly the subsidized commodities that was the essential welfare of the disadvantaged or poor , had disappeared from the local market . A few examples of these subsidized commodities are sugar , oil , soap , rice , chicken , meat , fish , and flour . So now we have a large unemployed and disgruntled low income population created by the privatization program , who also see their subsidized commodities suddenly increase two fold in price . But the Egyptian Government had to follow the GATT regulations and criteria otherwise an export market needed for hard currency would disappear and the soft loans from the IMF\\/World Bank needed for the ongoing economic development would be non-existent . A catch 22 state that had stressed the Egyptian economy . But the Egyptian population was patient and resilient , putting their trust on Mubarak 's government ; a population used to hardships and optimistic that things could not get worse . But alas , . . the coming years had more disasters to envelope . From 1991 -- 2001 , during this 10 year period , Egypt saw its economic fortunes depleting . A triple inflation rate and a very large unemployment level never experienced in Egypt 's modern history ; all due to the 1991 Iraq war , the floating of the Egyptian pound , the privatization of the nationalized industries , and the removal of commodity subsidies used for a very large needy population . But the Egyptian population kept on striving , and what used to be a slow paced life prior to 1991 was now a fast hard working double job life to most Egyptian citizens . But nobody complained , since the character of the Egyptian people due to their religious believes made them thankful that they were still able to make ends meet , based on their religious ideology that things could be worse if GOD-willing . Then came 2001 with the unfortunate and shocking 9 11 attack on the North East of the USA . Another uncontrollable factor that was going to again affect the Egyptian economy in a very negative way . Egyptian citizens were accused of siding with underground Islamic forces such as AL Qaida , that were anti-American and even anti-European . So came out an international policy by the USA , the newly formed European Community , and their allies to curtail Visas and travel to Egyptians . In another words , travel out of Egypt for Egyptians to most countries of the world , was now stopped by the US and EU on the basis that most Egyptians could be terrorists sympathizing with an anti-western Islamic movement . So Egyptians that were unemployed or looking for a better life and work abroad were not able to travel as was a norm before 2001 . Since the open door policy of Sadat that started circa 1975 , nearly a quarter of Egypt 's population traveled abroad for better opportunities of work and a better life . It is these Egyptians that traveled to the USA , Europe , Iraq , Australia , Canada , and most of he world that were returning large remittance to Egypt making them one of the countries largest hard currency earners . Another blow to the Egyptian economy , a returning population of Egyptians that feared political and racial reprisals abroad , were now joining an already increasing number of unemployed in Egypt that could not travel abroad due to the travel restrictions . Included is the lost hard currency remittance of the returning Egyptians , plus the lost opportunity of increased hard currency of what would have been an increased remittance by Egyptians who would have traveled if the travel restriction had not taken place . Life now was getting very hard for the Egyptians in Egypt due to the very high unemployment rate and a very large decrease in hard currency remittance , stressing the Egyptian economy that still had to pay it 's hard currency debts so as not to default . The Egyptian government had no other choice now but tax and increase prices on the local market so as to meet the countries expenditures and foreign debts . And it still does not stop here , since another woe was knocking on the door . Post 2001 Egypt were the years of social upheaval and change . Unemployment was reaching 15 percent due the conglomeration of Egyptians who returned from Iraq , those who lost their jobs due to the privatization program , and those who returned from the US and Europe due to racial reprisals created from the 9 11 attack . Added to these numbers were the new graduates from Universities who could not find employment due to the stagnate industries that had lost it 's export markets to the Arab world . Where once the unemployed and dissatisfied Egyptians would travel abroad to search for employment and a better life , the Visas and travel was know closed to them due to the anti terrorist policies that was forced on Egypt by international bodies . But the Egyptian population was still striving by creating local small business , inventing menial jobs and services , saving , and even stealing and begging . The population was now at a very high stress level ; disgruntled , angry , and negative . Thuggery and corruption was now at a rise with a high crime rate that had never existed before in Egypt 's past history . The population was ready to explode and the fragile economy was walking on a thin line . The government had no time to think about the countries internal social problems since it was putting all its attention into shifting it 's hard currency earning industries that were industrial exports and remittance to tourism , petroleum and electricity exports , and the Suez Canal . The police force was given the green light and the right to use excessive power to control the increasing crime , thuggery , and discontent . This extended power to the Ministry of interior gave the police absolute power which was used to quail a now volatile population through fear . So life in Egypt starting from 2002 were years of hardship with a faltering economy , even though inflation was still at check . Then came the last woe which is the precursor to the Tahrir Uprising . By 2002 the Egyptian economy was functioning internally , the population was striving on the money that was circulating in the local market . Industrial exports were at a standstill and Egypt 's hard currency earnings were from a few industries such as tourism , petroleum and electricity exports , and the Suez Canal . Since the increasing population was demanding more resources , the governments expenditures were increasing over its earnings creating an economic depression . Then out of a black sky the Euro was created , and Egypt 's currency floats again due to the World Banks evaluation of the Euro rate . A few month down the road the IMF and World bank demand Egypt to float the Egyptian pound against the dollar for a second time . This was it , . . the Egyptian pound devalued another 100 percent from 3.33 LE to 6.00 L.E to the dollar , clearly meaning that imports and Egypt 's outstanding foreign debts were going to double in price . The Cash starved Egyptian economy was broke , and hard currency earnings from the national industries were not sufficient to pay outstanding foreign debts , . . the government started collecting off the local market . From 2002 up to today , . . the Egyptian economy was now in a deep depression with hyper-inflation hitting the local market without disdain . Every year there was a price increase on all products on the market , may it be foodstuffs , building material , petrol , electricity , water , transportation , medical bills , education , real estate , and nearly any imaginable thing . Egyptians were now really stressed since none could meet their ends . For eight years an angry Egyptian population were complaining about the government 's excessive price hikes , . . accusing them of stealing the countries wealth and being corrupt and therefore the main reason to the counties depressive state . Yes , there was excessive corruption and many elite figures in the higher echelons of the government and business community did make excessive amount of money due to the abuse of their power , positions , and wealth ; but that was only a fraction of what was lost due to the economic woes that was pushed upon the country due to international monetary policies . During these past eight years shanty towns were sprouting in any empty quarters of the country , the government could not check these hotbeds of discontent since the people themselves were aggressive . These hotbeds of discontent created a ruthless population of violent citizens that would grab at any chance to make money , . if it was through crime , creating mafia organizations who were monopolies inflating prices on certain commodities , and stealing at any opportunity . Thuggery became a norm , and the economy on the market based itself on the survival of the wiliest , corrupt , and strong . The Government had to check the population giving the police force and the Ministry of internal affairs the full rights and freedom to use excessive force on the population . The police force and its security apparatus was now a business on its own , with its absolute freedom to use it 's powers as needed . Incredible to see a society and a cultural character that used to be passive and polite suddenly change to aggressive and attacking . May it be the poor , the police , the rich , or the government , everybody was gnawing at the other . The police was under stress to control the crimes and revolutionary elements that were increasing in the squalid quarters of the mega-city shanty towns , so they became a business on their own by protecting richer areas of the society and getting compensations for these works , because even the under payed police force was affected by the economic depression . The depression became a boom for the rich and a boon to the poor and middle class . To prove the importance of what is stated in this article , this was posted by Reuters dealing with a economic reform plan declared by the new Egyptian cabinet on the 13th day of the January 25th uprising : Feb 08 , 2011 at 12:52 CAIRO -- Egypt 's new cabinet promised to keep subsidies in full and draw in foreign investment at its first meeting since an uprising driven in part by poverty and economic hardship broke out two weeks ago . Incredible but during the last 8 years prior to 2011 , . . one could observe how the rich got richer and increased in number during the depression and vise verse with the poor . The stressed Middle class was in a magnet being pulled by both sides , . . some dropped to a poorer level while other became a new higher middle class . This was due to a large unemployed labor sector , in which competition between the unemployed laborers for work brought their wages dropping to unsustainable levels in which they could not reach the end of the month if they did not borrow money , work a double shift , live in deplorable conditions , or exhort money . The rich were getting richer due to the low labor wages and a poor government that was accepting kickbacks . So the law of the jungle was functioning in the economics of a mega-city which was the economic nucleus and therefore effecting the country as whole . Only the past 8 years did the population of Egypt curse their President and a police force that was using excessive force for stability and control . A President that was respected and liked up to the past eight years . Mubarak is not able to tell his people that all the economic miss falls of the Egyptian economy was due to international policies that had cheated him and Egypt outright . He let corruption rampart since the people were aggressively out of control and he became incumbent due to the continuously uncontrolled misfortunes that happened to Egypt in only 11 years . It does n't really matter if Mubarak is to be or not to be the President of Egypt , since the problem can only be solved if the travel restrictions on Egyptians to travel abroad is lifted and the International Momentary fund plus World Bank re-evaluates the Egyptian pound .

Twitter , Facebook , YouTube , cell phones and even cable news outlets are putting a tremendous amount of power right into the hands of the people . And do n't think for a second that the rest of the Arab world is n't watching . For starters , these communication tools allow ordinary citizens to plan and organize protests in a way that was unthinkable just a few years ago . They can spread the word about mass protests , ensuring more people will show up . In turn , the sheer size of some of these protests makes it close to impossible for officials to stop them . Thanks to Facebook and Twitter , these protests are n't happening in a vacuum as they might have decades ago . When young Egyptians take to the streets by the thousands , the world is seeing it and hearing about it in real time through texts , tweets , pictures and videos . It 's also why governments , such as those in Egypt or Iran , have tried to crack down on the internet and some of these websites . In the case of Egypt , social media sites have also put pressure on Washington to act more quickly . With so much information leaking out , it became impossible for the U.S. to downplay what was going on and stay out of it . No surprise that other dictators in the Middle East are worried . And they should be - they could be next . Interested to know which ones made it on air ? This is great news . Well , the actual news is n't great , but the idea of social media is . Governments and large businesses no longer have total control over the media and public opinion . This is a great counterbalance to the power struggle in the world . Dictatorships can only thrive when they can control information . As long as those who are being repressed can find a way to get the information out , the dictators will have a hard time and will likely crumble all the more quickly . Social media is only one way to spread information . As long as the internet exists , there will be ways to use it . I think we are witnessing the end of the totalitarian state as a form of governance . Some in the news media are leading viewers to conclude that the Egyptian protesters are mostly secular , non-violent , not anti-American , and somewhat more Westernized than protesters we have seen in other Arab countries . To that end , where are the Egyptian women protestors ? I 've seen only men . This instant technology is wonderful . It shows the whole world in real time what monsters govern these countries . After 30 years of repression , Mubarak is doomed . My only hope is that democracy will take over . It seems democracy would be the logical choice since Facebook and Twitter are the very essence of free speech . Social media are redefining the dynamics of popular revolt . The need for a central figure to drive a revolution is replaced by the collective consciousness of the masses . If we had had all this technology back in the 1960s and 1970s , how different the U.S. would be today ! Just think how many folks would have shown up for MLK , the March on Washington and our own Days of Rage . And what would have happened at Kent State ? Jack : Social media allows the story to get out about Egypt 's struggle for freedom . Social media allows people to communicate with other people who have freedoms , and this comparison brings on an uprising . Gradual freedom brings on an evolution of democracy , but Egypt has been struggling for 30 years . We are witnessing the Egyptian people bring about more freedom for itself and its children . January 31 , 2011 at 1:59 pm | Instability in the middle east , will offer more opportunities for Al-Queda , and their sympathizers , to gain more control over people , and become an even greater danger to the free world . It is highly unlikely that any type of westernized democracy will evolve , in that part of the world , due to the religious oppression . January 31 , 2011 at 2:02 pm | Jack you are saying that if I use social media and can get enough people to agree with me I can put pressure on the American government to do something , even though I 'm from another country . That is just wrong . How long has the world been telling the US to shut up and but out ? Ever sense the Korean war ended . Did you ever listen ? No , so how in the name of god is facebook , twitter and whatever going to make America do anything ? What these things do is circumvent people like you and Wolf . By sharing person to person or using social media we take the TV media spin out of the equation and are left to judge events by ourselves . That 's what scares politicians and the news media the most . People getting the actual facts without spin control . January 31 , 2011 at 2:07 pm | the everyman has a voice and is using it . Would n't it be ironic if the population in all these countries rose up and found there voice and installed a true democracy . Not a capitalist society but a true democracy where the citizen is elected not the warlord . January 31 , 2011 at 2:15 pm | I think the social media has affected the modern uprising in a big way . Before a dictatorship could shut everything down and run everyone out of town . Then use what any means necessary to shut down the uprising in total darkness . With today 's modern technology there always seems to be a way for the news and pictures to get out in real time . The protesters are able to stay in touch with one another and become better organized . Making it hard for dictators to stay in control of their country . January 31 , 2011 at 2:22 pm | You betcha Jack , Social Media and technology are the driving forces behind the spread of current social and political revolutions in the Middle East and North Africa . The genie is out of the bottle and the news of these revolutions have gone viral since Tunisia exploded . Arab and other third world leaders are now on notice : Institute democratic and economic reforms or prepare to be removed from positions of leadership because other forces are waiting in the wings to assume power . The same message applys to leaders of the developed world as well . January 31 , 2011 at 2:23 pm | The more people communicate with each other , and share ideas and ideals . The more we 'll find out just how small this world really is . We are now seeing that basic human rights out weigh all of human greed and corruption . We are seeing that were all not that much different from each other . We all want was is right . The Middle Eastern people want basic human freedoms , employment , freedom to speak your mind , to peacefully assemble , to vote for it 's leaders . Democracy is a good thing , until special interests have their way . January 31 , 2011 at 2:26 pm | People use the tools to which they have access . Be it word of mouth , flyers , Morse Code , smoke signals , or social media , people with grievences find a way to be seen and heard . Think of how fast we will get our information in another 50 years . January 31 , 2011 at 2:28 pm | Power to the people . Who 's next , the US and our Congress ? Could be if they do n't wake up . January 31 , 2011 at 2:36 pm | It works both ways Jack . To use social media to protest peacefully it is a wonderful thing . To use social media to gather unlawfully and for unlawful purposes is quite another . Where the problem comes in is when people use social media to manipulate people and opinion . Who knows if what is being put on Facebook is true and accurate and it could incite riots . An angry mob is an ugly thing and innocent people tend to get hurt . January 31 , 2011 at 2:52 pm | It has allowed the people to speak louder than the dictators . We need more social media and uprisings until we achieve social equality , and the world has a long ways to go before we reach social equality ! January 31 , 2011 at 2:53 pm | They have done so in ways that the affected dictators could not have imagined in their worst nightmares . And that goes for some of our own lawmakers and politicians right here . The last presidential election proved that . Trust me , our leaders are working overtime to figure out a way to shut down the internet at will . They forget that it was designed several decades ago -LRB- when people were a lot smarter -RRB- to be able to survive a nuclear attack . January 31 , 2011 at 2:53 pm | Social media & technology is here & will only continue to become more & more advanced . Yes , we are able to observe what is happening all across the world by the click of a mouse or our T.V. remote . The bottom line is not due to either of these tools . These protests & uprisings are not limited to the Middle East . Its happening in many parts of the world & the reason is always because of corrupt Government . People have become frustrated & tired of their corrupt lawmakers & are now insisting it comes to an abrupt halt . I hate to say it , and I hope I 'm wrong , but i 'm thinking the U.S. is sitting on the doorstep of protest & uprising if the Government does ` nt get its bussiness in order . January 31 , 2011 at 2:53 pm | Jack : It allows the `` freedom of thought '' to be deposited into others ! January 31 , 2011 at 2:54 pm | Lizzie 's husband Ken In California You betcha it has Jack . The social media and technology has given us instant information faster than it takes for the tears on John Boehner s face to dry . January 31 , 2011 at 2:59 pm | Social media have made organizing protests much easier and more widespread . The downside is that they can veer off in unexpected directions , control being taken by the most organized . One need only look at the Russian revolution , an early example of media involvement in political uprising that was usurped by the organized Bolshevik party , and the Iranian revolution , another media fueled uprising , similarly usurped by an organized minority , the mullahs with their radical Islamist policies , contrary to the goals of the majority of those involved . We can only hope that the forces for democracy are at the forefront of the unrest in Egypt and not Islamic radicals aligned with Hezbollah or similar violent groups . January 31 , 2011 at 3:07 pm | CNN is leading its viewers to conclude that the Egyptian protestors are mostly secular , non-violent , not anti-American , and somewhat more Westernized than protesters we have seen in other Arab countries . To that end where are the Egyptian women protestors ? I 've seen only men . January 31 , 2011 at 3:21 pm | I think one big factor , as we saw in Iran during their protests , is that uplinks to the likes of Twitter , Facebook and YouTube makes it almost impossable for the people in power to censor the news of what is happening . they can no longer just cut off traditional media and hope the truth does n't get out . this is a GOOD thing and gives new meaning to `` the whole world is watching '' . and as a side note to this same technology , Jack , secretive organizations like the US Military and State Department are also subject to having their `` dirty laundry '' being `` aired in public '' like the Reuters journalists being murdered by that US Army Apache helicopter crew in Iraq . this is ALSO a good thing for OUR democracy . January 31 , 2011 at 3:23 pm | Too much technology is not always a good thing . In this case , it seems to escalate an already almost impossible situation . There is alot of power in social networking and all people should use the powers of this technology for the greater good ... in a perfect world . January 31 , 2011 at 3:27 pm | It 's not as easy for dictators to use brute force and mass killings and get away with it . Now the world will find out . January 31 , 2011 at 3:29 pm | They facilitate communications among disparate groups . Unfortunately , they can be corrupted by people trying to sway popular opinion with mass-messaging , faux-tweets , and the like which might be coming from anywhere - Russia , China , Iran , here . Someday , we 're going to learn the hard way that there are limits to the reliability of social media when they are serupticiously corrupted for ideological gain . January 31 , 2011 at 3:29 pm | The social media has facilitaed uprisngs . Free expression is good but the eisting sources are not without a downside . Anything can be sais and no need of reguard for the truth . It may be becessry to enact penalities for publishing false info on social media . January 31 , 2011 at 3:35 pm | I would limit to affects of social media to just popular uprisings . social media was used in an unprecedented constructive way with President Obama 's 2008 presidential campaign strategy . January 31 , 2011 at 3:41 pm | My father in law was a political prisoner in Egypt and Americans just need to understand the down right hatred the Egyptian people have for their government and just how bad Mubarak IS . They have went through a 30 year `` bailout '' with Mubarak and his henchmen acting as the `` Wallstreet banks . '' As a paratrooper and Desert Storm vet , I applaud the Egyptian army for its professionalism-they do all solidiers proud . To the Egyptian people I say ELFA MABRUKE ! -LRB- `` a thousand congratulations '' -RRB- for standing up for yourselves . January 31 , 2011 at 3:52 pm | I would not limit the affects of social media to just popular uprisings . Social media was used in an unprecedented and constructive way with President Obama 's 2008 presidential campaign strategy . January 31 , 2011 at 3:54 pm | I believe that effective parenting and responsible education in creating mature , self-reliant and problem-solving human beings will augment and transcend the problems of the world . Being responsible , armed with technology and state-of-the-art communication is imperative for civil unrest . , as well as creatively solving the problems of the world . Humans will always create new and innovative ways to communicate , from the early telegraphs to our modern technology . But I 'll bet we 're still argueing about the same stuff the cavemen grunted at each other about : Who get to be in charge and who gets the most stuff . January 31 , 2011 at 4:11 pm | El Baradei and the new Egypt 's own founding fathers and mothers are taking their turn moving humanity forward in our political , social , and spiritual evolution . Human beings are making progress everyday . Yes we all can . January 31 , 2011 at 4:16 pm | Remo , from beautiful downtown Pflugerville Texas With knowledge comes power . Power to determine one 's destiny , power to determine how one 's country should be . Power to understand that things can change . I hope the knowledge they have will help them determine a government that is for the good of all people and not something to `` settle the score with '' . January 31 , 2011 at 4:22 pm | Not sure of a question here but the advent of cyber-tech social media has indeed linked people and the world together resulting in ... ... ... ... . governments can fool some of the people some of the time but they can no longer fool ALL of the people ALL of the time . I do n't mind the tweeting , facebook etc. . but I sure wish that Television would only carry it on the hour , not 24 hours a day . I am so sick of seeing whatever the breaking news is , being on for a week or more . We can not police the world . The sooner we learn that the better . January 31 , 2011 at 4:26 pm | If social networking and wikileaks were the cause of revolts , we may as well replace our spy agencies with nerds and hackers . But that 's not the case . The food costs and housing issues have been a problem for a very long time . I could tell you some very disturbing first-hand stories about lack of affordable food , housing , migration , and oppression in Egypt . Just one : right outside Cairo , a train derailed and came to rest some distance from the tracks . Before the authorities could clean up the wreckage , people moved into the more intact cars to live . The authorities let them be . Frankly , I am surprised that Egyptians had not risen up long ago . IMO , they are just a tad timid and got inspired by what happened in Tunisia . January 31 , 2011 at 4:30 pm | The need for freedom lives in all of us , the rise of social media in the last decade has given voice to that ; the need to dominate and control lives only in people governed by greed . No media can make that look good . All dictators should start looking for new jobs now , do n't wait till it 's too late like Mubarik . January 31 , 2011 at 4:30 pm | technology is only a tool which was used to spread the unrest in the middle east and Africa . the minds of the people in these areas is the fuel of the unrest . the people must make up their mind how the future of their country will go . the world needs to watch or observe with out inserting their mind set on those people . January 31 , 2011 at 4:35 pm | This is great news . Well , the actual news is n't great , but the idea of social media is . Governments and large businesses no longer have total control over the media , and public opinion . This is a great counter-balance to the power struggle in the world . And , of course , the ones who are losing their coveted power are trying to control the information . Oh I 'm sorry , is it inconvenient to you to have some light shed on your nation ? January 31 , 2011 at 4:52 pm | The internet has been an important too for political freedom all over the world . Right now the internet is off in Egypt , cell phones were stopped as well for awhile but are now back on . And Egypt has closed the Al Jazeera office from broadcasting . Oppressive governments better get on board . All their days are numbered . They can either work for their people or their people will depose them . I hardly think Twitter and Facebook are the strengths behind these Middle Eastern protests . They may be contributing factors and the US Media uses them and probably gives them too much credit . Most of the people in Egypt are poor , extremely poor , and do n't have computers , smartphones , and much less have internet . So , you can see Tweets scrowling all day but that does n't mean there 's millions of people paying attention to them . January 31 , 2011 at 5:02 pm | Social media has simply revolutionized most aspect of American life . It has helped spread information , express freedom of speech and religion , boosted the economy and the countless list continues . January 31 , 2011 at 5:08 pm | Dictatorships can only thrive when they can control information . As long as those who are being repressed can find a way to get the information out , they will have a hard time and will likely crumble all the more quickly . Social Media is only one way to spread information . As long as the internet exists , there will be ways to use it . I think we are witnessing the end of the totalitarian state as a form of governance . January 31 , 2011 at 5:10 pm | Social media certainly can play a role to an extent , but countries who have a tight reign on media control , such as Iran and China , certainly have the ability to limit their effects . Just another example that those nations that simply do n't care about individual freedom have the greatest advantage in setting their own agendas . January 31 , 2011 at 5:16 pm | Its the `` end of the world '' as we know it Jack . January 31 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | `` An uneducated public is the dictator 's biggest friend '' ? You do n't say ? I think we 're in real trouble right here in River City then . January 31 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | A better question -- What would have happened if we had had this type of media during Viet Nam ? January 31 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | Well Jack , Dictators do try to keep the public away from information . I think , Egypt , only allows CNN Situation Room to be broadcast in Cairo . January 31 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | simply put technology has brought people alot more closer than before , good and bad . information gets to where it goes much more faster and more reliable . the youth this time have the better idea on how the world should work and the old are just scrambling to get the idea on how to use the internet like we do . this is a revolution . January 31 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Technology has changed the human evolution . Twitter , Youtube , Ireport are all what we call the Mobile Activism . January 31 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | This instant tech is wonderful . It shows the whole world in real time what monster govern these countries . After 30 years of repression Mubarak is doomed My only hope is that democracy will take over . It would seem that democracy would be the logical choice since Facebook and Twitter are the very essense of free speech . There are times when it seems like the quickness is too quick , but knowing the truth can only help . Now Obama has to step up , tell Mubarak to leave and help the Egyptians form a real , democratic government . Send Carter to broker elections . But Hell we have to help . January 31 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | I believe this social websites will eventually be the means of helping people across the globe identify with each other . This uprising in Egypt being discussed through these websites , shows us that we all have similar needs despite culture differences . Freedom and equality are key principles that are valued and spread through social networks like Facebook and YouTube . Thanks to them , I believe it may be possible to gain world peace . January 31 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | OMG -- if we had had all this technology back in the 1960s and 1970s , how different the United States would be today ! Just think how many folks would have shown up for MLK , the March on Washington and our own Days of Rage ... and what would have happened at Kent State ? January 31 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Social media is redefining the dynamics of people revolt . The need for a central figure to drive a revolution is replaced by the collective consciousness of the masses . January 31 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | I believe these social websites will eventually be the means of helping people across the globe identify with each other .

Freedom and equality are key principles that are valued and spread through social networks like Facebook and YouTube . Thanks to them , I believe it may be possible to gain world peace . January 31 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | It means to me , governments of all countries should realize that the young will find a way to communicate and the chips will fall in many directions . We America may also see that the government is not always forthcoming in our own country , when we use words like force our leaders , to recognize it 's responsibility . Why are we giving 1.3 billion dollars a year to a country that is a country we are fighting on human rights . and how many more countries are we paying dollars too , that could pay down are own national debt and help us clean up debt we are in from fighting wars in obscure countries . I think I 'll go twitter and find out how many more countries we have been paying for generations while one in 5 Americans go to bed hunger and with out health care . January 31 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Free communication has got to scare the living -- out of tyrants , autocrats , etc. . When people are able to communicate and say what they truly think without fear , it 's the dawning of freedom . As a person wiser than me once said , freedom truly comes when you are willing to risk your life for liberty , equality , human rights ... January 31 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | I Do n't Think The Social Media Has Affected Anything Going On In Egypt It Just Makes Everyone More Aware Of What 's Going On ! The Only True Way I Really Know What 's Been Going In Egypt Is From CNN And The Internet Plain And Simple ! My Thoughts Are With The Egyptians ! America with all of our problems and imperfections is still what other countries strive to be like . Freedom to select our leaders and chart our own course is the very basis of what it means to be free . January 31 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | ... from Alexandria , Virginia . Could this sort of thing happen in the United States ? I hope not , because the Religious Right might seize power . January 31 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Too bad American news media is n't taking advantage . We have to see what 's going on in Egypt on Al Jazeera 's live stream . Makes you wonder whose controlling the `` news . '' Maybe we would be better served if the media was n't corporate owned . We 'd be better off if a lot of what goes on here in the US was n't corporate owned , actually . January 31 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Jack , remember what I told you during Iranian uprising ? That nothing is going to happen immediately . What happened , the dictorial regime survived in Iran and so will the current regime in Egypt . Social media is definitely playing a role , but you have to understand that Middle Easterners are volatile peple , social media or not . We in America are lucky that Republican Party is not in charge here , otherwise you would have been hearing offensive words : Death to America January 31 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Tucson , AZ -- The new media have affected popular uprisings the way gasoline affects a fire . Consider how long it took for the French Revolution to proceed from food riots , to storming the Bastille , to deposing the King -- weeks ! The Tunisians accomplished much more in a mere four days ! We will see how long before Mubarak resigns and leaves Egypt in the hands of his newly appointed VP and cabinet ... I give it most another seven days , and that is only because the Egyptians , not being Arabs , are a bit less volatile . January 31 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Perhaps the real question is would our governments shut down our use of the social media should any city see a mass revolt that local police forces could not control ? Egypt is going to more than a history lesson as we have no idea of the final outcome . January 31 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | History is being rewritten because of the social networks and we get to watch . As far as the US goes -- we 're in a somewhat compromising situation . This is what happens when you get in bed with a Dictator . January 31 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | As much as I hate to quote Marshall MCluhan , where Social Networking is concerned , `` The Medium is the Message , '' fits the bill . What we need to look at is not ourselves as passive observers but when we are part of the events that unfold for others to witness on Social Medias . Those involved in a thing do not need to necessarily need to be educated so much as they need the affirmation that others , perhaps silently , have felt the same way about experiencing the same things . This may mean that Radio could have been just as effective as Social Networking is the same way we were and are able to listen to Sports Play by play . The Danger in North America especially is that Social Media may actually inhibit free expression and hand over the organization of Social action to the Medium of Organization itself . January 31 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | Social media networks are simply helping the protestors take it to the next level . With this on the peoples side , it is easier for them to revolt . It 's a tool that the younger generation has seemed to find a good use for twitter and facebook . It 's catching people off and it 's great to see people se these networks for a greater cause then boasting about their hangover they received from the night before . January 31 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | I fear that what is happening now in the Middle East\\/Egypt is more like the change in Iran than any other analogy . What do you think ? Whatever Jimmy Carter says , I 'm sure is gospel . January 31 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | As I make dinner for my Iranian-American husband , our daughter and her Armenian heritage boyfriend , I 'm struck by the notion that Facebook , Twitter , and 24\\/7 news coverage is but a giant dose of truth serum that is long overdue in the world . Perhaps this chronic condition of dictators deciding for the great unwashed is at last in the crosshairs of a cure -- thousands of voices reaching millions of eyes and ears . January 31 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | 1-Mubarak out price for the lives lost so far . 2 - President is commander of military even if he has no military experience - max 2 terms ... 3 - parliament depends on the city or governate population -- max 3 terms ... 5-all three must be separated in power and also watch each other efficiency . 6-Freedom of speech , religion and assembly . January 31 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | Social Media is very powerful tool for the freedom . Now we know what we can do with social network . January 31 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | When people do the wrong thing , no matter how severe it is . They would prefer that , not very many people know about it . With the Technology today , The act of wronging people is extremely more difficult and the more severe the act , the more the exposure is given to the act . The important thing for the wrong doer , is how they accept their exposure and correct the Wrong , ie Make it right . January 31 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | The Internet , Facebook and all other social network have proven how effective these tools could be . It took 5 days for Egypt to have a vice - president after a wait of 30 years thanks to FB and TW . Long gone are the days of `` Extra , Extra '' or `` Breaking News '' . Even Cable news ca n't keep up with the pace . At the rate news and events are changing one should not be surprise that by the end of summer their might be only one of two dictatorship left . Let you guess who these might be ! January 31 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | jack i think a lot of countrys should be watching . people should be treated equal you know our country started slavery so you know they do n't think people should be treated equel this country is greety so like i said the governments want to enslave people so people need to wake up . i think there should be no rich people . you ca n't even get into poltics unless you have a lot of money so all you end up with running the country is greety old men give the young people a chance bet we would have a different country . a better country stop using oil and use the sun and wint to run our world . luke January 31 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | It is great that we now have social media to assist us in informing the world on what goes on in different countries . It gives the people of Egypt , for instance , a bigger voice , that way , they know they 'll be heard & people can take action quickly . January 31 , 2011 at 5:32 pm | The impact of social and new media will only continue to give rise to the reality of a new `` global village , '' where humanity 's connections are finally realized , and the voices of the people - through online content - get to write the first draft of history . With Internet penetration up in Africa over 1800 % since 2000 , it will give autocratic and totalitarian regimes serious concerns to keep their growing populations on the other side of the digital divide . January 31 , 2011 at 5:33 pm | The social media has brought everyone to the same place in sec onds ... these dictators can no longer hide . We are watching an oppressed people wake up and gain their freedom ... Mubarek is 82 years old , Why wont he go away ? January 31 , 2011 at 5:33 pm | Jack , This is a game changer for everyone , governments can not control the masses like they use to , and it would appear social networking sites have given the masses away to communicate and the collective effect of `` saftey in numbers '' , gives the masses courage . something without facebook and twitter would be impossible . January 31 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | Could this happen in the United States ? I hope not because the radical christians could seize power . Bob T. in Alexandria , Virgina January 31 , 2011 at 5:35 pm | Jack , what good is the `` social media '' if the dictator shuts down the Internet , like Mubarak did ? And , tweets are bogus because the dictator 's buddies could be tweeting propaganda as a form of missinformation . Without the Internet and the streaming videos coming live from the streets from people 's Internet-connected cellphones , any information from the `` social media '' can not be taken as `` fact '' . January 31 , 2011 at 5:35 pm | Jack , I think the social media is great in this instance . The Arab world has been guilty of forcing it 's populations into the stone age for far to long . I think now they realize that the people have power and that the dictators have a whole new set of problems . I hope this snowball continues rolling down the hill and takes the dictators with it . Peace , integrity , freedom , rights and self esteem to the people ! -LRB- including women ! -RRB- January 31 , 2011 at 5:36 pm | Even in Alpine MT , winter population ONE , there is something glaringly obvious . Our media are fixated on -LRB- 1 -RRB- public statements by our administration , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- immediate implications and results . Diplomacy that counts is done in back rooms . Consequences of diplomacy usually take months to `` mature . '' Current talks between Egyptian VP and opposition will facilitate a change without us engaging in regime change and without Mubarek having to publicly capitulate . January 31 , 2011 at 5:36 pm | Jack , we ca n't have it both ways . We condemn gov ` ts because their leaders `` do n't want the public to know anything , '' yet we also condemn Wikileaks for doing that very thing ... informing the public of what gov ` ts are doing . Ca n't have cake and eat it too ! There are parts of the World that most of us will never see other than on a travel channel which only details the beautiful landscape of the country . Social media gives a greater indepth of the lives of the people that we know nothing about and would be hidden from us if we ever traveled this country . January 31 , 2011 at 5:42 pm | I wish democracy , freedom , and justice for everyone but why is it that everyone point 's fingers at President Obama when another country has problems ? Not just Egypt who I am praying for but any country or nation . Our country has its own problems and we 're still working on that right now while making steady progress . Bush made a mistake by interfering when we invaded Iraq to take over and look at how that ended . A lot of people expect the US to act as the big brother for other countries out there and take over . I understand that what other countries do can sometimes affect us but what they do is really none of our business to a certain extent . This is between the people of Egypt and their government . Obama is the President of the United States , not the World . January 31 , 2011 at 5:44 pm | This could be real '' Power to the People '' , Jack . An underground movement for regular people moving at light speed . Courage can be given to thousands that not dare to dream before ... . January 31 , 2011 at 5:46 pm | Female - from the Equality State Yes , that is a great point . Where are the women in all these spontaneous shots from social media of the new technology ???? Could these modern Arabs still not believe women are equal ? January 31 , 2011 at 5:47 pm | The events in Tunisia and Egypt are flash democracy . Text messaging , the internet , Twitter and Facebook have been used to make flash mobs which are humorous and entertaining , but with no significant impact or meaning . Now , the concept has evolved into flash democracy , the spontaneous development of significant demonstrations and protestations of a country 's populace for political change . Who knows where it will end ? January 31 , 2011 at 5:47 pm | Edmund K. -LRB- Deak -RRB- Brehl , J.D. , Ll . M. I have always genuinely believed that the 1990 fall of communist Russia was brought about more by the communications explosion than by the ` outspending ' of the former USSR in defense matters . Basically , you ca n't hide the truth . This sea change is now occuring in Egypt . I was an Obama supporter , but I am very disenchanted in how the President is handling this situation . We 're betting -LRB- as a nation -RRB- on the wrong horse - there needs to be a regime change in Egypt , and if we do n't take a side in favor of the Egyptian people we risk a rebuke by all of the peoples in the Mid-East who view the United States as only being interested in U.S. economic issues as opposed to properly being interested in worldwide humanistic issues . January 31 , 2011 at 5:48 pm | If the U.S.A. `` really does n't want to get involved in Egyptian politics '' , perhaps we should think twice or three times before supplying a foreign country with tanks and weapons . January 31 , 2011 at 5:51 pm | If the uprising will lead to : 1 -RRB- more democracy -- less dictatorship , 2 -RRB- more equality -- less Arab racism and apartheid -LRB- against non-Arabs or agaisnt non-pure-Arabs -RRB- , 3 -RRB- more honesty -- less `` unifiying the Arab world only by pseudo blaming the west and Zionists for its own fault , '' 4 -RRB- more freedom -- less totalitarianism , 5 -RRB- more tolereance -- less anti-semitism , then , that 's a good thing . However , if radical Islam will abuse this ` breach ' of security to further its ` Islamic domination ' goal , than , that world sees an even more bleak future . Moreso in face of Islamic Republic of Iran 's global aspirations and actions , the Mullahcracy that loves to stir rouble all over the world especially in the M.E. and gained some succcess - recently - in Lebanon despite anti-Hezbollah pro-freedom protests there . January 31 , 2011 at 5:52 pm | You know it would be a good idea if CNN went back to giving us at least an hour of international news as it used to at noon . I believe more Americans are becoming dumbed down and do n't get to witness what goes on outside of our country anymore . Those that live abroad have a better idea of what is going on in the world . A short while back this was not the case - the media should be educating the Americans as to what goes on outside of our circle . I would like to see CNN go back to that and I would also like to see intelligent discussions on cable channels instead of punditry fighting January 31 , 2011 at 5:54 pm | Social Media is just another tool to communicate . It can gather a crowd but the nation wide mass movement only happens when the mass media get involved and amplify its impact . But beware ... witness the mass misinformation by the right , and left , but mostly the right , on the web -- mass hysteria . January 31 , 2011 at 5:54 pm | Why will this raise pump prices . When I was young we had fuel shortages and long lines for gas at stations , but never a price increase . Why increase the price before there is a shortage . days of this the big news story is enough already . social media will be used in this country for the same thing as what is going on in egypt . the people their have had enough of the 2 class living standards . the haves and the have nots is what is really going on ! the 1 % of the top richest people should be watching whats happening in egypt so they know were they are taking this country were greed becomes our new god ! the constitution says it supports the common good of the country Ronald Raegan replsced those words with the common greed of the country which will be the start of of what you see in egypt right here !

KYRA PHILLIPS , CNN ANCHOR : OK . It 's the top of the hour , and it 's Monday , 10:00 a.m. in the east , 14 minutes to sunrise in San Francisco , right now we 're watching the midwest in that dangerous winter storm that could bury old snow records in St. Louis and Chicago . The system could trigger tornadoes in the south and it could batter the east cost by Thursday . Then near Seattle , a vigil for a corrections officer found dead in a prison chapel . It 's believed that an inmate serving life for rape and assault strangled her as she was trying to escape . The victim , Jamie Vindal was the only guard working in the chapel . The superintendent said she did n't even carry a weapon , the inmate is now in an isolated unit and has asked for a lawyer . And the government 's new dietary guidelines out today , if you love sugar , salt and big sticks of margarine , you 're out of luck , the fed say cut that out . Eat more seafood , fruits and veggies . It 's now 5:00 p.m. in Egypt and a curfew is in place and Hosni Mubarak remains in power . This morning he swore in a new cabinet in his latest concession to anti-government protesters . Meanwhile , the man who has become the face of that movement says Mubarak 's fall seems inevitable . MOHAMED ELBARADEI , NOBEL PEACE LAUREATE -LRB- via phone -RRB- : I will continue to participate in whatever it takes to make sure that the Mubarak regime should leave . I think that 's a - that is a consensus here in Egypt , in every part of society that this is a regime that is dictatorial , that has failed to deliver on economic , social or political fronts , and that we need a new beginning in Egypt that is free and that is democratic , and we need to go through a transitional period . PHILLIPS : But on the seventh day of protests , some stark realities hitting home . Food shortages becoming commonplace . People waiting in lines for hours to buy bread . Store shelves becoming empty . Lawlessness reaching a new level as well . Prisons empty with murderers , rapists , terrorists running free . And a show of brazen defiance , citizens then looted those prisons themselves . Now all eyes remain on the country 's military on what role it 's going to play in the uprising . Fighters igniting fear and rumors yesterday when they buzz crowds of protesters and some people felt panicked because they thought they were about to be bombed . Now out of the chaos , Mohammed Elbaradei is emerging as a leading figure of the opposition . The name might sound familiar . He used to head up the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency . And yesterday , he joined the crowds in Cairo 's -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- Square . A move that energized many of those protesters . Our Fred Pleitgen was right there earlier this morning . And he told us what he saw at street level . FREDERICK PLEITGEN , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Police forces absolutely vanished off the street here . There is some talk that it might return today . We 're not exactly sure that 's going to be the case but simply that 's something that is really being discussed and is the talk of the town . That could actually spur new unrest , because it was the heavy-handedness of the police that caused the riot here last Friday . But right now , there 's no police present . I was going around Cairo yesterday , in the suburbs , and we went past seven or eight police stations , which all of them had been abandoned , looted and burned down . There is an air of lawlessness where a lot of people are defending their own homes with everything they can find from samurai swords to clubs to rifle . So right now there is n't much in the way of any law enforcement authority . And the ones that are sort of trying to keep order is the military . PHILLIPS : Well , the U.S. is evacuating Americans who want to escape that turmoil in Egypt . And U.S. citizens are gathering now in Cairo 's main airport . The first charter flight has already taken off . The evacuees will be responsible for the costs of their flights , and according to the State Department , there are about 52,000 Americans registered with the embassy in Cairo . So far , 2,400 Americans have already been asked to evacuate . Now , for those who want to stay , the State Department is urging them to limit their movements , and keep a close eye on this escalating crisis . Now Lara Getz is one of 35 students who got caught up in the Egypt unrest . She and her Tulane classmates have been waiting for the call that says they can go home . Laura joins me on the phone from Alexandria , Egypt . So Lara , describe what you 've seen and what it 's been like for you ? LARA GETZ , STRANDED STUDENT : Well , first of all , I should probably clarify that I 'm just one student from Tulane . We 're a group of about 20 different students from different programs here , but it 's been a really , you know , extraordinary and pretty life-changing experience . You know , right know , we 're waiting to get out , but you know , starting on Friday we were able to see the Egyptian people finally stand up to a government that 's been extremely oppressive for about 30 years now and you know , take to the streets in a unified effort , despite the president 's efforts in limiting that . I mean , he cut off the internet . He cut off all mobile services , so there 's no communication among people and yet everyone 's still banded together . It has , you know , been a mixture of experiences . It has been frightening at times , since it 's been getting violent between people looting and you know , some of the criminals getting out . So , you know people running around . People have weapons now , but what has been really extraordinary as well has been to see how the Egyptian people have really united over all of this , and that , you know , in the neighborhoods we have been seeing people - we know people who are pretty much setting up watches and guards , and having people from all different walks of life , professors , street shop owners , young people , to like an 80-year-old man coming down and guarding their buildings and their friends and families and neighborhoods . So , you know , on the one hand you see , yes , it 's become violent and it 's unfortunately come to this state , and the president has refused to step down . On the other hand , you 've also seen a people really unite and show that they can really work together . PHILLIPS : Lara , you 've been mixing with college students since you 've been there , with other college students and you know , the average age is 20-something , 30-something , the younger generation that 's out there in protest . What have fellow college students there been telling you , as you talk about , even before this , as you talk about the politics and the life ? I mean , for the most part , have they all appeared to be anti- Mubarak ? Or have you found that there are students in support of his government ? GETZ : Obviously - this program has had a unique opportunity to really get to know the Egyptian youth themselves . All of us have a lot of Egyptian friends . And so obviously , you know , we 've seen a wide range of people , but really the majority of them know that it 's type for Mubarak to step down . He 's been extremely oppressive . They all want something better . They all want a better life for their family , for their friends , for their country . And so , you know , it has been incredible . Things that quite honestly , as a lot of people led up to the 25th and to Friday , you know - I 'm not sure how many people are expecting this to actually happen among the Egyptians and American students that I know . PHILLIPS : Real quickly , do you know how you 're going to get out of there , Lara ? Do you have any idea ? GETZ : We do . Right now , we have a couple different plans and we 're just waiting to see which one is the best option . One of the problems has been that most of the evacuation efforts , actually almost all evacuation efforts have been focused on Cairo , and we 're in Alexandria . So we 've been pretty much working with different people in the U.S. and in Egypt to help get evacuation efforts from Alexandria , which is now beginning to work . PHILLIPS : Well , you keep us posted , Lara . We want to stay in touch with you . Thank you so much for calling in . Let 's take a quick check of the big board right now . It looks like the Dow Industrials up 10 points . Overseas markets are shaky , of course , because of the turmoil in the Middle East . We 'll keep watching the numbers for you and what it means for you . Now the instability is not just hanging over Wall Street , it 's also rippling to your corner gas station . Some analysts say that if Egypt remains in turmoil we could see oil prices more than double . Stephanie Elam , that is not going to make commuters happy . STEPHANIE ELAM , CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT : No , it 's not exactly the Valentine 's day present anyone is hoping for around here , Kyra . This is what everyone is keeping their eyes on , is exactly how far this unrest is going to go . Could it potentially affect the Suez Canal because it affect the Su-Med pipeline ? This is really important . Because they actually are in Egypt 's control . However , a lot of the world 's oil makes their way through this . So here you have on this one graphic here that the red line , which would be the Suez Canal and then yellow line , which is the Sumed pipeline . We should not that that pipeline has 1.8 million barrels a day that flowed through it . In 2009 , at 1.8 million flowed through the Suez Canal . So those two arteries are key to getting oil out . Because if those two did n't exist , Kyra , then they would have to ship it all the way around Africa , and that 's an extra 6,000 miles . So no one wants to do that , because obviously it 's more expensive , and on top of it . It would really cut into supply here if we had to do that . So that would just take a lot longer to do and would affect how this oil gets to everybody else . Because as we know , a lot of the Middle East producers supply to a lot of the world . Now , at this point I do need to say that there could be delays at the Suez Canal . There maybe some delays now but it 's not because of issues as far as the canal is concerned . What we are hearing is that the issues are communications because we know a lot of the communications abilities were shut down because of the unrest . So shippers are having a hard time . The cal itself , the pipeline itself , are very much in control . So right now , we 're seeing that displayed even in oil prices , which did top 90 bucks in overnight trading but have come back a little bit . So it does n't look like anything crazy right now , but again that could change on a dime when you see what exactly has gone on with oil just this month , Kyra . PHILLIPS : All right , we 're going to keep tracking it . That major blizzard that we 've been talking about with possible record-setting cold and snow , is moving into the midwest . Rob Marciano is watching it second by second for us . ROB MARCIANO , AMS METEOROLOGIST : Yes , it 's really starting to come together . We have a number of ingredients and it 's going to be multi-day event , Kyra and it 's going to be a multistate event and it 's going to be multi-headaches . I can tell you that . We 've got snow , cold air , so frigid cold temperatures , blizzard conditions expected in Chicago , a ribbon of ice from New York City all the way back through northern Texas . And then down to the south , thankfully no snow or ice in the deep south , but enough heat and energy that we built up over the weekend to probably spawn some severe thunderstorms tomorrow and again on Wednesday . So big storm and big headaches . We got winter storm watches that have been posted from New England all the way down to New Mexico . So over 2,000 miles of linear real estate there , and tens of millions of people affected by this thing . And we could see anywhere from places like Chicago , you could see 12 to 18 inches of snow . If that happens , and I 'm pretty confident we 're going to have at least a foot . If they get 18 inches or 20 inches that would be the biggest snowstorm that they have seen in over 10 years . So a big deal , no doubt about it . We got a bit of rain across parts of the southeast . This is causing some travel delays across Atlanta , just kind of a precursor of the main storm . Minneapolis also seeing some snow right now . That 's driving down into Chicago , but this is the main event here , or the main piece of energy that 's really going to be driving down into Texas . And as that happens , everything is going to begin to take shape with this system . And we 're going to start to see it wind up fairly rapidly . I mentioned Atlanta got some delays , Houston , some delays as well , and Minneapolis because of the snow that 's limiting visibility right now , a couple of inches on the ground from this particular storm . Let 's go through where this storm is going to be and what time . We start it today , and we go through the next 24 hours . Oklahoma through parts of eastern Kansas is going to get hammered with snow and wind tomorrow . Blizzard conditions expected in Chicago , again a foot and a half potentially and the wintry mix nosing into the northeast , several inches of snow and ice expected there through Thursday . Going to be quite a week . Hold on to your hats . PHILLIPS : All right . You 've heard of krab , with a `` k , '' right ? Is it really crab ? It never had claws or legs . We want to know , what other foods are out there that sounds genuine ? You might even fool your taste buds , if you really think about it . PHILLIPS : Well , the stars came out for the Screen Actors Guild last night . And the `` King 's Speech , '' `` The Fighter '' and `` Boardwalk Empire '' are some of the big winners . `` Showbiz Tonight '' host A.J. Hammer is watching all these for us . It 's good to see you back . I missed you last week . Did you see `` The King 's Speech '' ? A.J. HAMMER , HOST `` SHOWBIZ TONIGHT '' : You know what , I still have n't seen it ? I ca n't believe I 'm saying that . I have a whole pile of movies to get to before the Oscars . PHILLIPS : A.J. , you 've got to see this movie . HAMMER : I 'm on it . Well , last night , Kyra , I 'm here to tell you `` The King 's Speech '' absolutely ruled and it was Betty White who reigned last night at the Screen Actor 's guild in Los Angeles . Now `` The King 's Speech '' won two awards , including the big one , outstanding performance by a cast in a motion picture . Colin Firth got outstanding male actor for playing King George VI in a movie , `` Black Swan 's '' Natalie Portman and `` The Fighter '' co-stars Christian Bale and Melissa Leo were also honored with 12 pound , 16 - inch high trophies called `` The Actor . '' Over the TV side , `` Boardwalk Empire '' and `` Modern Family '' won the awards for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama and comedy , respectively . HAMMER : Well , 89-year-old Betty White beat out `` Glee 's '' Jane Lynch and `` 30 Rock 's '' Tina Fey for favorite TV funny woman in a comedy series for her role in `` Hot in Cleveland . '' Do you see the look in her face ? She looked absolutely shocked , and no surprise , Betty brought down the house . BETTY WHITE , ACTRESS : But to have this happen on top of -- oww ! -- on top of everything else , I can not say thank you enough . HAMMER : Now , this was White 's first S.A.G. award , Kyra . She called the win the biggest surprise of her career when you think about how many decades , multiple decades , Betty White has had a career , that 's a pretty big statement . PHILLIPS : She 's a piece of work . Can you believe she 's 89 years old ? PHILLIPS : Yes and she 's still got it . So clearly it was a night of big stars , and big winners , but one huge TV star was noticeably absent . HAMMER : Yes , the guy with the biggest show on TV as far as sitcoms are concerned . We 're talking about Charlie Sheen , of course . And that 's because he checked himself into rehab once again on Friday . That 's basically shut down production of his hit sitcom `` Two and a Half Men , '' for the second time in a year . His publicist telling `` Showbiz Tonight '' Charlie voluntarily entered an undisclosed rehabilitation center , and CBS and Warner Brothers Television tell us , `` We are profoundly concerned for his health and well being and support his decision . '' Now the announcement that he 's seeking treatment came a day after Charlie was hospitalized with what his publicist had called severe abdominal pains late last week . An ambulance was called to Sheen 's Beverly Hills home , that was early Thursday , amid all these reports of wild party with porn stars , Charlie will reportedly be in rehab for at least , the next three months . And that leaves the production status of `` Two and a Half Men '' in limbo for the time being . But while Charlie is headed into rehab , some pretty good news about celebrities who have finished up their time in treatment . Disney star Demi Lovato left the treatment center that she voluntarily entered three months ago . She has returned to her home in Los Angeles , according to a source close to her family . Lovato dropped out of a world tour with the Jonas Brothers and sought help for emotional and physical issues back in early November . That was after some kind of an altercation with a dancer on her concert tour . Little information has been made public about Demi 's issues , but a statement by her publicist in November described them as emotional and physical issues that she 's dealt with for some time . And the publicist had cautioned at that time against describing the treatment as rehab . So good to see her out , hopefully on the right path , Kyra . PHILLIPS : All right . And if you want information on everything breaking in the entertainment world , A.J. has always got it for you . Every night , `` Showbiz Tonight '' 5:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. on HLN . Well , beefy , cheesy , chocolatey , how do you know if you 're eating the real thing ? The beef with Taco Bell 's beef had us talking this morning . And of course we 're keeping an eye on Egypt . The situation there so volatile right now . CNN correspondents are all over the region witnessing the action right there on the ground and from the air . IVAN WATSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- on camera -RRB- : This is an unmistakable show of military force . Fighter jets flying low over Cairo 's Tahrir -LRB- ph -RRB- Square , Liberation Square . This has been as symbol of defiance . PHILLIPS : Well , it 's one big step . A couple of long-distance runners will never forget taking . Their story tops our look cross country . Molly Johnston and David Upton not only ran the 26 miles of Houston 's Chevron marathon yesterday , but they took a matrimonial side trip . They actually tied the knot during the race . As they crossed the finish line , another journey was just starting . DAVID UPTON : -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- the only way I was going to marry here -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . MOLLY UPTON , MARATHON NEWLYWEDS : It 's been five years . PHILLIPS : We got another love story with good fortune . This one for a homeless couple from Green Bay , Wisconsin . -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- and her boyfriend won an all-expense paid trip to this Sunday 's showdown in Dallas , compliments of the city 's visitors and convention bureau which held a secret phrase contest that Ouida read about on-line . OUIDA WRIGHT , WON TRIP TO SUPER BOWL : And I said , have you to Dallas lately ? And he said , oh yes , I have . And I said `` Are you the contest guy ? '' Yes , I am . '' Can you imagine a homeless person who ca n't afford a movie gets to go to the Super Bowl ? PHILLIPS : Well , a lot of people are asking why do n't they just sell that trip , bank the proceeds and look to their future , but it 's Green Bay , Wisconsin , and they 're Packer fans . That 's all I have to say . Motorists in downtown Indianapolis need to be careful around the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue in New Jersey street after five manhole covers literally flipped their lids . Firefighters investigating a report , a smell of natural gas from those manhole started popping . One fire truck and nearby building were damage . Local gas company says , `` no. -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- manholes do n't appear to be natural gas related . We want to talk more about that beef with Taco Bell . The company has got its call of - well in a big chalupah . Sorry , I missed that one . The plaintiffs claim that the company 's beef is really less than 35 percent real - the other 65 percent , well , a mix of water , chili pepper and other stuff , including my personal favorite , yeast extract . A top company executive says bring it on , the beef claim is bogus and that the food starts with 100 percent USDA inspected beef and that the finished product is about 88 percent beef . Now the rest is the stuff that gives the food a flavor . He 's also promising a counter - suit . Let 's bring in Kat Kinsman . She 's the managing editor of CNN 's `` Eatocracy , '' food blog . Now Cat did I get that right . It is the chalupahs . Is that one of the - I have n't been to Taco Bell in a long time . Did I say that right ? Oh , you 're missing out if you have n't been to Taco Bell for a while . I think they 're mostly focusing on the taco meat -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . PHILLIPS : I almost said Chihuahua . That would not have been good . I would have gotten in big trouble . KAN KINSMAN , EATOCRACY.COM : Not so much . PHILLIPS : All right . So regardless of who wins this beef battle there 's a teachable fast-food moment here , right ? KINSMAN : There certainly is , and really it comes down to three words - read the label . All the information is out there , easy for you to find , it 's on the web site , two clicks away . You 're nuts if you 're looking to Taco Bell to regulate your health at this point . Just empower yourself , like in what you 're eating . PHILLIPS : Let 's talk about the beef and the chicken , and how do we know - you say read the label , but come on , a lot of us really do n't do that . What 's the reality check , if a taco is 89 cents we should know it 's not , you know , a certain kind of beef , if the chicken is at a certain price . Because I mean , you know , we do want the real thing , but there 's a lot of marketing ploys out there . KINSMAN : There 's a huge difference between cheap food and inexpensive food . And it just takes educating yourself a little bit to know the difference . In fact today the USDA was releasing new guidelines on what Americans should be eating . And that just really comes down to personal responsibility . Again , you look for words that you understand . How much salt is in there , how much actual beef is in there , just - if you do n't understand what a word is , take some time out and look it up . It 's the most important thing you 're going to do for your health , so why not take that little bit of time to do it . Words like cheesy and even blueberry are not necessarily regulated by the FDA , so you know , marketers will go with terms like chocolatey , beefy . I always do n't trust that `` y '' at the end of something because it means it 's like something but is n't something . So again , just go to the label and look for those words . LEMON : Got it . Lemon flavored , chocolate flavored , made with real - that 's interesting . When they say made with real , dot dot dot ? KINSMAN : Oh , it 's crazy . You see a lot of things , made with real juice . That can mean that whatever juice it is that you 're drinking only has been 10 percent actual fruit juice in it . You know , I do n't know about you , but if I 'm drinking juice , I want to be drinking juice , not just added sugar and water . And again , those new guidelines that are coming out today are telling you that you really should be cutting down on all of that added sugar , on added salt , and it 's really just up to people to take care of their own well-being . It 's not that hard , and it 's all right out there . PHILLIPS : Good advice . Kat Kinsman , a managing editor of CNN 's Eatocracy . If you have n't seen it in our web site . CNN `` Eatocracy , '' go right to it with all kinds of good advise . PHILLIPS : Well the situation in Egypt so volatile right now that things can change in an instant . We 've seen it protesters are defying the curfew , thugs are roaming the streets with machetes and home-made weapons and with little to no police force , well , people there are forced to protect their homes and belongings however they can . Firsthand account , live from Cairo is next . PHILLIPS : Well , stock market opening ball just about an hour ago . Let 's check the numbers . Dow Industrials up 24 points . The uprising in Egypt may be causing ulcers on Wall Street . Stocks opened higher just about an hour ago , but investors remain cautious about Egypt . Let 's go live now to Stephanie Elam in New York . So , Steph , Egypt not a big oil producer , but there are definitely concerns over the disruptions to tanker shipments going through the Suez Canal . . We talked a lot about this with Zain Verjee out of London . It 's definitely something we 're watching . STEPHANIE ELAM , CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT : Yes , it 's something everyone will be watching , especially on Wall Street because it could impact us . Right now , it does look like things are controlled . When you take a look at the Suez Canal , though , it is so , so important . Simply because if it were n't for the Suez Canal and the Sumed Pipeline , which is just to its west , then you would have to ship it all the way around Africa , which would be an extra 6,000 miles you 'd have to add to the shipment . So , the fact that these two arteries are in Egypt has made people watch . But overall , things have looked like they 've been controlled . Egypt is saying that everything is controlled at the Suez Canal , that there are no issues . Shippers may see some delays , but that 's because of communication issues . Those are those two arteries , the yellow one and the red . The Suez Canal is the red one . They 're very , very key . As you can see there , 1.1 million barrels coming through the Sumed Pipeline , 1.8 barrels going through the Suez Canal . So , very important . But right now , based on what we 've been seen , oil has gone up over 90 dollars a barrel overnight , but pretty much holding steady there . That 's that trip around Africa that would add that extra 6,000 miles , which no one wants . That would really mess with supply and demand . So , all in all , we are keeping an eye on it . It could change , but right now , it does seem like things are controlled as far as this is concerned in Egypt . If that were to change , then that would be something that could affect the markets again here like we saw happen on Friday , Kyra . PHILLIPS : All right . And let 's switch to another subject , Democrats announcing an aviation bill this afternoon . They say this would mean more jobs . What 's your take on that ? They 're selling this as completely about the jobs . The Democrats in the Senate say they 'll take to the floor today . It 's really about $ 8 billion that they 're saying would actually help out with the airports , get this money to the FAA so that they can improve the infrastructure of airports , and golly , do n't we know some airports that could use some of that fundage . But they 're pointing to an American Association of Airport Executives estimate , which says that these construction funds would play the part in 280,000 jobs . Now , they 're saying it would n't create the jobs necessarily . Some of these jobs could already exist , but they 're saying it would help keep some of these jobs around . A lot of construction jobs here as well . They 're saying the airline industry accounts for about 11 million U.S. jobs , they would like to see more of that happening . Now , if this bill sounds familiar , it was taken to the Senate floor last spring , and it did pass 93-0 was the vote there , but then later stalled because of some side issues involved . The Senate Democrats are now saying this could get through more easily this go - around , but they 're really pushing it in this $ 8 million really as they 're fixing up the infrastructure they will actually be able to create jobs and keep some jobs basically . They 're very careful how they want to word that , but hoping this will help out some of the cities across the nation . It 's about 10:30 now in the East , 7:30 out West . History-making winter storm about to hammer the Midwest . It could impact 100 million people before it 's all over . Chicago , St. Louis could see new snow records . And that storm could spin off tornadoes in the South . The East Coast could see it by Thursday . And ready to roll . A little more than nine hours from now , workers at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida will begin moving the space shuttle Discovery to the launching pad . The February 24 liftoff will be Discovery 's last . Discovery crew will deliver a module and spare parts to the International Space Station . Well , you have seen the images . The protesters , their faces , but who are they ? Well , they are young , the median age in Egypt is 24 . And many are highly educated with advanced degrees . Despite that , they are unemployed or underemployed . According to the U.N. , Egypt 's per capita income is $ 1,800 a year . The official unemployment rate last year was 9.7 percent , but experts say the real jobless rate is significantly higher . All of those factors created a volatile situation , one that my next guest is watching very closer . Dina Amer lives in Cairo . She grew up there , and it 's her generation that has flooded the streets of Cairo . She 's a freelance journalist working with CNN this week . And Dina , just to tell our viewers , you actually interned for us a number of months ago . You did an incredible job , you graduated college , one of the smartest we have ever seen . And you were back home , visiting your parents in Cairo where you grew up . You were in London working , and it 's amazing how this all happened in just a couple days . But for you as an up-and - coming journalist , this is giving you real-life experience . When has it been like for you and your family ? DINA AMER , FREELANCE JOURNALIST -LRB- via telephone -RRB- : Hello , Kyra . Thank you very much , first , for saying all those lovely things about me . It was a pleasure to work with you . But I mean , this has been surreal . I mean , I would n't think in my wildest dreams I would be present here in Cairo while all this was happening . And I would be able , as a journalist , to take upon myself to experience this not only professionally , but personally , because my family is here , and I am also very emotionally affected . There are many events unfolding around me , and it 's all very surreal in that aspect . I think that the most important -- PHILLPS : What 's -- what 's it like at home , Dina ? I think you mentioned that your brother has been outside sort of guarding the homestead , kind of being your security guard . Describe to me how your family and you have responded to this , because it 's something that you guys have lived there for years that you 've never experienced . As you can tell , basic government functions have completely , like , failed , so citizens have taken it upon themselves . So , my brother and every man in the neighborhood has been up every night without a wink of sleep standing in the streets , with either kitchen knives or , like , wooden sticks , baseball bats , creating their own militias to try to secure the neighborhoods and to take care of their loved ones up above . It 's just - it 's very surreal because this is a very safe place normally . We never have to worry about , you know , taking care of our own property or looters , any of this . But because the reports of looting and vandalism and breaking into homes , every citizen has been on edge , and they have really been out in the streets every night , all the men grouped together and unified to secure the neighborhood . PHILLIPS : What about food ? We 've been reporting about a shortage of food , and you ca n't get out to get any food . Have you experienced that ? AMER : Yes , I have . My mother actually called me today very frantically . She went to the supermarket there were a lot of shortages of food . People were there and they were really stocking up on all types of food products and supplies for the home . Because people are very much on edge . We do n't know what 's going to happens next . And if it continues and prolonged , then what will happen if there is a serious shortage of food ? PHILLIPS : Now , Dina , this is your age group , it 's the younger generation that are out there on the streets protesting . Are you surprised by this ? Did you sort of see this coming ? Do you have classmates that are out there , people that you have grown up with out on the streets ? AMER : I mean , this is very surprising . I 'm American-Egyptian , I used to come back every summer , every winter break . And I never in my -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- would have imagined this type of uprising to the Mubarak regime . But it 's happening , and people are in the streets , very impassioned and relentlessly coming back every day . The youth -- most of the youth are there because also , as you mentioned , there 's high unemployment . So , this is kind of a sense of purpose every day to go out there and continue until they see their demands come to fruition . PHILLIPS : Dina Amer there , working for us in the Cairo bureau . Sure appreciate you calling in . It 's great to have your experience and your background as an Egyptian there working for us . Dina , thank you . PHILLIPS : Well , eat less salt ? That 's just one recommendation in the government 's new dietary guidelines . We 're going to tell you what else is on the list for better health . PHILLIPS : The very latest on the situation in E -- Egypt , rather , in just a moment . But first , we want to catch you up on a few international stories worth your attention today in the `` Morning Passport . '' U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton back from a quick visit this weekend to Haiti . This is in advance of the nation 's presidential runoff . That 's coming up in March . Now , Secretary Clinton says she 's still got concern about the Haiti 's election protocols , but is n't considering to withhold crucial U.S. aid to Haiti . And to Cambodia , where published reports have surviving members . The Khmer Rouge asking for their release from jail in advance of their war crimes trial set for next year . Now , the brutal regime is blamed for killing thousands of people , if not millions during the bloody rule in the late 1970s . Their leader was found guilty back in July of last year . And Japan 's Mount Shimo . Cool to look at , but bad to live close by . The long-quiet volcano roared to life for the first time in 50 years , belching hot , molten ash to the townspeople below . Folks closest to the eruption have been safely evacuated . And just moments ago , the government released a new list of dietary guidelines , urging Americans to eat healthy foods . Among the recommendations , cut down on salt . High-risk groups , no more than half a teaspoon a day . Everybody else , one teaspoon . Put more vegetables and fruits in your diet . Replace those refined grains with whole grains . And limit cholesterol intake to 300 milligrams per day . The goal behind the new guidelines , promoting health , reducing the risk of chronic diseases , and fighting weight problems . President Obama 's push to create jobs is running smack into a hard truth . Most of the new jobs just are n't paying enough . NIC ROBERTSON , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : The gunfire we can hear rocketing through the air , demonstrators say that 's the army firing to warn them to stay away . It 's long - there 's gunshots - it 's long after curfew right now . And if the government was controlling the situation -- tracer fire flying into the air -- these people would n't be out on the streets if the government was in control . PHILLIPS : Last night -- earlier -- I spoke with Nic , and he says that today , the Egyptian army is using even more muscle . They 're firing warning shots at protesters . PHILLIPS : An overwhelming majority of Republicans want the Tea Party to have some role in their party . Senior political editor Mark Preston following that story for us from the CNNpolitics desk . MARK PRESTON , CNN SENIOR POLITICAL EDITOR : Hey , good morning , Kyra . Great news for Tea Party activists . A new Gallup poll just released a few hours ago shows that 90 percent of Republicans say that it 's important that the Tea Party 's ideas are given significant weight within the party as it 's going forward . Now , we really should n't be too surprised by this because the fact of the matter is , the Tea Party 's main platforms are really based on fiscal discipline and really cost cutting here in Washington , D.C. And given these tough , fiscal times , a lot of folks would like to see that happen . You know , yesterday , the new White House chief of staff , Bill Daly was out on the talk show circuit . In fact , he was on CBS ' `` Face The Nation . '' He was asked about health care and moving forward the whole issue . Well , you know President Obama just last week in the State of the Union address said he would be open to working with Republicans to make some changes to that , although President Obama really defended the health care legislation that he really pushed through Congress last year . Well , the White House chief of staff reiterated that yesterday . He said the president has said that he 's been open to changes , but he did go on to say that the president is not in favor of refighting this fight . Well , we know House representatives - the House Republicans pushed through the repeal of health care recently , so I suspect this will be an issue that Democrats and Republicans will continue to fight about . PHILLIPS : President Obama does n't just have to deal with the job loss , but also the kind of jobs being created . Tell us about that . PRESTON : Yes , this is really a fascinating story that 's up on CNNmoney.com , written by Chris Isadora . The fact of the matter is , there 's been a lot of talk about how many jobs have been lost . The Obama administration Democrats are talking about jobs they have created since the recession . The fact of the matter is , what kinds of jobs have they created ? Not great news , according to a new study from the National Employment Project . In fact , 76 percent of jobs created in the first seven months of 2010 were in low - to mid-wage industries . That 's basically people who earn between $ 8.92 to $ 15 an hour . What 's probably more disturbing , and more disturbing politically as well for President Obama as he heads into 2012 , high-wage sectors , which are jobs made up between people who make between $ 17.43 and $ 31 an hour , accounted for nearly half of all the jobs lost in this whole recession . But only five percent of the new jobs that have been created are in that high-sector category . So , yes , it 's a tough employment situation for the country , but it 's also a very difficult political position for President Obama to be in right now . We 're going to have your next political update in just about an hour . And you can always go to our Web site , CNNpolitics.com , 24\\/7 . From easy lay-up to serious beatdown , high school basketball game takes a turn for the worse when parents get into the action . Where is the love ? PHILLIPS : All right . What did you miss over the weekend ? Well , this is some video that caught our attention from the past two days . A little basket-brawl highlights for you out of North Carolina . Not among the players , though ! This is the parents , folks . Can you believe this ? The fight started actually between the father and the school resource officer . Then the man 's wife and daughter did n't want to get left out . So , hey , they both jumped into the fray . Police say more arrests could come . PHILLIPS : All right . We 're keeping a close eye on Egypt . And the fear and anger that 's rippling across the region right now . Over the last two weeks , five Arab states have been rocked by protests . And CNN 's Suzanne Malveaux takes a closer look how a regionwide movement began with a single street vendor . -LRB- AUDIENCE CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE -RRB- SUZANNE MALVEAUX , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Starting with Tunisia , where an unemployed graduate student sets himself on fire after a city inspector confiscates his unlicensed fruit cart and then allegedly slaps him . His death sparks unprecedented fury and protests against the government , forcing Tunisia 's longtime president to flee . -LRB- AUDIENCE CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE -RRB- MALVEAUX : In Algeria , riots break out over rising food prices and a housing crisis . -LRB- AUDIENCE CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE -RRB- MALVEAUX : In Yemen , students take to the streets . Emboldened by its neighbors in the region - -LRB- AUDIENCE CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE -RRB- MALVEAUX : -- on Tuesday , Egypt erupts . Angered by the alleged corruption , police brutality , and lack of reforms in their own country , thousands pour into the streets , demanding Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak , who 's held power for nearly three decades , resign . Protesters are met with tear gas and violence . The next day , the violence escalates as Egyptian security forces turn water cannons and tear gas on the growing angry crowds . The Egyptian military urges calm . Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter report that they are being blocked by the government the Thursday a leading Egyptian opposition figure , Mohammed ElBaradei , returns home from Europe vowing to back the protesters . The Egyptian government then arrests a prominent leader of country 's largest opposition group , the Muslim brotherhood . The Obama administration is alarmed by the growing intensity of the crisis , but reacts with caution . BARACK OBAMA , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : So , the government has to be careful about not resorting to violence , and the people on the streets have to be careful not to resort to violence . And I think that it 's very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances . MALVEAUX : As unrest spreads beyond Cairo in the days to come , protesters take to the streets in Qatar and Jordan to show demonstrators their support . Mubarak goes on national television to tell Egyptians he government will resign , but he will stay in power . His offer does not quell the angry and growing crowds . A thousand inmates break out of a prison outside Cairo . Looters ransack prison buildings and businesses , and vandals tear off the heads of mummies at the Egyptian Museum . Journalists report a dangerous power vacuum . BEN WEDEMAN , CNN SR. . INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : The army is sort of controlling the street . Politically , there is a complete vacuum . MALVEAUX : Heading into this week , thousands of Egyptians continue to defy Mubarak 's curfew by packing Cairo streets . At the same time , American tourists are getting a lifeline out of the country . The State Department now reports more than 200 are being flown out of the Egypt . KYRA PHILLIPS , CNN ANCHOR : Well , our Suzanne Malveaux is of course reporting on Cairo because she lived there and has first-time insights . But also , we welcome you . You have moved to Atlanta . PHILLIPS : This is your new gig . MALVEAUX : I 'm feeling a lot of love here , too , actually . It 's been fantastic . PHILLIPS : Well , being a twin , I 'm expecting you to baby-sit my twins and to mentor my twins . -LRB- LAUGHTER -RRB- MALVEAUX : I will . I 'll have that second job . You have a full - time job there , Kyra . You have to carry both . I hope you 're ready . PHILLIPS : So what do you think , leaving the White House and coming to Atlanta ? MALVEAUX : You know , the news is everywhere . I 'm excited to be here , as well as in Washington . And obviously , yes , I lived in Cairo . A lot of friends there very concerned about what 's happening there . And it 's a very big story . So we 're going to get started with that .

About 3,000 people gathered in the Jordanian capital for the event , according to national police spokesman Lt. Col. Mohammad Al Khateeb . Half of those demonstrated , while the remainder walked alongside or watched from the sidelines . Al Khateeb said there were protests in six other cities on Friday , with crowd estimates totaling about 2,200 . The demonstrations in Amman were the third in as many Fridays , with protesters gathering in front of the Al Husseini Mosque to decry government policies they blame for rising prices , low wages and unemployment .

There were also calls for Prime Minister Samir Rifai , who took office in December 2009 , to step down , and for the dissolution of parliament . The Islamic Action Front , the political arm of the Jordan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood , is also asking for an `` elected government . '' Currently , the prime minister and cabinet are appointed by King Abdullah II . In recent weeks , the government has announced several measures intended to ease citizens ' economic hardships . These included reducing taxes on fuel derivatives and effectively subsidizing basic commodities . The government last week also announced a pay raise -- 20 Jordanian dinars per month -- for civil servants , military personnel and retirees . Still , protesters contended Friday that the measures do n't go far enough . Besides their demands of Jordan 's government , those in Amman also showed solidarity with others in the Arab world who have recently taken to the streets to demand certain freedoms and urge the ouster of their governments .

My concern now , is the safety of my fiancee & his family , living in Alexandria , Egypt & also 4 all our US reporters & tourists still remaining in Egypt at this time . My prayers r with u all . My God see justice 4 Egypt & may he keep everyone safe from harm in today 's protest without causing a war in Egypt . The internet & cellulars are down at this time , but I was able 2 get thru by calling my love 's home phone line . I 'm so glad their ok . Thank u , Anderson 4 bringing us the news live , may God be with u thru this difficult time in Egypt . February 1 , 2011 at 3:22 am | Keep safe Anderson and staff . I am amazed at the Egyptian people who are protesting in the face of the a giant government . They are a brave courageous people who have made it clear what they do n't want : Mubarak ! There are no voices rising up for what they do want . What is an acceptable temporary replacement so as to avoid anarchy after Mubarak is ousted ? I fear they could be over run by something\\/someone they have n't chosen . February 1 , 2011 at 2:51 am | I 'd like to know if any other country & US have thought about doing a food drop , for the people of Egypt if there food supply is so low . We should be backing the people . mubarak has nothing to govern without the people of Egypt behind him . Stay safe February 1 , 2011 at 1:27 am | Anderson , be careful , it is going to be an explosive day . Mubarak will be out of reign . February 1 , 2011 at 12:29 am | I hope the army keeps its words to not turn on the unarmed people . I really wish someone of those people surrounding Mubarak , takes it upon himself , and walks up to Mubarak and whispers in his ears that he needs to leave . Actually Mubarak is 82 years old man , who is out of touch , and clinking on his day job . last time I checked , Hmmm , let me see ... Egypt is not a monarchy . He needs to leave - !!!! Once all the dust has settled and Mubarek is gone , the question being asked especially in the U.S. , is what next ? Who 's the leader ? The fact that there are no viable opposition parties seems to make westerners nervous , because their system of politics is all that they understand . What 's important is to trust these good people to prevent chaos , and to ensure that they are governed . A coalition of several prominent individuals could work as an interim government until an election is held . After all that they 've been through I have no doubt that Egyptians will get it done , and that they will be able to cooperate with one another . Perhaps the partisan , bitter party infighting which characterizes American politics is NOT the way for Egyptians to go . They have the floor , so let 's just watch rather than fretting that `` there 's no leader '' . January 31 , 2011 at 11:42 pm | Mr. mobarek pls have democratic election and 100 % no one will elected you . live the power in peace to others it will be good 4 all off the mid east and Africa . January 31 , 2011 at 11:41 pm | Anderson Cooper , Please expose to the world that the looting going on in Egypt is not from the protesters . They are plain clothes policemen and criminals that were let loose from the jails in Cairo . The regime is doing this to spread fear amongst Egyptians and to keep the protesters off the streets . Also , please expose the Egyptian chivalry and bravery . The ones protecting the streets now are the Egyptian people themselves . They are doing this in shifts and organizing themselves in the absence of law . With chaos on the streets caused by criminals and escape prisoners , there is no way to filter out the bad from the good without the army being given some power to take control . In order to effectively provide protection for the citizens of Egypt , the residents must return to their homes and clear the streets allowing a representative to speak on their behalf . The country is at greater risk of danger if the military are overtaken by evil doers pretending to be their friends . They must be strong now ... punish those who are committing crimes and protect the innocent . Use force if necessary to accomplish this . January 31 , 2011 at 11:26 pm | Anderson , Great job in coverage . Very fair and accurate coverage , as you always do . That however should not take any credit away from Ben , Nick , Iven . I am glued to the CNN . To be frank with you , I was torn between Aljazeera and CNN , but now The former is out , it is only CNN . Great and complete coverage . Keep up the good work January 31 , 2011 at 11:21 pm | I need to tell Obama that Mubarak is using The Muslim Brotherhood threat to gain his support . It is actually a fake threat , The people do not want The Muslim Brotherhood and will never choose them . The people prooved that they have a say and they will choose the right person . the US need not to worry about that , We are a nation who wants to live in peace , we want to build our country and have a better future for our kids and we can do that , all we need is our freedom .

CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : Hi , I 'm Carl Azuz , and you 're tuned in to CNN Student News ! A country in chaos ; the Midwest bracing for a blizzard : 10 minutes of commercial-free headlines start right now . AZUZ : Protesters ignoring a government curfew ; armed troops patrolling the streets ; daily supplies running low . In a word , chaos . For more than a week , people have been marching through the streets of Egypt , calling for long-time President Hosni Mubarak to step down . Some experts think this past week of protests could just be the calm before the storm . There are reports that Egyptians are planning another wave of massive protests starting today in some of the nation 's major cities , like Cairo and Alexandria . The Egyptian military has been called out to try to control the situation . Yesterday , a military spokesman said the army wo n't use violence against the protesters , the troops are just there to help maintain security . There have been times when protesters fought with security forces in the streets . We 've gotten reports that more than 100 people have been killed in the violence , though it 's hard to confirm those kinds of numbers in a situation like this . Egyptians who are n't part of the protests are being affected , too . Parts of the country are running low on things they need , like food and gas . And with police and security forces focused on the protests , some shops and businesses have been robbed , and there are reports of prison breaks . As you can imagine , a lot of people are trying to get out , especially citizens of other countries who live or work in Egypt . The U.S. State Department says there are more than 50,000 Americans in Egypt . The agency 's working to arrange transportation out of the country for those folks . But as we heard from one American , finding a way to leave can be very frustrating . LAURA MURPHY LEE , AMERICAN TOURIST IN EGYPT : You can not get away by water . You can not take public transportation because it 's been deemed unsafe , and you can not fly . So apparently , there are over 50,000 Americans in Egypt , some of whom may be flown out of the major cities . But those of us who are not in Cairo or Alexandria , are trapped right now . AZUZ : There 's another aspect to what 's going on in Egypt , and it has to do with oil . Egypt is n't a major oil producer , but four-and-a-half percent of the entire world 's oil supply has to go through Egypt . Stephanie Elam is here to help explain what kind of impact it might have if that flow of oil runs into any problems . STEPHANIE ELAM , CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT : This is something that I know is like a world away for most Americans , but it could really have been an impact . And what we want to do is demonstrate for you just how key this region is , because you 've got the Suez Canal there , which is in Egypt . It 's controlled by Egypt . And there 's also the Sumed pipeline . So , let 's take a look first at the Suez Canal . You can see right there that in 2009 , we know 1.8 million barrels a day flowed through the canal . You also have the Sumed pipeline , which is just to the west of the Suez Canal . And through there , 1.1 million barrels a day actually flow through that pipeline . So this artery , these two arteries , are just key for the region , because without this , what shippers would actually have to do is ship it all the way around Africa to get it over to Europe . And that would add 6,000 miles to the journey . No doubt about it , a -RRB- that would cost a lot more . And b -RRB- it would also mess up with some supply and demand on when it would actually show up in Europe and the rest of the world that needs to get this key oil from such an important , oil-producing region . AZUZ : Taking you back to the U.S. now , where it has been a pretty rough winter so far . We 've seen brutal snowstorms . Do n't even get me started talking about the airport . There 've been hundreds of canceled and delayed flights . And here we go again . A major storm system is developing across the country . Yesterday afternoon , Rob Marciano was tracking which parts of the U.S. could be affected and just how bad this might get . ROB MARCIANO , CNN WEATHER ANCHOR : There 's over 20 states that are within a winter storm watch or advisory or winter storm warning , from New England all the way to New Mexico . This is a huge system that 's going to affect tens of millions of people ; pretty much 3\\/4 of the country is under the gun here . And if you 're not in one of these winter weather advisories , you 're in the Southeast , which has had the heat built up for the past couple days , so there 's going to be some energy there for severe thunderstorms also . Winter storm warnings now posted for St. Louis back to Oklahoma City . We could see anywhere from eight to 12 inches of snow down here . Up to Chicago , could see 12 to 18 inches of snow . That is unbelievable for Chicago . And if that happens , if that verifies , we get 18 to 20 inches of snow , it 's going to be the worst snowstorm they 've seen in over ten years . AZUZ : February first : On this day in history in 1790 , the U.S. Supreme Court met for the first time in New York City . In 1865 , President Abraham Lincoln signed a resolution sending the 13th Amendment , which would abolish slavery , to the states for ratification . In 1960 , four African-Americans began a sit-in protest at a lunch counter in Greensboro , North Carolina after they were n't given service because of the store 's `` whites only '' policy . And in 2003 , the space shuttle Columbia broke up while re-entering the earth 's atmosphere , killing all seven crew members on board .

Islamabad is the capital of Pakistan , the country with the world 's sixth-largest population . That 's your answer and that 's your Shoutout ! REZA SAYAH , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT , ISLAMABAD : It 's a little after 8:00 in the morning , and we 're in the town of Daud Khel here in northwest Pakistan . We drove four hours to get here from Islamabad . This is Islamabad ; this is where we are in Daud Khel . A lot of the militant Taliban activity you hear about is here in the tribal region just west of us , and this is Afghanistan . We came here to tell you the story of Rukhsana Batool . She 's a 25-year-old mother , and every morning she wakes up , puts on her burqa -- a full-length Islamic veil -- and takes her two little boys to school . That 's not so unusual . What happens next is . Rukhsana does n't leave her kids at school . Instead , she sits right next to them in class and learns . That 's because she 's enrolled in first grade with her kids . RUKHSANA BATOOL , FIRST GRADER MOM -LRB- TRANSLATED -RRB- : I used to bring my children to school , and I saw them studying , and I thought I really want to study and learn , too . SAYAH : A teacher here at the school says , for weeks , Rukhsana came to class because her kids would n't sit still . She ended up liking it . Her parents had never sent her to school , so the teacher had an idea : why not enroll and come to class . And for Rukhsana , the decision was easy . MUREED FIZZA , RUKHSANA 'S TEACHER -LRB- TRANSLATED -RRB- : She was interested in studying and I welcomed that . I told her I would teach her , even if it meant taking up break time . SAYAH : Rukhsana gives her husband a lot of credit for encouraging her . Remember , illiteracy is a huge problem here in Pakistan . Where we are it 's rare for little girls to go to school , let alone 25-year-old moms . One study shows only one out of ten girls go to school in this province . SABIR HUSSAIN SHAH , RUKHSANA 'S HUSBAND -LRB- TRANSLATED -RRB- : I think women in every country should be educated . If she 's getting educated , then our family will be much more enlightened as well . FIZZA -LRB- TRANSLATED -RRB- : My opinion is that one of the main solutions to all of the issues we have in this country is the education of women . I think if one woman is educated , her entire family will be educated . SAYAH : Their teacher says one of Rukhsana 's boys could be sharper than she is . Some friendly competition between mom and her two little boys in first grade . Reza Sayah , CNN , Daud Khel , Pakistan . AZUZ : It 's only on CNN you 'd see a story like that . Well , our last story on this first day of February : We want you to check out this nature film . Watch , as the majestic silverback gorilla strolls across the wilds of the Serengeti . Hold on a second , since when do gorillas stroll ?! This one does . And he 's not on the Serengeti . He 's in a British animal park . The 21-year-old has become a pseudo-celebrity because of this YouTube video that shows off how he walks upright . We 're not sure how he learned it ; it might 've been because he was watching how his human keepers walked on two legs ... AZUZ : ... and then he just aped their behavior . We 're sure a unique skill like that gives him a leg up on the other gorillas . So he should definitely be proud ; you know , stand tall . I can hear you groaning from here . He wrote us , `` A pun a day keeps laughter on its way . '' We 'd love for you to send us your sign-off line . We 're gonna keep doing these ; we 're having a good time with them , and we enjoy what you have to say . Have a great day . For CNN Student News , I 'm Carl Azuz .

But an Iranian opposition leader is making a competing claim of solidarity with the demonstrators , pointing out that when Iran 's leaders faced a similar movement in their own backyard two years ago , they crushed it . Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi on Sunday praised Egypt 's protests , according to Iran 's semi-official Fars news agency , as did the speaker of Iran 's parliament , who said the parliament and the nation support uprisings against dictatorial regimes . `` The time has -LRB- been -RRB- reached to overcome puppet autocratic regimes by relying on the Islamic teachings , '' said speaker Ali Larijani , according to the news agency . And Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami , a top cleric in Tehran , was quoted last week by Fars as saying , `` An Islamic Middle East is being created based on Islam , religion , and democracy with prevailing religious principals . '' But Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi says that his 2009 mass protest movement , which was violently crushed in the streets of Tehran , was based on the same grievances as the ones now seen in Tunisia , Egypt , and Yemen . `` Today , the slogan of ` Where is my vote ? ' of the people of Iran has reached Egypt , '' Mousavi wrote on his website . And in the Egyptian government 's confrontations and clashes with protesters , he says , `` We can identify a similar pattern '' to the crackdown by the Iranian government in 2009 . With Iran 's regime and Iran 's opposition both trying to identify with Egypt 's protesters , `` there are two competing narratives , '' says Afshin Molavi of the Washington-based New America Foundation , which describes itself as a nonprofit , nonpartisan public policy institute . Analysts say Iran 's leaders have a strategic interest at stake in the turmoil in Egypt : It is weakening Iranian leaders ' biggest archrival in the region -- the secular , pro-Western Hosni Mubarak . Mubarak has been an ally of the West for decades , taking the opposite position from Iran on a number of issues -- opposing Iran 's nuclear program , supporting peace with Israel , and working to prevent border smuggling of weapons to Hamas militants in Gaza , according to American diplomatic cables released recently by WikiLeaks .

Protests in the Middle East raise questions about the internet 's role in democracy Some say the internet is a human right ; others that it 's not necessary for protest Egypt has cut access to internet and mobile phones ; protests continue -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Are we in the age of internet revolutions -- where Facebook , Twitter and text messages are essential ingredients in democratic change ? Or , as the ongoing protests in Egypt perhaps show , is the internet only one tool in this process -- nothing more than the modern version of the telephone ? As violent demonstrations continue on the streets of Egypt -- where many are upset with the results of Hosni Mubarak 's 30 years in power -- tech pundits and bloggers are trying to sort out the internet 's role in the situation . Some say Egypt is violating modern human rights by cutting access to the internet and to mobile phone networks . Others say the fact that protests have continued despite these digital barricades reveals a massive hole in the argument that social media spawns modern revolutions . `` Where activists were once defined by their causes , they are now defined by their tools , '' Malcolm Gladwell writes in The New Yorker . To help make sense of these complicated arguments , here 's a wrap-up of what people are saying about the internet 's role in Egypt , where unrest continues , and in Tunisia , where protests earlier this month toppled the government and set off a wave of unrest in other Middle Eastern countries : `` We want to make sure that Egypt is not interfering with the use of social media . That 's a fundamental right as clear as walking into a town square . We 're making these points clear to Egypt , publicly and privately . '' Dave Pell , writing on the blog Tweetage Wasteland , says the internet is n't essential for revolution -- but it sure helps : `` Yes , folks . The Civil Rights movement took place at a time before Twitter . For those scoring at home , the same is true for every notable historical movement from the Big Bang through the release of Destiny Child 's Bootlylicious video . The realtime , social web is clearly not a required element to organize and execute a high impact revolution . Neither is a megaphone , but it sure makes it easier for the folks in the back to hear you . '' '' ... Do n't confuse tools with root causes , or means with ends . The protests in Tunisia , Egypt and Yemen are against dictators who 've held power -- and clamped down on their people -- for decades . That 's the fuel for the engine of dissent . The dozen or more protesters that self-immolated in Egypt did n't do it for the tweets . ` It 's about years of repression and dictatorship . Revolutions existed before Twitter and Facebook , ' Issandr el-Amrani , a Cairo writer and activist , said in a telephone interview from Tunisia . ` It 's really not much more complicated than this . ' Only about a quarter of the Egyptian populace is online , el-Amrani estimated . So street protests have grown the old-fashioned way : by leaflets and spontaneous amalgamation . '' `` Humans are functioning as defacto news aggregators using the publication tools already available . This , while not a novel idea , really hit home in the past two weeks with the two subsequent revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt . What I and you probably noticed was that interested people we followed took it upon themselves to become individual nodes of information , using the tools they had to serve as their own news networks . '' In The New Yorker , Nicholas Thompson , a social media expert , writes that the internet can benefit both sides of a conflict : `` Governments control the pipes through which all that information flows . This means they can block sites or , as Egypt has just apparently done , shut down the entire Internet and thus confuse everyone who has come to rely on it . In Iran , the government clearly had some success using the Internet to disrupt and slow the green revolution . In Tunisia , the government hacked the password of nearly every Facebook user in the country . Had Ben Ali not fallen so quickly , that information would have been extremely useful . Technological tools can be used quite effectively by the masses , or by the man . '' '' ... technology -- not just the Internet but also mobile phones -- make -LRB- sic -RRB- it easier to trace protesters and dissidents . It would be very hard , for example , to trace the names of everyone who gathered on Minsk 's central square to oppose the results of the recent elections in Belarus before mobile phones became ubiquitous . '' `` I think the right to connect now becomes a fundamental human right . And the problem here is we see that government is the single point of failure for the internet . Whether that 's the kill switch , as Egypt has used it , or whether it 's the fact that they control the structure for the internet . And so our future -- the means by which we 're going to build the next society -- is vulnerable here , and that worries me . At the same time , I celebrate the fact that the people in a nation can use these tools to take charge . '' `` Would the State Department have gotten involved early on -LRB- remember , their first public comment was in respect to Tunisian Net freedom -RRB- ? Would Al Jazeera -- without offices on the ground -- have been able to report on the unfolding story as they did ? Most importantly , would any of that have mattered ? '' Internet access is `` fundamental '' to the protests in Egypt , writes Khadija Sharife on the Huffington Post : `` More than ever , the internet remains a crucial vehicle of sustaining and transmitting resistance by allowing for Egyptians to ` network the world ' about the machinery of Mubarak 's brutal regime . While it is not technology that has given life to the revolution but Egyptians themselves , catalyzed in part by their Tunisian neighbors , access is fundamental . '' In The New Yorker , Malcolm Gladwell points out that protests -- and revolutions -- occurred long before the internet . Take the Civil Rights movement : `` Thousands were arrested and untold thousands more radicalized . These events in the early sixties became a civil-rights war that engulfed the South for the rest of the decade -- and it happened without e-mail , texting , Facebook , or Twitter .

Follow live blogging on This Just In and the latest tweets from CNN correspondents from the protests . Send your video , images to CNN iReport . Cairo , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Egypt braced for a `` march of millions '' in anti-government protests Tuesday as embattled President Hosni Mubarak tried to throw up literal and figurative roadblocks in the way of demonstrators calling for his ouster . Major demonstrations are planned for Cairo , Alexandria and other cities , the latest in a series of rallies that began a week ago . Protesters have defied orders for a curfew , and the country 's powerful military announced Monday that it would not open fire on peaceful demonstrators . A leading opposition figure told CNN that the United States needs to be ready to `` let go of Mubarak , '' a longtime ally . `` You should n't be behind the curve , and you need to start building confidence with the people , and not with the people who are smothering the people , '' Mohamed ElBaradei , the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , told CNN 's `` Anderson Cooper 360 . '' Mubarak 's newly appointed vice president , longtime intelligence chief Omar Suleiman , announced Monday that he had begun discussing reform with opposition parties . Speaking on the state television network , Suleiman said a reform package should be drawn up `` expeditiously . '' Gunfire amid protests in Cairo Egypt VP : Reform comes through dialogue Egypt 's protesters not swayed by tanks `` The other parties will also have a role to play , which will lead to real political reform , '' Suleiman said . But there were no details of what proposals might be on the table , nor was there any immediate reaction from opposition figures or any indication of which parties were taking part . And at the same time , the government has shut down the country 's rail network , posted troops at key locations , closed banks and schools and pulled the plug on mobile phone and internet service ahead of Tuesday 's protests . Mubarak has ruled Egypt for nearly 30 years under a sweeping emergency decree , imposed after the 1981 assassination of his predecessor , Anwar Sadat . A wave of protests against his regime erupted following the uprising in Tunisia that ousted its longtime strongman January 14 , and Arab League Secretary-General Amre Moussa -- Mubarak 's former foreign minister -- called Monday for a peaceful transition of power `` from an era to the other , '' the French news agency AFP reported . Egypt 's military announced Monday evening that it recognized `` the legitimate demands of the honest citizens '' and would not open fire on peaceful protesters . `` The presence of the armed forces in the Egyptian streets is for your benefit to protect your safety and peace , '' an unnamed spokesman announced on state television Monday night . `` Your armed forces will not use violence against this great people , who have always played a significant role in every moment of Egypt 's great history . '' And human rights activist and blogger Ramy Raoof told CNN 's `` Parker Spitzer '' that troops are mingling with demonstrators in Cairo 's Tahrir Square . `` There is no aggressive behavior from the army toward the peaceful assemblies , '' he said early Tuesday . `` We hope that within a few hours , the same also will happen . We hope the army will not escalate violence against us . '' Though Mubarak has given no indication that he will bow to demands for his ouster , he fired his Cabinet on Saturday , and his designation of Suleiman as vice president marks the first time he has filled that post since he came to power in 1981 . Monday , Mubarak swore in Mahmoud Wagdy as the new interior minister to replace Habib el-Adly , who has been criticized by protesters because of police actions . Others sworn in on Monday were Finance Minister Samir Radwan , a former economist at the International Labor Organization , and Health Minister Ahmed Hosni Farid . iReporters help cover Egypt protests Tony Blair discusses Egypt crisis Will unrest spread to other countries ? At a glance : Nations facing unrest Radwan told CNN 's `` Quest Means Business '' that his priority is `` to show that this is a government that responds to the demands -- the fair demands , I would say -- of the people in Tahrir Square . '' `` We need to use public expenditure to achieve some sort of social justice and a better distribution of the fruits of growth , as to the bottom 40 % of this country , '' Radwan said . At the same time , he said , Egypt should n't sacrifice economic reforms and gains `` that enabled it to stand the storm of two successive crises -- the food crisis and the financial crisis . '' State television reported Monday that the crisis has cost the country an estimated 69 billion Egyptian pounds -LRB- nearly $ 12 billion -RRB- and set its economy back six months . Meanwhile , there are international indications that the world could accept a changed Egypt without Mubarak . In Washington , U.S. officials have been calling for an `` orderly transition '' that will include free elections in September , when Mubarak 's current term expires . `` The United States government does not determine who 's on the ballot , '' White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters . `` The question is whether or not those elections are going to be free and fair . That 's what we would weigh in on and weigh in on strongly . '' While it was widely believed Mubarak was grooming his son , Gamal , as his successor , that plan now has been complicated by demands for democracy . ElBaradei is one of several opposition figures whose names surface when protesters talk about possible future leaders of Egypt . Another possibility is Moussa , a veteran diplomat who was Mubarak 's foreign minister until 2001 . But several opposition movements have been represented on the streets in the demonstrations , and Raoof said , `` There is no leader for the revolution . '' `` There is no political group leading the people . There is no one leading the people . People are going in a very organic way ... people are just doing it . '' Mounir Fakhry Abdel Nour , secretary-general of the Wafd Party , told CNN the group 's followers have been `` extremely active . '' In Alexandria , an armored personnel carrier fired warning shots Monday as about 2,000 to 3,000 people gathered . The shots were seen as an apparent effort to intimidate protesters near a hotel . While it 's difficult to ascertain a solid death toll during the violence , Human Rights Watch staffers have confirmed 80 deaths from two hospitals in Cairo , 36 deaths in Alexandria and 13 fatalities in Suez , said Human Rights Watch researcher Heba Morayef . The unrest has paralyzed daily life in Egypt . Many essential supplies are running low , said Peter Bouckaert , Human Rights Watch emergencies director . Gas stations throughout Cairo and Alexandria were closing because they were out of fuel . The amount of goods in shops were low and many were rationing how much food people could buy . The Egyptian stock exchange and banks were closed Monday , and the Moody 's ratings agency downgraded debt ratings for the country because of the turmoil . There were long lines in front of bread shops and supermarkets , ATMs and gas stations were closed , and there was a minimal police presence . In one neighborhood of Cairo , however , sanitation workers were seen collecting garbage . Men with makeshift weapons patrolled neighborhoods , creating checkpoints to fill the void left when police stopped patrolling the streets , and the self-appointed defense groups appear to be working closely with the military . Suez Canal authorities have said operations there are unchanged and the army is in control . However , shipping companies are predicting delays . And Egyptian soldiers are guarding the pyramids in Giza , one of the world 's top tourist draws . There have been reports of prison breaks , and state-run Nile TV said Monday nearly 2,100 escaped inmates had been arrested .

But the pay stinks : Employers have n't added enough jobs . And those they have added are n't particularly good ones . A big worry is whether the trend toward low-wage jobs will continue . Experts say it 's too soon to tell . The embattled Egyptian government early Tuesday restricted communications and travel ahead of what protesters are calling a `` march of millions . '' Here 's what the government has done so far : Noor Group , an Internet service provider , has been shut down , according to the information ministry . The move essentially takes the country offline . The government is also planning to shut down mobile phone networks before the march , the ministry said . Security forces have been laying concrete barriers in front of strategic locations in central Cairo . President Hosni Mubarak has ordered an indefinite train shutdown . `` Will help prevent protests from reaching Tahrir Tuesday , plus further cripple economy , '' CNN 's Ben Wedeman wrote in a message on Twitter . Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak -LRB- pictured -RRB- is likely thinking more about restoring order than leaving , a former U.S. ambassador to Egypt says . Street demonstrations in Egypt show no signs of letting up . Calls for President Hosni Mubarak to leave office persist . So far , Mubarak shows no signs of heeding the call . Is he considering an exit from office or does he believe he can manage his way out of this crisis ? Daniel Kurtzer believes Mubarak is n't going anywhere anytime soon . Kurtzer was the U.S. ambassador to Egypt from 1997 to 2001 , the U.S. ambassador to Israel from 2001 to 2005 and an adviser on Middle East policy to the Obama campaign during the 2008 presidential election . Today , he 's a professor of Middle Eastern Policy Studies at Princeton University 's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs . He knows Mubarak well . `` Mubarak , as the ultimate guarantor of stability in Egypt as far as he sees it , is only thinking about how to restore calm and law and order , '' Kurtzer said . `` In the back of his mind is the idea that maybe the demonstrators have an issue and something needs to be done . But his major concern now is to restore law and order . '' It would take a dramatic turn of events for Mubarak to leave office , according to Kurtzer . `` I believe the only thing that will change Mubarak 's mind is a sit down with top military and security leaders who basically say to him , ` Your presence is putting the system in jeopardy . ' There 's no evidence yet to suggest that that kind of attitude has grown in the military , '' Kurtzer said .

Anthony Kennedy tends to be the swing vote . I would not be at all surprised that he would be the swing vote in this case as well , '' Toobin said . `` When you consider that this is the signature achievement of the Obama administration , and that it is hanging by a legal thread right now , it 's a cause of great concern to supporters of the law . '' Because the Florida judge ruled that the individual mandate , the part of the law that says everyone has to buy health insurance , is unconstitutional , he says the whole law has to go out the window , Toobin said . Toobin said it is important to note that several federal judges have found the law constitutional . `` This is why we have a United States Supreme Court , to settle when judges disagree with each other , '' Toobin said . The nine justices `` have the last word , '' Toobin said . `` Nobody can tell them what to do or when to do it . '' -LRB- Updated at 5:37 p.m. -RRB- The U.S. Department of Justice says it plans to appeal the ruling of a federal judge in Florida , who earlier today struck down as unconstitutional key parts of the sweeping health care reform bill championed by President Obama . -LRB- Updated at 3:47 p.m. -RRB- A federal judge in Florida has ruled unconstitutional the sweeping health care reform law championed by President Barack Obama , setting up what is likely to be a contentious Supreme Court challenge in coming months over the legislation . Monday 's ruling came in the most closely watched of the two dozen challenges to the law . Florida along with 25 states had filed a lawsuit last spring , seeking to dismiss a law critics had labeled `` Obamacare . '' Judge Roger Vinson , in a 78-page ruling , dismissed the key provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - the so-called `` individual mandate '' requiring most Americans to purchase health insurance by 2014 or face `` I must reluctantly conclude that Congress exceeded the bounds of its authority in passing the Act with the individual mandate . That is not to say , of course , that Congress is without power to address the problems and Inequities in our health care system , '' Vinson wrote . `` Because the individual mandate is unconstitutional and not severable , the entire Act must be declared void . This has been a difficult decision to reach , and I am aware that it will have indeterminable implications . At a time when there is virtually unanimous agreement that health care reform is needed in this country , it is hard to invalidate and strike down a statute titled ` The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act . ' '' On the heels of anti-government demonstrations in Tunisia , thousands of protesters spilled into the streets of Egypt in a rare display of anti-government outcry . CNN reporters on the scene witnessed throngs of people in Cairo march from Tahrir Square to the parliament building . Demonstrators threw rocks at police , who threw them back and shot tear gas at the protesters , who also reciprocated . While Egypt estimated that there were 5,000 to 10,000 protesters , CNN estimated that the demonstration peaked at 15,000 to 20,000 protesters . The protest 's organizers said they wanted to mirror the uprising in Tunisia , which 10 days prior had precipitated the end of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 's 23-year rule . Before the protests in Cairo , several Egyptians set themselves or tried to set themselves on fire earlier in the month , which also was reminiscent of Tunisia , where a man 's self-immolation spurred the uprising . The Egyptian protesters - who included young and old , Christians and Muslims , students , workers and businesspeople - said they were angry over the cost of living , failed economic policies and corruption . They demanded that President Hosni Mubarak , in power for three decades , follow the lead of Tunisia 's president . `` We breathe corruption in the air , '' said one demonstrator . Tens of millions of people are bracing for a major storm system poised to sweep through the central United States and beyond this week , according to weather forecasters . Chicago , where a blizzard watch already has been issued , is expecting a snowstorm of historic proportions . `` This storm could be one of the top 10 biggest snowstorms ever in the city , '' said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris . The same system is expected to coat large sections of the country 's midsection in a thick blanket of snow , he said . The Navy commander fired for making racy videos and broadcasting them on a ship says that the movies had the `` tacit approval '' of senior Navy leadership , the Navy Times reports . Owen Honors ' statement to investigators , obtained by the Navy Times , marks the first time his side of the story has been made public . Honors made headlines for days in early January when the videos were published on the Virginian-Pilot newspaper site . The films included a simulated rectal exam , anti-gay slurs and sailors pretending to shower with each other aboard ship . In early January , Honors was removed from his post commanding the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise . An official 15-page statement that Honors gave to Navy investigators states that two commanding officers , two strike group admirals `` and myriad other senior military and civilian distinguished visitors '' were aware of the videos , according to the Navy Times . Honors made the videos in 2006 and 2007 when he was executive officer of the Enterprise , and they were discussed during meetings with the ship 's commanding officer and other leadership , the Navy Times reports . During these conversations , Honors received encouraging feedback about the content of the movies and was never told to stop making them , according to the report . Honors ' superiors did not respond to Navy Times ' requests for comment .

Few images have been more powerful than those of demonstrators dropping to the ground to pray in the face of security forces . And while some have been inspired by the role of religious faith in the protests , there are definite worries that the banned Muslim Brotherhood is waiting in the wings , hoping for a chance to take over . `` You do n't just have a government and a movement for democracy , '' former British Prime Minister Tony Blair cautioned on Monday . `` You also have others , notably the Muslim Brotherhood , who would take this in a different direction . We need to be anxious to meet the aspirations of the people , but do it in a way that produces something better .

Then when they sweryed , Allah made their hearts swerve ; and Allah guideth not a trans-gr-essing people . -LRB- 5 -RRB- And recall what time Isa , son of Maryam , said : children of Israil ! verily I am Allahs apostle Unto you , confirming the Taurat which was before me , and giving the glad tidings of an apostle who cometh after me : his name will be Ahmad . Then when he brought Unto them evidences , they said : this is magic manifest . -LRB- 6 -RRB- And who is a greater wrong-doer than he who fabricateth against Allah a lie even as he is summoned Unto Islam ?

Allah hath chosen for you the -LRB- true -RRB- religion ; therefore die not save as men who have surrendered -LRB- unto Him -RRB- . -LRB- 132 -RRB- Or were ye present when death came to Jacob , when he said unto his sons : What will ye worship after me ? They said : We shall worship thy God , the God of thy fathers , Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac , One God , and unto Him we have surrendered . -LRB- 133 -RRB- Those are a people who have passed away .

We make no distinction between any of them , and unto Him we have surrendered . -LRB- 136 -RRB- And if they believe in the like of that which ye believe , then are they rightly guided . But if they turn away , then are they in schism , and Allah will suffice thee -LRB- for defense -RRB- against them .

We are His worshippers . -LRB- 138 -RRB- Say -LRB- unto the People of the Scripture -RRB- : Dispute ye with us concerning Allah when He is our Lord and your Lord ? Ours are our works and yours your works . We look to Him alone . -LRB- 139 -RRB- Or say ye that Abraham , and Ishmael , and Isaac , and Jacob , and the tribes were Jews or Christians ? Say : Do ye know best , or doth Allah ? And who is more unjust than he who hideth a testimony which he hath received from Allah ? Allah is not unaware of what ye do . -LRB- 140 -RRB- Those are a people who have passed away ; theirs is that which they earned and yours that which ye earn .

From Sir Salman Rushdie 's book `` Satanic Verses '' , p. 376 , paperback issue -- for those 1 billion Muslims to read as they are forbidden to purchase or read said book : One of the passages that prompted the crazy Ayatollah Khomeini to issue a fatwa against Sir Rushdie : `` The faithful lived by lawlessness , but in those years Mahound or should one say the Archangel Gibreel ? should one say Al-Lah ? became obsessed by law . Amid the palm-trees of the oasis Gibreel appeared to the Prophet and found himself spouting rules , rules , rules , until the faithful could scarcely bear the prospect of any more revelation , Salman said , rules about every da-mn thing , if a man farts let him turn his face to the wind , a rule about which hand to use for the purpose of cleaning one 's behind . It was as if no aspect of human existence was to be left unregulated , free . The revelation the recitation - told the faithful how much to eat , how deeply they should sleep , and which se-xual positions had received divine sanction , so that they leamed that so-domy and the missionary position were approved of by the archangel , whereas the forbidden postures included all those in which the female was on top . Gibreel further listed the permitted and forbidden subjects of conversation , and earmarked the parts of the body which could not be scratched no matter how unbearably they might itch . He vetoed the consumption of prawns , those bizarre other-worldly creatures which no member of the faithful had ever seen , and required animals to be killed slowly , by bleeding , so that by experiencing their deaths to the full they might arrive at an understanding of the meaning of their lives , for it is only at the moment of death that living creatures understand that life has been real , and not a sort of dream . And Gibreel the archangel specified the manner in which a man should be buried , and how his property should be divided , so that Salman the Persian got to wondering what manner of God this was that sounded so much like a businessman . This was when he had the idea that destroyed his faith , because he recalled that of course Mahound himself had been a businessman , and a damned successful one at that , a person to whom organization and rules came naturally , so how excessively convenient it was that he should have come up with such a very businesslike archangel , who handed down the management decisions of this highly corporate , if noncorporeal , God .

Man is judged by God basis his inner soul intentions in heart and mind ? Loving and Fearing God means we should take into considerations of the signs or inspirations which comes more as alarms to those who are doing as God told as commandments in all Holy Books that came upon the sons of Israel by Moses , David , Jesus and then upon Muhammed PBUH who was derived from Ismael son of Abraham PBUB ... All those books landed or inspired are on the base of monotheism and God told he has all the beautiful names known or unknown to us ... so no matter what names we call him by Allah , Allahim , God , Lord , Creator , Almighty and so on ... But you have mentioned other religions that worshiped Planets , Stars , idols unendless list of beliefs which were actully reduced by Islam but return it became branches that contained those converted publicly but inner still on their old belief and that what has given Islam a multi cultures and beliefs that have came out of the one islamic belief , that has caused any seeing doings of one accuses the whole bunch under the name of Islam with out any suggrigation between branches . You know I think not all those accounted to Islam or Islamic countries are real Muslim in practice but Muslim only by Coding as by land or family of birth ... but they contain all those you might know in beliefs or in disbliefs in their inner soul , heart , mind , that 's why we were told we will be judged by our intentions and not by being accounted for religions as followers ... And on and on and on and on and on and on goes the koranic-based drivel !!!!!

January 25 , 2011 . February 1 , 2011 at 11:42 pm | Report abuse | Islam is the religion of INNER PEACE . There is a mis-understanding about the use of the word PEACE which in common English usage refers to OUTER PEACE vis-a-vis war and conflict . A person following Islam is more likely to be at peace with himself and those around him\\/her . This is reflected in the wars and conflicts you will see through out history . Muslims have not been involved in most of the bloodiest and harshest conflicts in the history of man . Conflicts in the Muslim World today , while occupying significant news time , A -RRB- pale in comparison to what non-Muslims have done in this past century and B -RRB- are mostly the result of secular governments in the Muslim World vying for power and resources C -RRB- often backed by non-Muslim armaments and vested interests . Islamic Governments and Rulerships have rarely indulged in brutality that is reflective of a lack of inner peace of its adherents . The only example that comes to mind is the Armenian Genocide and even that was committed by the Turks who soon thereafter morphed into a secular European Nation-State . They were basically Europeans in spirit while retaining the last vestiges of the soon to disappear Turkish Islamic Caliphate of many centuries . February 2 , 2011 at 10:39 am | Report abuse | `` Lacking the image-of-God doctrine , Mohammed emphasized something else in its place submission . The very name he gave to his new religion Islam means submission . Submission in Islam means submission to God , submission to Mohammed as the ultimate prophet of God , submission to the Koran as the ultimate revelation from God , submission of women to men and submission of everyone to the caliph , sultan , shah or whichever other kind of Muslim ruler is in power . Hence the same Muslims whom Mohammed taught to fight fiercely against infidels of the house of war are taught to be docile submitters within the house of submission . The problem is that blind , unthinking submission , submission , submission emphasized over eons of time does not encourage clearheaded critical thinking , without which no democracy can succeed . In a submission-focused context , what can voting mean ? Dozens of Muslims nations elect parliaments , yes , but to date there is always a strong man who can demand submission from the entire body of elected officials at will . Those who refuse to submit risk assassination . ... A devout Muslim s sense of his own intrinsic value , accordingly , does not rest upon recognition of God s likeness within him . He measures it instead by the intensity of his uncritical submission to every requirement of the Koran ... '' -- D. Richardson February 2 , 2011 at 10:58 am | Report abuse | '' ... A devout Muslim s sense of his own intrinsic value , accordingly , does not rest upon recognition of God s likeness within him . He measures it instead by the intensity of his uncritical submission to every requirement of the Koran ... The Koran and the Requirement of World Domination Mohammed could not have known the size of the world , but several passages in the Koran show that he envisioned Islam dominating all of it , however large it might be : He it is who sent his messenger ... that he may cause it -LRB- Islam -RRB- to prevail over all religions -LRB- Koran 9:33 , M.M. Ali ; see also 48:28 and 61:9 -RRB- . M.M. Ali designates these three passages as the prophecy of the ultimate triumph of Islam in the whole world . Mohammed s successors , the caliphs , quoted passages like these to inspire Muslim armies as they advanced out of Arabia , imposing Islam by the sword upon a peacefully unsuspecting Middle East and North Africa , as I described in the previous chapter . Islamic armies , imbued with what Mohammed claimed was divine authorization , imposed Islam by force over vast areas , all the while extorting wealth from subjugated Jews and Christians to fund their ongoing conquests . As I noted , major defeats at Tours , France , in A.D. 732 , and again at Vienna , Austria , in A.D. 1683 , halted Islam s attempt to take all of Europe by force . Gradually Islamic forces were forced to retreat from Europe , except for part of the Balkans . But Islam has again set its sights on a conquest of Europe and of European civilization , wherever the latter has spread to North and South America and other regions . Muslim strategists ask their followers , Why do we find in these modern times that Allah has entrusted most of the world s oil wealth primarily to Muslim nations ? Their answer : Allah foresaw Islam s need for funds to finance a final politico-religious victory over what Islam perceives as its ultimate enemy : Christianized Euro-American civilization . So , Islam follows Nazism , fascism and communism as the world s latest hostile takeover aspirant . Nazis , fascists and communists failed . Does Islam have a better chance at success ? I believe it will flounder if we awaken to its threat in time ; yet , if there is not adequate planned resistance , Islam does have a better chance of succeeding . Communism s world takeover attempt was guaranteed to fail because its economic policy was naively contrary to human nature . Advocating the rubric What is mine is thine , and what is thine is mine , communism failed to see that human nature will not keep those two balanced propositions in equilibrium . Like a female black widow spider consuming her mate , the latter part of the formula makes a meal of the former , leading to the collapse of any system based upon that formula . In contrast , political systems do well if they can persuade people to adhere to What s mine is mine and What s thine is thine maxims . Only if a strong religious incentive is added does such an idealistic formula have any long-term chance . Even then success will be spotty . But communism -LRB- and Nazism , for that matter -RRB- excluded religion . And that mistake was the final nail eventually clamping a lid on communism s coffin . Communism , on a historical scale , perished while still in its childhood . Islam is not repeating communism s mistake . Mating political cunning and incredible wealth with religious zeal , Islam does have a chance to succeed and will succeed unless major parts of the Western world unite to take appropriate countermeasures . But many Western leaders , unable to believe that a mere religion could possible be a serious political threat , keep proclaiming themselves as Islam-friendly , reasoning that all religions are good-aren t they ? A Muslim strategist in Beverly Hills , California , declared several years ago , as quoted by a friend of mine : Now that the struggle between Western democracies and international communism is winding down , it is time for the real and final struggle to begin , and we are going to win ! - D.

Modern de-vils are classified as the de-mons of the de-mented . To believe that all the heavenly books that were sent to the different prophets are true . However , apart from the Quran , all other books are not valid anymore . '' Another major item to delete . There are no books written in the spirit state of Heaven -LRB- if there is one -RRB- just as there are no angels to write\\/publish\\/distribute them . The Koran , OT , NT etc. are simply books written by humans for humans . Prophets were invented by ancient scribes typically to keep the un-educated masses in line .

Mubarek is ousted in favor of a radical 2 . Murbarek becames more radical towards Israel . In Daniel Chapter 11 , Daniel has a vision of Israel being attacked in the last days . Daniel uses the term `` King of the South '' as one of the attackers . Many believe King of the South refers to Eygpt . Keeping in mind 2 points 1 .

Love compels them to see the positive things in their child . They knew that he had drug problems , they knew that something was wrong with him . That was why the dad decided to inquire Jared about what was in the bag and cared enough to follow him . He was suspicious but I am sure he never thought that Jared was going to kill someone . I am probably too young to judge the parents but I wish they atleast took him to a psychiatrist or sent him to rehab after he was suspended . It 's an unfortunate incident .

There were a lot of astrology skeptics on our comment boards , and a few of them said they were determined to prove that free will trumps the stars any day . Among the seeming optimists were Jonathan , who wrote , `` What a relief , I was worried there for a second that I was n't who I thought I was all these years . I was afraid I 'd have to learn a whole new personality . Which is really bad , because the signs on either side of me do n't fit me at all . '' Julia was also relieved . I 'm not a goal-setting , hard-working Capricorn and I knew it . I 'm an aloof and eccentric Aquarius . Long live the Aquarians ! '' Some thought perhaps the astrological system could be further refined . Aunt Linda took the time to pen a detailed explanation of the concepts at hand -LRB- omitted here -RRB- and concluded on this note : `` The Babylonians designed a system of astrology that was as accurate as possible for their day . Would n't it make sense for modern astrologers to do the same ? '' Joshua said , '' ` Fun and harmless . ' Is that why there 's people that wo n't leave their homes on days when their horoscope gives a bad outlook ? Is that why people spend all their money going to astrologers to get their fortunes read ? Astrology , tarot , etc , is all stupid B.S. that should be expunged from society , especially those astrologers that lie to their customers and tell them its real , when they know it to be fake . '' Neerav replied , `` I agree , Joshua . The reality is , unless you believe in the idea of predestination , that you are in control of your destiny , and not what is told by the position of the stars and planets in an artificially -LRB- and arbitrarily -RRB- divided up sky . This year , I am challenging each and every yearly astrology forecast for my zodiac sign -LRB- Ariers -RRB- in order to prove once and for all that they are useless and have no relevance to how we live our lives or determine our destiny . '' A fairly cynical hobart said , `` I think someone should do a study with 1,000 subjects and three treatment groups : 1 . tropical zodiac , 2 . sidereal zodiac , and 3 . a postmodern random essay generator . Each treatment group writes a horoscope for each subject , and at the end o of the day , we see which one wins . I bet it 's a three-way tie . '' this sucks said , `` So can I continue to blast the soundtrack for HAIR from my car or do I need to buy a new CD because of all of this ? '' Bob replied , `` You should get a new CD because the music in Hair sucks , not because its inaccurate . '' In a follow-up story , we received even more heated comments : RabiaDiluvio said , `` Breaking news : we just discovered that the Easter Bunny might be brown instead of white and Santa wears yellow and black sweaters on the weekend . '' Doomguy said , `` What a pile of crap . The fact that your sign can shift over the centuries is just more proof that astrology is a fantasy . In fact , some of the stars in the actual constellations themselves have moved since astrology was dreamed up . Please people ... this is the 21st century . Can we move past invisible boogey men , fiery pits and pitchforks and the layout of stars in the sky somehow controlling your life ? '' neptuneguy said , `` If you are that concerned about your zodiac sign , then this may actually change your identity . For the rest of the world , you might as well worry about changing your underwear . '' LastLegUp said , `` A quarter of a million Americans believe in astrology ? That 's really depressing .

We 'll open the comments at 3 p.m. ET and will talk with you then . Comment of the day : `` Wow ! What a great story . From homeless to superstar . '' -- JRR The viral story of Ted Williams , a homeless man with an amazing radio voice , captivated our readers . An outpouring of support came for this man , who was given a job with the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team as a result of the publicity . Check out what CNN.com readers had to say about this and other stories on CNN.com . Most of the responses , like from Elliot , were in support . He wrote , `` I am pleased to say that I 'm from Columbus as well . This is truly remarkable and to watch this man this morning break down and cry because of the offers and gestures of kindness , it was amazing . I really wish him the best and want to thank everyone that has seen the same opportunity to ` HELP ' as we here locally saw . '' Kevin Kunkel said , `` Big pat on the back to the Cleveland Cavaliers for being in a position and willing to give this guy a new chance in life . '' Veritas was among those who hoped this news would encourage more people to look at the homeless in a different light . `` God bless you William . Homeless does not mean hopeless . Many wonderful , talented , intelligent people are homeless due to the state of the economy . Once someone is homeless even for a short time , opportunities dissipate for jobs . No phone , no address , no transportation , no shower , no soap , and it goes on . We should all thank God for the little things we often take for granted , and show our appreciation by helping those less fortunate . No matter how little we have it is without a doubt more than someone else . Believe me it will come back to you tenfold . '' gman asked , `` What the heck is wrong with people ? He had a radio job and got into drugs . Many homeless people were skilled that ran into mental or drug problems , etc. . Why is it such a shock that a homeless guy has a skill ? It is insulting . '' Cleareye was wary of the story , `` This is a little too perfect . Nevertheless , if this guy cooked up this as publicity for himself , then cool . He has a great look to go with the voice . Hollywood here he comes ! '' But most of the respondents were very supportive , and we heard from many in the radio industry . Dan Brand-Levitan was in awe : `` Dude . I 'd love to have pipes like that . I 'm a former radio guy . Had to get out of the biz because the poor job markets and my debt load made it impossible . If I had pipes like that , I 'd be in big with the money . '' Mark Gunn said , `` I 've been in radio for 33 years and it 's stories like this that continue to make this a worthwhile career option . I am so very proud of this business right now . I listened to Ted this morning and the people that stepped up to offer him a second chance made for some really compelling radio . '' The emotional scene of veteran Rep. John Boehner of Ohio inheriting the speaker 's gavel and shaking hands with Rep. Nancy Pelosi got commenters going . Boehner appeared to shed tears as he took the gavel , sparking a passionate debate about the future of Congress , and the true nature of the sobs . 44mlm wrote , `` America , our long national nightmare is half over . In 2012 we will finish the job . '' A commenter using the nickname BlubberingB and an avatar of an emotional Boehner wrote , `` Please call me Mr. Boehner . Do you have a Kleenex ? '' JPatcher responded , `` It shows they really do have emotions . '' Several commenters referencing the moment in question said the oversized gavel reminded them of the mallet used in the arcade game Whack-a-Mole . ohcynicalone wrote , `` Boehner , dude , you ca n't look away like that when you play Whack-a-Mole . Look , there is a mole in a blue dress with pearls popping up beside you ! '' But JonJon20 said that it 's `` hard to hit anything when you ca n't see through your own tears . '' Finally , 10001NYC echoed what still others were feeling : `` I love it when one group of lying , cheating , self-aggrandizing thieves turns power over to another group of lying , cheating , self-aggrandizing thieves . '' Readers had a strong connection to Rafferty 's work and shared personal stories about what his songs mean to them . Many commenters also talked about the still-undetermined cause of death and speculation that the crooner was abusing alcohol . From there , many commenters shared stories and opinions on alcoholism in society . depeche68 wrote , `` I used ` Right Down The Line ' at our wedding going on three years ago , and it made me cry that night as I looked at my beautiful wife . His music will be close to me forever . I am sorry it ended the way it did for Gerry . Maybe a few people will see the light before it is too late . '' epdm said , `` I 'd give my right arm to be able to write a song as great as ` Baker Street , ' and that was just one of many from this huge talent . ... So sorry to learn of his painful last years . Rest now , Gerry . '' westTN said , `` His story reminds me why I stay sober . I did n't want to go out the way he did . I ` gave up the booze and the one night stands . ' Sounds as if he could n't . I hope he found some peace before he died . Thanks for the great tunes . '' This was easily the most-commented story of the day . Just about every reader was outraged about something . twirler wrote , `` No question the African slave trade , the Holocaust and the treatment of American Indians are gigantic horrors of human behavior . Can we learn from these events and go forward ? Can the generations of all races and religions in the 21st century be free of the blame and guilt and hate that belongs to perpetrators centuries ago ? Will the hatred of blacks toward whites ever end ? '' And mastmom said , `` Consider 205 years of slave ` trading . ' It is a clean word -- trade . Much cleaner than kidnapping . Eight generations of people : children , women and men subjected to horrific lifelong physical abuse and suffering until their death . Nothing in history compares to that misery . everything99 replied , `` If humankind is 1 million years old as they say , I am sure they have produced situations pretty much like this many times . '' Several readers took issue with the article and the responses it got , and much debate ensued . amidiots wrote , `` My problem is people 's assumption that because Africans are involved in the slave trade , that Black Americans are to forgive modern racism or take credit for part of the problem . ... White people asserted that the position of Blacks were less than human to justify the act and position themselves as the dominant race ... that is the beginning of modern racism . Not slavery but the idea that certain races are inherently stupid or less capable . '' YOUR TURN : Now that you 've read what other people are saying , do you find that your views align with theirs ?

Connect the World takes viewers on a journey across continents , beyond headlines and into histories of the stories that are changing our world . In the last two years Dambisa Moyo has gone from a relatively unknown academic to one of the most controversial thinkers of our time . The Zambian-born economist first came to the world 's attention with the publication with of her bestselling book `` Dead Aid : Why Aid is Not Working and How there is a Better Way for Africa . '' In it , she attacks the process of foreign aid by explaining that it 's ineffective . In 2009 Time Magazine listed her as one of the `` 100 most Influential People in the World . '' And this month she 's out with her second book entitled `` How the West Was Lost : Fifty Years of Economic Folly -- and the Stark Choices Ahead '' in which she talks about the inevitable decline of the West and the forces that brought it there . Here 's your chance to ask Dambisa Moyo your questions . Do you agree with her assessment of aid ? of the West 's future ? Send in your questions and do n't forget to tell us where you 're writing from . I agree with your assessment that the West will fall eventually , all great empires -LRB- if you can collectively call the West an empire -RRB- have . Do you have a time frame of when this will happen and if another super power , say China , will emerge , or are super powers a thing of the past ? January 31 , 2011 at 12:26 pm | Reply I totally agree with this wonderful lady . I am British and when I think of the damage that has been caused around the world because of western greed and imperialism it makes me ashamed of my identity . I have recently been amazed and humbled by the show of passion and courage of the Egyptian people in the recent struggle for freedom . The other day I said to myself that I wish I was born an Egyptian after seeing just what a wonderful people they are . You know that things are heading downhill in the US in particular when you are afraid to question your own government and its foreign policies . US Americans still have freedom of speech and that can never be taken away from you . We are supposed to live in a democracy and yet we seem to be ignored lately . Love will defeat evil . January 31 , 2011 at 12:35 pm | Reply Where you find India in economic order by say 2030 . I am writing from India January 31 , 2011 at 12:35 pm | Reply The very fact that so far the US housing market has not reached the bottom does prove that the golden era of western world is over . In fact the downward fall of US housing market will continue and the bottom will not be reached in foreseeable future . Right now US investors are misguided by US stock market . But let us not forget that Dow Jones index is not a true indicator of US economy because it is manipulated by rich and powerful . To get a true feeling about the economy what the investors should be looking for are the number related to National debt , unemployment etc. . January 31 , 2011 at 1:04 pm | Reply I completely agree with your stance on the negative effect of AID to Africa and why it is completely dead on arrival . I believe to be able to work our way out , Africa needs some bold leadership ! Look at us right now , we can not even take a bold stance on Cote du Ivoire , where do you think the bold leadership will come from and under what style of governance ? On the future of the West and its decline , does it include the USA -LRB- the center of innovation and freedom our current world -RRB- ? I believe one should seperate Europe from the USA as inspite of the current problems , the US remains the place where people want to go and live their dreams freely . I believe it this part of the human spirit that makes society great . China is limited by its authoritarian rule and lack of innovation -LRB- ps what have they invented in the last 50 years ? -RRB- . . India is dogged by it stratified society and caste system . . my best bet is Brazil which has shown innovation in renewable energy but is challenged with huge inequality ! January 31 , 2011 at 1:27 pm | Reply I would like to read her books before expressing any comments . but , what Dambisa Moyo expresses sounds interesting and accurate . i will try to find her books in Portugal , where I am . by the way , I was born in Angola from Europeans parents . January 31 , 2011 at 1:29 pm | Reply Bla bla bla . And by the way , that lady is not a clairvoyant that sees the future , so stop asking dumb questions like if she has a time frame of these events , or if she knows what other super power will emerge . Better spend your time in something more productive than trying to predict the impredictable , and that way maybe the West wont fall . January 31 , 2011 at 1:35 pm | Reply January 31 , 2011 at 1:39 pm | Reply I JUST WANT YOU TO TAKE A SECOND AND ANSWER MY QUESTION . DO YOU BELIVE THAT UNITED STATES ARE HEADING TO SUPER INFLATION AND THE WORTH OF THE DOLLAR WILL BE ZERO AND WILL TRUST THE WORLD INTO CHAOS AND ANARCY . THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR A RESPONSE . January 31 , 2011 at 1:43 pm | Reply Let 's hear more from this one , she I am writing from Shanghai , China . Greater China for instance hosts millions of returnees from the west and have learned the best & worst of the golden era . On the contrary , how does the reversed scenario look ? I think the west is n't falling but being minutely segregated from the new world as we diligently observe its pride serves its own fate . My question is , will the new golden age perform differently ? January 31 , 2011 at 2:16 pm | Reply What role do you see for latin america outside of Brazil and Argentina ? January 31 , 2011 at 2:18 pm | Reply Do n't you think this prediction was made long ago by Karl Marx ? Uncontrolled capitalism flows towards inefficiency , bad wealth distribution and ultimately , dismiss . Question : why we in the west never learn the lesson ? Or , how come we permit the financial sector to eternaly possess the classroom keys ? Who will be strong enough to put hedge fund mangers and other cassino bosses and manipulators into financial rules ' jails ? January 31 , 2011 at 2:32 pm | Reply It seems to be not so much about the West as to the fact that we live in an integrated gobal economy now . How do we move smoothly from what we have today to an effective and well functioning global economy that works well for everyone ? This is not a decline or fall . Simply a re-balancing of wealth and prosperity . Why should one side of the world live long and wealthy lives whilst the other live without . Growing economies deserve as much as anyone else , and if they earn it then why not . Both sides will have to up their game in order to retain\\/acquire what they want . Competitiveness will drive innovation , and in some cases , like here in the UK get peoples off there arses and get moving . China will not be ` cheap ' forever and they know this , knowledge and education is going to be key here . This is new magical ` new era ' , simply people saying I want you have , and I 'm going to work for it . I just hope current and future leaders on both same play fair , or this could end up nasty ! January 31 , 2011 at 3:01 pm | Reply The days of the West are coming to an end . In the next decade , the whole world order that has been built up since mid-19th century will probably be turned upside down . In a similar way that World War I and its denouement , World War II , sounded the death knell of the European empires that had dominated the world for centuries , the golden age of western capitalism and industrialisation is coming to an end . The imperialism and outward expansion of the European empires and latterly the US which comprised of rapid industrialisation at home , plunder of resources -LRB- oil , minerals , agricultural produce , slaves -RRB- in dark-skinned nations , rise of commerce and finance is in retreat . This is because the so-called `` colonies '' are actually more competitive , entrepreneurial , dynamic , frugal and most importantly do n't have the image problem of being perniciously greedy , war-mongering bullies as evinced by the financial collapse of 2008 and the Iraq war . However , the West are still leaders in a number of industries , have the best models of government -LRB- democracy , freedom of speech , free-markets -RRB- and the enduring legacy of being on top for so long that respect is still commanded . The challenge for the West -LRB- the US in particular -RRB- is to handle the inevitable transition of the next decade of power from North and West to East and South smoothly and peacefully . Otherwise the tragedies of the first half of the 20th century will be repeated . January 31 , 2011 at 3:04 pm | Reply Yes , America probably will fall someday , but when it does so will all the other countries that rely on U.S. AID . Where do the majority of countries go when they need help ? -LRB- AMERICA -RRB- America is a self imposed whipping post for the world . We should just stay to ourselves and let others fend for themselves . January 31 , 2011 at 3:07 pm | Reply The West has values unmatched by any other parts of the continent . The recent decline in those values in the past few years led many to believe that the West Golden Age is over . Neglecting the fact that those values , should they have existed on the other continents are on a much steeper decline . The Western Systems are into a correction mode and will recover , whereas other parts of the world are riding the tides , unaware of such declines . January 31 , 2011 at 3:07 pm | Reply Antonio , what an interesting veiwpoint . How well did that work out in Russia and Cuba and Venuzuela and ... Regarding China , they are more capitalistic than the the US is today -- and so is Russia . January 31 , 2011 at 3:08 pm | Reply I am working together with local people and women in the village of Mfuwe , Zambia aiming at sustainable eco business together instead of charity . A lot of people in Japan and other rich parts of the world want to help Africa very much . What do you think is the best way to work on equal terms beyond aid ? FIrstly for those who still talk about Karl Marx and communism , I suggest that you immediately review your junior high history , communism has never worked , doesnt work and will never work , Reagan was right , the only and most efficient way to lead a society without enslaving its people is through unobstructed capitalism . Those of you that talk about inequality between the west and some countries in Africa and Asia , well that is a sad truth . There is , however , no way in which America is to blame , if you want to blame the west , blame England , who controlled a third of the world ages ago just like the Soviets did . The inequalities are due to geographical position , many people in the west are sending aid over to Africa , if this women has a problem with them not being distributed , then she should get out there and actually do something about it like find her own company to distribute them in a better way . For those people who still believe that America will fall then remember that this country build the world up , why do you think the US is policing the world ? Because no-one else will , if you think that your country is better because you dont have soldiers in Iraq and Afganistan then go ahead . In the minds of the rest of the world you are cowards . Which country will step in if America pulls out and lets countries like Iran and North Korea develop nuclear weapons and then watches as their unstable governments launch them at the rest of the world ? Please `` some other country '' we need you because I think that the US needs a rest . This crisis is a temporary thing , as all crisis this one will pass and then transform into an economic boom , the US produces a quarter of the worlds GDP with three hundred million people while China has less than a tenth with almost two billion -LRB- a third of the worlds population -RRB- , this crisis will show the US government what changes have to be done and those changes will be carried out and the US economy will grow again . I believe that now that the world is split between countries there is little chance that an empire as powerful as the US will fall like Ancient Rome or Ancient Persia . Europe will not fall either , Europe will simply be reduced to a weak group of countries , simply because of their Social Benefits and the inability of its population to work . Europe will fall because its people got used to not having to work . China will never be dominant because the labor is getting more and more expensive and the US companies will pull out , crippling their communist economy . Russia will never build up again because it missed its chance and is crippled by communism . India has most of its power in its non-communist government and the size of its population , but lacks the education and leaders to help it prosper . If non of the above convinced you , then ask yourself this : Why are people from all over the world moving to America in huge numbers , why dont people from Mexico -LRB- Not being stereotypical , just an example -RRB- risking their lives getting into the US even though they know that they will get a poor job because of the stereotype ? Why dont they go to Europe where people get a lot of social benefits ? Because America is not only a country , its an idea and the best prototype of a society . January 31 , 2011 at 4:26 pm | Reply Been here in Beijing for 15 years , while watching a plethora of Africans arrive here for the trade-off : a visa for the African to TRY and find work , or study Mandarin , or buy a few suitcases -LRB- a container or two , if lucky -RRB- full of products to sell back home ; in exchange for China 's insatiable need for resources , and giving their OWN folks employment in construction projects in various African countries . `` The West `` is quite a few decades away from its anathematic past , though an alarming amount of Africans here in Beijing , still speak of the bad western whitey , as they get racism everywhere here -- A case in point -LRB- made the news -RRB- 2-3 years ago there was a police sweep through san Li Tun , and almost ALL black folks were harassed , but very few whites . Question : How much of African wealth will China come to possess ? The West ai n't goin down -LRB- sorry ! -RRB- it is just a re-distribution of wealth thanks to globalization ; capitalism is merely exploiting the previously untapped massive labor forces for manufacturing to maximize trans-national corporations and their majority stockholders , and the upper-classes with significant portfolios that are not effected by fewer and fewer jobs . January 31 , 2011 at 4:28 pm | Reply Africa ... who cares !!! They have nothing to offer the world , none of them have skills to better the world at large ... let them all die ! January 31 , 2011 at 4:31 pm | Reply North Africa is a focal point of future contention and what just happened in Sudan will problably be repeated as the Black population becomes more assertive and throws off the yoke of Islam and Christianity . We are looking at many years of conflict as battle lines harden . China is over the horizon and her population will eventually rise up to overthrow authoritarian . The fracture points of future contention Tibet , Inner Mongolia . In Indonesia the West Papua half of New Guinea is already in conflict similar to what we saw in Timor . The European world influence will wan overtime . Nuclear weapons and the `` shield '' they provide will be with us for eons to come . January 31 , 2011 at 4:42 pm | Reply With the world moving towards being more unified due you think that the nations of the world will be able to come together peacefully and surrender sovereignty in order to form a government for humanity or will such a body be formed through war ? I am American and I hope that our 'em pire ' is indeed over ... as long as the rest of the world is peaceful . For the record , those bashing the West , remember that there have been very few non expansive empires in the world , ancient China is one I believe . If we , the West , had really wanted an Empire , history would be far different . Thank God for the English culture that gave America it 's philosophic outlook of peace . America has fought in wars -LRB- Vietnam , Korea , Iraq , Afganistan -RRB- to be sure , but those were justified at home as necessary for freedom . Even if you do n't believe that is the real reason , the fact that this is the only way that these wars could be sold to the American people says a lot about our culture . I wish Africa luck on finding the same direction . January 31 , 2011 at 4:59 pm | Reply Thank God that such small minded ignorance is only confined to a few . I 'd urge a certain person to pick up a book , but I do n't believe you are of sufficient intelligence to grasp even the most basic concept of ANY subject of ANY book ! January 31 , 2011 at 5:08 pm | Reply The west invented money , we gave gold it 's value -LRB- Alexander the Great -RRB- . I believe ones the west gets stuck by it , we invent something else . Why should we cut ourselves with something we ourselves invented ? European aint suicidal I hope . Because I am one . January 31 , 2011 at 5:12 pm | Reply To J. Parker and EP : what a narrow angle lens !!!! Connecting Marx 's thoughts solely with the likes of Cuba , USSR -LRB- Russia -RRB- is of little sense . Who 's closer to a more efficient , just and happy society : the USA or Sweden , Japan , Germany or Denmark ? Who s the least socialist among those five countries ? To know what works and what does n't , first one must define the judgment criteria . The 10 % richest Americans own 90 % of the country 's wealth . While some sell SIVs , the other part of the team bet against them while everything is supposedly safe through CDSs ! The current American model is bankrupt . To rediscover your path look no further than the fifties and sixties when a CEO made 20 times what an engineer did , not 500 times . Como down to earth . January 31 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | Reply You must have many admirers , and you can add me to them ! I am a teacher in Mexico , and one of my responsibilies is to spend time indoing forward thinking . Before I founded my highschool , I worked wirh UN , World Bank , Harvard Institute for International Development , and others . And I continue to remain abreast of world events . Right now I am hourly connected with events in North Africa which is a very delicate and potentially an `` eplosive cocktail '' ! And I fully agree with you : the center of world power -LRB- political , economic , military -RRB- moves from West to East . The B-2 vs J-20 issue is very telling ! Over the past year I have been studying Islam , which I plan to introduce as a subject in our curricula starting 2012 . I dont think that I have to explain to you why I am doing this ... ! I am also sending brief Capsules -LRB- one or two pages -RRB- on what I am learning . The ignorance around this old and rich culture is mindbogling ! Unfortunately I am writing them in Spanish , otherwise I would share them with you . I am almost certain that sometimes In pursuit of new knowledge and new ways of seeing things you must feel misunderstood and lonely . But keep it up , by all means . I would like to recommend you a book which will interest you . It is called `` Iconoclast : A Neuroscientist Reveals How to Think Differently '' by Gregory Burns . If you have a Kindle ebook , you can get it in 60 seconds . Hi : the first line of my recent comment is NOT of my making . No man\\/woman or country has the answers , South Africa , the land that blood flows for decade apon decade ... and it goes on and on ... sin of the father carried over to the children . Its is like polution ... polution of the earth , culture , etc Wikipedia should put this as the meaning of the word politics : '' Bottom 3 inches of a frence drian '' January 31 , 2011 at 6:32 pm | Reply The west will never fall and as far as China and India are concerned , the overpopulation will kill them both in 2 decades time . In the city of Mumbai . 8 million out of 15 live under extreme poverty whether on the sidewalks or mud tins huts . How the hell are they gonna get rid of this atrocious poverty ? January 31 , 2011 at 6:33 pm | Reply I agree with your assesment of aid from `` The West '' . As a citizen of the west , specifically the US , I 'm quite worried about the state of the economy . Especially given that so many of the things that are being protested are problems here . January 31 , 2011 at 6:57 pm | Reply the West is a different mass than US . Maybe its about time US to realize that is not longer No1 . But its not the end of the world . Europe always had culture and civilization and those along technological advancement are the keys to stay strong . Unfortunately US lacks both culture and civilization . US is going to gain some cultural respect when is going to use the surplus value from capital accumulation to organize a social state . When is going to tax the rich as their income is not product of their work . No I 'm not a Marxist , but most Americans have a misconception as they tend to believe that someone with money , can allocate money efficiently as well . That 's not true because rich people evaluate only according to return and repeatedly -LRB- probably and intentionally -RRB- they leave externalities out of the picture . Americans must grow up and look at the person next to them and not up in the sky . Europe is a different agenda , there is a huge cultural difference between Europe and US which can not be grasped by economic data as it is hard to put a price on cultural `` goods '' . In terms of `` economic imperialism '' the west is in decline , but a `` rich '' society is neither happy nor advanced , neither wealthy nor civilized , it is just rich . And metaphysics about social life are not very helpful . Simplistic notions , as `` rich people are destined to become rich '' or `` do the best you can do and the rest will come '' , are just an indication of how intellectually crippled a society is -LRB- i spoke like master Yoda -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- : -RRB- . January 31 , 2011 at 6:59 pm | Reply Ms Moyo . Congratulations for speaking the difficult truth about African aid . However -- I think you will live to see your pessimism about the West proved wrong . In reality , we are on the brink of a new era . The unrest in Egypt , Tunisia and Iran are the awakening of the information age in those countries . Just like the fax machine was partly responsible for the fall of the Soviet Union , so the internet and satellite TV will be the end of the old Arab plutocracies . The age of robots is upon us -- the age of artificial intelligence is close behind . We are already living in a time when a social network of ordinary people can topple a dictatorship protected by the very best modern technology . Who would have dared predict that a website called facebook would change the world so drastically , and for the better ? We will live to see the whole Earth connected and speaking freely -- human to human -- in the next decade . It is the coming together of the global village -- not as an abstract idea , but a concrete fact . There has never been such an event . There has never been such potential . We are on the brink of a giant leap forwards . January 31 , 2011 at 7:01 pm | Reply The west stopped looking with a long-term perspective and no longer looks beyond this quarter or this year . Westerners became selfish . ' I got mine ' and too bad for anybody else became the prevailing attitude . They even refused to pay for what they used , and borrowed extensively to live high . They lacked leaders to carry on the legacy that had been left to them . They focused on forcing their own ideology instead of helping others in the world meet their needs . So how does her work and insight differ from that of CNN 's own Fareed Zacharai -LRB- spelling . . -RRB- ? I 'm currently finishing his `` post-American world '' which was written when ? I think it was prior to her 's . . And it seems that just from what I understand , she took a lot of the same interpretations that he made and then added the twist which intrigues us all . . That it WILL happen , and that the west will be `` replaced . '' If you 're a fan of this work , please also read the `` post-american world '' and see how they compare . No offense to anyone , but if I could read someones book , write my own and make similar , yet more `` scary '' claims about it that stir up controversy and skyrocket sales to make money , I 'd probably do it myself . Here 's to hoping that 's not the case here . . , because people buy into that stuff hook , line and sinker .

January 31 , 2011 at 7:56 pm | Reply Hello Dambisa Moyo and CNN friends , I would like an answer from Dambisa Moyo on the following questions : - How are going to Improve our world ? - What can we expect from you in 2011 ? I am awaiting Dambisa Moyo s replies . Just from her speeches so for I can see she blames the worlds problems on free markets concepts such as pensions . And less on the idea of the centralization of Communist Government centralization of wealth in which acts like a social security without a pension for employees . I will update as I go I am listening right now , have not read the book yet . However , body language says a lot . Along with that I think the West will not decline if it starts recognizing Communist China as a Communist market place like we did withh the Soviets and start to implelent anti trust laws on Communist SOE 's like we do with big Corporations . Currently our Prosecution of Communist SOE 's is bleak as we have very sympathetic leaders to Mao and Communsit ideas . In which is wrong as it has been proven that the Centralization of weealth causes huge amounts of disparity and then causes pockets of wealth and povery instead of a nice spread in which free enterprises do . Along with that the Centralization of wealth in the government alllows it to be used as an itnernational conquest like the Soverign Wealth funds are being used instead of properly being used to spread out among the people via competition . We can see this as the last world economic crash was primarily due to the centralization of wealth in communist neo mercantalist economics along with inabilities to compete which primary evidence of 90 % of the worlds resources centralized in Communist China shows . I would love to sit down with her and sip her mind . February 17 , 2011 at 7:06 am | Reply Pretty nice post .

Many point to the speech President Obama made to the Muslim world in Cairo in June 2009 . In it , he spoke about Democracy and warned that governments ca n't suppress the rights of the people . So ... almost two years later - these protesters want to know why President Obama is n't putting his money where his mouth is - and openly supporting them . Some in the Middle East are going even farther . The Israeli newspaper Ha-aretz writes that Mr. Obama will be remembered as the president who `` lost '' Egypt , `` and during whose tenure America 's alliances in the Middle East crumbled . '' The piece suggests President Obama has been too cautious - sitting on the fence and neither embracing despised leaders nor preaching for Democracy . But supporters of the administration say that abandoning a key ally in a time of crisis would damage America 's interests in the region . What kind of message would it send to other allies ? Also , others see Egypt as a moderate force in a region of Islamic extremists like Iran . They say Egypt has helped keep peace between Israel and the Arab world . Meanwhile , there are signs that after 30 years , the White House is quietly preparing for a post-Mubarak Egypt . One former Obama official tells the Los Angeles Times that the administration recognizes it has to be `` on the right side of history , '' and that it ca n't try to keep Mubarak in power at all costs . Here s my question to you : What is the U.S. role when it comes to violence and political unrest in the Middle East ? Interested to know which ones made it on air ? There has always been conflict in the Mideast and we will continue to be affected by it as long as we are so dependent on their oil . Our sputnik moment should be making a car that can run on anything but oil . Just think of the peace we could have if we were n't always trying to pacify some oil-rich dictator . To stay out of their business . We have spent billions upon billions of dollars on corrupt governments all over the globe , and for what ? The people of these countries know nothing of our generosity , do n't care about it and end up hating us regardless . The U.S. should be very careful not to choose sides but support a more democratic government that gives the people more rights and freedom than they have now . The U.S. has to walk a fine line when doing this . It is like an outsider getting involved in a family argument . You need to watch what you say and do or the whole family will turn against you . The role of the U.S. in an unstable Middle East is to be `` on the right side of history '' ... These days , being on the right side means giving moral support to a downtrodden populace trying to oust a ruthless dictator , while giving the same dictator financial support to maintain a military for the purpose of putting down his enemies . A brilliant policy really , in its simplicity . Being on both sides of history always guarantees you 'll come out on the right side . It is long past time for us to stop sticking our noses in everyone else 's business . How would we feel if another country interfered in our affairs ? Peter in Tarrytown , New York writes : It is time for the U.S. to fish or cut bait . Either we support democracy , civil and human rights and we oppose dictatorial countries or we do n't . We have the opportunity now to back the citizens of Egypt or look like hypocrites . What do we stand for if we do n't support the citizenry of Egypt now ? Maybe if we had listened to the likes of Rep. Ron Paul , and at least considered a non-interventionist military foreign policy when it came to the role of the US anywhere in the world , we might or might not have been in the position of `` invading '' other countries . I am not not sure if I am a Paul supporter , I am just saying . When it comes to Egypt , we must look at our role in the past and see if it was necessary . It 's funny because I am sitting in a Political Science class right now and we are discussing this very issue . Historically , most of America s foreign policy is dictated by Wall Street , specifically what s in it for us ? If a country has something we need , i.e. oil , gas , cheap labor , real estate for a military base , etc , then the U.S. is there with guns-a-blazin . But if there is little or no financial pay off for our intervention , we just rationalize the unrest by stating it s a `` domestic dispute '' then do nothing aside from offering an obligatory million or two dollars in emergency aid six months down the road . It is n't our affair , and we should not be meddling . January 31 , 2011 at 2:03 pm | Jack : Good question , but no easy answers . The Middle East will have to define itself and not the United States . We will have to protect our friends , and hopifully make new friends down the road . It is in the best interest of the United States ' National Security that Israel is protected from its enemies . Prayer and faith that all will turn out for the better in Egypt and the Middle East . Tough question !!! January 31 , 2011 at 2:05 pm | make sure we do n't allow the suez canal to close . that is probably the target anyway . If that is lost we and all of Europe is a goner . January 31 , 2011 at 2:11 pm | For me , the answer is very simple , we need to stay totally out of it , and any other countries problems . Stop foreign aid to all countries , now , before we are in the same shape as they are . Obama needs to stay here , in the good old U.S.A. and worry about whats going on right here . We , the United States and are corrupt politicians need to stop trying to kiss every countries backside and stop being the police of the world just to gain favor , let some other countries help for a great change , do n't you think ? I really do n't understand how Obama or any of our corrupt politicians can give any advice to any country about what is the right or wrong thing to do , when they do n't have a clue as to how to fix our own problems . The biggest joke of all was Janet Napolitano givng afghanistan advice on border security , what an idiot she is , give me a break . Obam and Napolitano 's idea of border security is just turn your head and look the other way and let the invaders invade , what a joke the both of them are . What do you call 10 politicians jumping off a high cliff , a good start , that 's what ? January 31 , 2011 at 2:11 pm | Jack you guys just do n't get it . You have no role of any kind in the middle east . You are a customer for their oil and an easy money sorce . Except for being an invading military force , that is where your role ends . The second you tell them to do something they do n't want to do you will get told to go pound sand . January 31 , 2011 at 2:13 pm | It is an internal matter , and we should be hands-off . With the anti-American talk already swirling , the U.N not the U.S. needs to be the referee . January 31 , 2011 at 2:33 pm | when is Washington going to understand that the U.S. role in the middle east should be limited to flying out Americans from trouble spots . Ever since World War II our middle east policy has been totally dictated by two things , Israel and Oil . January 31 , 2011 at 2:36 pm | It is long past time for us to stop sticking our noses in everyone else 's business . How would we feel if another country interfered in our affairs ?? January 31 , 2011 at 2:37 pm | To me it should n't be anything at all but with the OIL situation we 'll try once again to buy peace to no avail . We 'll just give them more money , which we have to borrow from China . January 31 , 2011 at 2:38 pm | I think The United States needs to denounce any violence being used by either side . The U.S. should be very careful not to choose sides but support a more democratic gov ' t that gives the people more rights and freedom than they have now . The U.S. has to walk a fine line when doing this . It is like an outsider getting involved in a family argument . You need to watch what you say and do or the whole family will turn against you . January 31 , 2011 at 2:38 pm | Personally , I think they have been acting wisely and diplomatically as a brilliant nation , and will succeed if they continue at the same pace . January 31 , 2011 at 2:38 pm | To stay out of it ! And let the new freedom movement have it 's way . These people want full employment and a democracy ! They want to vote their leaders in , and have a job , what 's wrong with that ? The Suez Canal is n't going to be shut down , that 's income and jobs for Egypt 's people . This whole deal is about employment and what 's fair for all . While these people have `` their '' Revolution , Mubarak 's kid is toughing it out in Vienna ? Life is so tough for some ! January 31 , 2011 at 2:39 pm | Why would we have a role ? It 's not our country and there is no invasion from some other country . If this were happening in the USA do you think some other country is going to stick their nose in our affairs . No they are not . We need to simply watch the situation and keep our mouths shut . January 31 , 2011 at 2:43 pm | untill we get our own house in order we should stay out of it . January 31 , 2011 at 2:45 pm | It 's an internal matter that they need to figure out for themselves . January 31 , 2011 at 2:45 pm | best option for United States is to keep our nose out of it BUT to let the Egyptian military know thru back channels that IF some radical Islamist group like the Muslim Brotherhood ends up in power , that will be the END of ANY American aid money or support for their country . I do n't think that they want to lose the 1.3 BILLION dollars of support that were give the Egyptian military every year . January 31 , 2011 at 2:53 pm | I believe that the United States mst not be involved involved with the internal struggles of other countries . President Woodrow Wilson made this mistake by sending 100,000 US troops to Russia to adid in the counter-revolution against the Communists in 1919 . this led to the Cold War . What happened in Russia was a civil war . We had no business being there . the same is true in Egypt . We should support the activities of UN Peacekeeping Troops who are trained to keep the peace . We got involved in Bosnia , Kosovo and Viet-Nam and look where it got us . United States troops should not be involved in warlike actions unless it is a threat against our national security or is a clear and present danger . As a Viet-Nam Veteran I am speaking on behalf of thousands of veterans who `` Do n't want to study war no more . '' January 31 , 2011 at 2:56 pm | What it is and what it should be are two entirely different things . It is a role where we meddle in everyone s business messing things up everywhere , including here at home . What it should be is to mind our own business and take care of our own problems we have more than enough . January 31 , 2011 at 2:57 pm | Pooh pooh the violence , and try to direct the political unrest so that the protesters understand that the United States is not their enemy . The truth of the matter is that political unrest leads to a power vacuum which can be exploited by Islamic extremists , since they are usually the most tightly organized political organizations and which are willing to say anything to achieve power . We can only hope for the best -LRB- but expect the worst , because that 's what 's happened in both Iran and Lebanon -RRB- . January 31 , 2011 at 2:59 pm | U.S. - Egyptian relations are aimed at maintaining regional stability , improving bilateral relations , continuing military cooperation and sustaining the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty . The United States should remain neutral as Egypt has been it 's own democracy for over 20 years . Other then helping to get U.S. citizens out that want to leave the area through the U.S. Embassy efforts we need to do nothing . Egypt 's problems are their own and unless they ask for assistance from the west we need to stay the hell out of their business . Any interference from the United States would only appear like an oil grab . January 31 , 2011 at 3:05 pm | We have enough headache , and enough problems jack ... we need to stay away and fix our economy ... stay focus on Manufacturing ... strengthening dollar , and stringent immigration ... o.k. . . what nonsense you guys speak ... middle east ... middle east ... are they pumping oil to America ? we liberated Kuwait ... fought for Saudi what did they give ... look at oil , it is going up ... up ... and up ... we need to produce more fuel-efficient automobiles till we do public transportation ... o. k , Again , GM lobby or buy all Cleveland transportation , lobby to cars and oil dependency ... ??? wake up ... January 31 , 2011 at 3:09 pm | To sit off to the side and see what happens . January 31 , 2011 at 3:27 pm | Emphatically , NONE ! Get American citizens out and that is it . Funny how we had such a problem with Iraq having a dictator but not with Egypt . Or how we are not encouraging the citizens to revolt against a government that will not hold elections . Our government refers to him as `` president '' , I do not think that is the opinion of the Egyptian citizens . Perhaps we should all be taking to Facebook and Twitter to remind our government that we do not want to police the world . January 31 , 2011 at 3:30 pm | To try and keep the peace , at all times , during these times as well as peaceful times . January 31 , 2011 at 3:30 pm | None ! We need to get our own house in order before dictating to other governments . Let the Middle East take care of their problems and we can take care of our many , many problems in the mean time . January 31 , 2011 at 3:32 pm | We ned to urge Mubarak to impement changes to benefit the general population . Since it is not clear who is the principal force behind the potsts or what thier objectives are , it hard to formulate any respose . There is already signs of anger towards the U.S. by the people who want Pres. Mubarak out . We do n't need to aggrevate it or get mired down in it . We 've messed around in the Middle East too much too often . The US should be pushing the United Nations to take more leadership in promoting modern , responsible government in these member countries . January 31 , 2011 at 3:48 pm | The U.S role is clearly to protect , preserve and sustain U. S national security interest and economical interest . S also has an obligation to it 's strategic allies like Israel . In addition , the U. S , as does the rest of the global community , has a role in ensuring that the middle east region is one that is conducive for the peaceful existence of all countries in the region . January 31 , 2011 at 3:51 pm | There has always been conflict in the mideast and we will continue to be affected by it as long a we are so dependent on their oil . Our sputnik moment should be making a car that can run on anything but oil . Just think of the peace we could have if we were n't always trying to pacify some oil rich dictator . We could actually speak with our convictions instead of our pocket books . January 31 , 2011 at 3:58 pm | What difference does it make , Jack ? You do n't care what people think . You and your ideological media cronies tolerate different responses based on who occupies the White House . Because the White House is currently occupied by one of your own , any response , no matter how incompetent , will the be correct one in your eyes , and you 'll look for creative ways to defend it . January 31 , 2011 at 4:05 pm | We need to recognize that the voice of the people creates the allies of the future . Benito Juarez , a Mexican hero , used to say ` Respect for the rights of others , is peace . '' The u.s. role is to concoct a million reasons for oil prices to skyrocket , not one ounce of oil has been slowed since the uprising , but the u.s. oil companies and brokerage firms will find a way to sqeeze that extra buck from american pockets . and our do-nothing president will stand by and pretend nothing has happened . too bad , I was his biggest fan . I thinks Egyptions are better off than americans . we just think we are doing better . lou in clearwater January 31 , 2011 at 4:17 pm | Jack , our country 's history suggestion we have rarely been on the side of the main street people . This is principally because we have never learned to appreciative the culturally history of our opponents and its impact on our Strategic interests . It seems our strategic interests are being defined by international corporations . Hence we loose every time . January 31 , 2011 at 4:23 pm | Remo , from beautiful downtown Pflugerville Texas We should let the region decide for themselves . Western Europe and the U.S. have meddled enough and we have the poor results to prove it . January 31 , 2011 at 4:23 pm | The stage was set in 1776 . Opposing democracy and the rights of man is not an option . It 's important to be who you are in this life , in this world . January 31 , 2011 at 4:24 pm | The role of the U.S. is to promote political stability , human rights and democracy in Egypt and in the rest of middle east region . To effectively accomplish this goal , the Obama Administration must support the cause of the Egyptian people and nudge Hosni Mubarak to leave his leadership post and Egypt . The U.S. must foster democratic and economic reforms in Egypt . This requires the U.S. to pull out all of the stops and use all tools of influence neccessary to accomplish this agenda -- i.e. diplomacy and\\/or stopping military aid to Egypt , imposing economic sanctions and encouraging U.N. sanctions . Furthermore , the U.S. can and should also broker , support and oversee free elections in Egypt after Mubarak 's departure . January 31 , 2011 at 4:28 pm | Indeed , has been intteresting to watch the Obama ADM with their finger to the wind giong from supporting he Dictator to `` not knowing what to do '' . The world looks at Obama ADM as weak and indeed that shows worldwide ... partly responsible for what has happened . Reading history alot , I wonder what Reagan , Eishenhauer or Truman would of done ? we can advise the people in these areas but we have to stay out these areas . the people of these areas must chose their own destiny so they can feel that they decided their future . January 31 , 2011 at 4:41 pm | The u.s. needs to stop borrowing money to give israel and egypt billions of dollars . Israel and egypt have budget surpluses and we have deficits . We have homelesness , poverty , foreclosures , expensive health care , expensive college tuition , high energy bills , 70 trillion dollars in unfunded liabilities , high credit card rates , high bank fees , dropping home values , two unnecessary wars , and 16,000 murders per year . Our entire budget is borrowed money which we get from banksters who we bailed out with taxpayer funds . We continue to loan banks trillions of dollars at 0 % interest so they can gamble it away on wall street instead of investing in america . Obama and congress are fiscally insane , and have absolutely no concept of budget reality . Where is the stability in the middle east we were promised when we invaded iraq and afghanistan . It is time for politicians to help main street , instead of helping corporations , banks , wall street and countries who do n't need our help . January 31 , 2011 at 4:52 pm | What is the U.S. role when it comes to violence and political unrest in the Middle East ? Why should the US have any role ? The US should adopt the Muslim act of charity system . 1st you take care of yourself 2nd you take care of your family 3rd you take care of your parents 4th you take care of your siblings 5th you take care of your neighbors 6th you take care of your community -LRB- town , city -RRB- 7th you take care of your nation 8th you take care of other nations If our nation would adopt this charity system we would be doing so much better . If you have money after taking care of yourself then you can share it with other . We do n't have the money to support Israel , Egypt , or any other nation . We need to take care of us first ! This is a tough one . We claim we want to help the citizens of the Middle East establish democratic governments . We support Egypt 's Mubarak who is a dictator but paid by the US at a cost of 1 billion 5 hundred million dollars a year so the US can count on him to support our support of Israel . The Saudis have oil , lots of clean oil and allow us military bases in their country . Great cooperation and compromises will be needed to get us through this point in our relationships in the Mid-East January 31 , 2011 at 4:57 pm | Cliff Glass - Rego Park , New York The only reasonable action that President Obama can take in Egypt is to declare that all military aid will be immediately converted into humanitarian assistance and distributed to the Egyptian people via international organizations , such as the United Nations or the Red Cross . Assisting the people and not military regimes is the best way to ensure Middle East stability . Let the food , water , generators , and blankets be stamped '' made in USA '' instead of the tear gas cannisters and rubber bullets . January 31 , 2011 at 4:59 pm | Ron Paul said it best when he said '' The terrorist are over here because we , our C.I.A is over there . As a country we have innocent blood on our hands . January 31 , 2011 at 5:09 pm | Not to be flip Jack but maybe we should mind our own business unless it ' s clearly a security threat to the United States . I do n't mean we become isolationists . That did not work in the 1930 's when we turned our backs on Europe and the rise of Adolph Hitler . But I think we have spread ourselves way too thin with a presense in just about every part of the world . Let 's work on protecting our borders and making things again . January 31 , 2011 at 5:11 pm | This is the unfortunate by-product of creating alliances with dictatorships . Now the President is caught between a rock and a hard place . What kind of message does it send to other regime 's we are allied with , such as Saudi Arabia , if we jump at an opportunity to overthrow their government ? What we should be doing is pressuring our existing allies to reform or cut ties , and only make future ties with democracies . We ca n't continue to stand for one thing and support the opposite . No wonder we look like hypocrites . We must however keep Egypt form becoming another radical religous country , just like we must keep America from becoming a right wing only , all christian country . I am glad I am not the President . I could do a term in Congress as I have the ability to become an elite jerk overnite too . January 31 , 2011 at 5:16 pm | The impact of social media is undeniable , but whether it 's for good or ill remains to be seen . And therein lies the rub : instant communication , without the `` leavening '' of evaluation and reflection , can bring instant progress ... or instant doom . January 31 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | January 31 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | I know we do seem to think we are the police chiefs of the world and now countries are expecting us to continue on as if we are . BUT we are n't -- we need to MIND our own business ! January 31 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | The United States basically should not stick its nose to other country 's internal affairs . The whole Middle East historically was ruled by Kings and monarchs . Egypt is an ally , but they should resolve their issue in accordance to what is right and best for them . To take side and play a major role not only emboldens some , but it also brings fear and uncertainty to other allies in that part of the world . We have so much problem of our own here , so stick to domestic affairs and leave them alone . January 31 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | We get it , publicly no head of state wants to take a stand one way or the other . Privately , I 'm sure they 're all saying Mubarik is on his way out . Once upon a time we used to have leaders with real guts , now everyone is so concerned with appearance it 's like all the world 's leaders are stuck in a high school mentality . Small wonder more and more people feel the need to take matters into their own hands . Obama has , frankly , been a real disappointment in this situation and I voted for him . Where 's the guy who spoke so passionately about the rights of people during his campaign ? That has to apply to everyone , not just one country , or it means nothing . January 31 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Here s my question to you : What is the U.S. role when it comes to violence and political unrest in the Middle East ? Umm ... to cause more of it ? January 31 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | The U.S. needs to stress the grave concern over the Muslim Brotherhood . We 've already seen Lebanon 's government collapse and Iran is waiting silently . If Egypt does collapse , which it probably will once Mubarak resigns and the Muslim Brotherhood finds a way into Egypt 's new government , this means ALL radical terrorist groups could be one step closer on its ambition to whip Israel off the face of this planet . That whole region of the world will become a war zone . We need to mind our own business . Their culture has completely different values and objectives than ours . We learned nothing from Vietnam . We ca n't continue to meddle in other countrys affairs and when were not successful in ramming democracy down their throats throw money at the failure . Washington needs a mental enema . I feel the U.S. should simply be promoting democracy . Offering resources and finances to help ensure the framework of a monitored national election this year . It would bring organized opponents to the forefront with positions , ideas and mandates and help put some faces to the unrest . It is the most effective method of ensuring real change in Egypt is reflective of the majority of its citizens and avoids leaving any political void . January 31 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | You ca n't keep them down on the Farm , once they 've seen Paris January 31 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | President Obama Did Speak About Democracy In His Speech In Cairo , Egypt Back In 2009 But That Does n't Mean We Should Be In Support Of Removing Anyone From Power ! The Obama Administration Is Handling This Situation The Best Way They Can , It Unethical To Just Send Troops Into The Country And Remove Someone From Power That Is n't Hurting Nobody ! I Think The Best Thing Anyone Can Do Concering This Issue Is To Offer Our Support And Try To Talk Peacefully And Find Ways Together To Fix What 's Broken ! Please Mr , Obama do not put all your money in Mubarak , put all you ' r money in the Eygption people they the one wll stay in the end ... you have to act now before time is all over , they 're looking for a leader jump in and get it , Mubarak all gone it 's the time to act . we going anyway if you do or not . Tucson , AZ -- The US has no good role to play in these events -- remember , Egypt is not our country ! We must have good relations with the governments , but we do not get to choose those governments , and can not , without hypocrisy , support despots in suppressing their own peoples . By emulating England in overthrowing popular governments we did not `` like '' , we have made many enemies around the world , in places where we need to have friends . We screwed this up in Iran -- lets not screw it up in Egypt too . January 31 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | The U.S. on the `` right '' side of Middle Eastern history ? When has this ever happened ? The problem for the U.S. with this particular Egyptian uprising is that Mubarak is not overtly tyrannical like others the U.S. has made it 's foreign policy very clear with . He is , in fact , the worse kind of tyrant , a soft , hidden one depriving his highly educated population of a fair chance at social mobility . Obama , step up , and support the Egyptian people , they are LITERALLY fighting for the words you spoke about in your recent State of the Union . January 31 , 2011 at 5:35 pm | Jack , if America talks the talk of democracy , she must be willing to walk the walk as well . For the past 30 yrs , with 2 Billion dollar taxpayers money annually , American Govt has supported the Dictatorial and Anti-democratic regime in Egypt , Is this a role we the American people should be proud of ? . Our true ally are the Egyptian people who are calling for an end to dictatorship and entrenchment of democracy , and it is their voice we must listen to . January 31 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | The U.S. role in the middle east is simply anything the israeli lobby -LRB- AIPAC -RRB- tells us to do . From the orchestrated financial collapse around the world to the local school board appointments , every thing is being micro-managed to the benefit of the overlords . January 31 , 2011 at 5:41 pm | Jack , the role the U.S. has is to speak softly and carry a big stick , same as it has for years . January 31 , 2011 at 5:42 pm | I wish democracy , freedom , and justice for everyone but why is it that everyone point 's fingers at President Obama when another country has problems ? Not just Egypt who I am praying for but any country or nation . Our country has its own problems and we 're still working on that right now while making steady progress . Bush made a mistake by interfering when we invaded Iraq to take over and look at how that ended . A lot of people expect the US to act as the big brother for other countries out there and take over . I understand that what other countries do can sometimes affect us but what they do is really none of our business to a certain extent . This is between the people of Egypt and their government . Obama is the President of the United States , not the World . January 31 , 2011 at 5:46 pm | Unfortunately , the US always comes to the rescue , whether or not it 's appreciated . We are damned if we do , and damned if we do n't . Logically , we really ca n't do any different than what we 've always done , and that is to help . Obama has already developed a rapport with Mubarik . . they are waiting for us to help . Eithery way and as always , The US loses . January 31 , 2011 at 5:48 pm | I know this one , Jack . The role of the U.S. in an unstable Middle East is to be `` on the right side of history . '' Every politico and pundit worth his or her sound bite says so . These days , being on the right side means giving moral support to a down-trodden populace trying to oust a ruthless dictator , while giving the same dictator financial support to maintain a military for the purpose of putting down his enemies . A brilliant policy really , in its simplicity . Being on both sides of history always guarantees you 'll come out on the right side . January 31 , 2011 at 5:53 pm | It is time for the U.S. to fish or cut bait . Either we support democracy , civil and human rights and we oppose dictatorial countries or we do n't . We have the opportunity now to back the citizens of Egypt or support the citizenry of Egypt now ? January 31 , 2011 at 6:01 pm | Pleaseavknowledge the ongoing talks between the Obama administration and Mubarak , which most likely are suggesting he leave the country . At the same time , the Obama Administration is working with leading members of the opposition to assist in their rise to power . He is serious in his assisting the oppressed . In the end , our president will be embraced by the protestors , as well as most of the world . I would guess , that no matter what the outcome , that conservative Americans will find fault with Obama 's actions . January 31 , 2011 at 6:03 pm | The same as it should be here in the States when it comes to violence and political unrest . If we are truly tired of the bickering in the nations capital . Maybe we should protest and demand our leaders to straighten up and do what 's right for `` We the people '' . If we can spend 1.3 billion on Egypt and not knowing how many other countries . We can surely trim back here and pay off our nations debt for the two wars in the wrong countries and other projects unknown to the tax payer . Before we have even more political unrest . Oh yes , your question , let 's clean up our own country first and put it back into order . January 31 , 2011 at 6:04 pm | We would , of course , all like to have the President come out and speak strongly for the people and the ousting of Mumbarak , but the President has to act responsibly and resist the urge to do so . To do so would be a self-glorifying act , it would make him ` look good ' but would not BE good for anybody . He should not be criticized for not seeking his own glory . He should be praised for working diligently behind the scenes to get the Egyptian people to the democracy they seek with as little violence or risk of a ` crack-down ' as possible . January 31 , 2011 at 6:04 pm | The US is caught in the middle on this one . I say butt out and let things take their course . Obama is doing the right thing . January 31 , 2011 at 6:07 pm | For Obama to talk about a government `` not '' trampling on the rights of its citizens is like Janet Napolitano going to another country to give advice on securing their borders while proclaiming `` our borders are as secure as they have ever been '' . Neither of them walks the talk !! Our borders are still wide open and Obama 's attempt to take away our freedoms such as the internet and guns , says all there is to say !! One scenario bothers me . So Obama says it 's time for Mubarak to go . In response Mubarak mows down the protesters , says to hell with the Israeli peace treaty , and keep your 3 billion dollars . We will get our weapons and aid from Russia and China . Two countries that have no problems dealing with the worst despots on the planet as long as they can make a buck . What do we do then Jack ? Our role in Middle East unrest ? Because of our foreign policy -LRB- and tax dollars , -RRB- the Egyptian people are oppressed . For once , could n't we keep our nose in our own business ? January 31 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | It is the same as it always should be Jack , protect America 's best interests . Make no mistake , due to Obama 's lack of action , our country just got weaker . Where we had a dictator sympathetic to our and Israel 's interests , we will have a dictator rise to power who is sympathetic to Iran 's interest . When a democracy would promote the Muslim Brotherhood to power , who are decidedly anti-western and anti-Israel , it does not benefit us . The whole region is crumbling and I hope people like the idea of paying high energy prices . With Obama 's anti-commonsense domestic energy policies and him sitting idly by and watching more of the world 's oil supply fall into anti-American hands , we are all going to be in a world of hurt . January 31 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | if USA gets involved they blame us , if we do n't they blame us too , ca n't the countries take care of their own government and well being of their own region ? We got enough problems here in USA to take care of , no matter the importance of the conflicts all over the world , we ca n't babysit everyone ! January 31 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | See who wins their election , call and congratulate them . . Same as you would do any other country ? Why is it even a question ? January 31 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | Apparently , President Obama is not only making good on his Cairo Speech w years ago , he also is not making good on his Nobel Peace Prize . It seems that our president is more concerned with the benefactors and Big Oil money that put him into office , than to see the Arab oil company supported dictatorships go down like a house of cards . Can we say Iran , 1952 and 1979 ? January 31 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | There is no right side history on this one . Egypt is a complex situation . Does anyone really beleive that some of the faces , some of the current organizers that we see on TV are not radical muslims from Iran or elsewhere . January 31 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | Mubarak has robbed the youth and future of Egypt through his greed and corruption . The government housing is falling apart and they wo n't fix it because it might take a few pounds out of his pocket . Put him on the talk-show and lecture circuit and I guarantee he 'll consider leaving by the end of the week . January 31 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | Let me ask this : What role should Egypt play when rioters take to our streets in Detroit , or DC or Nashville ? January 31 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | Obama was too quiet on health care reform . He was too quiet on the oil spill . He was too quiet on financial regulatory reform . He was too quiet on the DADT repeal . Quiet is President Obama 's style , Jack . We should stand up for ANY demonstrations that are peacefully demanding Democracy . We are the United States . That 's what we do ! We lost a great opportunity last year to take a greater stand during the Iraninian demonstrations , we should stand up firmly on the side of the demonstrators this time , and not let this opportunity pass us by ... grow a spine President Obama ! January 31 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | Im 14 and am interested in this , i thing that obama should support the protestors fully . And preach democracy to the protestors . In my opinion he is n't doing enough and is embarrassing the U.S.A January 31 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | when the American Media can put this much interest in American democracy and freedoms it would be warranted . . But its kind of hard to spread democracy when the people at home dont have it . . But just like the American media lookin for the Best ratings story . . Not Whats best for America . . So Americans will never be truly free . Keep playin IRAN 'S game . they been working the American Media for years . . Its a shame ... January 31 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | There 's a great divide between what the US role should be and what is being practiced . Right now , the US is looking for a stable and relatively unchanging leadership that 's relatively friendly . We should 've gone about promoting our ideals -- democracy and fair elections -- but we did n't . Now , in the eyes of the Arab people , we are the enemy , and they are certain to vote against us . That 's a risk that the US just does n't seem to want to take , so they continue down the path of old instead of making real changes . January 31 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | What IS the role ? Or what SHOULD it be ? The role of the US Govt and security forces has seldom been on the side of the angels since Reagan in South America and maybe before . It has propped up dictators and embraced oppressors from Egypt to China and back . What it should NOT be doing is giving MONEY to said dictators ! In fact , foreign aid should be suspended everywhere until we recover financially assuming we ever do . What it SHOULD be going is standing for something , standing for democracy , standing for civil rights , standing for individual freedoms . I know diplomacy is a matter of inches and intrigues but we have never become befriended for either our diplomacy or our billions . Perhaps we would do better to simply stand for what we used to believe in -LRB- and most Americans still do -RRB- . January 31 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | It 's time to stop providing support to these ungrateful , terrorist nations . It 's time that the muslim world step up and quit taking handouts and spend some of their oil money . January 31 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | Jack , I see the role of the US in handling this unrest as a of peacekeeping in Egypt , IF the UN requests our intervention . We all know what happened when we went into Iraq without the agreement of the UN . Personally , I 'm getting tired of the world always asking the US to intervene and save them , while at the same time degrading us . Smartest thing this Administration could do ? ... do nothing unless the UN requests it . Bottom line ... we 're screwed either way . January 31 , 2011 at 6:24 pm | Why do we think we are the sole country in the world who should dictate our politics upon foreign states ? Let 's get out of the Middle-East period , including Iraq , Afghanistan , and all other states including any foreign aid for Israel . I am tired of the US trying to police the world , when we can not take care of ourselves . Look at our homeless , our people dying in need of transplants , etc. . Leave the rest of the world alone and take care of trade , econonmy , health , welfare , etc. let 's be honest Jack , regardless of how the president responds to this crisis , he is going to get slammed by someone in the media . His response has been absolutely correct . January 31 , 2011 at 6:24 pm | We started a war in Iraq to establish a democracy there , we need to be consistent . We are either pro democracy in all cases or we should stay the hell out of things that are none of our business !! We have enough political unrest here at home . Maybe we should clean our own house before we tell others how to clean theirs ! January 31 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | The Million dollar question : Walking the thin line between supporting natural pro-Freedom and Islamists totalitarians who 'd like to see another -LRB- Gaza style -RRB- Hamastan , or Iran oppressive regime ... How about some clarity from the W.H. Supporting `` mainstream '' Egyptian Arabs and denouncing the fascist ` Muslim brotherhood ' who was established in the 1920s inspired by European fascism and started its Jihad already against the Brits , and has been the main source of radical Islam , the mastermind of the massacre of 3,000 innocent people by radical Islam -- Khalid Sheikh Mohamed was a `` Muslim brother . '' Simply put the atrive for an all oppressive Sharia dominated Caliphate `` dream . '' January 31 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | A little honesty and integrity by the U.S. would go along way to minimizing unrest and curbing violence in the Middle East . Why do you think there are people who burning old glory and scream death to America . Encouraging real democracy , instead of brutal dictators , would help too ... along with stopping the prosituting of America to the military industrial complex . January 31 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | Our role is to remember we do n't have a vote . It is up to the Egyptian people . This is what we would tell them if they tried to influence the USA . January 31 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | We have no role in this revolt . Every time we pick a side that we think is the democratic force we wind up sorry . Backing the rebels in Cuba gave us Castro . Helping out the Shaw of Iran gained us the Ayatola and his puppet Amanutjob . Sticking our nose into Iraq wound us up with the very strong possibility of fat guy in the black turbin . Stay out of it and set up a relationship with whichever side comes out the winner . January 31 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | The US should assist Egypt toward a more democratic state so that any power transition will go more like the Philippines when Marcos left and not like Iran when the Shah left . How to do that is for the diplomats , not twitter or facebook or the world media -LRB- that 's you , Jack -RRB- . By the way how can it be said that Obama lost Egypt if Mubarak leaves or the power structure changes ? It was n't his to lose . Now if Maine decided to leave the US and become part of Canada ... THAT would be his loss . January 31 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | Let us Note Jack , that POTUS warned against the repercussions of the activities of such regimes as we 've seen in Egypt , how unrest tends do become the ultimate fate for repression . What he infact did not do was threaten governments and peoples with drastic US policy towards them when they did things that were n't favorable . Hello , did you see the inauguration and the new strategy not to lecture of countries ? This is what happens when you make a deal with the devil you know . The US government always seems to support Democracy abroad , but we get squeamish when we think the people may choose a form of government that could be anti-American . It 's just another variation of support for the dictator 's of Iraq , Iran , Saudi Arabia , and on and on ... January 31 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | The U.S. can do what it has long been preaching the world on . We have an opportunity to dramatically improve our image -LRB- and ultimately , our security -RRB- if we will more vocally support the uprising . We had this opportunity in Iran many years ago , and sat on our hands . The result has been plaguing us ever since . We should not pretend that these events will end with Egypt . January 31 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | Whats going on in Egypt , and other places around the world that we the United States always seem to stick our nose into , will happen and we should as Obama is doing , watch and see . The last thing we need is to piss off more of our `` allies '' . Our influence has worn out its welcome . We talk about free society and let the people decide , , well let em decide . Enough Americans have given there life to push our agenda across the globe . Bring em home to protexct our borders , but I suspect that makes too much sense . January 31 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | A democracy is a bottom up process . We can not and should not attempt to impose it . The US is doing exactly what it should do -- working privately with key players to assist in pushing Mumbarak toward a peaceful transition toward a real democracy . The risks are far too great for the President to get ahead of this , he needs to keep doing what he is doing and keep pace with it . I am glad we have a President who does n't risk the fragile peace of the region just so he can look like a hero . January 31 , 2011 at 6:27 pm | President Obama has to do the right moral thing , which is to side on the democratic aspirations of Egyptians ... do Americans know that their government gives $ 1.3 billion a year of taxpayers dollars in military aid to the Mubarak regime ? that should stop first . Stay out of their political business and just try being good trading partners . We live in a world where controlling countries , people , and their resources just will not fly anymore . January 31 , 2011 at 6:28 pm | The role of the US is simple . As reported on CNN we now know that several US Presidents including Ronald Reagan supported President Mubarak knowing in full force he is a Dictator since he NEVER had an opposition party . So the role is simple ; US policy cares about the government politicians they deal with , not the people of the country . What I despise so much is to see our leaders talk about the people of Egypt . Where were they for them for 30 years . Laith F. Gulli , Columbus , Indiana January 31 , 2011 at 6:28 pm | As an Egyptian American , I and many like me see the US as a beacon of freedom and justice . People kill themselves trying to come to this country for the opportunites it provides and freedoms it affords . If the US decides to abandon the plight of the Egyptian people for a better life and future in favor of a dictator then it will have truly lost the souls and minds of freedom seekers around the world . The US should shock and awe the nay sayers and side with the people of Egypt . Other wise Al-Qaida will have a recruiting bonanza . January 31 , 2011 at 6:28 pm | Jack we need to do what the French did and give support to the people . when those crazy Brition 's had the guts to stand up and say no more . You may remember them George Washington , Adams , Jefferson to name a few . The U.S. Government will not suffer from this we the people will and I think if you check American 's are for the freedon of the people . And I am ready to suffer a little for them . Hell oil prices are going up and there is no interruption of the flow , but hey someone has to get rich out of this . What happened to the price control laws ?? I think Our government needs to look into why oil is going up and support the people in their fight for freedom . But I bet they will screw it up again by not doing what is right . January 31 , 2011 at 6:28 pm | I believe that the US should provide the only the influences that we would accept in the same situation . How receptive would the US population be if the United States were in a similar national debate , and Russia or China attempted to influence the outcome ? January 31 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | Anything we do will be wrong . If we do nothing we look weak or indifferent . If we take action we will be seen as taking over the country for aour own purposes and we will be stuck in another quagmire just like we are in Iraq . January 31 , 2011 at 6:30 pm | The US administration has not only to protect our own interests in the Middle East , but also to support and protect our Allies , like Israel ! If we lose these Allies , then we will lose the only door to any potentiial peace in the Middle East . January 31 , 2011 at 6:30 pm | Looking at our history of dealing with the Middle East after WWII , we should stay out of it . Meddling gets us nowhere . We pay for it sooner or later . Recently it took 50 years before we paid for it ... with lives . . It is time that we realize that our actions have consequences . We 're dealing with those consequences now with some in the Middle East mistrustful of us and extremists from there attacking us . Stay on the fence and let those folk govern as they see fit whether it is democratic or not . We may not like it , but we must respect it . January 31 , 2011 at 6:30 pm | The United States and Israel have no business trying to influence another country 's internal affairs . We talk about promoting democracy but the minute a country begins the transition , the US and Israel are the first to raise concerns about who the new leaders of that country will be . January 31 , 2011 at 6:32 pm | If we are asked for help we should do as much as we can . If we are not asked then we should mind our own business unless we are threatened . During the Yom Kippur war Egypt lost 250 tanks , Israel lost 25 . Egypt can not make tanks planes , helicopters or any kind of military equipment . Whoever ends up on top they need us . Jim Parker The U.S. 's role in Middle Eastern politics is right about where it should be . The US should not try to influence the direction in which politics run in the world directly , but the US should be present enough to prevent another dictator from grabbing hold no matter their political alignment . If the US does decide to back a leader who ends up declaring Marshal Law for another three decades , it may not be viewed as the country that lost Egypt , but when another revolt arises , no one wants it to be their fault . Unlike all the `` extremist '' theories you here , Egyptians just want a leader who listens and acts , not someone who will sit around and line his pockets with money and continue to let people suffer . January 31 , 2011 at 6:35 pm | The problem , Jack , is that while we 've been happy with him , most Egyptians are unhappy among other things with Mubarak 's support -LRB- and ours -RRB- of israel . No need here to get into Israel 's treatment of Palestinians . We pushed Mubarak to help our ally and we 're going to suffer for that support in Egypt as elsewhere in the Arab world . January 31 , 2011 at 6:35 pm | The U.S. should have no role in Middle East politics . We have lost all credibility in the region with double standard policies . Isreal can have nukes but Iran 's can not have a civilian nuclear program . The Shah was a dictator so he had to go . Saddam was a dictator who was supported by us in the war with Iran yet when time came this dictator too had to go . Now it 's Mubarak , U.S. supported him for 30 years even though he betrayed his people and all Arab countries . Now it 's time for this dictator to go . Shame on the architects of our foreign policy as we have lost all of our credibility and respect around the world . send in da CIA ... start r back . . if 1 there already . . a usa friendly allie to power January 31 , 2011 at 6:36 pm | Joe Ft Walton Bch Fl Very simple . The US need to tell Mubarak to step down . January 31 , 2011 at 6:39 pm | Don t just stand there , President Obama , stand up for the people of Egypt . Tell the dictator of Egypt to go . Send a message to the world ! Read more at the Internet Free Press . January 31 , 2011 at 6:40 pm | Mr. Cafferty , the USA has a great opportunity to win the hearts and the mind of the Egyptian people in particular and the Arab world in general . The Egyptians have decided to bring Mubarak 's regime downe . This is historical moment of the Egyptians history and is going to be documented , so Mr. Pres. which side you want to be ; whether black or white ! it 's a decison that will affect a nation of 80 million people . What the heck is the right side of history ? Why should we get involved in the way every country is run ? Egypt is a sovereign nation and the way the people and the leaders decide to run it `` Yes '' is our business but not our responsibility . Have we forgotten Iraq so soon ? Whatever US interests need to be safeguarded within the arab world need to be done within diplomatic circles when Jullian Assange is not listening . Couple of things we need to get into our psyche : 1 . Democracy is not the best way of governance for all peoples 2 . The US can not intervene in every country because their leadership or system of governance does not agree with ours . We need to get ourselves together first . We just had one of most uncivilized elections in history ! January 31 , 2011 at 6:49 pm | Anything that President Obama says will only serve the right wing . What a world we live in today . So ... I guess we stay silent . January 31 , 2011 at 6:50 pm | It is very easy for someone to criticize as to why President Obama has not made a decision on supporting either Presidendt Mubarak or the Egyptian people . Many factors to be considered , you can not go in and take over making decisions prematurely . If President Obama would have chosen sides already , he would very likely be criticized for the decision made , as being premature and possibly wrong . It 's one of those cases that you 're damned if you do , and you 're damned if you do n't . Give him a little bit of time , and I am sure that he will make a good decision , and a wise decision . January 31 , 2011 at 6:52 pm | Mubarak has been your ally and had your support for 30 years , you ca n't just turn out on him when everyone is against him ! ... i 've been anti-mubarak since the day i was born , but he still is my president Egypt is his responsibility and not yours ! you ca n't turn against him and force him to step away for he has n't abandoned his country and ran away from his people Egypt belongs to the Egyptians and they so can take care of their country it 's their business not yours and all you can do is STAY OUT OF IT . being on the right side of history is to support the people and you 're already doing a great job using the media , i think that is support enough and you ca n't physically take any actions against either Mubarak nor the People . And i think that Mubarak is leaving he knows that ... he has no intention to stay as the acting president anymore . For the first time in a 30 years he 's assigned a vice president and a whole new government ... kind of telling the people that he is leaving but he 's not going to run away and leave the country to burn with no one in charge ! January 31 , 2011 at 6:53 pm | We have meddled in Egypt for so long now that the Egyptians are looking to us for the support they have earned over these past 30 years . We need to make sure they get a shot at democracy . We should see that Mubarak steps down , and then make sure free and fair elections take place . January 31 , 2011 at 6:55 pm | As a professor of international relations I sum up the issue of promoting democracy simply to my students : the US sees democracy , especially in other countries , as an outcome of the political process , while most states see it as a process itself . If we knew for sure that the Muslim Brotherhood or a similar faction would n't gain power we would be more vocal in supporting the movement . Truth is , democracy will always be second to security and so Mubarak will always be attractive to US foreign policy . January 31 , 2011 at 7:00 pm | Jack Cafferty sounds off hourly on the Situation Room on the stories crossing his radar . Now , you can check in with Jack online to see what he 's thinking and weigh in with your own comments online and on TV . Would you ride in a car that drives itself ? Is she the answer ?

ANDERSON COOPER , CNN ANCHOR : We are live in Cairo where it is 5:00 a.m. on this the 8th day of the uprising in Cairo . What this day holds nobody can tell . And this may be a make or break day for the Mubarak regime . They are calling it a `` Million-Man March '' . That is scheduled -- it is scheduled to start in some four hours from now . How many people will actually show up ? We do n't know . Where they will go , we 're not sure what will happen , we simply ca n't tell . The Mubarak regime is certainly trying to make it as difficult as possible for the protesters to gather , shutting off train service . The last Internet provider ISP has shut down as well . And we anticipate the cell phone service will be cut shortly . The Egyptian military has promised not to harm protesters , but as we saw today in Liberation Square , this situation can turn violent very , very quickly . COOPER : From terror to triumph we still do n't know exactly what occurred in that situation that caused the military troops to fire in the air . In the end the crowd was chanting `` The people and the military are one . '' But take a look at the fear on the face of that Egyptian soldier holding his gun at the protesters ready to shoot . Others finally shot in the air . That is the look of fear , and we -- you rarely get to see that so clearly in the face of one soldier here . The military obviously playing a crucial role and what -- how they react to this protest today may be a turning point , maybe a critical juncture . We 'll talk to Ben Wedeman and others about that and what they anticipate . But I want to tell you a few of the other updates . As we said , cell phone service is likely to be cut here . American civilians are trying to be -- are trying to evacuate as much as possible . As many as thousands of -- a thousands of Americans were evacuated on Monday in special U.S. government charters , that they have to reimburse the U.S. government for . They were sent to -- to sites in Europe . And from there it 's up to them to -- to -- to book their onward travel . U.S. Marines -- a special contingent of U.S. Marines is coming to the United States embassy to secure the embassy here in Cairo ; non - essential diplomatic personnel , their families are also being evacuated here . It is a very tense situation on this the 8th day . The U.S. now has named a special envoy , a former ambassador to Cairo , a retired State Department official who will be meeting with the Mubarak regime . But what that regime decides to do frankly , at this point , is anybody 's guess . I want to show you a little bit of what we saw today in the hours that we spent in Liberation Square . COOPER -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Tense moments today near Liberation Square . Soldiers fire into the air to keep protesters at bay . The threat of violence is constant , but nothing so far has stopped the daily demonstrations for change . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : It 's about 4:00 in the afternoon . The curfew began an hour ago . But still more and more people are arriving here in Liberation Square . They 're incredibly enthusiastic , even though it 's the 7th day of protests . They are determined to keep this going . They 're chanting saying they 're not going to leave this square until -- until Mubarak leaves . -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Young and old , they seem to come from all walks of life , all with the same message for Mubarak . I mean , I do n't know what kind of language do we have to say it to him in , but he 's got to learn that people do n't want him . They have seen what the police forces can do in his name and they will not accept him anymore . COOPER : Overhead a military helicopter circles constantly , a reminder that Mubarak 's government is still in place . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : It 's difficult to get a sense of how large the crowd really is here in Liberation Square . But it does -- you get a feel for it when you actually try to move through . It 's -- it 's actually incredibly crowded . People are just packed wall to wall . There is no central leadership or anything . There 's sort of different groups chanting different slogans , all of them , of course , anti- Mubarak . -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Hour after hour , the chanting continues , many are tired but they refuse to leave . This is just the basic -- basic needs for a -- for any human being . You know , a shelter to live in , you know food , education , medicine . COOPER : That 's what people are wanting here ? But the whole world is afraid that this government is going to turn into the harbor for terrorists . No , this is actually not . We hate terrorists as much as the whole world . COOPER : This is n't about fundamentalism ? The people actually -- they are under poverty level they live in Egypt right now . And it is -- this is the time -- this is the time for some kind of change to happen . Otherwise , we 're never going to be able to change . COOPER : The Islamist group , the Muslim Brotherhood has begun to take part in the protests , but no one group here is calling the shots . We have no problem with Israel . We have peace -- peace agreement . Mubarak tries to let the people think that the Muslim Brother will control the country and will start to be -- making a war . Actually that is not true . We -- COOPER : So if Mubarak leaves you do n't think the Muslim Brotherhood would take over ? We 're not going to allow them . -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Tomorrow a massive protest has been called , the pressure keeps building . The protesters hope something soon has got to give . COOPER : Some of the people on the scenes we saw today in Liberation Square . And as we said , it 's just four hours until this massive protest is planned . I 'm joined now by Ben Wedeman and Ivan Watson here in Cairo . And also in Alexandria , I 'm joined by Nic Robertson who 's there . Ben , what are you anticipating was going to happen today ? BEN WEDEMAN , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , of course the job of anticipating has become very risky here , because this whole protest movement has just sort of popped up in the last week , so it 's very difficult to say . But we know that people are walking to Cairo from the Nile Delta . We know that despite the fact the government has cut the Internet , you ca n't send SMS 's , BlackBerrys do n't work . And in -- within moments we expect the cell phone system to go down . We know that word has passed just by word of mouth , throughout the entire country . So I think we can anticipate a huge demonstration . A million , it could be more , it could be slightly less . But this will be probably the biggest demonstration we 've seen in Cairo yet . COOPER : Are you nervous about it ? WEDEMAN : Of course I 'm nervous . I 'm nervous , because I have a family here . And we 've seen that since this has begun , the security situation in -- in Cairo has deteriorated dramatically . This is one of the safest cities on earth under normal circumstances . But at the moment we see the police , even though they 're back in small numbers , just disappeared . They were pulled out of the country -- out of the city in the morning of Saturday . And basically , security is now in the hands of the army in some areas . But for the most part in Cairo , it 's the job of people in the neighborhood going out with baseball bats , shotguns , whatever they can find because the worry is that this current political uproar is just sending this country down the drain economically . The infrastructure is n't working . COOPER : Now you -- we -- we 've heard from demonstrators that they plan to actually go to the residence of President Mubarak . Is -- is that likely ? WEDEMAN : I know that between the Tahrir Square and the Ipihadia -LRB- ph -RRB- Palace on the eastern edge of this city , there are around 20 army checkpoints . It 's going to be very difficult for them to go , unless simply the army steps aside and says you can go . Otherwise it could be very difficult . We 've heard that one of the targets of the demonstrations is state TV just up the block from here . There you have it surrounded by tanks . They 've now put barriers on the roads . So there is a real anticipation that they could move towards some of these strategic sites . COOPER : Ivan , you were out at the pyramids today , which are close to Giza , I believe which are -- are very close to the city . I just want to show some of that video that you saw . IVAN WATSON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT -LRB- on camera -RRB- : Crews have been deployed around the city , and the tanks are even parked here at one of the ancient wonders of the world the Great Pyramids of Giza . -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : An army officer insisted the pyramids are still open for tourists , but the soldiers would n't let us come any closer . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : This is part of what has Egyptians so scared right now , a number of hotels and cabarets and casinos like this that were torched and looted in the first days of the protests . -LRB- END VIDEO CLIP -RRB- COOPER : It does seem , Ivan , in -- it seems to me that the Egyptian military have kind of clamped down today , in terms of making it more difficult for protesters to get access and journalists to get access . Was that your experience ? WATSON : Yes , they look like they have taken a more -- you could -- could say aggressive posture . And what was really striking is we heard some reports that hey , the -- the police were supposed to be back out on the streets . I saw a handful of traffic cops , really . And instead , what was really striking , was seeing just how much the military had fanned out throughout the city , in force , all the way up until Giza and especially in front of everything from telecommunications buildings , the cell phone buildings to -- to parliament and -- and important , you know , intersections as well apparently trying to fill in some of that law and order vacuum that Ben was just talking about . COOPER : Nic Robertson , you are in Alexandria , which is to the north of where we are in Cairo . There is a march planned there as well . What are you anticipating , what are you hearing about what 's going to happen ? NIC ROBERTSON , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : They say there will be a million people here , they say they 're going to focus on gathering in the Martyr Square -LRB- ph -RRB- , the Martyr Square is also where the main rail station is here . So they already know that if the rail networks are hit and trains ca n't run they 're may -- they 're going to lose people there . And they know they 're going to have a difficult -- they 're going to have difficulty organizing if the cell phones are n't working . So they 've been through that on Friday , and they say that they 're going to push ahead regardless . It 's hard to imagine that they will get a million people in this city . But they know that this is a day where they need to really push up the momentum . And -- and they , unlike Cairo , perhaps , have fewer choices of -- of sort of buildings , government buildings that they can really target that might make a difference in toppling President Mubarak . But -- but regardless , they 're going to gather , they say and -- and keep pushing and keep the men from going -LRB- ph -RRB- . Some people say well , it might be done by Friday and other people are kind of less optimistic about it , they say this may take a whole lot longer -- Anderson . COOPER : Ben how will -- I mean , how much longer can this go on for without something breaking one way or the other ? WEDEMAN : It really ca n't go on much longer , because the economy 's at a standstill . The stock market 's been closed now for two days . Last week it just went through the floor , it crashed . Banks are n't working , universities , schools , the railroad system is n't working , the Internet . I mean , basically , this country has come to a screeching halt . And the feeling is that people within the regime around Mubarak are going to have to calculate that eventually the costs of this shutdown are going to get so high that when they do take over , if they do take over from Mubarak , they 're going to be dealing with a massive mess in this country . So we 're really teetering on the brink of chaos in this country . COOPER : We were talking before we went on the air and you made some really interesting points about how people live here ; that a vast majority of people are living one day to the next . They 're -- they 're working one day in order to earn money for their families that night to eat . And because they are not working and banks are closed , people just do n't have money . WEDEMAN : And basically 40 percent of the population lives on less than $ 2 a day . And what they -- what you earn in the day , you feed your country in the evening -- I mean you 're family in the evening . And so this explains why there has been so much looting , so much ransacking of stores and what-not because people live such a day-to - day existence . COOPER : We 're going to have a lot more with Ben Wedeman , and Ivan Watson , Nic Robertson as well throughout this hour , the best correspondents in the region . We 're going to continue to draw on their expertise . We 're also going to show you the latest on American civilians trying to get out of this country , as I said , more than a thousand evacuated by U.S. charters today . The airport is a -- is a disaster zone right now in terms of trying to get out . It is very difficult for people . We 'll also talk to two Americans who are stranded here right now and hoping to get out in the days ahead . COOPER : It 's easy to find a number of businesses which have been looted in downtown Cairo . This is a Samsung customer service center . This one got broken into on Friday night . There 's been a large group of people came , broke in , tried to take whatever they could . Since then we 've seen these civilian militias , these local neighborhood groups which have popped up on just about every street corner , particularly after curfew , they armed themselves with guns in some cases . But more often than not with knives and clubs and sticks to try to -- not only to protect their homes , but also protect businesses on that street . -LRB- END VIDEO CLIP -RRB- COOPER : In a moment we 're going to talk to two young Americans who have been living here for several months . And are looking to get out or trying to get out in the next couple of days . We 'll tell you about how difficult that is for them . But first , I just want to tell you there are some 50,000 Americans who live and work in Egypt though , the exact number of who are in the country at this point nobody really knows unless they 've registered with the State Department , which most have not . Some 2,400 or so Americans have asked the U.S. State Department -- 2,600 , excuse me -- have asked the U.S. State Department for aid in getting out of the country . Starting today , the American government started flying out voluntary evacuations , families of -- of diplomats , but also tourists and others who are Americans who are living here who wanted to get out . They 've flown out about 900 or so on Monday . They hope to fly out another thousand or so on this day , Tuesday . It 's already Tuesday morning here . I want to check in with Jill Dougherty who has the latest on the evacuation . Jill what 's the scene ? JILL DOUGHERTY , CNN FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT : Well you know , Anderson , really they are using everything that they possibly can to get the word out . That 's the main thing , because of course communications are basically down . They do have a good Web site ; the State Department 's Web site has a lot of information if you can get Internet coverage . They 're also using you know , radio , TV , social media , e-mail , whatever -- whatever is possible . And interestingly , they 're also encouraging people who have relatives who might be outside of the country , outside of Egypt to contact if possible their relatives and help them out and give them some information . One thing that they do point out is , the airport apparently does not have a curfew , but the city does . So they are saying , you know , if there 's a curfew in place then Americans should n't be going across the city to the airport -- Anderson . COOPER : And at this point also , they 're -- they 're now going to be sending U.S. Marines to -- to basically secure the U.S. Embassy here in Cairo as well , correct ? DOUGHERTY : Yes , they 've -- they 've sent a team that 's going in there . They 're pretty heavily armed and they 'll be you know , beefing up what you normally get at the embassy . And then also , Anderson , in terms of beefing up , they 're also beefing up the evacuation for Americans , because there are pockets of Americans throughout the country that might need some help . And so this is what P.J. Crowley , the State Department spokesperson told us today about that . -LRB- BEGIN VIDEO CLIP -RRB- P.J. CROWLEY , SPOKESMAN , STATE DEPARTMENT : Tomorrow we expect to begin to add other destinations . We might have two flights tomorrow going to Frankfurt , but as we also have begun to do -- do surveys around the country . We will , as soon as we can have flights go into Aswan and Luxor in -- in the next day or two , as we 've identified pockets of American citizens in those locations as well . DOUGHERTY : Yes , so they are using charter flights , they actually used a Canadian plane today . U.S. military plane , and eventually they 're hoping , as you said , tomorrow they 're going to be starting out and trying to do at least as well as they did today in getting people out . COOPER : I appreciate that report . We 'll continue to follow that . I want to introduce you to Jessie Sobrino and Tom Traylor , two Americans who have been living here . You guys have been here what , for five or six months ? TOM TRAYLOR , AMERICAN STUCK IN CAIRO : Five months . JESSICA SOBRINO , AMERICAN STUCK IN CAIRO : Yes . COOPER : So at what point did you decide it 's time to get out ? TRAYLOR : For me that decision was made -- you know , normally I 'm pretty comfortable walking around the city just about anywhere . But in the last few days as I 've been out and people have kind of identified me as an American , and there -- they 've -- as an -- as an American they 've been saying , that you know , we 're pretty upset about your -- your country 's position on supporting Mubarak . And the minute that they started being hostile towards me that was like ok , I need to find somewhere else to go . COOPER : Do you feel -- feel that as well ? SOBRINO : I do . For me actually the turning point was about a day before him . Just because I 'm female I could n't go roaming the streets as much as Tom had the opportunity to . So the anti-American friends made me really experience to the same extent , that 's the organization that I work for , I write reports mostly for the upper class businessmen . And given the economy my job 's really -- COOPER : And you live in a neighborhood , how -- how is the security there ? I mean , there 's no police around ? So is there one of those neighborhood watches ? TRAYLOR : Well , you know we are very fortunate because we live in Zamalek , that the building we live in , because there are so many Egyptian families outside of our building at any one time , there could be like 20 to 50 armed men protecting our building . So we 're very fortunate in that respect . I can imagine like being in some other neighborhood without having that and -- and it could be , you know , even with that -- still that presence , we still hear gunfire like every night . COOPER : There 's no doubt there 's a lot of folks at the U.S. State Department working very hard , they 're probably understaffed trying to get people out . But we 're hearing a lot of frustration from Americans who are n't able to contact the U.S. State Department . They put out a statement the other day saying , well contact our Web site . But obviously there 's no Internet service here . How -- how -- what 's your experience been ? Have they -- have you called them ? SOBRINO : I mean I registered upon arriving here at the end of August . And then one of the roommates that we 're staying with called and said , here are the individual are here , here 's our home phone lines , and cell phones have been in and out . We have n't had any direct contact . And everything we 've heard about the State Department has been through the media and not directly from an embassy representative . The most -- the most helpful advice we 've gotten are from friends who are working for the embassy , but not directly from them . COOPER : So are you planning to take a commercial -- because commercial flight are still going but a lot of commercial flights have been canceled or delayed and the airport scene is just a nightmare . I met someone when I flew in , on I guess it was on Sunday , who had been there for 48 hours and still no word . How are you going to try to get out ? TRAYLOR : Well , fortunately for us , because we have a place to live , we 're able to contact our families , and we 're having them get tickets for us . And because we have a place to live , we can kind of hang out for a little bit you know , try to get past the rush of all the tourists getting out . All of the foreign tourists are getting out as well . So we 're able to contact our families , they are getting tickets for us , and then we 're just kind of waiting it out in Zamalek until -- you know , hopefully by the time we leave on Friday and Saturday , it will be a little bit calmer there . COOPER : So you think Saturday you have a flight out ? TRAYLOR : As far as I know right now , on Saturday I have a flight out . Now , whether it happens , as we 're hearing from our friends that are at the airport right now that you -- you know , you could have a flight and the flight could be delayed for 24 or 48 hours . So -- COOPER : So your friends are stuck at the airport ? SOBRINO : My grandmother was there for 36 hours . She actually came to visit me on Thursday and ended up being stuck there for an extended period of time . COOPER : You 're grandmother picked the worst time to visit you . I 'm sure your grandmother loves you very much but -- SOBRINO : She made it to London , though , so that 's good . And my flight 's going out to Paris on Friday afternoon hopefully and we 're going to try and get there about 24 hours in advance . COOPER : What -- what do you want people in the United States to know about what 's happening here from your perspective ? TRAYLOR : I say from my perspective , that the first thing I 'd like people to know , is that for the most part the protesters that I 've encountered , and I 've been out a lot during the day , you know these are individuals who just want their freedom . And a very telling sight for me is that there 's a point where I was in -- I was observing one of the protests last Tuesday . And myself and a couple of other foreigners were maybe a little too close to the front and as people started to run away from the police , some Egyptian men saw us and they surrounded us to protect us from the crowd leader . And I -- I felt most of the time , like that -- that is how the protesters are reacting you know , this is all about them wanting freedom . And so they 've been very , very gracious to me as a foreigner . COOPER : Are you concerned about what may happen today in the hours ahead ? TRAYLOR : Oh yes , absolutely . I mean , you know , we 're hearing from the friends that we have that this is going to be like -- this is going to be a very , very large day . And so you know , this is a day for me that I 'm going to be inside . COOPER : Jessie and Tom , I want to thank you for being with us . I know it 's even a risk coming here . So we do appreciate that , and wish you the best of luck in getting out . COOPER : Thank you very much . When we come back , we 're going to have the conversation I had with Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei today . A former IAEA official , a Nobel Peace Laureate who is here , returned here on Thursday . We 'll talk to him about what he sees the next step being . COOPER -LRB- on camera -RRB- : There 's a much heavier presence of the Egyptian soldiers on the streets in Cairo . And they 're having a little bit of a heavier hand today . They 're blocking off certain traffic routes , and they 're blocking off certain exits and entrances to the Square . So it 's harder and harder to get to the Square . A lot of people say that they are trying to give a show of force or give a sense that they 're -- they 're in control of the situation . COOPER : One of the things that President Hosni Mubarak has done officially and effectively over the last 30 years he 's been in power is , never really allowing significant opposition forces to grow in this country . So if he is removed from power or steps down from power , there 's a real question about who would move in to fill that vacuum ? Would it be the military ? Would some other political figure arise ? Would the Muslim Brotherhood take on a greater role ? And , frankly , no one knows the answers to those questions , but one name that 's become more well-known in the last couple days is Mohamed ElBaradei , who was the former head of the IAEA . That 's may be where you have heard his name , if you 'd heard it all . But he 's lived most of the last three decades outside of Egypt . Even though he 's Egyptian , he 's lived outside of Egypt . So he does n't really have a huge popular base of support in this country . He only returned to this country on Thursday , but his name and -- it has become more well-known , he 's taken on more of a prominent role in the last several days . And there 's talk -- he has said that he 's had talks with the opposition figures and with the protest organizers to try to talk about forming some sort of government of national unity , if and when President Mubarak does leave . I talked to Mohamed ElBaradei earlier on Monday . COOPER : What is happening today ? What are you doing today ? MOHAMED ELBARADEI , OPPOSITION LEADER : Well , what I 'm trying to do today is see the way forward , Anderson , when clearly people are going to continue to demonstrate . There is a large demonstration planned for tomorrow . It might be even bigger Friday if things does not move . I think the number one priority for the people and industry , everywhere right now is for Mr. Mubarak to get a dignified exit . COOPER : There is concern in some quarters -LRB- ph -RRB- in the United States about what comes after Mubarak . What do you say to try to alleviate people 's concerns ? ELBARADEI : I think that there 's friction , frankly in some quarters in the U.S. . One , if democracy were to come here , they might automatically be hostile to -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- and that 's not true at all . You know , we -- peace between democracies is much more durable than peace between dictators . COOPER : How controlled are things right now , in terms of every day knowing what 's going to happen ? ELBARADEI : Nobody knows . I mean , that is also -- COOPER : You do n't even know ? ELBARADEI : I do n't even know . I mean as you can see , Mubarak is keeping mum -LRB- ph -RRB- . Nobody knows what he 's thinking , why is he staying ? As I mentioned yesterday , I think it was Fareed Zakaria , who has an -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- with this . He now for , the sake of the country , should just go . And nobody knows what is -- what the new government is going to look like . People are not accepting just shuffling of people because it 's -- the demand for change is quite different from what -- you know , cosmetic changes . They need a drastic shift . COOPER : Secretary Clinton talked about -- calling for a transition to democracy which they say they 've been calling for , for 30 years . But if you call for 30 years and you 've seen the outcome , things getting from bad to worse , do n't you think there 's something wrong ? And do n't you think that people then will not believe that you believe in your basic values , freedom , democracy , rule of law ? You really have to be -- I mean you can not change things in Egypt , but you have to stand up and make it loud and clear that you are not in fear of a dictator . Mubarak has been supportive of the peace process . Mubarak has been helpful in many regional issues , but they have no reason to believe that a democracy here will not be as supportive of stability . It would be durable stability . COOPER : When you heard that Vice President Biden said he did n't consider Mubarak a dictator , what did you think ? ELBARADEI : Did he say that ? This was days ago . ELBARADEI : I know Joe Biden , I 'll ask him to come here for a day and let us talk . I 'll take him out a day in the street and talk to the people . If he finds one single Egyptian saying that Mubarak is not a ruthless dictator , I 'll be surprised . COOPER : And your message to President Obama is what ? ELBARADEI : My message to President Obama -- I have lots of respect for him , I worked with him in the last year at the IAIA , and I have much admiration for him . But I tell him , you need to review your policy , you need to let go of Mubarak , you need to be -- you should n't be behind the curb . You need to start building confidence with the people and not with the people who are smothering the people . COOPER : Are you concerned that the protesters wo n't be able to maintain , you know , their energy ; that they wo n't continue to come out every day ? ELBARADEI : I do n't think so . I think they 're determined . I have been talking to some of the leaders today . I mean , I think they are not going to let go until they see the back of Mubarak frankly . The earlier he would do that the better , you know , for the country . I -- my fear , Anderson , is that we would have more violence if that was to happen . COOPER : Do you fear a crackdown by Mubarak ? ELBARADEI : I do n't see . I think if they do that that would be a bloody country . People now , as you have seen , they have been empowered . I mean they have been beaten . They are not going to stop short of change of regime , change of Mubarak . COOPER : If there is a transitional government , would you run for President ? ELBARADEI : This is not -- and again , Anderson , this is not my priority at all . At my -- at this stage , all I want to see is Egypt modern , moderate , democratic . And I would be -- I would have achieved the last mission of my life , if you like . I always said if people want me to run , I would not let them down . But that 's not my priority . COOPER : Can you predict what 's going to happen ? I mean , do you have a sense of if Mubarak leaves , when he might do that ? ELBARADEI : I think within the next two weeks things have to be clear . I think within the next two weeks if things are not clear , I am afraid that things will escalate . There 's no , as I said , there 's no going down . COOPER : I 'm joined now by Robin Wright , senior fellow at the Institute for Peace ; also by John King , host of `` JOHN KING , USA '' . John , what are you hearing out of the White House in terms of how they are viewing the situation here ? JOHN KING , CNN HOST , `` JOHN KING , USA '' : Well , on a lot of points , they actually agree with Mr. ElBaradei in that interview . They think the next two weeks are critical . They also think , Anderson , the next 24 hours could be critical . The administration wants him to leave . They 're not saying that quite publicly ; but privately , they want him to leave . They 're conveying that message . They do n't want him to leave in a vacuum , however . They want him to work with his current newly-constituted government . Work with Mr. ElBaradei and other people in the protest community to form some sort of an interim relationship that would then allow a period of time for democratic institution building and democratic elections . But they do believe since -- they believe , number one , Mr. Mubarak is resisting that advice and digging in , and they think tomorrow could be critical . If there are huge numbers of peoples in the streets , how does the army react ? And does the army then go to the President and say , Mr. Mubarak , you need to go ? That could be the key moment . COOPER : And Robin Wright , in terms of a transition to democracy , it is made all the more difficult because as I said , President Mubarak has not allowed there to be democratic institutions in this country ; has not allowed there to be real legitimate opposition groups . ROBIN WRIGHT , SENIOR FELLOW , U.S. INSTITUTE OF PEACE : And that 's such a great deal of uncertainty . And for the Obama administration , that also makes life more difficult . It 's an issue of trying to also create a sense of transition beyond Egypt , in the region generally . You have very nervous allies whether it 's from Saudi Arabia or Israel concerned about what Egypt 's transition might look like and what it might lead to . And what impact it would have , because Egypt , as you know , has been always the intellectual center -- the political trendsetter in the region . And so there 's a lot to think about when it comes to who are the players ? And there are so few out there . There 's a kind of hysteria in Washington about the Muslim Brotherhood , which has so far managed in any election to get no more than 20 percent . It does have a solid 20 percent , but it is not considered , I think among Egyptians , as the obvious alternative . That 's one of the problems . The Muslim Brotherhood does not have the kind of significant support . So who are the players ? All the political parties that have been tolerated over the years have been very small and insignificant in terms of providing the leadership . This is why Egypt is so interesting right now . It 's something entirely different . COOPER : It is very interesting Robin ; and John to Robin 's last point , John , when you 're out with the protesters , they make -- I mean , they bend over backwards to try to explain to me and all of us that the Muslim Brotherhood is only playing a small role in this . And that it is young people who are really the ones in the forefront of these demonstrations . It 's not the Muslim Brotherhood . It 's not Mohamed ElBaradei . It is young people . And even today we were videotaping people praying during one the demonstrations . We had a number of people come up and say you make sure you understand these are just prayers . This is not a sign that we are all Islamists and that this is some sort of fundamentalist demonstration . How real is that fear in the White House , John ? The Muslim Brotherhood is maybe 25 percent , maybe 30 percent if there is an election tomorrow . What they do fear though , is because there are no other democratic institutions , no other political parties have been allowed to form and grow , that if you did this tomorrow , if you did this in two weeks , then what would happen ? Who would step into that vacuum : maybe some radical elements of the Muslim Brotherhood ; maybe some other radical onus -LRB- ph -RRB- ; maybe Iran would try to interfere ; outside forces would try to interfere . Without any democratic institutions beyond President Mubarak , that is the administration 's fear , which is why they hope , Anderson , that President Mubarak will get the message , turn to his Vice President and his military chief and negotiate a transitional government that brings in Mr. ElBaradei , brings in some other people from the demonstrations and then has a several month cooling off period where you organize elections . That 's what they want . They do n't believe at this moment President Mubarak has gotten that message . The President of the United States has called him . The prime minister of the U.K. has called him . Prime Minister Merkel has called him . However , what they would like , but they know they ca n't get is for King Abdullah from Saudi Arabia or King Abdullah in Jordan to deliver that message . But it 's the domino effect Robin just spoke about , that they do n't believe the leaders who know him best , who he trusts most would deliver the `` you need to go '' message because of the domino effect it would have on them . COOPER : Do we know where Mubarak would try to go and live ? Would he try to live in the United States ? Robin knows a bit more about the region than I do . Most people think he would not come to the United States . Would he go to London , where his family is ? Would he go elsewhere in the Middle East ? If that happened , that is a giant if . Make no mistake , if the United States could help privately negotiate a departure for him , they would be happy to do so . COOPER : Robin Wright , I appreciate you being with us . These are heady days here and difficult hours ahead . We 're going to continue to follow it ; John King as well . We 're going to have more live from Cairo . We also just want to give you an update on the massive storm that is hitting the Midwest and also the plans to be heading east . We 'll have that and more from Cairo in just a minute . COOPER : Even though there 's not a large organization controlling these demonstrations , there are people trying to do the best they can . Trying to police order , trying to keep things orderly , make sure this does n't erupt into violence . There are even people who are handing out food , they 're handing out dates like these to the crowd because people spend so much time here they get hungry . COOPER : And that sense of policing the crowds , self-policing is going to be critical in the hours ahead as we anticipate a massive demonstration here in Cairo , also one called for Alexandria . And again these could be critical hours in the few hours ahead . We 're coming up on the 6:00 hour here . The demonstration is anticipated to begin around 9:00 . The rallying point is just a few blocks from where I 'm standing in Liberation Square . We 're going to have complete coverage . Let 's check in though with Isha Sesay who has a `` 360 News and Business Bulletin '' -- Isha . ISHA SESAY , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Thanks Anderson . A federal judge in Florida has ruled President Obama 's health care reform law is unconstitutional . The judge ruled that Congress overstepped its authority in passing the law , because it contains a provision requiring most Americans to buy health insurance by 2014 . The Justice Department says it will appeal the ruling . A California man has been charged with making terrorist threats after allegedly targeting a mosque in Michigan called the Islamic Center of America . Roger Stockholm was arrested in the mosque parking lot allegedly with a large amount of fireworks in his car . He 's being held on bond . Oil prices are spiking amid concerns about the situation in Egypt . The price settled at just over $ 92 per barrel today , the highest close since October 2008 . And a massive winter storm is heading toward the United States with more than 20 states expected to get at least some of it . Meteorologist Chad Myers joins us now with the very latest . Chad , just how bad is it ? CHAD MYERS , AMS METEOROLOGIST : Well , it 's going to get worse . It 's just starting , but it will be all the way -- these warnings all the way from Boston , all the way back down to El Paso , Texas . And if you 're in this , this is the zone of snow . There will be just a slight area of ice below that , south of that , about 50 miles . Some spots could pick up an inch of ice . That will bring down power lines , trees , and the like . That 's what this is . That pink area there , that 's the icing going on . Here comes the snow , Oklahoma City tonight , Tulsa , back up through Springfield and into St. Louis , then Chicago and then finally in to Detroit . It is a big storm . It continues to be a big storm as we move in . But the good news is , it 's a fast storm . This storm will take 36 hours to go from Texas to Massachusetts . If it would be 50 hours or 100 hours the snow would be much deeper . I 'm assuming and expecting that we 're going to see 10 to 20 inches to be the max everywhere here in this dark purple . But there may be some spots higher than that . The problem is not going to be so much the snow , sure obviously 15 inches of snow is a lot . But if you 're south of this line , south of Scranton , south of Pittsburgh , all the way back down even into Louisville and Columbus , Ohio and Indianapolis , that 's the line of ice that could even be more problem than the snow -- Isha . SESAY : Oh dear , weather woes for a lot of people . Chad Myers , we appreciate it . SESAY : Anderson , let me send it back to you in Cairo . It sounds a world away , Isha , from where we are right now . We are -- as I said , we 're about three hours away from this demonstration . I can tell you , I already hear protesters off in the distance , people chanting off in the distance after morning prayers . It 's going to be a very interesting day here to say the least -- potentially a dangerous day , but potentially also a critical day for the future of this country . I hope you stay with our coverage . We 'll also be on the air of course tomorrow night live from Cairo as well with all the developments on Tuesday . When we come back , though our coverage continues ; I want to show you some of the most remarkable moments that we have witnessed over the last 48 hours over this weekend . We 'll be right back . COOPER : Just been checking my Blackberry . It looks like cell phone service is still on here in Cairo , though we have been told to anticipate a shutoff of cell phone service . All Internet connections now are down . The last ISP server went down a short time ago . Also the train service has been cut to Cairo . All efforts by the government to make -- to lessen the impact of this large demonstration , which is anticipated to start in just a few hours ; I can already hear some protesters coming from one area heading toward Liberation Square to join up with a larger group . That 's the staging point just a few blocks in that direction . Again , we 're going to continue to cover it , be up all day and into tomorrow night to bring you the latest information . We want to take a look back at some of the most dramatic moments that we saw today , Monday here , and also some of the most dramatic moments we saw over the weekend . Get -LRB- EXPLETIVE DELETED -RRB- out . What the hell do you want ? The first choice -- Mubarak leaves . The second choice -- we die here . We have no choice . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : We hate this person . He 's a little -LRB- ph -RRB- person . NIC ROBERTSON , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : How do you get the President out of the country ? Because at the moment he sees the demonstration -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : We hate Mubarak . ROBERTSON : This is what we 're seeing that we have n't seen before as well . Look , `` Foreign governments , stop hypocrisy , stand for Egyptians and freedom . '' IVAN WATSON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : This has been an unmistakable show of military force . Fighter jets flying low over Cairo 's Tahrir Square , Liberation Square which has been a symbol of defiance . This country 's economy , its infrastructure has come to a screeching halt . WATSON : Soldiers have been deployed all around the city . And the tanks are even parked here at one of the ancient wonders of the world , the Great Pyramids of Giza . ROBERTSON : Tracer fire flying in the air . The demonstrators say that 's the army firing to warn them to stay away . These people would n't be out on the streets if the government was in control . At the moment , much of the attention is on this , Tahrir Square , the heart of the protest movement . COOPER : Are you scared to be here ? There 's like millions here so what am I scared of ? COOPER : They 're calling for freedom and change and justice . Those are the words you hear a lot . And they 're saying that their demands have n't changed , they want Mubarak out . ElBaradei is like over there with the crowd . Everybody wants to get a look at him . Wants to hear anything he might have to say . What is your message to President Mubarak ? ELBARADEI : He should leave tonight . So certainly there is no indication that the movement is in any way waning , and it seems to be getting stronger by the day . COOPER : All of our correspondents and camera crews and producers and engineers here are working literally around the clock day after day to bring you the best coverage we can . Stay with CNN online and on television for the latest coverage from Egypt . Join us again on 360 tomorrow night at 10:00 p.m. Eastern . I 'll see you then . "}, {"uid": "48", "dct": "2011-01-31", "dates": ["2011-01-21", "2011-09-01"], "text": "You 've selected the U.S. Edition . Would you like to make this your default edition ? YES | NO Radsch , who is writing her dissertation on cyberactivism in Egypt , wrote on her blog that her fingers are crossed that Check his facts and refute them if you can , otherwise , stay out and do n't reduce the collective IQ of this thread . The fact is these people need to be given a chance to decide their own destiny . I believe the ideal of Democracy which we have basically in America . . and I hope that Egyptians are given a chance at real democracy . I doubt there is anyone out there who is does n't want change . It 's just a matter of how much a price we have to pay for it , and quiet a price it may be . I was on the verge of tears seeing people not only turning against each other but pulling out the pavement stones to throw at each other . Watching the flames only a few meters away from the Egyptian museum , all I could think of was that the worst was going to happen . Keep in mind that against the many thousands , maybe millions , protesting on the streets there are many many more that are not . Some of them torn between wanting him to leave now , in 6 months or never . Many do n't even have the luxury of caring . They just want this to end one way or the other so they can get paid , buy food and move on . These people voices are not loud enough to break through the bubble the protesters live in . They have made such an incredible achievement . The brought upon changes that 10 days ago would have seemed like a dream . There were actually many jokes after the uprising in Tunisia about what would it take for something like that to happen here . They would all end with the fact that any one of the disasters we had to go through would have been enough in any other country . But here , all we could do was joke about it . They have made an incredible achievement . We all appreciate that , but after 30 years of having no voice ; they seem to not get enough of their own . I am not pro Mubarak by any means . I think his career may have started decently enough but he has 30 years of mistakes to account for . Omar Suliman is a decent man . Ahmed Shafeek is a decent man with a vision . They both deserve a chance . In Egypt we are political toddlers . For many years we have only known one president , one political party . We coexisted with all the corruption and we were silent about it . We need time for a proper political life to develop . From now till September is a good enough time as ever . I am not pro Mubarak but I want my country back before more damage is done . If it means I have to take him for 6 more months then so be it ! To the powers that be ! There is little to be gained from letting the country fall . There are only a few things that could change the outcome the Egyptians are headed for , and here are a few things that could be done ! Every military has the ability to assist in humanitarian aid ! Have the military set up first aid and medical facility s on the side of the places where the clashes are taking place , one for each side , then set up kitchens or M.A.S.H units on both sides provide food and beverage for all that hunger ! Set up a place on both sides there as well , for the protesters to speak there grievances , allow them to air their problems with out censorship on the government tv ! Assure them they have won their freedom , explain this is as important as any catastrophe , the devastation to the Egyptian people is as important and the change in the government , as any major natural disaster ! How the government changes will be up to the people , but the military can help to defuse the violence , with humanitarian help ! You must be logged in to post a comment .

WOLF BLITZER , CNN ANCHOR : Egypt 's president Hosni Mubarak is certainly feeling the heat right now as new vice president Omar Suleiman said on state television today that Mubarak has asked him to start working immediately on `` real political reform . '' Right after that , the vice president 's office said that talks with opposition parties are already under way . Right now , it 's 1:00 a.m. in Egypt . A Monday scene in Cairo 's Liberation Square may be the calm though before the storm . In just a few hours , massive demonstrations billed as a `` Million-Man '' march are planned across the country . And now we 're learning the Egyptian government is shutting down , get this , shutting down all mobile phone networks in the country ahead of the march . Already , essential supplies are running very , very low . There have been long lines in front of bread shops , food markets , gas stations and banks are closed . ATM machines are in the dark . A lack of security and lack of cash paralyzing the Egyptian capital right now . And the military , the Egyptian military is n't just guarding the streets and strategic locations . Modern weapons are now protecting the very symbols of ancient Egypt . CNN 's Ivan Watson is joining us now live now from Cairo with more . IVAN WATSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Well , Wolf , on this seventh day of protests , the crowd in Cairo 's central Tahrir Square of demonstrators was bigger than Saturday 's crowd , was bigger than Sunday 's crowd , bigger than ever , in fact . Meanwhile , out in the streets of the Egyptian capital , we saw troops , tanks , armored personnel carriers fanning out , a dramatic increase in the amount of troops in the Egyptian in the streets of the city . Take a look at this report . WATSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : One of the world 's most famous landmarks now guarded by army tanks . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : Soldiers have been deployed all around this city , and the tanks are even parked here at one of the ancient wonders of the world , the Great Pyramids of Giza . -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : An army officer insisted the Pyramids are still open for tourists , but the soldiers would n't let us come any closer . On Monday , the troop presence was dramatically increased in Cairo , soldiers trained to defend their country from foreign enemies now taking on the duties of largely absent police -- an effort to restore law and order in a frightened city bearing the scars of several days and nights of unrest . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : This is part of what has Egyptians so scared right now , a number of hotels and cabarets and casinos like this that were torched and looted in the first days of the protests . -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Most of the businesses in town are still closed . With the normal working day cut in half by a curfew that started at 3:00 p.m. , Egyptians had a few short hours to shop for groceries -- among those foraging for food in largely empty streets , this family from Taiwan stranded while on vacation , hoping to catch a flight out of the country on Tuesday . After a week of sweeping historic changes , some Egyptians taking it upon themselves to clean up the debris left by days of protests . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : There is a civic-minded dimension to this protest movement here . We have come to the street , and ordinary people , they 're not being paid to do this . These are volunteers , students , demonstrators who are out cleaning up the streets . Is somebody paying you to clean these streets ? ISRA NASRI , EGYPTIAN PHARMACY STUDENT : No , no , no. . No somebody pay me . No , I 'm just -- I 'm volunteer . I 'm coming -- no , no , no pay , no -- no money , no. . WATSON : And why -- why -- why are you volunteering ? NASRI : Because this my country . I wanted to clean it . WATSON : What is going to happen to your country ? NASRI : I do n't know , but I want it to better . That 's all I want , to be better and to be -- to have a good president . WATSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : After years of fear , these Egyptians are no longer afraid to repeat this simple demand : They want a better government . WATSON : Now , Wolf , thousands of people were in Cairo 's central Tahrir Square this evening . And their demonstration had shifted more to a sit-in . They set up tents . They lit campfires underneath the palm trees . And as you mentioned , the vice president giving a televised address during which he called for dialogue with opposition parties and he said , yes , I agree there are problems , questions that have to be addressed that have been raised by the youth . This has been very much a youth-driven movement so far of street protests . But we are also hearing from an official inside the Information Ministry telling us that the phone , the cellular phone networks are likely to be cut off in the coming hours . The train links have been cut off as well . It does seem like efforts by the government to try to stop or at least reduce the number of people invited to participate in what opposition groups have dubbed tomorrow 's million man march -- Wolf . BLITZER : I just saw your tweet on that , Ivan , that the phone systems , the cellular phone systems , the mobile phone systems in Egypt are about to be shut down to try to stop people from getting involved in that march . But that -- that potentially could have the opposite effect from the Egyptian government 's perspective . It could really embolden those young people especially to go out there , given how sophisticated the Egyptian mobile phone system is right now . WATSON : Well , what we saw was the cellular phone networks were shut down on Friday , and you had running street battles taking place between demonstrators and the police , which have now largely evaporated from the streets . We do n't see them out in uniform anymore , except for a few traffic cops I saw today . And , instead now , the big rallying point has become this central square , Tahrir , or Liberation , Square . And that 's a place where people are gathering . And they 're not communicating via Facebook or Twitter or e-mail . Instead they 're simply handing out flyers , photocopies and that is where you will see posters that have been put up inviting people to participate starting at 10:00 a.m. local time in what has been dubbed a million man match . We will just have to see what 's going to happen later on Tuesday . BLITZER : Ivan , we will stay in touch with you and all of our reporters in Cairo and Alexandria , elsewhere in Egypt . We also have some extraordinary images just coming in showing just how tense the situation on the streets of Cairo is right now . This amateur video that we 're about to show you shows a confrontation between security forces and a gathering crowd . Shots are fired and the threat seems to subside as the crowd starts chanting the people and the army are one . The U.S. has launched around-the-clock efforts to airlift , to evacuate Americans out of Egypt . The State Department now saying it 's evacuated more than 1,000 people today , hopes to evacuate another 1,000 tomorrow . Here 's the State Department 's spokesman , P.J. Crowley . P.J. CROWLEY , U.S. ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR PUBLIC AFFAIRS : Roughly 2,600 people have contacted by a variety of means and registered with us that they wish to leave the country . Obviously , today we 've , kind of , put a pretty good dent in that number , but , obviously , that will -- that will go up -- will fluctuate day to day , as American citizens make their own decisions about whether to stay in Egypt or to -- to leave . And just a reminder , American citizens who have the ability to get out through commercial means are doing so at the same time . So we 're a source of -- of support , but -- but , you know , there are still commercial flights coming in out of Cairo . BLITZER : Scrambling to keep up with the events in Egypt , the Obama administration today brought together a group of outside experts on the Middle East to discuss the situation . Joining us now , one of those experts , Michele Dunne of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace here in Washington . Michele Dunne , thanks very much for coming in . MICHELE DUNNE , CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE : Pleasure . So this was a group of scholars , experts invited to meet with whom at the White House ? DUNNE : To meet with some senior officials to work on Middle East , on democracy issues and also sort of on public affairs . BALDWIN : Did they think they needed some outside experts ; the internal experts were n't enough ? Is that why they brought you and your colleagues in ? DUNNE : Well , not necessarily . But I think they wanted to sort of run through what are the messages that they 're delivering ? How do we think they 're going over ? Do we have suggestions for how they could better articulate the U.S. point of view ? BLITZER : Was there a consensus that emerged in terms of what the U.S. should do next ? DUNNE : I think that the outside participants thought that the administration , you know , has made progress . It 's sort of gone from asking for reform and things that we 're seeing as far too little to stop these demonstrations to now talking about a transition to real democracy and then we saw even later today talking now about the need for the Egyptian government to negotiate with the opposition . -LRB- CROSSTALK -RRB- BLITZER : Because it was only a week ago that the secretary of state was saying that this is a stable government in Egypt and then the vice president saying Mubarak is not a dictator , which seemed to suggest to a lot of outside experts and probably inside experts that they were out of touch . DUNNE : That 's right . Their initial statements I think were sort of far behind the curve . I do n't think the administration wants to be out in front of the curve of events . It has no desire to be steering what 's going on in Egypt but they do want to be seen to responding to what they admit are legitimate demands by the protesters . BLITZER : So let me pick your brain because you 're an expert . You called -- you said months ago that this was likely to happen . I was reading your stuff . And so what should the U.S. be doing , not a week from now or a month from now , but right now ? What should the president of the United States and the secretary of state be doing ? DUNNE : I mean , there are a couple of key questions now . One of the key questions is whether President Mubarak is going to -- is it possible for him to stay on or not ? DUNNE : I think the U.S. administration does not want to be the ones calling publicly for Mubarak to step down . I think they think that 's somewhat unseemly , that the U.S. should n't do that , but there definitely should be high level private contacts going on with Mubarak and with others , notably the Egyptian military about how they see this shaping up and the fact they really need to respond to these protesters and not just take half-measures , for example , as Mubarak did by naming a new cabinet , which did not respond at all really to what the demonstrators are asking for . BLITZER : We 're hearing that the administration has decided to send a former U.S. ambassador to Egypt , Frank Wisner , probably someone you know , many of us know him , to go as a special envoy to Egypt . I assume he 's going to meet with President Mubarak with a special message . Now , President Mubarak knows Frank Wisner very well . He spent a lot of time in Egypt . What do you think that special envoy 's message is going to be ? DUNNE : Well , I do n't know what the message is going to be , but the message itself is very important . Ambassador Wisner is someone who was a close friend of President Mubarak , someone trusted and liked by Mubarak and the others that he will be meeting with . So that 's good . He 's a reassuring presence in that respect . He 's also someone who could deliver a tough message if he 's given one to deliver . BLITZER : Yes , and he 's been very involved in Egyptian affairs over these years since retiring from the State Department as the ambassador . I know he 's on the board of American University of Cairo as well . So we will see what happens . We will follow that . Michele , thanks very much for coming in . ANNOUNCER : This is CNN breaking news . BLITZER : All right , we 're going to get back to what 's happening in Egypt in a moment . But there 's a major development happening at the White House right now . Dan Lothian is working the story . And , Dan , it involves the U.S. ambassador to China . Tell our viewers what you have learned . DAN LOTHIAN , CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT : That 's right . Ambassador Huntsman we are told here by two senior administration officials that he will be stepping down . A hand-delivered resignation letter was sent to Mr. Obama today . It takes effect on April 30 . Now , he has played a critical role in this relationship that the United States is forging with China . And you might recall when President Hu was here at the White House during that press conference , a reporter asked Mr. Obama about the prospects of Mr. Huntsman running against him and as a Republican candidate in 2012 . Mr. Obama joked that I 'm sure he will be very successful in whatever his endeavors he chooses in the future . The president went on to say -- quote -- `` I 'm sure that having him work with me so well will be a great asset in any Republican primary . '' Robert Gibbs said that it was well-known within the White House that he would be stepping down at the early part of this year . And he said ever since that became known that they have been looking at who would replace him . So far , though , no word on that , Wolf . BLITZER : Jon Huntsman , as you say , the former governor of Utah , maybe a future Republican presidential candidate himself deciding to step down . A good time for him he believes to do so . All right , Dan , thanks very much . Someone else is closely watching the situation in Egypt right now . We 're talking about Bradley Manning . He 's the U.S. soldier accused of leaking the WikiLeaks cables . Wait until you hear the link he 's now making between himself and the uprising in Egypt . And another big story in the U.S. today . A federal judge knocks down a key part of the health care reform law . So what does it really mean ? Our own senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin is standing by . BLITZER : The situation in Egypt certainly on Jack Cafferty 's mind . Jack is here with `` The Cafferty File '' -- Jack . JACK CAFFERTY , CNN ANCHOR : With Egyptian protesters hitting the streets for a week now , there 's a growing sense of frustration at the lack of response from the United States . Many point to that speech that President Obama made to the world in Cairo in June of 2009 . At that time , he spoke about democracy and he warned that governments can not suppress the rights of the people . So almost two years later , these protesters would like to know why President Obama 's not putting his money where his mouth is and openly supporting them . It 's a reasonable question . Some in the Middle East are going even farther . The Israeli newspaper `` Haaretz '' writes that Mr. Obama will be remembered as -- quote -- `` the president who lost Egypt and during whose tenure America 's alliances in the Middle East crumbled '' -- unquote . The piece suggests President Obama 's been too cautious , sitting on the pence and neither embracing the despised leaders nor preaching for democracy . But supporters of the administration say that abandoning a key ally in a time of crisis would damage America 's interests in that region . What kind of message would it send to our other allies in the Middle East ? Also , others see Egypt as a moderate force in a region of Islamic extremists like Iran and they say Egypt has helped keep peace between Israel and the Arab world . Meanwhile , there are signs that after 30 years , the White House is quietly preparing for a post-Mubarak Egypt . One former official told `` The Los Angeles Times '' the administration recognizes it has to be on the right side of history , and that it ca n't try to keep Mubarak in power at all costs . So here 's the question : What is the role of the United States when it comes to violence and political unrest in the Middle East ? Post a comment on my blog -- Wolf . BLITZER : Jack , thank you . President Obama 's sweeping health care reform law took a big legal blow today . And the battle looks like it could all the way to the Supreme Court . A second federal judge has ruled that key parts of the measure are , in fact , unconstitutional . Let 's bring in our senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin in New York . It 's a serious setback for the Obama administration although the Justice Department says it will appeal . JEFFREY TOOBIN , CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST : And , Wolf , what makes this decision even worse than the last one is , the one in Virginia that struck down part of the law , is this judge , Roger Vinson in Florida , said as a result of the individual mandate , the part of the law that says everyone has to buy health insurance , because he says that 's unconstitutional , he says the whole law has to go out the window . So he has declared the entire law unconstitutional , everything about preexisting conditions , people staying on their -- kids staying on their parents ' health care plans until 26 , unconstitutional . All of that is out the window if this ruling stands . BLITZER : Well , it 's going to take a long time before it reaches the United States Supreme Court . Let 's say it takes six months or a year . What happens in between ? TOOBIN : Well , that seems to be up for debate at this moment . The White House held a conference call earlier this afternoon . And they said nothing changes . The law remains in effect pending the appeal . But in the judge 's opinion , he says that he believes that the administration will not implement the law . So I think the Justice Department is going to have to go back to this judge or certainly to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals to get some clarification about what happens right now . But certainly , the main point is that the United States Supreme Court is going to have to address this law sooner rather than later . BLITZER : And it will probably be obviously a split decision at the Supreme Court . We can be sure of that . All right , Jeffrey , thanks very much . A monster storm now barreling across account United States . It has Chicago squarely in its sights . That 's not all . Three-quarters of the country could get pounded by snow , sleet and ice . And Egypt , home of the Pyramids , looters have damaged and made off with priceless treasures already . So what are they eyeing next ? BLITZER : The chaos in Egypt , it 's not just in Cairo . Alexandria also a hotbed of unrest . Why lots of people are deeply worried about Egypt 's border with Gaza right now as well . And why is Bradley Manning , the man accused of leaking all the WikiLeaks cables , watching the situation in Egypt so closely ? A close friend of his talks to CNN . BLITZER : Hundreds of American citizens have started to make it out of Egypt . The U.S. has begun around the clock evacuations . And officials are hoping to fly some 2,000 people to safety by this time tomorrow . Official video today shows President Mubarak meeting with his new cabinet , but there 's speculation on his whereabouts . Some suggesting he 's in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh reportedly convinced that he 's taken refuge , at least some people say , there . We do n't know , though . Egypt 's chaos is certainly not confined to Cairo . Security forces are on the streets of Alexandria , the second largest city in the country , one of two locations where the so-called million man protest movement is being organized for tomorrow . Those massive demonstrations are planned only for -- planned to begin in just hours from now . Let 's go live to our senior international correspondent , Nic Robertson . He 's in Alexandria . He 's joining us with more . NIC ROBERTSON , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , Wolf , the latest here is that we 're seeing the army patrolling the streets more than they have done over the past couple of evenings . It 's not clear what they 're looking for . We know that the government is trying to head off this million man march by closing down the phone networks here as they did on Friday to try and thwart the big protests on Friday . And the thing that we 're seeing in this city that the demonstrators are doing differently that make it more difficult to control them is they have protests in different parts of the city . It almost does n't matter which area , which neighborhood you go into . You will find a protest marching down a street in one direction , then another . Also gathered in the central Liberation Square , Martyrs Square in here the center of the city . That square is right at the end of the rail network . And there are rumors as well the railway system will be shut down tomorrow as well to try and stop people getting into that protest . But it seems that the army here is stepping up their efforts to have a better idea of what 's going on in the city where and when -- Wolf . BLITZER : Based on your eyewitness account , Nic , have you seen a shift in the relationship between the protesters in Alexandria and the Egyptian military ? Forget about the police right now . We 're talking about the army . Has there been a change over the past 24 hours ? ROBERTSON : You know , we saw the army here just drive past this hotel about maybe eight or nine hours ago shooting a heavy caliber machine gun in the air , trying to scare protesters away from the square behind me here . We have n't seen that before . That was the first evidence we 've seen where the army appeared to sort of challenge the protesters on the ground , firing in the air , not firing at them . And it had the desired job of chasing them away . We had n't seen that 'til now . But when you talk to the people , they see the army in two very clear ways . The soldiers , the low-ranking soldiers , they say , `` Those soldiers are on our side . '' And we 've seen it ourselves . They 're much more friendly to the people . It 's the officers , the senior officers that people here think are still loyal to President Mubarak . And they have concerns that ... BLITZER : All right . Looks like we just lost that satellite connection with Nic . But we 'll be in touch with him . The Mubarak regime certainly has cooperated with the Israelis and the United States to keep the peace . Egypt is counted on to keep weapons out of Gaza , which is controlled by Hamas . Hamas viewed by the U.S. government and the Israeli government as a terror organization . Egypt says it has blocked dozens of border tunnels . Take a look at these . They 're big enough to actually smuggle livestock . But Israel says weapons and rocket parts still reach Gaza . And what happens if Egypt just stops policing its border ? Three years ago when Israel responded to rocket fire by sealing off Gaza , Palestinians blew holes in the Egyptian border fence . Thousands of desperate people poured across while Egyptian guards simply watched . Of all of Egypt 's neighbors , Israel certainly must be watching with the most concern right now . After several wars , Egypt became the first Arab nation to make peace with Israel . That was back in 1979 , and that peace has held ever since . But Israelis right now are deeply worried about what happens next . Let 's go to Jerusalem . CNN 's Fionnuala Sweeney is joining us live . Fionnuala , the prime minister of Israel , Benjamin Netanyahu spoke out today . What did he say ? FIONNUALA SWEENEY , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Well , it was the first time that a government official had gone on camera and publicly made a statement . He did speak yesterday at a cabinet meeting , but he elaborated somewhat today after a meeting with the German chancellor , Angela Merkel . And he said that how Egypt handles this situation would have an impact on the security of Israel . And then he went on to draw a comparison with the revolution in Iran and said that the situation was extremely dynamic and fluid , and that led him on to directly compare what is happening in Egypt with what happened in Tehran in 1979 . BENJAMIN NETANYAHU , ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER -LRB- through translator -RRB- : What may develop and in fact has already developed in a number of countries , including Iran itself , is that they have oppressive regimes in the form of extremist Islam , and they certainly are suppressing human rights and trampling them into the dust . And they 're not allowing any democracy whatsoever , no freedom , no rights whatsoever . And these regimes also constitute a danger to peace and stability of all civilized people . -LRB- END VIDEO CLIP -RRB- SWEENEY : Well , the Israeli prime minister refusing to comment on his preference for any potential post-Mubarak situation in Egypt but essentially saying that Israel was watching the situation extremely closely and urging Egypt to open dialogue with the protesters and to allow them freedom of expression -- Wolf . BLITZER : I know the Israelis have a very good relationship with the new vice president of Egypt , Omar Suleiman . Do they want Mubarak to step down and hand over power , the Israelis ? SWEENEY : Well , Israel , of course , would be in favor of democracy . But in terms of Hosni Mubarak , he has kept the peace for Israel , particularly around Gaza , by patrolling it very securely and doing a lot of work as far as the Israelis have been concerned . So Wolf , it is a situation for Israel , better the devil you know . But Benjamin Netanyahu explicitly saying he would n't go into any possible post-Mubarak situation but said that , because the situation was so dynamic and so fluid , that his fear was that if change happened too quickly without the structures in place for democracy , that that could have an impact on Israel 's security . BLITZER : All right Fionnuala , thanks . Fionnuala Sweeney reporting for us from Jerusalem . The army soldier suspected of telling all to WikiLeaks gets just one hour of television a day in a detention center . Guess what he 's watching ? We 'll give you a clue , it 's Egypt . And thousands of tourists flee Egypt amid all the chaos going on . The ancient treasures that lured them there in the first place may now be in danger . BLITZER : Now , a fascinating link to tell you about . We 're learning that the U.S. army private suspected of divulging top-secret information to WikiLeaks believes he may be responsible for the protests and the unrest we 're seeing in Egypt right now . And apparently , he 's happy about it . Our Pentagon correspondent Chris Lawrence is joining us now with details . I 'm not sure it was exactly top secret , but it was secret information that he was providing , allegedly , to WikiLeaks . What 's going on here , Chris ? CHRIS LAWRENCE , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Wolf , we know that these WikiLeaks cables were read in Egypt . You know , they concerned Egypt , went into detail about some of the messages that were being passed between the U.S. and Egyptian governments . And Private Manning , as you mentioned , you know , he has not been convicted of anything . But he has been charged . And one of his friends visited him in his detention center in the brig in Quantico and says that Manning has been using his one hour a day that he 's allowed to watch TV to keep very close tabs on what he can on what 's going on in Egypt . DAVID HOUSE , MT RESEARCHER , FRIEND OF MANNING : That was yesterday talking to Bradley Manning . We talked for 21\\/2 hours . And Tunisia and Egypt were a very large part of our conversation . LAWRENCE : You got a sense that he felt a real connection to what is going on there ? HOUSE : Talking to Bradley Manning , yes . Events happening today in Egypt are exactly in line with what he views the Internet as a powerful force for , and that is a force for good , a force for democracy . He views the power of social media as a force that can unite people and allow them to rapidly organize and to actually outsmart tyrannical regimes . This is one reason he believed why the Egyptian government had unplugged the Internet in Egypt , in order to prevent this young educated class of people from rapidly organizing . LAWRENCE : And again , some of these leaked cables show that behind the scenes the U.S. State Department was supporting a pro- democracy activist there in Egypt , pushing for the release of some of the dissidents who were being imprisoned . So you know , all of this was read in Egypt and looked at as a sign possibly of what support maybe they could expect from the United States government . BLITZER : Interesting stuff . All right , Chris , thank you . A King Tut statue is smashed into pieces and tossed on the ground . Looters vandalize and steal some of Egypt 's priceless artifacts dating back thousands of years . And now Egypt 's army is stepping in to protect what some call the greatest open-air museum in the world . And military propaganda from China or an all-too-familiar movie moment . BLITZER : Some of the world 's most priceless treasures now facing danger in Egypt . Looters have already damaged a statue of King Tut and carted off ancient artifacts in the unrest boiling over in the country . Now many of Egypt 's museums are frightened that they could be targeted next . Let 's go to CNN 's Mary Snow . She 's working the story for us . What do you know , Mary ? MARY SNOW , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Wolf , Egypt 's Supreme Council of Antiquities said that the country 's major archaeological sites , monuments and museums are now being protected by the army . But there 's still a lot of concern . Zahi Hawas -LRB- ph -RRB- , the top antiquities official , wrote in a blog this weekend , quote , `` My heart is broken and my blood is boiling '' after reporting ten looters got into the Cairo museum . He and many others are hoping that national pride will protect priceless artifacts . SNOW -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Soldiers stand guard outside the Egyptian museum in Cairo , home to thousands of historical treasures . But it has n't quelled concerns after looters entered the museum on Friday night . Thomas Campbell is director of the New York Metropolitan Museum , which has close ties to Egypt . THOMAS CAMPBELL , DIRECTOR , METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART : Anyone who 's had the privilege of visiting the museum will recognize it 's one of the most significant collections in the world . So seeing damage to these artifacts is deeply troubling . SNOW : For many , the images were a flashback to artifacts destroyed in Iraq in 2003 . CAMPBELL : I think that 's the thought that went through everyone 's mind . SNOW : But Campbell says the situation appears to be different than what happened in Iraq . In Cairo , the antiquities chief reported over the weekend , the museum was safe and that the damage was linked to a group of criminals apparently looking for gold . Then came images of civilians guarding the museum along with the military . Egyptologists like Bob Brier , who says he 's visited the museum more than 100 times , are now trying to assess the damage . BOB BRIER , EGYPTOLOGIST : It 's not just abstract objects . We know these pieces . You know , we 've stood in front of the cases and talked about them to our students , and now to see them lying on a floor smashed , it 's horrible . SNOW : Of the items is damaged , Egypt 's antiquities chief says looters broke 13 glass showcases . Among the artifacts damaged is a statue from King Tutankhamun 's tomb dating back more than 3,000 years . -LRB- on camera -RRB- What are we looking at here ? BRIER : I 'm pretty sure I think I know what this is . This is another Tutankhamun object . It 's a panther . The panther is over here . This is the big base that it was on , and standing striding on top of the panther was Tutankhamun , showing his power ; he 's controlling the panther . SNOW : Despite fears for the safety of other museums and archeological sites throughout Egypt , there is hope in seeing images of civilians protecting these treasures . CAMPBELL : It 's extremely moving , and it symbolizes the great value that the Egyptian population place on their -- on their cultural heritage . They are the guardians of a heritage that is significant for the world . SNOW : As you can imagine , Egyptologists are expressing concern about what 's to come in the next few days , especially at monuments , archaeological sites that are outside Cairo -- Wolf . BLITZER : All right , Mary , thanks very much . Let 's hope for the best . Let 's talk to two women who are just back in the United States . They had been in Egypt . Marian Gergis and Mikaela Anderson are joining us . They just landed at JFK . Marian , how hard was it to get out of Egypt during these tumultuous days ? Marian , can you hear me ? MARIAN GERGIS , TOURIST : I mean , me and Mikaela were pretty lucky , because we went part of a tour group so once we -- yes , I can hear you . GERGIS : Can you hear us ? BLITZER : Yes , we hear you fine , but go ahead . Tell us how hard it was to get out . Once we got to the airport , I mean , it was crazy . People were on the floor sleeping . People were on the line , just trying to get through and buy tickets just to get out of Cairo . But Mikaela and I were actually pretty lucky , because we came part of , like , a tour group . So they kind of just , you know , brought us in , and we checked in . Took us about , what , two hours to check in maybe ? GERGIS : About two hours to check in . ANDERSON : Anyone who was n't in a tour group really had a difficult time , though ; not getting through . And we heard that our flight was one of the only flights flying out of the airport . So we 're not sure how true that is . But we got very lucky to get out . BLITZER : And Mikaela , did you see any of the demonstrators , the protesters while you were there ? I know you were in Cairo and then you went to Luxor . What did you see ? Well , when we were flying back to Cairo to , you know , take part of our tour , we got trapped at the airport , because they were having curfews . So we were stuck there till about 2 in the morning . Then they had to transfer us to a different hotel , because we were staying at Safir , I believe , Hotel about two blocks from the museum . So we lucked out . We were n't in the middle of it , but we stayed at the Radisson Blue instead . And there were some locals out there that were standing guard with , you know , large sticks , metal rods , bats , blockading the streets . Just , we -- you know , they were taking precautions , thinking they might do damage . So they kept everyone in hotel rooms , telling us not to leave . But it appeared they were just protecting their property from anyone who might be looting . BLITZER : Well , we 're happy you guys are back . I 'm sure your families are a lot happier than we are . Thanks for coming in , Marian Gergis and Mikaela Anderson . Should the U.S. take a more active role in what 's happening in Egypt and the Middle East ? You 're telling what you think to Jack Cafferty . `` The Cafferty File '' coming up . And China shows off its military might . Why is it more like the scene from a Hollywood blockbuster , literally ? BLITZER : Let 's get right back to Jack for `` The Cafferty File '' -- Jack . JACK CAFFERTY , CNN ANCHOR : The question this hour , Wolf , is : `` What is the U.S. role when it comes to violence and political unrest in the Middle East ? '' Lou writes , `` There 's always been conflict in the Mideast . We will continue to be affected by it as long as we are so dependent on their oil . Our Sputnik moment should be making a car that can run on anything but oil . Think of the peace we could have if we were n't always trying to pacify some oil-rich dictator . '' Pete in Georgia says , `` To stay out of their business . We 've spent billions and billions of dollars on corrupt governments all over the world , and for what ? The people of these countries know nothing of our generosity , do n't care about it , and in the end up , they wind up hating us , regardless . '' P. in Pennsylvania writes : `` The U.S. should be very careful not to choose sides but support a more democratic government that gives the people more rights and freedom than they have now . The U.S. has to walk a fine line when doing this . It 's sort of like an outsider getting involved in a family argument . You have to watch what you say or do or the whole family 's likely to turn against you . '' J.D. writes , `` The role of the U.S. is -- in an unstable Middle East is to be the right side of history . These days being on the right side of history means giving moral support to a down-trodden populace , trying to oust a ruthless dictator , while at the same time , giving that dictator financial support to maintain a military for the purpose of putting down his enemies . It 's a brilliant policy , really , in its simplicity . Being on both sides of history always guarantees that you 'll come out on the right side . '' Kathy writes , `` It 's long past time for us to stop sticking our noses into everyone else 's business . How would we feel if another country tried to interfere in our affairs ? '' Peter in Terrytown , New York , sums it up this way . `` It 's time for the U.S. to fish or cut bait . Either we support democracy , civil and human rights , and we oppose dictatorial countries , or we do n't . We have the opportunity now to back the citizens of Egypt or look like hypocrites . What do we stand for if we do n't support the citizenry of Egypt now ? '' BLITZER : I think a whole bunch of leaders in the Middle East are pretty nervous right now , seeing what 's -- what 's happened in Tunisia , what looks like could happen in Egypt . If you 're a leader of one of those countries , you 're getting a little antsy . CAFFERTY : Well , there 's some stirrings , apparently , in Jordan , correct ? CAFFERTY : And little noises being made here and there . And yes , I mean , these are all a bunch of iron-fisted folks who do n't allow their people a whole lot of room to do much of anything . And if they see Mubarak go , what is it , the old Shakespeare line : `` He who wears the crown sleeps uneasily at night '' ? I butchered that pretty good , but it 's something like that . BLITZER : Something like that . Jack , I 'll see you tomorrow . BLITZER : We have some very sad news to share with our viewers tonight . A really beloved and talented cameraman and a good friend of ours , Jerry Thompson , died over the weekend after a battle with brain cancer . He worked here at CNN for more than 25 years , covering some of our most important stories . Many of the viewers may not know his name but have literally watched history from Jerry 's shoulder . He was a quiet pro who was always determined to get it right . Through his gifted eye and steady hand , he took beautiful pictures and was a key part in many of the news events that we 've covered . He leaves behind his loving wife , Inez , and their three sons . Our hearts and prayers go out to Jerry Thompson 's family . We will miss him . BLITZER : Here 's a look at today 's `` Hot Shots . '' In Guatemala , indigenous people take part in a Mayan ritual to commemorate their civil war . If Kazakhstan , assistants prepare for an awards ceremony at the Asian Winter Games . In Paraguay , a cowboy rides a bull during a traditional festival . And outside of a mall in Beijing , a little girl stands next to a statue representing the year of the rabbit . `` Hot Shots , '' pictures worth a thousand words . Chinese propaganda or a `` Top Gun '' movie moment ? CNN 's Jeanne Moos has this `` Most Unusual '' blast from the past . JEANNE MOOS , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Take off those sunglasses , Tom Cruise , and look where you may have ended up . China 's state television , CCTV , was showing a training drill . Chinese fighter planes doing maneuvers . But someone online noticed that missile strike looked awfully familiar . MOOS : That sure looks like the final dogfight in the movie `` Top Gun . '' `` OMG , Tom Cruise has defected , '' said one post . The `` Wall Street Journal '' grabbed the footage before it was taken down from the CCTV Web site and slow-mo 'd it to show the debris patterns matched . Maybe CCTV just needed a glitzy shot fast . TOM CRUISE , ACTOR : I feel the need -- the need for speed ! MOOS : CCTV did not feel the need for speed when we asked for comment , but gave a `` no comment '' to others . -LRB- on camera -RRB- `` Top Gun '' backfiring on the Chinese reminds us of another doctored missile photo that blew up on the Iranians . -LRB- voice-over -RRB- Iran 's revolutionary guard 's Web site first published a shot of four missiles going up . Then bloggers noticed one of the four seemed to be a composite of the others . The Iranians later updated the shot , showing three missiles . One theory was they put in an extra missile to cover up a dud . At the time , CNN did its own demo . Smoke from the bottom of another missile over here , which it looks like they did , because this cloud matches over here . And then you just grab up here , some of the missile there and you sort of add that in .

According to a transcript of his comments to leaders of his new government read on state-run Nile TV , Mubarak acknowledged what he called `` peaceful demonstrations '' as well as grievances about the economy . Thousands of protesters have hit the streets of Cairo , Alexandria and beyond calling for the president 's ouster as well as substantial reforms . `` The current stage requires us to reorganize the country 's priorities in a way that acknowledges the legitimate demands of the people , '' he said . The president , again recognizing the depth of the unrest , urged those charged with shaping the new Cabinet -- specifically , his newly appointed Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq -- to pursue `` a wide range of dialogue with all the -LRB- political -RRB- parties . '' Such discussions , he said , `` will achieve the democratic process . '' Mubarak called on new government leaders to `` stand against anyone committing any forms of corruption '' and stressed `` the necessity to continue with fair , serious and effective new steps for more political , constitutional and legislative reforms . '' As he did in a nationally televised early Saturday , Mubarak referenced the unsettled security situation across the country , in part due to a void created after police largely abandoned their posts . He called on new government leaders to `` stop all the violence by whoever commits it , '' while appearing to criticize the Muslim Brotherhood , the country 's largest opposition party . `` The citizens and the young people of Egypt have gone out to the streets in peaceful demonstration asking for their right for the freedom of speech , '' Mubarak said . `` However , their demonstrations have been infiltrated by a group of people who use the name of religion who do n't take into consideration the constitution rights and citizenship values . '' The president claimed that such people of `` giving the chance for criminal groups to loot and confiscate public and private property , spread fires and spread fear . '' Mubarak commanded the new leaders `` to take care of the people , '' so that they again felt safe from looters and other criminal elements . Mubarak expressed hope that the military could succeed in protecting Egypt and its institutions and soon go back to its original goal , `` which is to defend the country and its sovereignty .

Egypt 's major archaeological sites , monuments and museums were under the protection of the country 's army on Monday , according to the nation 's Supreme Council of Antiquities . However , unease persisted among Egyptologists and archaeologists , who fear some of the nation 's priceless treasures may fall victim to looters or vandals , amid unrest and uprisings fueled by what protesters see as a lack of economic opportunity , widespread poverty and pervasive corruption . Egypt is `` the greatest open-air museum in the world , '' said Peter Der Manuelian , the Philip J. King professor of Egyptology at Harvard University . He said he and his colleagues are `` trying to stay on top of -LRB- the situation -RRB- as best we can , '' given spotty internet service in Egypt . Friday night , a group of `` criminals '' entered the Cairo Museum using a fire department staircase , Zahi Hawass , secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities , told CNN early Sunday . Once inside the museum , they went to the Late Period gallery , Hawass wrote . `` When they found no gold , they broke 13 vitrines -LRB- glass showcases -RRB- and threw the antiquities on the floor . '' The intruders then went back to the gallery housing artifacts from King Tutankhamun 's tomb , where they opened one showcase , broke a statue of King Tut on a panther and threw it to the ground , he wrote . A group also entered the museum gift shop and stole jewelry , Hawass wrote in a blog post Sunday . A group of `` tourist police officers '' had stayed at the museum overnight , as they were unable to leave after the curfew took effect . `` These officers , and many young Egyptians who were also there , helped to stop more people from entering the museum '' during the protests , Hawass wrote in the blog post -- which he faxed to Italy so colleagues there could post it on his website in the absence of internet in Egypt . Hawass told CNN early Sunday there were nine suspects , but in the blog post he said there were 10 . One of them asked the people guarding the museum for water , he said , but `` they took his hands and tied him to the door that led to the gift shop so he could not escape , '' according to the post . Hawass told CNN that when the suspects were apprehended , authorities found the remains of two mummies and some small artifacts with them . However , he said Sunday , everything that had been damaged can be restored .

Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak -LRB- pictured -RRB- is likely thinking more about restoring order than leaving , a former U.S. ambassador to Egypt says . Street demonstrations in Egypt show no signs of letting up . Calls for President Hosni Mubarak to leave office persist . So far , Mubarak shows no signs of heeding the call . Is he considering an exit from office or does he believe he can manage his way out of this crisis ? Daniel Kurtzer believes Mubarak is n't going anywhere anytime soon . Kurtzer was the U.S. ambassador to Egypt from 1997 to 2001 , the U.S. ambassador to Israel from 2001 to 2005 and an adviser on Middle East policy to the Obama campaign during the 2008 presidential election . Today , he 's a professor of Middle Eastern Policy Studies at Princeton University 's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs . He knows Mubarak well . `` Mubarak , as the ultimate guarantor of stability in Egypt as far as he sees it , is only thinking about how to restore calm and law and order , '' Kurtzer said . `` In the back of his mind is the idea that maybe the demonstrators have an issue and something needs to be done . But his major concern now is to restore law and order . '' It would take a dramatic turn of events for Mubarak to leave office , according to Kurtzer . `` I believe the only thing that will change Mubarak 's mind is a sit down with top military and security leaders who basically say to him , ` Your presence is putting the system in jeopardy . ' There 's no evidence yet to suggest that that kind of attitude has grown in the military , '' Kurtzer said .

Toobin said it is important to note that several federal judges have found the law constitutional . `` This is why we have a United States Supreme Court , to settle when judges disagree with each other , '' Toobin said . The nine justices `` have the last word , '' Toobin said . `` Nobody can tell them what to do or when to do it . '' -LRB- Updated at 5:37 p.m. -RRB- The U.S. Department of Justice says it plans to appeal the ruling of a federal judge in Florida , who earlier today struck down as unconstitutional key parts of the sweeping health care reform bill championed by President Obama . -LRB- Updated at 3:47 p.m. -RRB- A federal judge in Florida has ruled unconstitutional the sweeping health care reform law championed by President Barack Obama , setting up what is likely to be a contentious Supreme Court challenge in coming months over the legislation . Monday 's ruling came in the most closely watched of the two dozen challenges to the law . Florida along with 25 states had filed a lawsuit last spring , seeking to dismiss a law critics had labeled `` Obamacare . '' Judge Roger Vinson , in a 78-page ruling , dismissed the key provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - the so-called `` individual mandate '' requiring most Americans to purchase health insurance by 2014 or face `` I must reluctantly conclude that Congress exceeded the bounds of its authority in passing the Act with the individual mandate . That is not to say , of course , that Congress is without power to address the problems and Inequities in our health care system , '' Vinson wrote . `` Because the individual mandate is unconstitutional and not severable , the entire Act must be declared void . This has been a difficult decision to reach , and I am aware that it will have indeterminable implications . At a time when there is virtually unanimous agreement that health care reform is needed in this country , it is hard to invalidate and strike down a statute titled ` The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act . ' '' On the heels of anti-government demonstrations in Tunisia , thousands of protesters spilled into the streets of Egypt in a rare display of anti-government outcry . CNN reporters on the scene witnessed throngs of people in Cairo march from Tahrir Square to the parliament building . Demonstrators threw rocks at police , who threw them back and shot tear gas at the protesters , who also reciprocated . While Egypt estimated that there were 5,000 to 10,000 protesters , CNN estimated that the demonstration peaked at 15,000 to 20,000 protesters . The protest 's organizers said they wanted to mirror the uprising in Tunisia , which 10 days prior had precipitated the end of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 's 23-year rule . Before the protests in Cairo , several Egyptians set themselves or tried to set themselves on fire earlier in the month , which also was reminiscent of Tunisia , where a man 's self-immolation spurred the uprising . The Egyptian protesters - who included young and old , Christians and Muslims , students , workers and businesspeople - said they were angry over the cost of living , failed economic policies and corruption . They demanded that President Hosni Mubarak , in power for three decades , follow the lead of Tunisia 's president . `` We breathe corruption in the air , '' said one demonstrator . Tens of millions of people are bracing for a major storm system poised to sweep through the central United States and beyond this week , according to weather forecasters .

The same system is expected to coat large sections of the country 's midsection in a thick blanket of snow , he said . The Navy commander fired for making racy videos and broadcasting them on a ship says that the movies had the `` tacit approval '' of senior Navy leadership , the Navy Times reports . Owen Honors ' statement to investigators , obtained by the Navy Times , marks the first time his side of the story has been made public . Honors made headlines for days in early January when the videos were published on the Virginian-Pilot newspaper site . The films included a simulated rectal exam , anti-gay slurs and sailors pretending to shower with each other aboard ship . In early January , Honors was removed from his post commanding the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise . An official 15-page statement that Honors gave to Navy investigators states that two commanding officers , two strike group admirals `` and myriad other senior military and civilian distinguished visitors '' were aware of the videos , according to the Navy Times . Honors made the videos in 2006 and 2007 when he was executive officer of the Enterprise , and they were discussed during meetings with the ship 's commanding officer and other leadership , the Navy Times reports . During these conversations , Honors received encouraging feedback about the content of the movies and was never told to stop making them , according to the report . Honors ' superiors did not respond to Navy Times ' requests for comment .

What are the protests about ? The protesters are calling for democratization -- for a government that they feel represents them . They want President Hosni Mubarak , 82 , to step down after 30 years holding onto power , and an end to what they complain is a corrupt regime . Some have called for the government to face a trial . The anger is driven largely by economic frustrations . Egypt has seen a dramatic rise in the cost of living in recent years . While the government has offered food subsidies to help people handle rising prices , many are struggling . Egypt 's economy was stagnant for decades , but in the past 10 years started to grow , creating bigger differences between rich and poor , said Juan Cole , a Middle East historian at the University of Michigan . Where does U.S. go from here with Egypt ? Press & protests : Egypt cuts internet Why now ? What sparked the protests ? A wave of protests in nearby Tunisia which overthrew the government helped inspire people in other nearby countries , facing similar frustrations , that it was time for an uprising . But the spark , in many ways , was one young man . Mohamed Bouazizi , a 26-year-old college graduate in Tunisia , was unable to find work , so he set up a fruit cart . Police confiscated it , saying he had no permit . According to the Federation of Human Rights Leagues , police also beat him . Bouazizi set himself on fire in protest , and later died . His self-immolation triggered the huge protests in Tunisia , which in turn helped inspire people in other nearby countries , including Algeria and Yemen , to take to the streets as well . There have also been protests in Jordan and Sudan . A Facebook page calls for similar demonstrations in Syria . A popular Facebook page that helped organize the Cairo protests beginning January 25 was dedicated to Bouazizi . Many are young men . The majority of Egypt 's population is under 30 , and the vast majority of its unemployed are as well . While the protesters include people from different socio-economic levels and different parts of the country , there is a `` high proportion of the educated middle class , '' said Cole . There 's `` a feeling amongst that middle class that they 're not being given the opportunities in life that their degrees warrant -- what historians would call a ` blocked elite , ' '' Cole said . Have the protests been violent ? The protesters have generally been peaceful , chanting slogans and holding signs . Last week , police clashed violently with some demonstrators , leaving some dead and others wounded . Once the government sent in the military to take the place of police , the clashes came to a halt . The two sides have generally gotten along well . Some protesters have even posed for pictures with members of the military on their tanks . At times , the protests have even taken on the feeling of a music festival , with people wandering around , chatting , and celebrating . `` This is the start of the rest of my life , '' one jubilant young man who appeared to be in his 20s told CNN . `` As cheesy as it sounds , that 's exactly how I feel right now . '' How did chaos begin in some areas ? Police disappeared from the streets in parts of Cairo and some other areas , and some police stations were ransacked . Over the weekend , looters attacked stores and homes and torched some cars , and some prisoners escaped . Men gathered in neighborhoods to create vigilante groups protecting their property . In some places , people handed out knives , sticks , clubs , and baseball bats to men and teenage boys , encouraging them to fight any looters who came along . Some Egyptians said they worry the chaos could be part of Mubarak 's strategy , getting citizens angry at the protesters for creating havoc and excited for government security forces to come along and bring order . But the crime has also built more frustration against the government among many Egyptians . While it 's difficult to ascertain a solid death toll , Human Rights Watch staffers have confirmed more than 120 deaths in Cairo , Alexandria , and Suez , according to a researcher for the group in Cairo . How is the food supply ? Many families are fast running out of staples , and they are either unable or unwilling to shop for groceries . `` I have three children , and I only have enough to feed them for maybe two more days . After that I do not know what we will do , '' school administrator Gamalat Gadalla said . Grocers have closed up shop or are running out of supplies themselves . `` With the curfew , there are no restaurants , food or gas . Basic goods will soon be in shortage , '' Sandmonkey , an Egyptian blogger said via Twitter . Egyptian state-run Nile TV has set up a hotline for citizens to call in and report bread shortages . There has been no other indication of what the Egyptian government is doing to address the crisis . CNN 's Ben Wedeman , Nic Robertson , Ivan Watson , Frederik Pleitgen , and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report .

The homeland is undergoing critical events and difficult tests which have started with honest young people and citizens . They have the right for peaceful demonstrations to express their worries , but they were exploited very soon by those who wanted to exploit the situation to create chaos and destroy the constitution . `` These demonstrations moved from a civilized expression of practicing freedom of speech to sad confrontations which were organized by political groups who wanted to throw fire on the oil and to threaten the stability and provoke and create looting and destruction and fires and to block roads and attack national possessions and public and private possessions , and attacks on some diplomatic missions in Egypt . `` We are living together in difficult days , and what hurts our hearts the most is the fear which has overtaken most Egyptians and the anxiety which has overtaken them regarding what tomorrow will bring for them and their families and the future and destiny of their country .

My brother and citizens , I have initiated the formation of a new government with new priorities and initiatives which will respond to our young people 's demands and their anxieties . `` And in dialog with all political forces , we have discussed all the issues that have been raised regarding our democratic and political reforms and constitutional changes which they will require in order to fulfill these legitimate demands and the restoration of stability and security .

Send your video , images to CNN iReport . Cairo , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Bowing to eight days of protests , Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said Tuesday he will not seek office again in elections scheduled for September , but vowed to stay in the country and finish his term . The concession , the largest the embattled president has made so far , was remarkable for a man who has held a tight grip on power for three decades . But it was unclear whether the offer would do anything to calm opposition groups and protesters who have called for Murarak 's immediate resignation . `` My first responsibility now is to restore the stability and security of the homeland , to achieve a peaceful transition of power in an environment that will protect Egypt and Egyptians and which will allow for the responsibility to be given to whoever the people elect in the forthcoming elections , '' Mubarak said in a televised address Tuesday night . The announcement rang flat in Cairo 's Tahrir Square , where thousands of protesters erupted in chants of `` Down with Mubarak ! '' and `` The people want the president to be judged ! '' Some waved shoes in the air -- a deep insult in the Arab world -- and said they would continue their demonstrations until Mubarak quits outright . Mohamed ElBaradei , the Nobel Peace Prize winner who has become a leading opposition figure , said Mubarak 's decision was `` an act of deception '' that would only `` extend the agony . '' Egypt protests threaten global economy At a glance : Nations facing unrest `` Whoever gave him that advice gave him absolutely the wrong advice , '' ElBaradei said . However , Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa , a former Egyptian foreign minister , said demonstrators should weigh what Mubarak has said before responding . `` I 'm aware that there are certain currents in Egypt that will not see that as satisfactory and they need more , '' Moussa , a possible presidential contender himself , told CNN . But , he added , `` I believe that there is something new that has been offered . '' Mubarak has led Egypt for nearly 30 years since the 1981 assassination of his predecessor , Anwar Sadat , aided by an emergency decree that has allowed him to rule with an iron fist . But following demonstrations that have only grown in the past week , the 82-year-old former air force general told his people Tuesday night , `` I have spent enough time serving Egypt . `` I will pursue the transfer of power in a way that will fulfill the people 's demands , and that this new government will fulfill the people 's demands and their hopes for political , economic and social progress , '' he said . Tuesday 's turnout in Cairo , Alexandria and other cities came despite efforts by the government to suspend rail service and cut off mobile phone and internet networks , and in spite of the mounting hardships facing Egyptians . Banks and schools have been shuttered during the demonstrations , teller machine screens are dark and gas stations have run out of fuel . Long lines snaked around bakeries and supermarkets as shops began to ration how much food customers could buy . In Alexandria , protesters clashed with supporters of Mubarak , leaving 12 people injured , said Qutb Hassanein , a member of an opposition group . The military was called in to restore calm . Mohammed Mahmoud , a protester , said he was hit in the head by a stick during the clash . `` We do n't want him -LRB- Mubarak -RRB- . We are staying here until we die , '' he said . Mubarak 's announcement capped a day in which anti-government demonstrators stood shoulder-to-shoulder in Tahrir Square for a `` march of millions . '' It comes less than three weeks after a wave of protests that forced Tunisia 's longtime strongman to flee to Saudi Arabia in mid-January . Protesters last week taunted , `` Mubarak , Saudi Arabia is waiting for you . '' But despite calls for him to leave the country , the aging leader vowed Tuesday that `` This dear country is my country ... and I will die on its land . '' Opposition leader Ayman Nour called the speech `` very depressing . '' Nour said Mubarak was already expected to step down at the end of his term -- but he is believed to be maneuvering to have his son , Gamal , succeed him . Google connects Egyptians to Twitter Zakaria : Mubarak is a ` dead man walking ' Mohammed Habib , deputy chairman of the officially banned Muslim Brotherhood , said Mubarak 's speech was built around emotional appeals to his decades of military service and the presidency . `` After 30 years during which corruption and diminishing the strategic role of Egypt in the region became the norm , I do not feel it is time to appeal for people 's emotion , '' Habib said . `` We should say ` thank you ' to him , ` and get out . ' '' In Washington , President Barack Obama said he spoke with Mubarak soon after he announced he would not seek re-election . Obama called for an orderly transition in Egypt that , he said , should be meaningful , peaceful and must begin now . The U.S. president stressed the Egyptian people will be the ones to determine their own leaders and destiny . In Cairo , the U.S. ambassador to Egypt , Margaret Scobey , met Tuesday with ElBaradei and will be speaking with leaders of other political movements , a senior State Department official said . The official cautioned that Scobey 's talks with ElBaradei does n't mean the United States favors him . As in Tunisia , the protests have been fueled by economic woes , including a dramatic rise in the cost of living coupled with high unemployment . Despite the government 's food subsidies , people are struggling , with an estimated 40 % of the country living in poverty . The majority of Egypt 's population -- and the vast majority of its unemployed -- is under 30 , and many protesters are young men looking for economic opportunities and a better life . As the demonstrations grew , Mubarak fired his cabinet and ordered newly appointed Vice President Omar Suleiman to hold talks on political reform with opposition leaders . And on Monday , the military -- the foundation of the modern Egyptian state -- announced it would not open fire on peaceful protesters . `` I think it 's all over with once the army makes that announcement , '' said Juan Cole , a Middle East historian at the University of Michigan . Cole said he had expected the regime to endure the crisis with the support of the military , but that the military appears to have `` cut Mubarak loose . '' Shibley Telhami , a University of Maryland professor and Brookings Institution analyst , said the military may have anchored the government but , `` At some point , they are going to have to make a decision about protecting the institution beyond the man . '' And Fouad Ajami , a Johns Hopkins University professor and Hoover Institution analyst , said Mubarak 's invocation of his years of service was `` almost pathetic . '' `` I believe the crowd was discovering its power as Mubarak was discovering his own weakness and the vulnerability of his own regime , '' Ajami said . Now , `` No one believes his promises , and now no one really believes his threats . '' The demonstrations had turned ugly last Friday , when thousands of riot and plainclothes police used brutal force to crack down on people on the streets . Unconfirmed reports suggest up to 300 people may have been killed during the protests , U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said Tuesday . Human Rights Watch has reported 80 deaths from two hospitals in Cairo , 36 in Alexandria and 13 in Suez . CNN has not been able to independently confirm the death toll . But since the weekend , the army has replaced police as the enforcers of security , and the gatherings have been largely peaceful . In recent days , protests inspired by the Tunisian outcome have spread to Algeria , Yemen , Jordan and Sudan . Calls for political reform prompted Jordan 's King Abdullah II Tuesday to dismiss his government and appoint a new prime minister , and a Facebook page urged similar demonstrations in Syria . John Entelis , director of Middle East studies at New York 's Fordham University , said the Arab world is facing a `` wave '' of unrest sparked by the Tunisian revolt . `` If it were not for Tunisia , none of this would be happening at this time or in this way , '' Entelis said .

A 96-page Human Rights Watch report details cases of detainee mistreatment The report was compiled before the current unrest Report : Those guilty of abuses are often not held accountable CNN was unable to get a response from the Egyptian government -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` The guys would say they 'd be tortured so bad , they 'd be screaming , ` Tell me what you want me to say ! Tell us what to say and we 'll say it ! ' They 'd agree to confirm anything State Security wanted . '' The words are those of one Egyptian speaking to Human Rights Watch - and alleging torture by Egypt 's security services against his fellow detainees . Another man , a 22-year-old taxi-driver , told HRW last year about his detention by Egyptian police : `` They had whips and hit me on the legs , on the bottom of my feet , and on my back . When they took me down , they brought a black electric device and applied electro-shocks four or five times to my arms until it started smoking . '' They are two of many cases documented by Human Rights Watch in a 96-page report on mistreatment of detainees in Egypt entitled `` Work On Him Until He Confesses : Impunity for Torture in Egypt . '' Protester : ` We 're here for the future ' ` Mubarak leaves ... or we die here ' The report , which was published Monday but compiled before the current unrest , concludes that the Egyptian security forces carry out torture and ill-treatment of detainees with impunity and the `` government is failing miserably to provide victims of torture and ill-treatment effective remedy . '' The international human rights group says those guilty of human rights abuses have little expectation or reason to fear they will be held to account . It cites the Egyptian government 's own figures that criminal courts convicted only six police officers of such abuses between 2006 and 2009 . The Foreign Affairs Ministry reported to HRW that 10 other officers were acquitted , and three received suspended sentences . The Interior Ministry said that it had reduced the salaries of 47 officers , suspended 17 , issued one warning and acquitted 11 . There were at least 70 cases -LRB- some involving more than one officer -RRB- referred to the courts or a disciplinary tribunal during that period . It 's not clear how many complaints are filed each year , but HRW said that human rights lawyers have documented numerous incidents that never reached court . The Egyptian government told a U.N. panel in November 2009 that `` the Office of the Public Prosecutor investigates every complaint it receives about torture or cruel treatment . '' CNN was unable to get a response from the Egyptian government on the report . In the event that officers are convicted of ill-treatment , the law does not provide meaningful penalties that might represent a deterrent , HRW said . Abuses are classified into three categories -- contraventions -LRB- a fine of less than US$ 17 or 100 Egyptian pounds -RRB- , misdemeanors -LRB- a fine of more than US$ 17 or a jail term -RRB- and felonies -LRB- prison , prison with hard labor or the death penalty -RRB- . Torture and `` assault leading to death '' are felonies ; cruelty and other categories of assault are classified as misdemeanors . According to the Egyptian penal code , any official `` who deliberately resorts , in the course of duty , to cruel treatment in order to humiliate or cause physical pain to another person shall be subject to a penalty of up to one year 's imprisonment or a fine of up to EGP200 -LRB- US$ 34 -RRB- -RRB- . '' Egyptian blogger helps organize protests The evolution of Egypt 's protests Zakaria : Mubarak is a ` dead man walking ' Egypt : Israeli intelligence got it wrong `` The result is an epidemic of habitual , widespread , and deliberate torture perpetrated on a regular basis by security forces against political dissidents , Islamists allegedly engaged in terrorist activity , and ordinary citizens suspected of links to criminal activity or who simply look suspicious , '' the report concludes . One case highlighted by HRW is that of Khaled Said , a young businessman in Alexandria whose death prompted street protests last year against police brutality and has been a rallying cry in the current protests . He was accosted by police at an Internet cafe because he had posted a video online allegedly showing police dividing up drugs seized in a bust . The son of the cafe 's owner told HRW : `` They grabbed his head and banged it against the marble shelf . At this point we tried to get them outside , thinking that they wanted to arrest him , but they dragged him into the entrance of the building next door ... They kicked him so hard that he fell on the stairs . They held him by the throat and by the hair and banged his head against the stairs . '' An official autopsy said Said died after swallowing a bag of drugs , but photographs of his body showed severe injuries . Human Rights Watch says the State Security Investigations -LRB- SSI -RRB- is responsible for the disappearance of many people . `` SSI officers will summon individuals or arrest them , after which he or she `` disappears '' for a period of time , usually up to two or three months...Longer-term detention occurs at SSI headquarters in Cairo according to recent witness testimony and human rights groups . '' One such detainee , according to his lawyers , was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood , Nasr al-Sayed Hassan Nasr , who was allegedly held blindfolded for 60 days last year . Nasr told HRW that his interrogators warned him : `` This is the biggest citadel in the Middle East for extracting information . You are 35 meters below the ground in a place that nobody except the Minister of Interior knows about . '' His account is consistent with the findings of a UN Human Rights Council mission to Egypt in 2010 that found : `` There is an alarming lack of judicial oversight of facilities run by SSI , which as such are not subject to any inspections of the kind referred to above . With this in mind it becomes difficult to fully ignore many reports about terrorist suspects being arrested , transferred to , and held incommunicado in what are mainly referred to as SSI secret underground cells . '' In February 2010 , the Egyptian Foreign Ministry responded to accusations by HRW : `` There is no truth to the allegations regarding the unlawful detention of some individuals inside State Security Intelligence headquarters . In Egyptian law no citizen can be unlawfully detained . '' HRW says the Egyptian government maintains that incidents of torture are isolated -- and the Ministry of Interior tends to respond to accusations of torture `` by denying the facts , discrediting the complainant , and pointing to training programs and internal disciplinary measures . '' It says there is significant gap between the number of torture incidents that victims or their families document or file with prosecutors , and the very small number of complaints that prosecutors transfer to court and result in convictions . The HRW report says the offices of the Public Prosecutor in Egypt `` operates very much as an instrument of the executive '' , despite its formal independence as a judicial body . `` Another factor contributing to impunity is the clear conflict of interest that arises when police are involved in investigating allegations of abuse within their own ranks , '' it says . In its recommendations , Human Rights Watch urges the Egyptian government to take steps towards ending torture and ensuring effective investigations . `` Officials at the highest levels , including the president and minister of interior , should publicly acknowledge the scope of torture in Egypt and declare that they will tolerate neither torture nor ill-treatment . '' And it adds : `` The ministry of interior should immediately end the illegal practice of enforced disappearance and detention in SSI offices , and allow prosecutors to conduct unannounced visits to such sites to verify compliance . '' "}, {"uid": "232", "dct": "2011-02-01", "dates": [null, null], "text": "As Egyptian protesters demanding reform fill the streets by the hundreds of thousands , it 's worth remembering that the U.S. helps control the purse strings in that country . American taxpayers give $ 1.5 billion dollars a year in foreign aid to Egypt , second only to Israel . Although the White House has said it 's reviewing this aid depending on the military 's behavior - One top Republican says now is not the time to threaten to withhold any of this money . Congresswoman Kay Granger - who chairs the house subcommittee in charge of foreign aid - says we should n't use the money as a stick to force Mubarak into reforms . Granger says most of the $ 1.5 billion goes toward the military - which seems to be a stabilizing force among the demonstrators . Granger says Congress should only consider withholding aid if there 's evidence that U.S. military equipment is being used improperly . Several top Democrats are on the same page , saying the U.S. should remain committed to assisting Egypt . They point to the close relationship between the two countries . Nonetheless , some experts think cutting financial aid is the best way to get results . A bipartisan group of former officials says the administration should suspend all aid to Egypt until the government : Agrees to elections as soon as possible , allows banned candidates to run , immediately lifts the state of emergency that 's been in place for decades , releases political prisoners , and allows for freedom of the media and assembly . Here s my question to you : Should the U.S. withhold any of its $ 1.5 billion in financial aid to Egypt ? Interested to know which ones made it on air ? Deaddin in Cupertino , California writes : Jack , As an American -LRB- from Egyptian descent -RRB- , I think that the U.S. should withhold all aid until elections are called - elections that are inclusive of all parties and all candidates interested in running . By withholding aid , you will see the fastest results . Michael in New Mexico writes : No. . We have to honor our treaties and other agreements with Egypt . We need to use their airspace and the Suez Canal to have access to trade and tourism . What is the cost of peaceful relations ? $ 1.5 billion in financial aid is a bargain for what we get . And , considering that Egypt uses that money to buy military equipment from us , it really is n't aid at all . Living in Egypt for four years as an American and being a part of an Egyptian family and culture , I know Egyptians view any support given to Egypt and its people as a positive reflection upon the U.S. To take away aid would be regarded as a lack of direct support to the people and Egypt . To use aid as a punishment would only hurt the people and our image in the Egypt that they regard so highly . As sports , hamburger and fries are a given in our country , ` bartering ' is as strong in most if not all Middle East countries . The art of the deal is manifest in all negotiations , especially in Mideast politics . Puting pressure on the military 's income stream will transfer up the ` political ' chain from the Egyptian military leadership to Mubarak . It will ultimately define who really has the power in Egypt . Their military is more likely to make a better ` deal ' with Mubarak then any U.S. attempt to reason a new paradigm . We need to learn how to play their brand of hard-ball in which friendship takes a side seat when ` push ' needs to become ` shove ' . If funds should be withheld from Egypt until a democracy is formed , funds should be withheld from Israel until a two-state solution is found and there is peace with the Palestinians . The double-standard should not apply , yet again . Stop foreign aid altogether . Please show me the logic in paying out huge sums to anyone when the U.S. is broke and has to borrow the money . Again , American imperialism caught red handed ! Another case where we 're caught supporting a dictator that is in bed with us instead of supporting human rights which we always hear from our Wa DC leaders . What hypocracy from the American government . We should be protesting at the capital too for a politically corrupt government that we have . BTW , no where in the US Constitution does it allow foreign aide to anyone . We 're broke but we keep supporting these American puppet governments throughout the world . Americans need to wake up and demand real change or else ! We should only withhold aid if the riots continue getting out of control and Mubarak still refuses to cede power . President Obama should urge Mubarak to let his people know that he will not seek another corrupt reelection as he had done previously . 30 years in power is a lot more than enough . February 1 , 2011 at 4:04 pm | tampa , fl china called , they want the money back any way . February 1 , 2011 at 4:09 pm | No. . We have to honor our treaties and other agreements with Egypt . We need to use their airspace , the Suez Canal , to have access to trade , and tourism . What is the cost of peaceful relations ? 1.5 billion in financial aid is a bargain for what we get . And , considering that Egypt uses that money to buy military equipment from us , it really is n't aid at all . February 1 , 2011 at 4:11 pm | Why do n't we wait and see what happens first ? Seeing that we want Egypt to remain stable and responsible , why do something precipitous . February 1 , 2011 at 4:15 pm | Tom Mytoocents Fort Lauderdale , Florida We should withold aid until the smoke clears . When we see who the government represents then funds could be released slowly and monitor how funds are spent . We should do the same stateside with our own budget as well . February 1 , 2011 at 4:22 pm | Yes the u.s. should stop giving billions to egypt and israel . We are borrowing money at 4.5 % interest from the banksters and giving it to two countries who have budget surpluses . It is insane to continue giving money to countries who do n't need financial help from the u.s. who has a total national debt of 235 trillion dollars , 4 times the world GDP . Instead of congress and obama living in fantasy world they should immediatley declare a fiscal emergency and cut 500 billion from the annual federal budget which has a 1.5 trillion dollar deficit . The people living in countries with dictators seem to have more power than the people in this country . The banks and corporattions are draining this country dry , outsourcing jobs , gambling with 0 % loaned taxpayer money , and investing in every country except america . Shame on obama and congress . February 1 , 2011 at 4:23 pm | We should keep things business as usual until such time as a new arrangement is put into place . To do anything else would be influencing the outcome of this situation . Besides , if that bipartisan group really wanted Mubarak to change , why did n't they push for reforms before ? February 1 , 2011 at 4:29 pm | I think that the U.S. should withhold its $ 1.5 billion aid to Egypt until the following conditions are satisfactorily met : \\* Hosni Mubarak officially resigns as Egyptian president . \\* A chosen replacement to Mr. Mubarak supports U.S. policies and the peace agreement between Israel and Egypt . \\* The chosen replacement must also initiate and support democratic and economic reforms . \\* Opposition persons and parties are allowed to participate in free elections . \\* The elected person as Egypt 's next president supports U.S. policies , democratic\\/economic reforms and recognizes Israel . February 1 , 2011 at 4:30 pm | I would give them the aid to pay for free internet access for every location in the country -LRB- monitored by USA and Free Europe -RRB- but only to one site so that the people of Egypt can nominate some new leaders , and then vote on who it is that they really want in power . This would do away with all the foreign speculations which are doing nothing to help the situation there ! February 1 , 2011 at 4:39 pm | Now is not the time to add fuel to the fire . everything should continue as normal until the political issues and their resolution are better identified . Knee jerks should be saved for the dance floor . February 1 , 2011 at 4:42 pm | The aid is not helping Egyptian women , youth and seniors to live a life of dignity . The aid seems to benefit Mubarak and his cronies , including the military and the murderous secret police . The aid needs to be redirected so it can go through non-governmental organizations run by women and geared to helping women . After all , when you help women , their entire families benefit . Not the case when you direct help to men . Help Egypt , not Mubarak ; the two are not synonumous . February 1 , 2011 at 4:54 pm | No , we should keep sending aid as long as china will lend us the money or the printing presses do n't break down . February 1 , 2011 at 4:56 pm | Absolutely America should hold aid until we see who gets into power after the dust settles . Besides that , why should America send a billion and a half dollars in aid that we will have to borrow from China . We are broke folks . Any money we give away we have to borrow from someone else driving up our own deficit . They are an oil rich country how about trading oil for money . February 1 , 2011 at 4:57 pm | We 'll just be giving the new radical Muslim Egyptian `` government '' that is going to emerge -LRB- one that will despise the US -RRB- $ 1.5 B so I think we should hold it and pay off a tenth of the national debt . February 1 , 2011 at 4:57 pm | When you see people moving in a civilized way toward greater democracy , the best thing to do is get out of the way . Further , aid to Egypt is not intended for Mubarak but to support the role of Egypt in Middle East politics . This role might not change much . Whether we should decrease foreign aid in general will be budget issue but we should not single out Egypt at this time . To sum , we should not mess until we have a clear way to contribute to progress . February 1 , 2011 at 4:58 pm | What 's happening in Egypt is worth watching , and I hope a true democracy can be established . But the U.S. is broke - all foreign aid should be stopped . It 's time to look after our own country . If we cut funding to Egypt , what happens to our ability to use Egypt 's airspace ? What happens to the people who are already in dire financial straits , if our funding goes away , and the country sinks into total chaos & worse yet , total violence ? If the Suez Canal is blocked , and we ca n't use their airspace , I think we will regret it . Some politicians seem to have fast easy quips as to what we should do , but most of those off-the-cuff comments are not well thought-out . I think we should continue to talk behind the scenes with Mubarac , watch the developments , and continue our support until we have a lot more solid data to substantiate making changes in our funding . Let 's wait and hear what Sarah and Michelle have to say ... perhaps they can enlighten the rest of us as to how best we can proceed . February 1 , 2011 at 5:08 pm | Yes . And withhold the thirty billion in cash , weapons , and technology we give to israel . February 1 , 2011 at 5:09 pm | Why is the US still providing any financial aid to any country ? Why not stop it all , and start paying down the debt . Let Egypt and Israel worry about themselves . Your Empire is ending , America ... February 1 , 2011 at 5:12 pm | Yes . Not even a single dime should be given to tyrants . February 1 , 2011 at 5:16 pm | We should not use the money as a stick to force Mubarak into reforms , says congresswoman Granger , but the same money has been used for 30 yrs by Mubarak to stiffle the growth of democracy and freedom in Egypt , Is this a good news to be proud of ? . Why do we use our money to promote force strength in Egypt , rather than democratic values . February 1 , 2011 at 5:16 pm | February 1 , 2011 at 5:16 pm | Of course we will continue to give them aid ! Right now we will give aid to anybody who will take it !!!! The more of our american dollars we have floating around the world ... the more they are needed !!!! And thank goodness we are the only ones who can print them ... and print them we do !!!!!! February 1 , 2011 at 5:17 pm | Yes , withhold the money -- we need it here . Have n't you noticed that we have many dire situations here where that money would be better spent ? February 1 , 2011 at 5:17 pm | There is no reason for the american taxpayer to be supporting ANYONE overseas . Charity begins at home . February 1 , 2011 at 5:17 pm | Who thinks witholding aid would yield quick results ? Did Iran 's behavior change when the international community accelerated sanctions ? February 1 , 2011 at 5:17 pm | Should the U.S. withhold any of its $ 1.5 billion in financial aid to Egypt ? no , instead of writting a blank check or sending them more weapons , we should send them food , water and hygiene supplies February 1 , 2011 at 5:17 pm | I think that The usa should leave the egyptian people to make theire decision ... becaus the fact of giving the 1.3 million dollar as a finaincial aid it 's like byuing the coutry not helping ... February 1 , 2011 at 5:17 pm | Absolutely not . The US is making a grave mistake in not supporting Mubarek . It is clear that what started as protests for reforms has turned into an extremist movement . El Barradei is a dangerous man , sympathetic to extremists and smart enough to downplay it to the west . The demands of this mob are unreasonable to say the least and the Muslim Brotherhood is pushing for extreme change not toward democracy , but toward their own agenda ... that is why they refuse to meet with the VP , refuse reforms , refuse even the transition time needed . They want sympathizers in charge now . And the country and region will crumble . February 1 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | I am not so eager to embrace this new `` democratic '' movement . In a democracy , without contstitutional protections of minorities , separation of church and state , without equal rights of all minorities and system of laws to protect everyone , it is destined to devolve into another oppressive Islamist regime , ala Iran . To borrow a phrase , it will be akin to a democratic vote taken between 3 wolves and a lamb about what 's for dinner . February 1 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | We should stop all aid period . We have no business in Egypt 's internal affairs . The US needs to learn that we should not pay for friendship , but in turn earn it ! This practice usually backfires more than it works !! February 1 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | American have kept quiet so far , that was good . Now you are talking about money -- not now please ! February 1 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | Although the money is supposed to go to the military , has n't Mubarak been diverting some of it to the police ? We should cut that and put it into direct aid to the Egyptian people , like food ! February 1 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | Jack -- as an American -LRB- from Egyptian descent -RRB- I think that the US should withold all aid until elections are called , and elections that are inclusive of all parties and all candidates interested in running . By withholding aid , you will see the fastest results . It 's very simplistic , but it 's very similar to witholding an allowance for a child for misbehaving , they will listen right away if that were to take place . I pray that all this ends soon and Egypt moves on to good things . February 1 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | Pending resolution of the transition of power and reconstruction of a constitutional government , the military is the only constant holding things together in Egypt at the moment . I believe doing that at this time would be suicidal to our relationship with Egypt . Yes , Mubarek needs to speed up the transitional process - hopefully to a temporary leadership pending RAPID turnaround elections . He made reference to `` speedy '' elections ... it can not wait 8 months . Other countries in the middle east are seeing this and already acting . The status quo is not an acceptable option . February 1 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | No , the U.S. should not withhold 1.5 B in aid to Egypt because only the people will suffer , NOT MUBARAK nor his inner circle . He 'll benefit from the suffering it would cause . February 1 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | What ... ... ????? Has George Bush paid a visit to the situation room at the White House ?? Come on , Jack ... . we 're talking about the OBAMA administration here ... ... we 're not going to withold any money , nor are we going to start a war ... ... . February 1 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | I agree , it 's time for us to stop sending out anything to other countries until we get our own financial situation under control . That would save a LOT of $ $ $ $ . February 1 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | No ! Now is n't the time to shut down foreign aid to Egypt . The people of that country are making change with the HELP of the Egyptian Army . Since most of the aid goes to the Army , cutting that off would seem to hinder , not help , the people achieve the reforms they are looking for . Lawmakers calling for aid to stop should turn on their TV and watch what 's happening -LRB- withouth their help -RRB- . Sometimes it pays to just stay out of the situation . February 1 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | is this a question ? i thought the U , S. was in debt ! let 's rethink all of our handouts . yes - without the whole $ 1.5 bil . February 1 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | yes , i believe our country should withhold all aid until justice is done for the peaceful protesters -- Jobs , economic stability , etc. . Time after time we back repressive regimes with most of our aid going to the military . What a recipe for disaster ! Let 's do this right , for a change . February 1 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | Absolutely not -- if the US withholds aid to Egypt , the people will seek aid elsewhere . Desperate people seeking help from the wrong groups , such as Hamas and Hisballah is dangerous for the US and for the stability of the Middle East . Egypt has been an ally and it should continue to receive support until it gives us a reason to distrust . February 1 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | I do not think many of us understood that we were supporting a brutal dictator just to protect Israel . What does that say about the USA ? We protect one peoples to the detirment of another ? I say do n't send them another cent until there free elections . February 1 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | Jack . They should not withhold any of the 1.5 B in aid . That comes out to about $ 20\\/person in Egypt . That is a good deal for freedom for all of us . February 1 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | Hypocrisy , double stardards and lack transparency is the biggest contributor of what is happening in the Arab world at the moment and USA is part and parcel of it . What is democracy in essence Jack ? February 1 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | The US should with hold a portion of our aide to Egypt until they have fair elections . I do not trust Mubrak or what he said today . Those people deserve freedom . Thanks February 1 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Yes we should withhold the aid until the situation is resolved . I totally expect Egypt to close the Suez Canal as a result of it but tough choices need tp be made . We may get $ 10 gasoline and long lines but I am all for it . Besides ... the oil stocks will go through the roof . February 1 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Absolutley Not ! This Would Be Wrong And A Way Of Stabbing Egypt In The Back , These People Are Just Fighting For Their Freedoms And Its Not Right To Stop Aid To Egypt Just To Force Someone Out Of Office , Its Not Our Place On Weather President Mubarrak Stays In Power Or Leaves Unless He 's A Threat To Our Country ! IF funds should be withheld from Egypt until a democracy is formed , funds should be withheld from Israel until a two-state solution is found and there is peace with the Palestinians . The double-standard should not apply , yet again . February 1 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Are you crazy ? There should be no punishment for a country creating a new and improved version of itself . Egypt is a friend that will face many obstacles in the coming years . To deny aid is to not only say we do n't care about Egypt 's people at all , do n't care that they 've ousted a human rights abuser , and but to actually say we prefer them to be subjugated and miserable . Personally , I 'm appalled anyone is suggesting denying aid . Now , if we want to delay it until the new government is in place , that is one thing . But denying it all together ? I 'm glad this article implies that most of Congress has their heads screwed on straight in regards to this . I hope it is true . February 1 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Egypt is not a poor country . Once they rule themselves and get rid of the corrupt mafia they will send the US assistance to help it in its financial crisis ! February 1 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Yes any aid which is being given to Egypt -- the Egyptian Government must be terminated until Mubarak the despicable dictator leaves along with his cronies There must be a clean break with this corrupt oppressive regime Listen to the people they are fed up with this regime . All other regimes in the Middle East should take note they will soon be swept away The genie has escaped from the bottle February 1 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | No. . U.S should not get directly involved in any way except in verbal support of democracy . Mbarak has conceeded to the changes demanded and has agreed to step down in a peaceful transition . That should be enough for any mature opposition ! All U.S should do is assure the Egytian people that iWe will hold Mbarak to that commitment . February 1 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | NO ! In fact if the USA is still the home of government of , by and for the people , they should at least double it ! If you could afford $ 1.5 billion for all those years in support of a un-democratic lie , surely $ 3 billion is a small price to pay for some democratic truth -- no matter how bitter it may taste , good medicine always helps when it is applied in a timely manner and the Egyptian people need a good dose of medicine right now . February 1 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | In my opinion , not at this time . We need to wait and see how this plays out . Let the people of Egypt bring about their own reforms . They seem to know what they want , power to the people . They are in favor of the army that the USA helps support , withdrawing money now might be perceived as an affront to the Egyptian people , as well as an interference . This should only be a last resort . If the people themselves force Mubarak out of power it will mean more to them than the USA doing it . February 1 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | stop flow of money to Mubarak IMMEDIATELY : he is another dictator but one we like ... and then there are democratically governemnts -LRB- like HAMAS -RRB- we dont like ; we are a real bunch of HYPOCRITES ! February 1 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | The money we send to Egypt goes to a dictator and not the people . The U.S should cease sending American money Immediately . February 1 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | No Jack , we should n't use the aid to Egypt as a weapon against them to achieve our goals . If anything , we should suspend the aid to Israel who 's heavy handed bullying tactics have caused nothing but problems in this world . Israel does n't need our money . February 1 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | K Shabman - Atlantic Beach , Fl I suppose it depends on how much spending money the U. S. wants to give Mubarak access to when he stops stalling and leaves the country . Is anyone watching the banking system in Egypt while Mubarak plays this game ? February 1 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Yes the us gov should cut it all along with the 30 billions to israel . That way the us will stop sticking it 's nose too much in the middle east I think egypt is changed now and you ca n't buy it 's ppl decions anymore . February 1 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Am so tired of my government holding up leaders who trample on the rights of their citizens ... it 's not about being on the right side of history but doing what is right . Withhold our aid to the military until the people of Egypt are guaranteed and conduct free and fair elections . We do n't need to endorse anyone , we do n't need to involve ourselves any further than just making sure no one is jailed or tortured . . something amazing might actually happen , people in the region might be more inclined to support us in the long run if we do ... February 1 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | The US should not threaten to withhold aid to Egypt so quickly . If Mubarak continues to defy the will of the people , the US should consider alternative means or accounts in which to deposit the foreign aid funds . Meanwhile , why are we so quick to talk about withholding aid from Egypt , when we continue to send aid to Israel without conditions . Why not make US aid to Israel contingent on Israel ceasing to build homes on the West Bank ? These guys need to get there act together . With this money Mubarak has used the military to get rid of anything that might threaten him . We need to stop funding as a threat until they agree to give all reasonable rights to citizens . They should be forced to hold a fair election immediately or not receive aid . We ca n't allow oil shipping through the Suez canal to control us . February 1 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Witholding aid at this time would be grossly unproductive . The USA would become the target for general Egyptian populace anger and would sully relations for years to come . This would be seen as direct interference in Egyptian internal affairs . What would the US populace and officials feel should major investing countries started withdrawing their funds from US entities en masse ? February 1 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | February 1 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | Stating that United States ' $ 1.5 Bn aid `` controls the purse-strings '' in Egypt is bit of a stretch . Egypt 's GDP is $ 470Bn -LRB- 2009 -RRB- and $ 500Bn -LRB- 2010 , est -RRB- - so $ 1.5 Bn of aid from US to Egypt accounts for less than 0.3 % . Hardly controlling any purse-strings , when put it perspective . Arguably , the decline of tourism - which accounts for 5-6 % of Egypt 's GDP - is a far bigger hit to its purse strings than any cutback of US aid . At a time when their economy will be severely pressured , cutting back US aid would only serve to further antagonize the US image in this Arab nation . February 1 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | Deb K in snowy MA Why should we give 1.5 billion to Egypt , when we 're not taking care of people in our own country ? When will the US government realize it 's time to take share the false wealth right here in the good ol US ; for the folks who are going without health care and a good education . Why do we continue to risk US bankruptcy to take care of other countries . It 's time to start taking better care of all the families who really need it here ; who continually go without the goodies we provide for other countries . Jack , we need to look at the larger question . We have repeatedly sent money to prop up oppressive regimes who generally conduct their affairs to please us . We pay no attention to how they treat their own people . Mubarak is just the latest in a long string of these train wrecks . It results in oppressed people hating the USA and doing us far more harm than the perceived good that our money has bought . We should not ask if we are going to withhold funds from Mubarak . We should ask what our policy should be and get to it . February 1 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | Yes , not only stop the Foreign Aide to Egypt but to all countries around the world . Lets start to spend the US taxpayer money on the US and rebuilding this country 's infrastructure ; creating job opportunites for our citizens who are out of work ; stop the decline of our educational systems and help stop so many citizens falling into poverty . If we do not clean up our own act , I fear you will see the revolt in Egypt coming to the streets of major US cities soon . We are becoming a country of have and have nots with the number of have not growing fast and the unrest is growing here as well . February 1 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | Well , Jack , i do n't think we know to whom we should to send the money ! The government in Egypt 48 hours from now is very likely not to be the government that is there right now . The only responsible move is surely to withhold aid until we see who we 're dealing with . Cris in New Freedom PA February 1 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | What 's President Obama waiting for ? take the scissors and cut through that aid to about 50 % until the America economy picks up . When Americans are asked to tighten their belt , others need to do the same with exception of humanitarian\\/economic aid . It 's about time the government redirects its aid to positive causes not military especially in hard times . February 1 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | Jose Gomez from Binghamton , NY Yes Jack , all aid should be withheld everywhere that has an authoritarian political system . There is absolutely no reason why the United States should give money to cruel , corrupt dictators for no reason , even if they are supportive of US interests -LRB- or the puppet state Israel 's interests -RRB- . February 1 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | Now , after 30 + years of supporting a virtual dictatorship , the U.S. suddenly wants to attach conditions of democratic elections , free and open media , fair courts ? I do n't understand how , suddenly , certain members of Congress can be so concerned for those basic principles of democracy , when they never said a thing when Mubarak was in power . February 1 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | Yes , and while we at it lets cut some of the billions we give to Israel February 1 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | The world will be a better place if we stop using taxpayers money to support Israel 's occupation of Arabs land and to ignore united nations resolutions . February 1 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | Mitch Dworkin - Dallas , Texas The U.S. in my opinion should temporarily withhold its $ 1.5 billion in financial aid to Egypt until there is some kind of a peaceful and reasonable resolution to the crisis that most Egyptians and the U.S. government find acceptable . I do not think that blank checks can be given to any country when we do not know who its leaders will be and if it could possibly be taken over by radical Muslim extremists . February 1 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | Good gosh , is there anyone we are not giving money to ? . America needs health care , better schools , updated infastructure , I could go on and on listing the needs of our country ... . No wonder we are in debt . Stop the money NOW . You dont loan money you dont have -LRB- PERIOD -RRB- . Now is the time to rebuilt our relationship with these countries without giving them $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ . February 1 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | By all means NO ! Mubarak has been an Allie of ours for a long time and has help to keep the region very stable that is what our money bought , remember when George Bush got involved and called for elections in Palestine who did the people elect Hamas , We need to let this process play out , let the Egyptian people decide the direction they want , an orderly transition would be preferable but to force our will may be to our peril , remember Iran and Komeni . February 1 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Jack the U.S Should not stick there noses to deep into this transition of Democracy ... Although the U.S Should cut aid to Egypt if Mubarak is removed as President ! For the simple reason the Country of Egypt will become a haven for Terrorists and who knows if it will become a Lawless Country ... February 1 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | The US should withhold every single penny until Mubarak stops reshuffling the deck and resigns . Egypt is not comprised of President Mubarak , but rather of 80 million citizens that , currently , respect America and its interests . However , protesters are being fired upon with tear gas canisters stamped with `` Made in the USA '' while they chant for their dictator 's removal . The best for the US to win 80 million new enemies is to continue to fund the regime . February 1 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Only if it becomes clear without a doubt that Mubarak is not serious about stepping down before any election campaign starts . It is possible that some kind of ` manageable ' stalemate could continue for months if not weeks without much fundamental movement from either side . February 1 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | The USA is giving aid to grantee the safety of Israel before anything else . The USA should stop aid for now . Later , when everything settle , they should consider why they are giving that money away . Egyptians would appreciate it if that money is used in rebuilding Egypt . You should make it obvious that any help offered is because the USA cares not because anything else . Try not to involve Israel in it . February 1 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Why do we always give aid to these other countries when we are in trouble ourselves . I am sick of being treated like an ATM !!! I lost a tooth to scurvy due to being out of work and not enough to eat for over a year . Where was the government when it was my turn for a little help until I could get back on my feet ? I was the wrong class , wrong color and not here illegally from Mexico . I still have the hole in my mouth because I ca n't afford a bridge or healthcare . Maybe I could afford these necessities if the government would take it 's friggin ' hand out of my pocket ! February 1 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | You are damned straight to with hold any $ to Egypt . That money could better be used to help the hungry children in the US or the elderly who are n't eating healthy food and are suffering the effects resulting in draining Medicare through frequent doc 's office visits\\/hospitalization . These cost come back to tax payers . Yes , Egypt needs help but no free rides and that should apply to many , many countries in that area -LRB- Israel being the most costly -RRB- . There must be demands following aid -- which has not been the case so far . February 1 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | I think the US officials who were watching Egypt should have recommended banning that money a long time ago . Mubarak has n't been running Egypt like a President . He was running the country more like a Pharaoh , including using a secret police force that could beat up anybody they did n't like . I think the US should not give Egypt any more money until we find out what the new government will be . It 's obvious Mubarak was n't using the money to help his people and as a taxpayer , I do n't want to give the Egyptian government any more money unless I know what 's going to be done with it . I 'm in financial distress myself and I 'd rather see the money being used to help Americans instead of corrupt foreign govrenments . February 1 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | The problem with arming other countries , is the chance that they turn on us down the road . That is a chance we choose to take in exchange for our interests to be taking serious by some of these so-called friendly regimes . I think we should see where this goes a little longer before we do something drastic . Their attention needs to be on getting it together instead of worrying about external problems right now . February 1 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | Much of the yearly aid we give to Egypt and Israel is a bribe so the two countries will refrain from attacking each other . If we are not willing to threaten Israel with the same economic sanctions for their actions , like their illegal settlement building , then we would look like hypocrites to the rest of the world by threatening Egypt with a loss of aid . February 1 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | ABSOLUTELY ! We should not only withhold aid from Egypt , but maybe even ALL foreign aid funding , at least for a temporary basis . With Americans losing their homes , jobs and eventually their minds , It seems we go out of our way help every any country but our own in these trying times . I know it 's likely easier said than done , but if I recall , the saying goes , `` charity starts at home . '' February 1 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | USA seems to forget that this aid goes to the military , the most respected and most reliable force in Egypt . and the latest events have prooved that to be true . You do not stop fueling a car just because there is a malfunction in it ! this aid is a must unless the USA is willing to see another Iran on her hands . Holding back the aid that America gives every year will not help the situation . Rather it would depict to the Egyptian people that the west is leaving their side entirely . Keep in mind that that the aid that America gives plays a vital role to us here in the U.S.A. it 's in our best interest in my opinion to leave that channel open , and to maintain a good relationship with a crucial ally that we have in that region . There are other ways for America to get involved rather than pulling funds from underneath them , especially during this moment we are in . February 1 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | Withhold aid to Egypt ? How about end aid permanently , along with aid to all other countries ? The fact that we are running trillion dollar deficits while at the same time sending money to other countries is absolutely mindboggling . And the entangling alliances this `` aid '' -LRB- much of it military -RRB- will only lead to creating further enemies , as I 'm sure the `` Made in the USA '' tear gas cannisters already are . February 1 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | Jack , Well I agree that the people of Egypt deserve a democratic government and the chance of a better life , i do n't feel that the US should get involved . It 's like the parents of an adult child butting into their life , it only causes hard feelings . Democracy is something that must be won and fought for , we did it and now it is time for Egypt to fight . I also fear removing funding from the military could lead to safety issues for the people of Egypt . Let the funding stand . Let the people of Egypt do this on their own . February 1 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | I think the American aid to Egypt will not play big part in the current events , Egyptian did not feel any good from this money , second Mubarak does not care neither , he until today disrespecting his people , he was talking to them but the have no communications with the outside world , no phone no internet and no transportation , and nor allowing the journalist to report from Egypt , that add to the lest of no freedom of speech freedom of press and no freedom of Assembly . how can he be trusted when he was the master of fraud and forgery in every election presidential or NDP , He is malty billionaire and so is his kids and wife , basically the 1.5 was just to keep him in the office , February 1 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | We need to slow down . Let the professionals in the State and Defense Departments have time to work with the Egyptians and suggest ways to approach the current problems . Money matters and is a powerful tool . Let us use it with a surgeon 's skill not a like a baseball bat . This is time for thinking , gathering information , consultation and looking at alternative solutions . Doing so quietly behind the scenes will benefit us all . February 1 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | We need to demonstrate to the people of Egypt that we are with them in this time of difficulty . We also need to demonstrate to all of Islam that Obama meant what he said warning current regimes not to get in the way of democratic reforms . Our nation is only as good as its word and Obama has already given our word to support reform . February 1 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | YES . . Why America always in a hurry 2 help other countries when we need help the most do n't see a lot of countries sending us 1.5 dollar . . So many americans have no jobs , no places to live . WE R BROKE and in DEBT ... yet want 2 send all that money to another country R u kidding ME ? February 1 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | Only unnecessary aid , yet we should withhold any amount that was going into Mubaraks pocket . If we added up the amount of unnecessary aid we supply to other countries our debt could be brought down significantly . February 1 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | As sports , hamburger and fries are a given in our country , ` bartering ' is as strong , in most if not all middle east countries . The art of the deal is manifest in all negotiations , especially in mid-east politics . Puting pressure on the Military 's income stream , as in our current potential withdrawal of Egypts 1.5 bln foreign aid pkg from the U.S. , will transfer up the ` political ' chain from the Egyptian military leadership to Mubarak in short order . Ultimately , defining who really has the power in Egypt . Their Military is more likely to make a better ` deal ' with Mubarak then any U.S. attempt to reason a new paradigm . We need to learn how to play their brand of hard ball in which friendship takes a side seat when ` push ' needs to become ` shove ' . February 1 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | The Whitehouse is reviewing the aid dependent on the Army 's behavior . What that means is that if the Army opens fire on the people , they know that the US will cut off the aid . That is an appropriate ` threat ' to make . For those on this site who are claiming that the aid should be withdrawn in general -- because we are in debt , they need to consider what would happen to the price of oil if the suez canal was cut off . That billion in aid saves us billions more than what it costs . February 1 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | Then we should apply the same rule to Israel as well . February 1 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | We should absolutely continue all of our foreign aid to Egypt . For 30 years we 've propped up the oppressive policies of this regime against the people of Egypt , we are now obligated to support the people as they attempt to form a free democracy . February 1 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | The US needs to pick sides : we 're either with Mubarak or with the people . The protests ca n't go on forever . Threatening to or actually witholding aid to Egypt will be picking the people 's side . In any case , the world can not afford to let these protests fade away . By doing so , Mubarak will make Tianamen Square look like child 's play as soon as all this international attention subsides . Pick a side , USA !!! And pick the people 's side , because Mubarak wo n't be there forever ; the people will . February 1 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | If we the US tax payer are to believe our elected officials ... some who say that we need to scrap a much needed HCR legislation , because it is tooooooo expensive and we cant afford it ... yet we can borrow $ 1.5 Billion to give Egypt to prop up there egotistical leader who doesnt know when to leave ... I am betting Mubarak has a pretty good chunk of that $ 1.5 Billion in a Swiss bank account somewhere ... . My elected officials better get a grip and start cutting off all the money we borrow and give away ... and start fixing some of our own problems ... February 1 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | This is a complete travesty . Not only the fact that our government is going so broke it ca n't even pay Income tax returns on time but we have plenty of money to bid the passage of our liquid gold . Because how else will we keep Americans in financial Holocaust we are all in now if we ca n't use this travesty to make record breaking profits in the Oil market . Should we withhold money from Egypt ? I think we should withhold it forever from everyone . Lets fight for a Democracy in America . I would love to see the day This REPUBLIC dies and is replaced my a true Democracy . The fact that Americans are losing everything Egypt is just a window into our future . February 1 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | I believe - u.S. should n't hold back any aid as this will make live for the common Egyptian even harder . This will give HM another excuse to why he ca n't invest in new jobs and better educational institutions . It might also give religious extremist -LRB- of any religion -RRB- wind in their sails if they were to take advantage of the situation February 1 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | No. . We should not interfere in any way to what is happening in Egypt . There revolution might just stumble on to a system of Government that is not controlled by a central authority which could enlighten us all and lead us to a better world . February 1 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | Heck yes , for the time being we should stop everything going to Egupt . They all need to grow-up , because situations for the good does n't happen over night , a new government will not be able to square that country away over night , that is impossible . Let them take care of themselves , we as a country needs to stop sticking our nose in evertwhere else , we have to many problems here . February 1 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | The friendship of United States with most countries is ` frienship with mutual benefits ' . To keep Egypt as an ally , the aid must continue . Is n't it a give and take situation ? February 1 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | Yes ! If we ca n't stand strong on our core principle of universal human rights then what do we stand for . The people have clearly spoken and Mubarak must leave . Bring in the UN and whatever other bodies to bridge the transition to a functional democracy . There is no other principled option . February 1 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | How typically self deceptive ! The U.S. no more `` controls Egypt 's purse strings '' than it controls sun spots on the moon . What the U.S. does is subsidize the U , S , arms industry by permitting Egypt to purchase with the weapons of oppression that Mubarak has used to oppress the people of Egypt . What we have here is a supreme case of blow back over which the empire has no control . Do what it wishes the U.S. has no control over the righteous actions of the people . When the time for an idea has come not even the empire can stop it America 's historic hypocrisy has already been unmasked ! February 1 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | The U.S. should hold all of the $ 1.5 billion in financial aid to Egypt until they ask for it and when that time comes we can sit down at the table with them without it appearing we are interferring in their affairs . Withholding financial aid is the only bargaining power we have and we should use it at all cost . February 1 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | The good Egyptian people have sacrificed a lot to get to this point . How can we expect them to want Mubarak to stay in power any longer to continue to murder and take revenge on them . We must put ourselves in their place . We are afraid that an anti-American regime will replace him . The longer we continue to anger the Egyptian people by refusing to help them in their time of need , the more likely that will become a self-fulfilling prophesy ! February 1 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | NO , this is the time when the money is most needed !! Once Mubarak is out of his position , this money is necessary for both the cleanup of the country and the construction of the new government . However , rather than throw one and a half billion dollars into the hands of this government , we should personally choose to which areas the money should be allocated . This will close the huge gap between the upper class and lower class that is present there now . February 1 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | This would put pressure on the military to force Mubarak out . February 1 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | In response to a couple of other commenters re this foreign aid question relative to our own countrys ' financial situation ... think of it as an insurance policy guaranteeing the continued use of the all important Suez Canal ... we all ` gots ' to pay to play . Its always been that way and will undoubtedly continue to be so . February 1 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | Very Interesting ... we with hold the money unless they do it the American way . . Sort of reminded me of a saying `` what if a man gains the whole world but loses his soul '' . We have been sending money to many countries , while our own country has been crumbling both in government and structures . How long will it bee before our youth wake up ... February 1 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | Withholding $ 1.5 billion from Egypt 's military is peanuts Jack . America spends more than that in daily interest on our national debt so withholding $ 1.5 billion from the Egyptian military would be like telling Obama his going to the Super Bowl if the Bears were playing , would have cost taxpayers millions for his security . So , no Jack , America needs to continue sending Egypt money so long as we 're both on the same page . The friendship of United States with most countries is ` frienship with mutual benefits ' . To keep Egypt as an ally irrespective of the regime in power , the aid must continue . Is n't it a give and take situation ? When you have a majority of the countries citizens protesting an all too corrupt regime , you probably should n't pick a side . We are not the worlds police . It seems the military has picked a side and it dose n't appear to be president Mubaric 's . They are essentially Egypt 's police now and certainly can make that choice . If you gave a handfull of money to a church or a charity , could you simply take it back if they did n't spend it the way you expected ? I do n't think so . The money is theirs . We should not even consider that move . I am all to sad that americans can feel so much passion for our country but will not go out on the streets as a `` majority '' to protest what we believe in . It would seem to be the patrotic thing to do . `` Decention of government is the greatest form of patriotism . '' February 1 , 2011 at 5:32 pm | We need to stop borrowing money from china to give to Egypt , Jordan , Lebanon , Pakistan . . And all other foreign countries . senator Dirksen had it right : a billion here a billion there , it all adds up . we ca n't afford to bankroll the world on borrowed money al February 1 , 2011 at 5:32 pm | Should the US keep giving aid to the Egyptian government ? Not just because the country does n't honor the wishes of it 's people by demanding its President step down ... The U.S. is BROKE financially . Now is the ideal time to end ALL foreign aid to ALL countries . February 1 , 2011 at 5:32 pm | Absolutely . We should n't be facilitating or paying for oppression and violations of basic human rights . But to be fair , and to avoid the appearance of hypocrisy or double standards , especially in the Arab and Muslim World , we should also cut the nearly $ 2 Billion we give Israel until that government adheres to all relevant UN Security Council resolutions calling for Israeli to withdraw from Palestine to its 1967 borders and all relevant international laws such as the Fourth Geneva Convention which prohibits collective punishment and building ` settlements ' on occupied territory . After all , Palestinians are just as deserving of freedom and self-determination as Egyptians . February 1 , 2011 at 5:32 pm | The people want too be able to eat half of that carrot . Can you blame those that are hungry ? Who would it hurt to give half the carrot away ? Granger 's suggestion of withholding aid if there 's evidence that U.S. military equipment is being used improperly is utterly laughable . Is this a position suggested in the case of Israel utilizing US weapons against Palestians , with documented cases in the abuse of power ? February 1 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | The US should not withhold any of the aid . Such a move will increase the chances of instability in Egypt which is ultimately not in the US interest . To the contrary , the US should temporarily increase aid during this critical period in order to ease the tension and improve teh chances for a stable and democratic Egypt . February 1 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | The good Egyptian people have sacrificed a lot to get to this point . How can we expect them to want Mubarak to stay in power any longer to continue to murder and take revenge on them . We must put ourselves in their place . The best way we can help them is to withold our aid . We are afraid that an anti-American regime will replace him . The longer we continue to anger the Egyptian people by refusing to help them in their time of need , the more likely that will become a self-fulfilling prophesy ! February 1 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | Thye U.S. should continue with the aid to Egypt and may be even increase it to nurture the budding democracy in Egypt . Just think how much money and american blood was expended to create a so called model democracy in Iraq . Democracy in Egypt is developing without the spillage of one drop of American blood . February 1 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | With 40 % of the Egyptian population living on an income of $ 2.00 per day ... with Egypt boasting highest unemployment in the world amongst young , educated people ... aid and support is needed , but NOT for the military . Mubarek , the U.S. , and the world need to `` listen '' ... really `` listen to understand '' what these passioned people are saying . I heard one protester on CNN say `` We have 2 choices ~ 1 -RRB- Remove Mubarak or This militaristic rule is not creating freedom . Our own leadership is blind , as Joe Biden does not see `` Mubarek '' as a dictator ... The U.S. and others need to rendezvous with leaders and support `` ways and means '' financially and otherwise to create jobs , life , hope , value ... February 1 , 2011 at 5:35 pm | We are broke ! I find it difficult to understand why we borrow money from one foreign country and give it to another . As usual we are left holding the bag and get very little bang for our bucks . February 1 , 2011 at 5:35 pm | 82 % of the Egyptians `` hate ' America for its Israeli support . It means that an Islamist regime there may be quite possible . You know very well what that ongoing financial support will be used for in such a case ! . Better be very , very careful and consider to keep those funds at home . Perhaps it may help in finding jobs for a few nationally un - employed here . In any case , we ` re in a MESS . We should n't be facilitating or paying for oppression and violations of basic human rights . But to be fair , and to avoid the appearance of hypocrisy or double standards , especially in the Arab and Muslim World , we should also cut the nearly $ 2 Billion we give Israel until that government adheres to all relevant UN Security Council resolutions calling for Israel to withdraw from Palestine to its 1967 borders and all relevant international laws such as the Fourth Geneva Convention which prohibits collective punishment and building ` settlements ' on occupied territory . After all , Palestinians are just as deserving of freedom and self-determination as Egyptians . February 1 , 2011 at 5:35 pm | Withhold our tax dollars from all the dictators , keep it in the US and not in those dictator 's swiss accounts February 1 , 2011 at 5:36 pm | what are we seeing now Jack is a great era , we do not wanna miss the opportunity of join the freedom march in that part of the world , we believe in democracy in the united stats and is it heart warming to see this movement , people not motivated with any religion believe , looking at the administrator tell the story poor middle class youth and young children and old man and amazingly women young and old , that is a new face of democracy , we need to support them not reject them and frustrate them , good bless us all and bless the once that support the freedom here and there February 1 , 2011 at 5:36 pm | Taxpayers ' money should be shared only with people who share taxpayers ' values and principles . Mubarak is clearly not one of them . Ordinary Egyptians may be . But , the only way to get to those people is through community and civil society channels , not through corrupt military or ruthless leaders who abuse those very legitimate recipients . Jack , Egypt & Israel , as part of the treaty they both signed years ago , both recieve money from The U.S. to `` keep the peace '' and so far , it 's been working fine . The trouble starts when a group of prople who are anti-Israel want `` change '' and they begin to stir up the people to do their dirty work for them and that 's what is happening in Egypt now . The Muslim Brotherhood is behind this bogus `` uprising '' , not the people . February 1 , 2011 at 5:36 pm | Not only should we start witholding money from Egypt but we should start witholding it from Israel and virtually any other country we send military aid to . Defense and defense related spending , including things like military aid , eats up $ 1.3 trillion dollars a year ! Yet no politicians are even thinking about touching that to reduce the deficit . Just between Egypt and Israel we could cut a billion dollars and they would still have a Shiite-load of weapons they can use to kill each other . February 1 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | Why do n't we strike a bargain with the Arab world , we will continue aid if they drop oil prices to a realistic level for the American people . February 1 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | What really puzzules me is we are in so much debt and so much unimployment , and yet we can afford to give so much money to these other countries . How can we contiue to borrow money only to give it to other contries . What about , charity begins at home ! February 1 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | America gave over 2.4 BILLION to the Jews in Israel in 2007 . The top recipient of all Foregin aid . Give the Egyptian their aid . February 1 , 2011 at 5:38 pm | There seem to be a lot of tea party types here that are saying we should not supply aid to Egypt because it should be used to pay down debt . It is the perfect example of their absolute ignorance . Ask them back , Jack , how much money we save by having our ships travel via the Suez Canal rather than going all the way around Africa . Or how about considering what it would cost us in oil prices were the Mid East to collapse into chaos ? The Tea Party people are idiots . That 's why they vote for people like Bachmann and Palin . February 1 , 2011 at 5:38 pm | We are all bound together in this planet . I applaud the Egyptian people and hope that their cohesion against tyranny is felt way beyond the Middle East . What affects Egypt will affect us in one way or another regardless of whether or not we continue to give them the 1.5 B in aid . If the Republicans want to cut costs , then here is a place to start . Ah but wait !!! It 's going to cut into the sales of defense equipment to Egypt and other Middle Eastern nations . Would the Republican want to stifle capitalism ???? Of course not ! Then in all good fashion , Republicans will continue to send the aid even at the expense of providing aid to it 's own people here in the US . After all , it 's the mighty dollar that speaks not the poor or marginalized in this country . If Republicans truly want to uphold their `` principles '' of cutting the deficit , then start with this miniscule amount which symbolically has great weight . February 1 , 2011 at 5:40 pm | This is a complete travesty . Not only the fact that our government is going so broke we ca n't even afford to pay income tax returns on time but we have plenty of money to bid the passage of our liquid gold . How else will Americans be able to be held in financial Slavery we are all in now chained to the pump . What will Corporate America do if they ca n't use this travest to make record breaking profits in the oil market . Egypt is just a window into the future of America . You can only bend something so far before it breaks . February 1 , 2011 at 5:40 pm | Stop the money ? It is a no brainer ! . `` Show me the money '' is always the way to go . Thirty years and Mubarak is still in his castle and the people are in sheds and tents . Finally the internet has shown these people how the rest of the world lives and they want a piece of it . Let freedom ring !!!! February 1 , 2011 at 5:40 pm | Terry - Greensburg , IN `` Hoosier Hillbilly '' Should the U.S. withhold any of its $ 1.5 billion in financial aid to Egypt ? We owe $ 14 Trillion dollars in national debt , is it our place to continue to provide the rest of the world with weapons and good Samaritan money for the rest of the world to squander ? I think `` WE '' should think this scenario over before doing anything for anybody except ourselves . It 's always been my feeling that charity begins @ home ! And I 'm sure ` our ' government thinks the same way , if they want to give some of their earnings to foreign governments - more power to them -- but ` our ' tax dollars need to go toward getting -LRB- -LRB- RID -RRB- -RRB- of debt ! ASAP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I 'm not saying they caused any of it , but then again I think `` Well maybe '' they did ! What 's happened to ` our ' dollar and who had a part in it ? February 1 , 2011 at 5:41 pm | This is strange its like the US was saying `` Hay Mubarak here is your money . We dont really care what your population thinks '' before ... and now that protestors are taking to the streets its like they are saying `` Ooh it looks like you are unpopular and its all in the world public eye now . Sorry Mubarak we now need to show the world that we care what your people think '' ... its just so daft ... Hmm February 1 , 2011 at 5:41 pm | Egypt receives $ 1.5 billion in foreign aid as a result of the Camp David accords ... it was one of the way 's the US convinced Egypt to accept Israel . The US should not withhold any of the $ 1.5 billion , but instead should redirect the distribution of these funds . The Egyptian military has amassed a considerable sum of foreign aid over the years since the accord was signed in 1979 . Even though the military continues to have a large impact on this movement the foreign aid which the U.S. sends to Egypt should be redistributed to help meet the demands and needs of the people . If the money is redistributed into work programs and salaries for civil servants , a greater majority of the younger population will have an opportunity to for employment . Nonetheless , the money should not be withheld , but redirected in a manor that will help the ` revolutionaries ' and a new Egyptian government meet the peoples demands . February 1 , 2011 at 5:41 pm | If we cut off aid to Egypt because they do n't follow our ideals when it comes to a lack of rights to citizens then how about that country that fails to allow a certian ethnic population to own property in certain parts of their nation . , February 1 , 2011 at 5:42 pm | Right now , any aid would go to the bad guys , no ? I say hustle up an honest government , then go for it ! February 1 , 2011 at 5:42 pm | We should keep our money . It is sad that we have to ask that question . We do not need to buy friends with our financial situation . February 1 , 2011 at 5:43 pm | People are saying that we should not pay money to sponsor an Islamist government that will surely rise out of Egypt , but the Egyptian people are not composed fully of Muslims , and even less by radicals . Giving aid to them would be support of a new government , and by donating , we are given a say in how the government is formed . Egypt is a main ally of ours in the area , and making them hostile towards us is not a solution . February 1 , 2011 at 5:44 pm | I believe funds should be withheld in support of the Egyptian people until Mubarak agrees to leave , and agrees to elections as soon as possible , allows banned candidates to run , immediately lifts the state of emergency that 's been in place for decades , releases political prisoners , and allows for freedom of the media and assembly . February 1 , 2011 at 5:45 pm | No. . For God 's sake , just go out and ask this dictator to leave , and assure the Egyptians that you will support them and work with any government they chose . It 's too late for this dictator to say anything to change people 's view of him , and soon it will be too late for the US . February 1 , 2011 at 5:46 pm | No ! this is the time when the money is most needed !! Once Mubarak is out of his position , this money is necessary for both the cleanup of the country and the construction of the new government . However , rather than throw one and a half billion dollars into the hands of this government , we should personally choose to which areas the money should be allocated . This will close the huge gap between the upper class and lower class that is present there now . February 1 , 2011 at 5:49 pm | All foreign aid must stop !! We are broke and borrowing it , how stupid are we to continue doing it !! I think we need to continue to honor the treaties that we put together . To walk away now would do more damage . We had better be on good terms with whomever becomes President there . And to do that , just do n't meddle . Support them in other ways , but do n't meddle in the construction of their new government . Besides our meddling after WWII is the reason that we 're at this point in the first place . February 1 , 2011 at 5:50 pm | most of us dont care what happens elsewhere . I just wish that are damn government would stop feeding us BS get things done and get this freakin nation back to hiring people in all fields . This is suppose to be the greatest place in the world . Well Im a 99er with years of exp . and havent found work yet . As screwed up as this country is and my credit , I cant get a loan to start a business . So this directed at YOU president Obama What am I to do because Im losing my patients with this country and YOU . February 1 , 2011 at 5:51 pm | STOP the madness . I do n't have any money , mine all goes to taxes , federal , sales , estate , income , dividends , you name it , health insurance -LRB- astronamical -RRB- , etc. , etc. . WHY the HE !! should we send anything to anyone , WHAT have any of them ever done for us . It 's been a one way street since the end of World War II . ENOUGH ALREADY !!! February 1 , 2011 at 5:53 pm | It 's our money to do what we want with . So , yes , if it can not be spent to protect our interests , it should be withheld . After all , it is basically a shake down . February 1 , 2011 at 5:54 pm | Principled change is the key word . Principled change means that health services , protection of food and fuel supplies , protection of routes of transportation ... in other words any programs that ensure the safety of the Egyptian people should not be cut by American generosity to the Egyptian people . The answer is : if aid continues , is there a way for Obama to specify that any funds now will be distributed to those that will ensure that the people receive the funds for programs that ensure there safety , through the transition . February 1 , 2011 at 5:54 pm | If the money is supporting Mubarak , then temporary and conditional withdraw of the money is a non-violent way to pressure him to leave . If we do not put pressure , I would not be surprised if this escalated to more violence than we have already seen . If the money is helping support the people seeking reform as Coral said , then I agree we could hurt their effort . The question is whether withdrawing the money will help or hinder the people in revolt . There are times that risks are worth taking . The question is do the costs outweigh the benefits . Is there enough potential for success and has the effectiveness of this strategy been thoroughly weighed ? February 1 , 2011 at 5:55 pm | Please note that the $ 1.3 billion a year to Egypt is part of the Camp David Agreement of 1979 and is tied to the assistance to Israel . You may want to suggest that the assistance be conditioned on democratic changes in Egypt . Raouf Youssef , Vienna , Virginia February 1 , 2011 at 5:57 pm | Should we cut off aid to Egypt just because the people of Egypt are trying to get rid of a dictator ? Should we cut off aid to Egypt because almost all of it goes towards military and weapons infrastructure ? February 1 , 2011 at 5:59 pm | to many times we have given aid in volatile situations i think we should drag our feet until we see who comes to power we are already giving aid to the Taliban in afghanistan I 'm sure with the regime there watch slowly watch carefully February 1 , 2011 at 6:03 pm | February 1 , 2011 at 6:03 pm | Jack Cafferty sounds off hourly on the Situation Room on the stories crossing his radar .

And that change will happen reasonably quickly . '' Also , there was this exchange about it being `` over '' : MORGAN : If you do n't have world leaders telling him publicly it 's over , are n't you going to create a - a vacuum and a void here into which the extremists could well come ? BLAIR : Well , it is over , in the sense that whatever we 're talking about , we 're talking about a period of transition until we get to elections . I really like your show and your doing a great job . But please quit saying in every interview the you playing devils advocate . It dosent sound good when you say it in every interview . February 2 , 2011 at 9:47 am | Report abuse | I watch CNN 24\\/7 , and in every country I go to , it is the first thing I turn on to feel at home . I never noticed anything about an interviewer before , like I have noticed that Piers cuts of his guests , in the middle of sentences - like a friend that is thinking about what they are going to say next while you are still talking . It is so frustrating to listen to and downright painful to watch . Maybe other interviews do it , I however they do it , I have never noticed it . Piers needs to take a Valium and mellow out ! He could be cutting off his guests due to nerves . February 1 , 2011 at 11:04 pm | Report abuse | I quite agree that he interupts and cuts people off mid sentence -- very annoying - it is almost as if he is not interested in the answer . Oprah does it as well . February 2 , 2011 at 2:03 am | Report abuse | Your editing and cutting off of guests is appalling . Hire some new people for your staff . Also keep in mind your role here on CNN Mr. Morgan ... ... this is n't tabloid news ! February 2 , 2011 at 7:35 pm | Report abuse | SHUT THEIR MOUTH AND MIND THEIR OWN BUSINESS !! Dang !! ... given that we have our own organizations setup to specificly start these problems for other countries ... Some people , I swear ! I think British must stay away from all the problems in this world . Their greed and colonial time created all these pains and agony for 2\\/3 of the world population . That pretty much goes for the US as well does it not ? @Dave , could you sound slightly more like a retarded 12-year-old ? February 1 , 2011 at 8:12 pm | Report abuse | Can you say English please because the Scottish , -LRB- Me -RRB- Welsh and Irish were also colonised to an extent ! lol Blair , you and your country are to be blame to everything bad that happens in the middle east . Blair , you lost a golden oportunity ti keep your mouth closed ! I do not think Tony Blair speak too much , he made international mess in UK , if will better for him to go and live peacefully in India or Thailand where God exists Shaji , I think you 're wrong ! The brits can not stay away from all the problems of this world just because , if they 're not the problem itself , they in one way or another helped to create it ! It 's utterly PATHETIC for Tony Blair to comment on what 's happening in Egypt or the region for that matter . He , as most `` experts '' in the Middle East , did not see the revolution of Freedom and Dignity coming in Tunisia and still does n't grasp its meaning . That revolution , being replicated in Egypt , is about the people taking matters in their own hands to let their regime and its foreign cronies know that they 've had enough and that they can manage their affairs on their own . Get used to it , Tony Blair , and find another line of work if you have any decency left . Blair should keep his mouth shut , he 's a total gaff . Especially when it comes to the Mideast , he 's simply a puppet . It seems that the only reason that the Westt is not completely siding with the people and fearing the fall of Mubarak is worry about Israel 's security . How long are we going to step on our values , principles , and way of life to please Israel that is not ever satisfied and often snubs its finger on our face ? If Israel was out of the equation , then I have no doubt that the West would be supporting the people , their freedom and democracy 100 % . The simple fact is that any democracy , whether bring Islamists to power or not , will not take Israeli abuses and atrocities lightly , while a paid coward dictator shields Israel . That 's why the West is really worried . Time to be on the right side of history , dump colonist fanatic unwavering Israel , live up to our principles of support to freedom , democracy , and human rights . Then , we would be cherished and our TRUE interests would be protected . Who the hell care what Tony Blair has to say . He has ruined his reputation so badly by being George Bush 's lap-dog . He should disappear with whatever dignity he has left and never been seen or heard again . Just like Colin Powell , and Condi Rice . As much as I find the irritating British accent annoying , I can deal with Tony Blair . I just ca n't stand YOU Pi-ss O-ff Morgan . Get off the air . I hate your annoying British accent . If an anchor had a Chinese accent , they would never be allowed on the air unless they were reporting on China . This is America and I really wish you 'd get off our air waves and go broadcast for your own people in the UK who do n't find your accent as annoying . Go away , please . wow , what a simple minded person you must be to be concerned about accents , if only the whole world was america and everyone spoke the same , would that make your life easier ? Well , not really . By your comment , I 'm assuming that you are saying you are not `` simple minded '' ! OK , Let 's see how you are NOT `` simple minded '' . consider this : If he had an Indian or Chinese or African accent , he would never even have a chance to be on the air here in America . A British accent is still a foreign accent and just as -LRB- if not more -RRB- annoying . Get him off the air . I 'm sick of his irritating voice ! February 1 , 2011 at 8:51 pm | Report abuse | Actually , I find it refreshing to hear someone , with clear diction and excellent grammar , regardless of accent . I will avoid watching the Tony B-Liar interview , however ! Surely you could find something more important on which to focus your attention . Simply change the station and in the process , take your absurd comments elsewhere . Right ... we should all listen to him . . He and Bush got us into a disastrous war under false pretences . He needs to go away and let Sovereign nations solve their own problems . Hosni Mubarak , who engineered 9\\/11 to sell hatred of Islam for 10 years ? yes of course all the evil in the world is the fault of the usa and the uk ... all ignorant infidels ... muslims are the pure saints of the world oh and the muslim brotherhood are the greatest saints of all , they will take over egypt and install a true democracy with the brutal subjugation of women , stoning of adulterers and slaughter of all jews ... then the world will live in peace Tony Blair needs to hang his head in shame and disappear from the public stage . Better yet he should be in prison with Bush and Cheney and a number of others , but since no government has the integrity to pursue justice with these criminals , Blair should at least have the decency to shut up . that refers to you now , How professional -- why do n't you just roll your eyes the whole time Tony Blair speaks , Piers ? I first turned on your show expecting an arrogant , unconnecte person . I must say , I owe you an appology . You are a gifted interviewer . Your show is very unique and you press key leaders on recondite issues in a way that is absolutely spell bounding . To top it off you dice up your show with interviews of entertainers that show them in a light I have never seen . You have won me over as a viewer - but then again I am just a Bubba from Georgia ... . Best of luck - Phil Hey Piers i like u show ... ... i need to get to know u better can u tell Mr. Blair for me that after Iraq '' ` WHO THE HELL CARES ABOUT HIS OPINION '' '' Tony Blair sounds like a nervous coward right now on your show . Good Lord with people like Mr Blair no wonder Mubarak lasted so long in power Tony Blaire meant to say '' I am shameless clown with zero self respect and dignity . I would love to kill millions more if i get a chance '' No courage from Blair or Romny . they are both shame free . They stand for democracy only when it is conveniet to them Tony Blair sound very uncomfortable ... is it because he knows he 's guilty of dirty politics in the Middle East ? First piece of intelligent reporting I 've seen on the Middle East situation for days . Tony Blair brought a depth of analysis based on first-hand experience of the personalities shaping the region which has been absent from much of the one-sided gung-ho knee-jerk reportage . Piers asked some unpleasant questions and squeezed out a response from a seasoned political interviewee . A deftly handled interview . egypt today explains why there has never been success in the Israel Palistinian peace talks . No Arab government ever wanted to see a democratic Palistinian state because if it happened just such events as are happening now would threaten all the Arab Dictators and Kings . Therefore whenever `` peace '' was close it was undermined by those who had everything to lose . Is was not Israel , but the Arabs who had the most to lose . If I am not correct why did not Saudi Arabia or one of the other rich oil countries not give a few billions to the Palistinians ? Why do we always have to stick our noses where it does n't belong ! Because even though you say we do n't belong ; we most probably might get more than our noses punched . And that 's the reason for that not to be sneezed at . The protesters in Alexandra , Egypt , were n't checked for weapons at the protest ; where as those in `` Freedom Square '' Cairo were all checked going in for same . The comments have got very puerile since Larry King retired ... & it 's not down to Piers Morgan . Also , Tony Blair has as much a right to be on this program as any one else . Three times as Prime Minister of Great Britain & one of those times was after he went to war in Iraq with the Coalition of sorts was no small feat . Those remonstrating would have to be a leader of a country to ralise that you have to make decisions on the advice of a lot of experts that would give their opinions on different issues , re ; war , etc. . Even the Attorney General at the time backed him onhis decision along with a majority in the House of Commons . So to judge in hindsight is very easy ; but to have to make a decision that might even mean your own country 's soldier 's might n't come home alive , that is much more intractable . Even for a great Prime Minister . Future political historians will be much kinder to him , especially when they 're judging his whole life & especially for his role in the Irish Peace Agreement . Do you have any substance to back it up ? Ah Tony Blair , what do you really expect from a war criminal ? Still to this day he defends the Iraq War , maybe he should visit Iraq and just walk around the neighborhoods , I am sure people will thank him for their `` liberation . '' Piers ... you seem like you have a nice personality ... I wonder if you took out for dinner Susan Boyle as you said you would ... ? Tony Blair sorry to say , was hood winked by George Bush and followed him into disaster into Iraq . That 's why I believe he is not the guy who has any wise comments about Egypt . USA and GB should be ashamed of their dirty politics , for they personal profit they oppressed whole countries in the Middle East . May be the esteemed Tony Blair should comment on why the Brits allowed Hosni 's son Gamal to quietly sneak into their country with 200 suitcases when things got hot in Egypt . . Protecting the crooks because they were loyal ... ? Terrible Blair interview ... If you are going to invite one of the most influential leaders of our time to come on your show -LRB- boost your self-admittedly suffering ratings -RRB- and give his opinions on a situation that he has and will continue to have an influence on , then you should allow him to speak and not edit his responses . You did this presumably to woo the republicans in this nation , that do n't `` typically '' tune in to CNN , to listen to Romney . -LRB- I 'm more republican than not , but come on ... he 's tried twice -RRB- Not very many people in this nation are interested in you watering down Blair 's interview -LRB- someone who has perspective and impact on the situation -RRB- , to hear a former governor of Massachusetts and twice failed presidential candidate give his opinion . Larry King was as good as he was because he was n't chasing ratings by flying by the wind ... he was more thoughtful . What a terrible interviews and job you do Piers . Very poor and lack of clever questions . You are asking things that most people already know and when you ask a question that may be worth analyzing you just move on onto another silly question . Well , I am glad that CNN has other programs that we can enjoy professional journalism . Sorry Piers but I am not quite happy with your performance as an interviewer so far So , JPTX are you a Journalist or Reporter for the Wall Street Journal or maybe the New York Times ?? I did n't think so . So , then what makes you qualified to evaluate Piers Morgan 's qualifications as an Interviewer ? I 'm sure Piers has more awards and accolades for Journalism or anything else than you will ever see in a lifetime . Remember , when you point a finger at someone else you point two at yourself ! Instead of criticizing Piers Morgan , do n't watch the show ay ? Tune into Rush Limbaugh , he 's probably more your style -LRB- down and dirty -RRB- . Piers , tonight I enjoyed your interview with Tony Blair . I happen to believe Mr. Blair is a man to respect and look up to . My mother is from England and I have been to England twice with my mother in the past and all my mothers relatives are there . As I have come to know and respect the English people , I have come to the following conclusions : Our country -LRB- the U.S. -RRB- is in BIG trouble for many reasons and it is my belief our leaders , politicians , or whatever they want to call themselves need help from England 's leaders in the way of leadership , honesty , and discipline . After all , the English are our founding fathers and the english people have been on this earth much longer than any American . I 'm talking through history . I do know England is our greatest ally and the US needs England . The English are very strong in nature and determined to persevere . Americans somehow have become hostile , uncaring , greedy , and dishonest . I 'm not saying 100 % of Americans are this way but there are far more that are this way than are not . Barack Obama is the best thing that has happened to the U.S. in a very , very long time and yet he has n't even been in office two years and a large majority of Americans just want to tear him down . Actually that began the day he was sworn in . Now whoever does n't see anything wrong with that is really sick . I believe evil forces such as the Terrorists in this world have infiltrated the U.S. with the intention of stirring up trouble to the point of our own destruction by causing terrible divisions among American people . Well I believe their strategy is working . We are destroying ourselves from within . BTW you are a very good interviewer and try not to pay attention to the messages you get about being a terrible interviewer and person . You are working in the U.S. now on national TV and in America insults are now a part of our culture . You should be proud to be an Englishman . Good luck to you sir and keep up the good work . Tony Bliar is the unprincipled weasel of truth . Having him as a `` peace keeper '' is like having a fox manage a chicken coop ! Any Middle East leader that are friends of Toni Bliar are sitting on shifting sand . The Bush 's lap dog obediently changed laps . Tony Bliar lied to his own people and sent them to Iraq to be killed and kill millions of innocent people . What makes him different to Saddam Husein ? Welllll , Nana Brown I assume you are an American??!@? Who knows these days . In your comment is n't that kind of like the kettle calling the teapot black ? Did n't Bush start it all by telling Americans that Sadaam had WMD in his stash and then after over 4,000 Americans died in Iraq , Whoops , no WMD ! The first mistake Tony Blair made was to believe ANY American politician , President or not ! Let 's get our facts straight shall we all before we start throwing up all over the Internet . Because of work requirements tonight was the first chance I had to see Piers on this show . When it was announced he was taking over from Larry King I thought that all the American audience knew about Piers was his stint as a judge on America 's Got Talent , and that like some actors he may be too stereotyped to be accepted in this type show . Can anyone imagine Larry King conducting tonights interview with Tony Blair as well . Excellent questions and he knew something about the subject matter , and did n't simply accept responses but challeged them . There was this big hype about this program before it began . I have been watching every single interview and so far I must say I am not impressed at all . Why do you have to cut them off when they are in the middle of a sentence ? This is no art of an interview . We need to hear what they want to say fully . You may try being quiet after you 've asked the question . after all it is not a battle . And why do you keep repeating the programs this early in the season ? Tony Blair has done nothing of substance in the Middle East other than talk a good game . Now I am convinced more than ever why people are relying more and more on alternative media like intenet outlets They feell they get more realobjective , refreshing and truthful\\/unbiased information from them than any of the main stream media and that also includes CNN I mean interviewing somebody like Tony Blair or Romney for that matter about democratization is like asking a predator about the peace and security of any of the herbivores groups . Mr. Blair although he likes to put in his two-cents worth has absolutely nothing to do with people 's revolution for democracy in Egypt . If anything , he was more than happy to . over the years , shake the hands of Mubarak at every turn for being such a pliant servant to the wishes of pro-zionist agendas . Tony Blair still believes he is significant when in fact he is a fraud and an old news !! Mr. Morgan , what did Tony Blair promise you so that you put him on your show . If Piers Morgan is going to have guests who speak in cliches , like the Kardashien sisters , you may as well go back to Larry King , then they can all speak in cliches together . Piers Morgan shame on you to say on Mubarak that he is Tyrant . Mubarak has done for Egypt and the Middle East more and more things to keep peace . What Obama or Tony Blair has done , Nothing . It is the first time I lose confidence in CNN . It looks like I m watching EL Jazeera or something . I m really disappointed I stopped watching CNN when I wanted to find news about Egypt I found this Morgan british guy . Why is this british guy on our national news program ? I did not like his tone or manners toward the Obama and the White House . I found the MSNBC -LRB- they were presenting a report about Goldman Sacs hand in all these uprisings -RRB- channel as a result and will no longer watch CNN . Is it my computer or is Tony Blair wearing a satin suit ? Last night was the first time I watched the new Piers Morgan Show , having never been a particular fan of Mr. Morgan , however I was pleasantly surprised with the straight forward , on point questioning of former Prime Minister Tony Blair and Mr , Blair 's opinion of the peoples revolutions taking place in Egypt and all across northern Africa and the Middle East . Morgan 's interview of Blair was respectful while at the same time asking the tough questions and not being afraid to push Mr. Blair to actually give an answer . I have a completely new respect for Mr. Morgan 's interviewing talents and look forward to watching his show on a regular basis . Mr. Morgan brings a completely fresh , comon sense voice to a sea of `` talking heads '' that otherwise waste air time on TV . Well what happens up here in Egypt is affecting everybody especially me ... I 'm Egyptian teenager who have been struggling from Mubarak 's presidency . . He is so old and so mischievous , We hated him long long time ago , He has been a vampire who sucks the people 's blood , It hurts to see your parents struggle all their life to provide us the fundamental basics of humanity that most Of Countries provide to their citizens . . we had enough as we had nothing of our Human Rights , Mubarak calls for Democracy then what Democracy means on his world ??! we 've been out of internet and Networks for 6 days because he 's coward fearing his citizens ' speech . . we have the right to speech and say what are we seeking for ... we 're seeking for freedom , for prosperity and Luxury . we did n't want him ever he stays by election fraud . . we want him to leave , and give up all he hopes to achieve for Egypt cause we 're sure that nothing would change , He promised a lot , He lied a lot , that we gained through these 30 years of his presidency , is n't the time to go ?? , He did let the police to kill over 300 innocent protesters who are calling for freedom . . is that what suppose to happen when you raise your voice ?! . He 's nonsense person , He 's deceiving cunning president . . we 're sick of him , we had enough , we want him out of this Country , legally he 's no of president to this country . . the people got him down . . we 'll find away to every unjust who does not respect humanity . . his speech is all nag nag nag !! Enough is enough ... we Have no future as long as he 's staying !!! I just listened to Anderson Cooper complaining about being harassed in a crowd in Egypt and I could n't help but wonder what on earth else he expected . For days he has been reporting only the side of the protestors , never did find out if they were being supported by outside forces from countries who want to see Egypt collapse and he never tried to find out how the millions of other Egyptians felt . It appears that the groups now opposing the protestors are not so much `` for Mubarak '' as they are `` for stability '' . They want their country back , want to be able to go to work , get food , get money at banks and not have to protect their own property . They have just as much right to be there as the protestors . Now that Mubarak has said he will go and will move up the elections , it appears the protestors are not using reason . They seem to have a mob mentality now and are not realizing that there has to be some sort of government in place . That fellow who claims to be an opposition leader who could have been a huge help refused to meet with Mubarak so what is his agenda ? The media fuelled the mob frenzy and now that there could be a peaceful stand-off and the government could work towards a democratic precess , the media and mob do n't seem to want that . The journalists can not complain if they are harassed because if you jump into a fire you may get burned . Toni Blair is the Middle East envoy for Peace is a blood thirst war monger serving Israel . The world finally has woken up and all those Middle East self serving corrupt leaders that could be bought for a price with our tax dollars will have to flee to England , Saudi Arabia or Israel . Google Tony Blair it all comes back to him : I 'm benefiting from all of your interviews . Thanks re Tony Blair . He was so insightful as UK PM . I am engrossed in his book '' A Journey '' . P. 454 -- in his speech to both Houses of Congress -LRB- July , 2003 -RRB- : '' ... anytime ordinary people are given the chance to choose , the choice is the same : freedom , not tyranny ; democracy , not dictatorship ; the rule of law , not the rule of the secret police '' . And , p. 682 : '' ... the power of people is needed to liberate the politics . '' Piers needs to lighten up . He 's trying way to hard to win ratings with what he thinks is a revolutionary style . It sadly comes off as just petulant rantings . I do n't give him long if he continues this way . I like your programm Mr Morgan . The interview with Tony Blair made me so sick to my stomch . This guy still thinks that they really needed to create that miss in Iraq . He never answered the questions about Mubarak and all the oppresion and torture he 's done to his own people . His only point was to tell us that he is a pro israel . So all the arabs and democracy and the right of people to live go to hell as long as Israel is safe and happy . Tony blair does not speak for people in the UK about anything he sold us a load of rubbish with iraq . The guy is a war monger who made a fortune for himself when he was prime minister .

As the throngs congregated , Egypt 's Nile TV showed live pictures of car traffic crossing a bridge over the Nile River , with bulletins announcing that a curfew would be imposed again on Tuesday starting at 3 p.m. Soldiers and plain-clothed security officers searched demonstrators and controlled access to Tahrir , or Liberation Square , which has been the focal point of protests against Egypt 's embattled Mubarak , 82 . After the first lines of security , scores of self-appointed volunteers from the protest movement conducted their own searches of bags , and ordered arriving people to show their identity cards as they streamed in . One man handed out leaflets , urging demonstrators to behave in front of foreign journalists covering the event . ` March of millions ' in Cairo Protester : ` We 're here for the future ' Protesters camp out in Cairo Gallery : Protesters on streets in Egypt `` As you know all media organizations are here to follow your efforts , '' the leaflet read , `` In order to show Egypt in a positive light , we insist that you follow a peaceful approach in expressing your requests and ideas . '' Men and women continued a practice that has sprung up here over the last week ... standing alone in the street , holding up hand-made signs , and posing proudly for the cell phone photos of passers-by . `` Mubarak has been here since Ronald Reagan , '' shouted one man , who held up a sign that said `` Get Out Mubarak '' in English . Said El Sisi , 23 , said he and his father and brother traveled two hours on five different buses from their village outside Cairo to attend the demonstration . `` I 'd like to see change in my country , '' El Sisi said , as he walked slowly with hordes of people through security checkpoints towards the square . `` I 'd like to see a president in Egypt every eight years like in other countries . ... this is just the country of rich people . I graduated from university and I speak four languages but I ca n't find a job because of nepotism and corruption . To do anything you have to pay money . '' Many Egyptian opposition parties have embraced today 's demonstration , which was promoted through fliers and leaflets , since the government has shut down almost all of the internet connections in the country . `` Today we are all together in Tahrir Square , '' said George Issac , a member of the opposition group Kefaya , which means `` Enough '' in English . `` This revolution is a revolution of the young generation . We are just supporters , '' Issac said . He claimed Egypt 's long repressed opposition parties were working together with one goal , to remove President Hosni Mubarak . In another part of Cairo , an aide to Ayman Nour said the former opposition candidate for president was holding talks with officials from the liberal secular opposition Al Wafd party . `` You can not call us Kefaya or Muslim Brotherhood or leftists or anything , '' Issac explained . `` We talk today as Egyptians . '' But Issac also said his party opposed the announced goal of some demonstrators , who planned to march from Tahrir Square to the Presidential Palace . `` I send a message for all the demonstrators . Do n't leave the square , '' Issac said , in a telephone interview with CNN . A march of tens of thousands of people , if not more , would put the protesters in tense confrontations with the Egyptian troops who have established checkpoints throughout the city . At the outskirts of Tahrir Square , army officers drove a truck blaring patriotic music from loudspeakers . On Monday , the military announced it would not use force against the demonstrators . `` The presence of the armed forces in the Egyptian streets is for your benefit to protect your safety and peace , '' an unnamed military spokesman announced on state television Monday night . `` Your armed forces will not use violence against this great people , who have always played a significant role in every moment of Egypt 's great history . '' And deeper in the throngs of jubilant protesters , one of the men who searched arriving participants wore a camouflage military uniform underneath civilian pants and jacket in an apparent effort to blend in with the crowd .

But amid the chaos , one young American woman has decided to stay and document the uprising from the frontlines . Lauren Bohn , a 23-year-old Fulbright Fellow studying Arabic and journalism at American University in Cairo , told CNN 's `` American Morning '' on Tuesday what she is seeing on the ground and what prompted her to remain in Cairo . `` I 've been caught in some tear gas and bumped around a few times , but , if anything , the people here on the ground are very protective of foreigners , '' Bohn says . `` It 's been essentially a media blackstorm , '' Bohn said about reports of media outages in Cairo . `` I was able to tweet yesterday for about an hour . I ca n't tell you where I found it , but I was able to upload some video and people have been able to call me on my cell phone , on my Blackberry . '' Bohn said although she 's been unable to make outgoing international calls , she can receive them . `` It 's been completely demobilizing , and , of course , that 's the whole point , '' she said . She said she has not felt any danger or hostility toward Americans from demonstrators . `` They 're embracing me on the ground and embracing people on the ground , '' Bohn said . `` They want to make sure that the U.S. government is hearing them . '' If we still want to have Egypt as a strong ally in a Middle East , we must support brave Egyptian people in their fight for the freedom and demonstrate them what our President stated in his speech in Cairo , we really mean it . Laura is in the majority vote . I am not so sure I support the demonstrators . Their eyes show so much hate . What if the Egyptian people turn against us ? What if they support anti-American leaders that want war with Israel . The start of WW111 ??? I guess I 'd have post-stress syndrome if I was up to my elbows in dog blood . This guy was a sick even before he committed this act -- I guarantee it ! And this has what to do with a student in Egypt ??? February 1 , 2011 at 3:05 pm | Report abuse | The way people look when protesting is totally different from the way they look when things calm down and life goes back to governance and day to day living . Do n't freak yourself out . Also , why else would you participate in such incredible protests unless you \\* hated \\* your situation ? The hate is natural , and I think these people are channeling it well and will continue to do so - with a constructive and society-enhancing outcome . I think Israel is irrelevant here . Any new government in Egypt is going to have to spend a lot of time getting things together at home . Will there be some anti-Israel rhetoric to boost cohesion here or there ? I 'm sure there will . Will it come to fruition ? No one wants the entire region thrown into war . They want economic opportunities , and starting a war will make getting them impossible . Also , as an America Jew friendly to Israel , I feel strongly that fear of armed conflict should not stop the international community and\\/or the USA from supporting a peoples ' right to economic self-determination . Sure , Gaza used their elections to pick war mongers , but the West Bank did n't and violence is down there . These things are inherently unpredictable . All we can do is support fairness and justice when we see it , and hope the favor is returned . Maybe , with all the prejudice against Muslims living in Europe , the Israel 's neighbors will start to figure out why the Jews do n't see going back there to be an option , and never really considered it home despite it being a Jewish population center for a few centuries . Sorry , I strongly believe in ideals but you are foolish to stay in a foreign country that is in such turmoil . Trust me , America will hear about what is going on without your silly dilly @ $ $ putting your life in jeopardy . Ahhh youth ... I find it interesting that journalists such as Anderson Cooper , who is always in direct line of fire when it comes to major events occurring around the world , are revered for their work in the field and recognized for their bravery . But when it comes to a new US journalist , who is coming upon her first opportunity for real reporting and fully seizing that opportunity , is thought of as naive or `` silly dilly '' because she is young . As for Lauren , excellent job and good luck with your journey . February 3 , 2011 at 11:17 pm | Report abuse | Cesar .

One difficulty Egyptians may face , however , is that mobile-phone networks also have been shut down during the protests . Land lines , of course , could presumably still be used in areas where that is the case . Last week , as demonstrators angry with the policies of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak took to the streets , the government shut down social-media websites , then blacked out all internet access in much of the country . On Tuesday , as protesters began what 's being called a `` march of millions , '' which many observers say could be a decisive day in the effort to oust Mubarak , there were fresh reports of the internet being shut off in much of Egypt .

On February 8 , the family vehicle -LRB- a white Isuzu Trooper -RRB- was found in a parking lot in San Ysidro , California , on the Mexican border . The children 's car seats were still in the car . On February 15 , McStay 's brother asked police to conduct a welfare check at the family 's home . When deputies entered the home they found two dogs home alone without care and it did n't appear as if the family left on a planned trip . Belongings that would have been essential for a vacation were left behind along with perishable items on the counter . It became clear to friends and family that something was amiss . Almost a year later , the McStays are still missing . An employee of Canada 's Outdoor Adventures company admitted to slaughtering 100 sled dogs , according to a workers compensation report he later filed . The employee - whose name authorities have not yet released - worked as a general manager of Howling Dogs tour company in Whistler , British Columbia . He claimed he was suffering from post-traumatic stress after carrying out company orders to kill the dogs , the report said . A company with the same name , Howling Dogs Tours in Canmore , Alberta , has no connection with this case . The man cited `` a slow winter season '' that compelled him to decrease the size of the company 's dog pack by 30 percent , the report said . The slaughter took place over the course of two days in April 2010 , when he allegedly shot and knifed the animals before dumping them into a mass grave , including at least one dog that was later found alive , the report said .

'' A federal judge in Florida has tossed out the sweeping health care reform law championed by President Barack Obama , setting up what is likely to be a contentious Supreme Court challenge over the legislation in coming months .

Florida , along with 25 other states , had filed a lawsuit last spring , seeking to dismiss a law critics had labeled `` Obamacare .

Few images have been more powerful than those of demonstrators dropping to the ground to pray in the face of security forces . And while some have been inspired by the role of religious faith in the protests , there are definite worries that the banned Muslim Brotherhood is waiting in the wings , hoping for a chance to take over . The Muslim Brotherhood has been part of the political scene in Egypt for more than 80 years and advocates a move away from secularism and a return to the rules of the Quran . It 's the oldest and largest opposition group in Egypt and is illegal under Egyptian law . And while the Brotherhood officially rejects the use of violent means to secure its goals , offshoots of the group have been linked to attacks in the past .

"}, {"uid": "88", "dct": "2011-02-01", "dates": [null, null], "text": "Interview with CEO of PIMCO ; Interview with Executive Chairman of Orascom Aired February 1 , 2011 - 14:00:00 ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . RICHARD QUEST , HOST , QUEST MEANS BUSINESS : A dramatic development out of Egypt . President Mubarak , as you have just heard , reportedly bowing to protestors ; stepping down at the next election . We will report on that , during this hour , if it happens . On the business agenda , a blockage in the pipeline . BP 's Rosneft deal is held back . And also , tonight , a commissioner from the EU , as the EU lights a spark under business . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Open for business in Europe , or we 're out of business . As you have already heard , just in the cuts , and a short while ago , we are hearing reports that President Hosni Mubarak will step down at the next election , later this year . Al Arabiya television network says the president is going to make the announcement in a speech . Now , we are watching of course everything that happens in Egypt at the moment . And if and when that speech takes place we will bring it to you immediately . The people of Egypt are out in force , or at least tens of thousands of them . They are in unprecedented numbers on the streets . And they are demanding that President Mubarak must leave . At this hour , it is 9:00 o'clock in Cairo and many thousands remain in the city 's Tahrir Square . Again , they are defying a curfew , standing together and chanting slogans or praying . The longer this goes on the greater the damage that is being done to Egypt 's credibility in the international financial markets . S&P , Standards & Poor 's has cut the country 's credit rating down to double B. And signaled it could fall further if the unrest continues . Moody 's , you know , downgraded Egypt on Monday . Mohamed El-Erian is the chief executive of PIMCO , which is the world 's largest bond firm . And bond fund , in terms of trading . I asked him how this plays out for investors in Egypt ? MOHAMED EL-ERIAN , CEO , PIMCO : It is important to do what we call tail scenarios , to assume what can happen . You do n't always get it right , but it gets you into a mindset of reacting . Most of the time , Richard , the battle is won or lost not in terms of anticipating every development , but in terms of reacting to every development . And you have to develop what we call , here , a concept of constructive paranoia . You have to be worried , but you have to be worried in a constructive manner . It is very important to ask the `` what if '' question and to ask something that investors around the world do n't ask themselves enough , is what mistake can I afford to make and what mistake can I not afford to make ? QUEST : In that scenario with so many unknowns , not least of which will President Mubarak finally relinquish power ? If he does relinquish power , what comes next ? Not to say the least , the Muslim Brotherhood and a variety of unknown factors , how do you answer those very questions , then ? EL-ERIAN : I say that we have to play both defense and offense . On the defense side , you have to make sure that you are well-enough positioned to be able to absorb a negative shock . On the offense side , you have to be able to exploit other people 's indiscriminate selling , or indiscriminate buying . When we look at Egypt , Richard , we see things starting to come together . We see the opposition talking within itself , and developing a forward looking agenda . We see more willingness on the part of the governments to interact with the opposition and we see the army , which is a very respected institution , and liked in Egypt , playing a constructive role . So put all this together , there is a slow process of reconciliation of very different views about what managed change looks like in Egypt today . QUEST : If we then go beyond the Egyptian shores , and we look , for example , at oil . Let 's just take this-you know , this very-this incident has shoved oil up to $ 100 and the danger is it creates a floor at that level . It is also had an impact in U.S. Treasury bond markets , as well , the flight to safety , the dollar . So , we ca n't just simply isolate it can we , to Egypt and the surroundings ? EL-ERIAN : We can not and should not . So , we should look for the following . There will be a permanent one-time increase in commodity prices . People now recognize geopolitical shock is more of an issue . And importantly other countries that are looking at Egypt will want to stock pile many more commodities in order to avoid what is happening in Egypt in terms of food inflation . So this will put pressure up on the commodities . On the dollar and Treasuries , what is really interesting to us , Richard , is not what happened , but what did not happen . What did not happen is a major strengthening of the dollar , what did not happen is a major increase in bond prices . And this addressed to us , that the U.S. not longer plays the same role in terms of flight to quality that it once did . QUEST : That is a huge suggestion , is it not , that if the U.S. , if the Treasury , the long bond , and the dollar is to some extent not a sensitive on geopolitical crisis ? Then frankly we have to rethink a lot of our fundamental thinking , do n't we ? EL-ERIAN : Richard , we have to think a lot of our fundamental thinking , because , we , as a society , as a global society , are going through some major realignments . We have , as a society , gone through a financial crisis that has changed facts on the ground . Starting with the U.S. deficit and debt situation , and we are seeing an accelerated migration of growth and wealth dynamics between countries . So this is a very exciting time . But it is a time also where people have to have open mindset to recognize that we are on this bumpy journey to something different . QUEST : Mohamed El-Erian , the chief executive of PIMCO . One of the largest bond funds in the world , if not the largest , and talking to me earlier from California . The markets and how they have responded ? Well , the U.S. markets , to some extent - - holding their own . Well , more than that . It even takes me as a bit of a surprise when you look at it , and you suddenly see , whoosh ! Up like a rocket . Up 138 , we are now over 12,030 . Some encouraging numbers from UPS , some better than expected economic data . None of which is terribly exciting , but it certainly gave the market the direction that it needed to go off like a roman candle . 138 points , over 12,000 for the moment , on the Dow Jones industrials . Now , some might argue it is just not BP 's day . The oil company has been slapped with a court order , its shares have hit a snag in London . And it posted its first annual loss in a generation . If that is not enough , you 'll hear from the chief in a moment . QUEST : Now , then , an update on our main story . We are hearing reports that President Hosni Mubarak will step down at the next presidential election , in September . Al Arabiya television network says that Mubarak is going to make in a speech . Now , when that happens , well , we are believing and we are told , and we are thinking it could be within the next hour or so . The people of Egypt , or at least those that are protesting are out in force and they are there in unprecedented numbers . If , when , and how , President Mubarak speaks , you will hear it here , on CNN . BP tonight is figuring out its next move after a London court blocked its planned deal with Russia 's Rosneft . The investors also sent BP shares lower in London . That was a response to the oil giant 's latest results . But before one gets too necessarily worried or exciting-exciting , I should say-bear in mind where BP has come from to get to where it is now , especially after the Macondo incident . Come over here , and I will brief you , in the library . BP-Rosneft , this is a deal they are wanting to do . But , of course , BP 's own subsidiary in-or the owners of , the partners TNK BP , they have been to the royal courts of justice , to get an injunction , but it is a temporary one . To stop this while , of course the full hearing is taking place . It is temporary injunction . BP believes , of course , that it would like , in some way , to do a deal with Rosneft and with TNK . And it said it is trying to fast-track those discussions . BP , itself , had a loss in 2010 of 4.6 billion . Now that is a first loss for the company in the best part of 20 years . It was the charges that have been set aside , for the Macondo spill , not only of course a trust fund but also the losses , the clean up , everything else . Because the trust fund , of course , is paid over many years , where as the clean up costs were draining outright , at the moment . It 's $ 4.6 billion loss in ' 10 . However , BP does say it will pay 7 cents a share in Q4 of ' 10 . Dividends were suspended as part of the whole noise and furor during the Gulf of Mexico spill . Many people believe the suspension of dividends was purely a political move . BP certainly has the cash reserves to continue . Although , there are some suggestions in `` Fortune '' last magazine article that the preservation of capital was crucial for BP in those early days of the crisis . Jim Boulden is with me . I went off on a tangent there . JIM BOULDEN , CNN FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT : That 's fine . It 's a good article . QUEST : Yes , it is . It is a very good article . Oh , yes , back to BP . BOULDEN : Very , very complicated , is n't it ? But what struck me in the 90 minute briefing that the CEO Bob Dudley gave today , to the press here in London , he is completely relaxed about this . At least he gives that demeanor . He says the court injunction , he said it before it happened . But he kind of anticipated it would happen . He said it is a time out . It just delays a little bit of what is going on , this deal between . And he says , very likely that whatever agreement comes out of all of this will be a fast track negotiation and it could be that TNK BP do get into the deal . QUEST : Is he trying to-look , I do n't understand this . QUEST : So he 's not trying to - BOULDEN : They do n't do the same thing . QUEST : Right , but is he trying to ditch TNK BP ? BOULDEN : No , no. . Because they do n't do these same thing . QUEST : So why is TNK BP all upset about Rosneft ? BOULDEN : They think that they had this deal since 2004 , that anything BP can do in Russia that they should have a little bit of it . It 's that simple . QUEST : Because the one thing I do know about litigation , is that where money is at stake , an agreement is usually found , because people do n't really want to litigate it to the nth degree . And that is why I think this fast-track negotiation that Bob Dudley wants is probably where we are going to go . Because you go to court , because that certainly quickens the mind , does n't it ? So then you get to the idea of where , OK , what can you give . What kind of stake can you give BP TNK into this ? QUEST : I need to just need to throw one unfair question at you . QUEST : Have n't given you notice about it , but you are well across the BP barometer . There losses this year , this $ 4 billion loss . It does n't really account for the full cost of the trust fund that they have had to put together . QUEST : That will be dribbled out over 20 odd years . QUEST : But , BP , why are they paying a dividend again , then ? BOULDEN : Because they got $ 17 billion of cash in , the bank , in 2010 because they sold assets . That is not from oil . They put $ 17 billion-they are going to get $ 30 billion , they think , by the end of 2011 . And that $ 17 billion is already in the bank . So they are able to be confident enough , the board , to start getting the shareholders back on their side , if you will . The BP dividend , back on the books . Jim , many thanks , indeed . Coming up , you adapt , or you die . A sobering message in the world of business , but in New York we 'll hear that from Richard Braddock , who extols the virtues of the Internet . In Hong Kong , it will be Michael Wu , with a coffee culture . It is `` The Boss '' after the break . QUEST : I need to remind you of our top story tonight . Egypt 's President Hosni Mubarak will reportedly step down , at the next election . The Al Arabiya television network says President Mubarak is going to make the announcement in a speech . It is expected within the next hour . You can be assured , of course , when it happens . You will hear about it here on CNN . OK , now we turn our attention : He was told that it would n't work . That was a risk that Michael Wu took when he brought the world 's biggest coffee chain to Hong Kong . In New York , Richard Braddock tells us tonight being a chief exec can be a very lonely place . As you can tell , the decisions , the trails , the tribulations , they are all about being `` The Boss '' . MICHAEL WU , CEO , MAXIM 'S GROUP : It 's great when the staff sees that the company shares the same values which they do . RICHARD BRADDOCK , CEO , FRESH DIRECT : I think it is going to have a major impact on our business going forward . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I 'd now like to introduce our final session of the day , entitled , Serving Your Customer Better : Using the Internet To Your Advantage , '' and given by Rick Braddock . BRADDOCK : Thank you . Nice to be here together , with all of you . And this audience does n't intimidate him . BRADDOCK : As we meet here today , there is probably little doubt that the Internet deserves to be in everyone 's plans , regardless of what they sell . It is not only a high growth medium , but also can be a transformative one as well . In many ways they help him map out the future for FreshDirect . BRADDOCK : What I write down in the speech is my freshest thinking on how to run the business better . So it gives me a chance to sharpen my strategic wit . BRADDOCK : Most of us are not using the Internet to its fullest capabilities in pursuing e-commerce sales . BRADDOCK : Your customer gives you that deep knowledge of themselves so that you can be prepared to serve them more effectively on their return . BRADDOCK : I sort of like to tweak people from the old ways and in a little bit of a philosophical sense , say , you know , get on with it . This is a new world . And if you do n't get acquainted with it you are not going to serve your customers the way others will do . BRADDOCK : Our average orders in New York is $ 120 , out in Westchester it is $ 160 , and the Hamptons it is $ 250 . If you really look at this business analytically when a customer tries you , one of two things happen . They either trend toward loyalty and become one of those , you know , e - commerce darlings . Or , they go away . BRADDOCK : OK , we 're out of questions ? OK , well , thank you . BRADDOCK : Being a CEO can be a very lonely place . That usually happens when your business is n't doing too well . Or it can be a very happy place , and that happens when your business is doing well . So , right now , with our business growing at 25 percent , I 'm pretty happy to be a CEO . WU -LRB- speaking Chinese , English Subtitles -RRB- : Welcome to coffee tasting today . WU -LRB- speaking Chinese , English Subtitles -RRB- : Edwin , you 're the host of the tasting today . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE -LRB- speaking Chinese , English Subtitles -RRB- : When we started , 70 to 80 percent of our customers were tourists . Now they make up 50 percent . WU : They were actually selling much more than just coffee . They were selling a lifestyle . WU : Hong Kong does not have a coffee culture . There is only a tea culture in Hong Kong . And a lot of people tell me that it wo n't work . It was n't always easy , though . With the foreign brand came new challenges . How to integrate local Hong Kong culture without weakening the Starbucks brand . WU : We have actually changed a lot of the ways that the customer perceives Starbucks in Hong Kong . For example , our food program , I think we are one of the very few , if not the only market , which actually makes our own food . So we can make very locally relevant foods , such as egg tarts , such as , curry puffs , such as sausage rolls . WU : We have learned that we can actually grow the market . We can educate our customers , and locations where we would never have thought would have been successful 10 years ago , are some of our highest grossing stores now . And in London , Sarah Curran prepares for the re-launch of My-Wardrobe . QUEST : Now , if you would like to be considered , or if you a chief exec who would like to be considered to be part of our `` The Boss '' , then please drop me an e-mail . The e-mail address Quest @ CNN.com . We 're looking for applicants When we come back , the Internet does n't work , the shops are shut and you have n't been able to get any money out of the cash machine , you are also head of Egypt 's biggest telecom company . The head of Orascom , the executive chairman , about how he 's doing business , at the moment . QUEST : Hello , I 'm Richard Quest , QUEST MEANS BUSINESS . And on this network , the news always comes first . And we 're learning the embattled Egyptian president , Hosni Mubarak , is expected to address his country later tonight , as tens of thousands of anti-government protesters still fill Cairo 's Tahrir Square . Al-Arabiya television network is reporting that Mr. Mubarak will announce he will not run for another term as president . In addition , `` The New York Times '' is reporting that President Obama has told Mr. Mubarak that he should not run for another term in the election in the fall , effectively withdrawing American support for its closest Arab ally . There 's been a big shake-up in Jordan on the heels of the series of public protests last month . King Abdullah has dissolved the government and named a new prime minister . Marouf Al Bakhit served as prime minister before . He 's also been a military adviser to the king . Elsewhere , in Australia , the flood-dividend Queens -- state of Queensland is bracing for more bad weather . A category four cyclone is heading toward its coast . Hundreds of residents in Cairns are being told to evacuate their homes and take sensible precautions . The storm is expected to make landfall there shortly . So , we are currently waiting for President Mubarak to speak about his future in Europe . But it 's becoming increasingly tricky to do business in the country . The Internet is partially blocked out , shops have been closed for days . Activists call for workers all over the country to walk out , as on strike a part of these protests . And even those who did go to work were faced with a countrywide curfew that started in mid-afternoon . This is some of the things that are happening in Egypt at the moment . BP is pulling its families and its staff out . A hundred and ninety - nine people flew to the U.K. . Last night and more could follow . BP 's chief exec says drilling is slowing down because of what 's happening . Production , though , has not been affected . Procter & Gamble , P&G , says it 's closed its general office in Cairo and two plants on the outskirts of the city . Now , the Cairo office may be closed , it 's told its staff to work from home and stay safe with their families . Coca-Cola also closed its office in Cairo , says that it wo n't reopen until the situation is more secure . It also says , not surprisingly , that it 's taking all necessary measures to ensure the safety of staff . And Volkswagen says it has stopped making deliveries to Egypt . Fellow car maker G.M. Says people and plant are safe . It will commence normal operations when conditions permit . That 's the scenario of what is happening with some of the major companies . Naguib Sawiris is the executive chairman of Orascom Technology , Egypt 's largest mobile phone network . And he joins me on the line now . Good evening to you , sir . Let us begin with what -- what -- do you have anything you can add to our understanding , perhaps , of President Mubarak stepping down or saying he wo n't run again ? NAGUIB SAWIRIS , EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN , ORASCOM : I just listened to the news just as you . I mean it was in Al-Arabiya and now it has not been confirmed by the Egyptian television , which should be the official channel . So we are not really sure whether this is true or not . QUEST : Let 's talk , then , business , while we wait and see , because , obviously , the politics will take care of itself . First of all , with -- you are a mobile operator and we do know that the mobile network has been closed down at various times or at least been ordered to be shut down . What is your understanding of all of this ? SAWIRIS : Well , look , we are an operator who has a license and we need to adhere to whatever the government tells us , because our license says that the government has the right to request us to close some of the services at their own discretion , you know , and when there is any crisis in the country . And I -- and we have to obey , otherwise we are risking losing our license , you know . So we already adhered to that . Personally , I believe that this , right now , there is no need whatsoever to close down the Internet or the SMS anymore because they were worried that the demonstrators will gather and meet and so on . They 're already there . They 're in the -- there is a million people in the middle of downtown Cairo . They 're staying there and they 're going nowhere until their demands have been met . So I do n't see any sense in that , because we are all now sitting in our homes without any work . We ca n't go to our offices because of the curfew and because of the lack of Internet . There 's no correspondence , no communication ... SAWIRIS : -- so I think it 's not a very wise situation . QUEST : I mean , when you start , you know , when -- when President Mubarak 's officials say to you , shut off the Internet , shut down the -- the mobile phone network , you obviously have to follow a legal instruction , but do you do so sort of under protest ? SAWIRIS : Of course we do that under protest . I mean I -- I do n't even share the wisdom of that decision . Right now , I believe it 's best to let the Internet back because we will hear more of -- of the young people 's wishes and demands . And we are able to resolve the deadlock we have now . I mean the situation now , we are in a deadlock . SAWIRIS : Demonstrators are saying we wo n't negotiate until he leaves and -- and the president is not leaving . And then -- and sensible people like us are saying , OK , he leaves and then what ? What 's the -- who 's going to run the country ? I mean there is no solution on the table to ask a man like that to ... QUEST : -- let me just ask you to give -- but then if that is the case , do you think some sort of halfway house -- and I -- and I know I 'm asking you to speculate , but do you think some halfway house where Mubarak says I 'll go in September but that gives us time to put in place a process , do you -- is that acceptable to someone like you ? SAWIRIS : Well , I think it 's acceptable to someone like him . We want the streets to be -- it to be acceptable to them . Right now , I believe that the street has put itself in a deadlock , you know . First of all , I must say that I commend President Mubarak for not fleeing away like Ben Ali did . You know , he is a military man . He 's a man who has been facing -- he faced wars and enemies . He is not going to flee the country and leave , you know ? So I believe -- I urge -- I urge the demonstrators to be reasonable in their demand and to allow a transition period . I believe that the president has the safety of the country in his eyes and would like to leave honestly -LRB- ph -RRB- ... SAWIRIS : And he -- he will be willing to do that if he sees that the country is put in good hands . QUEST : -- what -- what ... SAWIRIS : -- what we are -- sensible people like myself and others are trying to even broker now , if we can . QUEST : As you say , you 're trying to broker , let me just ask you , finally and briefly , how much damage is being done , do you believe , to your business and to the Egyptian economy by what 's taking place ? I know , politics aside , and I know there are greater issues at stake , but if we just look at it from the bigger -- from the business perspective ? SAWIRIS : I -- I believe we -- we 've lost all the growth of GDP this year . That 's gone away . So if there was a 600 -LRB- ph -RRB- percent anticipated , I think we 'll see the same in minus , you know . The other problem we have is there is that 'll stagnation . SAWIRIS : There is no traffic , no transportation . The factories are not running because the laborers can not reach the factories . The raw materials are not reaching , the products are not being distributed . In a few days , we will run out of fuel , food and everything . It 's a. . . QUEST : Indeed , many thanks , indeed , the chair -- the executive chairman of Orascom joining us -- joining us on the line there shortly . Now we join CNN USA and John King .

Supporters of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak attacked anti-government demonstrators in Cairo 's Tahrir Square , and the ensuing violence killed three people and injured more than 600 , according to Egypt 's health minister . `` It is our hope that what we saw today we wo n't see tomorrow or Friday or into the weekend , '' Gibbs told reporters . `` Obviously ... this is not all going to be wrapped up in a matter of hours . It 's going to take some time . '' Gibbs reiterated the Obama administration 's opposition to any violence in the Egypt demonstrations , either by Egyptian security forces , protesters or criminal elements . He added that if the Egyptian government is instigating any of the violence , `` it should stop immediately . '' At the State Department , spokesman P.J. Crowley called the attacks by what he described as `` thugs '' a clear attempt to intimidate the anti-government protesters , who were demonstrating for a ninth straight day . The United States does n't know the identity of the `` thugs , '' Crowley said , adding that others have identified them as `` supporters of the government . '' In an operation that started Monday , more than 1,900 U.S. citizens and their family members have been evacuated from Egypt , Crowley said , adding that further evacuations would take place Thursday . The attacks came the day after Mubarak announced he would not seek re-election as part of a series of political reforms . Opposition activists and protesters , however , said Mubarak must step down immediately with a caretaker unity government running the country until elections for president and a new parliament can take place . It was unclear whether such confrontations were being repeated elsewhere . Other Cairo neighborhoods were calm , and contesting rallies in Egypt 's second largest city , Alexandria , were largely peaceful . Gibbs said the time for a political transition in Egypt `` is now '' because the Egyptian people `` need to see change , '' and a `` meaningful transition must include opposition voices and parties being involved in this process as we move toward free and fair elections . '' At the same time , Gibbs noted that events in Egypt `` have moved enormously quickly in a very volatile region of the world , '' adding : `` What we 're watching is history being made .

CNN personnel saw wounded people being carried into Tahrir Square , largely held by anti-regime demonstrators , through an entrance that leads to the nearby Egyptian Museum . Several ambulances entered and left the square shortly before 4 a.m. Thursday . The source of the gunfire was not immediately known . Voices were heard chanting a prayer after a day of violent street battles in central Cairo . Sustained automatic weapons fire , including from what sounded like a heavy machine gun , echoed around the square , the epicenter of nine days of protests calling for Mubarak 's ouster . Anti-government demonstrators hunkered down behind makeshift barricades in the square and outside the nearby national museum against the onslaught , which demonstrators said included plainclothes police officers . `` They 're coming in with weapons . They 're spreading violence , '' human rights activist Gigi Ibrahim told CNN on Wednesday . `` We 've had peaceful protests here since Friday and no violence here . Only today were we faced with this really violent reaction . '' The pro-government protesters were not impeded by the army when they entered the square , CNN 's Ben Wedeman said early Thursday . Anti-regime protesters are now unhappy with troops , whose commanders had promised Monday not to use force against peaceful demonstrations , for standing by , he said . Small fires burned in the square early Thursday , some spreading to trees and walls . Egypt 's health ministry reported three people were killed and 639 were wounded in Wednesday 's clashes , according to the state television network . Reported fatalities in the previous eight days of demonstrations ranged as high as 300 , but CNN has not been able to independently confirm the death toll . In one surreal moment , whip-wielding Mubarak supporters thundered through the crowd astride horses and camels , and at least one man was pulled off his mount and beaten . A Mubarak supporter who spoke to CNN said the riders were pyramid workers who were protesting the negative economic impact of the crisis . "}, {"uid": "18", "dct": "2011-02-02", "dates": [null, null], "text": "By Dan Primack February 2 , 2011 : 2:24 PM ET One day before Egyptians took to the streets in protest , a Cairo-based venture capital firm called Sawari Ventures formally launched . It is the nation 's only privately-funded VC firm , with plans to invest between $ 2 and $ 5 million in local technology and telecom startups . Earlier today I spoke with Leslie Jump , a Sawari Ventures partner who works out of Washington , D.C. -LRB- her husband is Edward Walker , U.S. Ambassador to Egypt between 1994 and 1997 -RRB- . Below is an edited transcript of our conversation : Fortune : Is it safe to say that business is on hold for Sawari Ventures ? Leslie Jump : Definitely . The country is dealing with existential questions right now , and today you have thugs on camels attacking people in the streets . So obviously all regular business has been put on hold . One of our Egyptian partners has a non-Egyptian wife , so he took her to London to keep her safe -- but he plans to return soon . Our other partner is out in his neighborhood with a cricket bat , helping to protect it from looters . It was great to see our entrepreneurs come back online today , although they 're all out protesting . How are your firm 's investors reacting ? Our lead investor is Naguib Sawiris , the richest man in Egypt . He has been coming out with statements about how we need to get through this period first , and then remember that investment is key to Egypt 's economic development . We completely agree , of course . Obviously the American investors are a different story , and are a bit more cautious . We knew that a majority of our funding would come from the region , but we wanted some Americans involved to help validate the market . You said that you hope that there is a continued interest in economic development through investment . I believe in the pragmatism of the Egyptian people . Political folks keep asking if Egypt will turn into Turkey or turn into Iran , but I have a very hard time believing the latter is possible . The people are devout , but not fanatical , and the protests have been driven by middle and upper-middle class educated people who understand that economic reform is critical . Well , if I had the ear of the minister of finance in the prevailing government , I 'd tell him that the number one issue for entrepreneurs is that the country 's bankruptcy laws must be reformed . It takes two days to start up a company in Egypt and two years to wind it down . You can not have a successful and thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem unless you can fail fast . The second thing is access to capital . Speaking of which , how many other venture capital firms are active in Egypt besides Sawari ? Before January 25 , I used to tell people that the Arab digital economy was a lot like the U.S. digital economy in 1995 . In terms of venture capital , it 's more like 1975 . There are just seven firms in the region : Two in Dubai , two in Egypt -- one is public , and we 're the private one -- one in Jordan , one in the West Bank and Intel Capital . Egypt is a market of 80 million people who speak a common language , but it is very under-served in terms of access to capital . Despite the political challenges , Egyptians are rampant consumers of consumer technologies and are digital natives because the vast majority is under the age of 30 . I 'm hoping that , once things begin to stabilize , we 'll be part of helping to build out an entrepreneurial ecosystem that has incredible potential .

That all changed on Wednesday . The morning after Mubarak dramatically announced he would not run for re-election in September , his supporters waded into Tahrir Square by the thousands , and suddenly serious , prolonged violence reigned in central Cairo . There were immediate suspicions that the pro-Mubarak demonstrators were not simply average citizens standing up for the man who has led Egypt for three decades -- suspicions that proved at least partly founded . Violence boils over in Cairo Police van plows into people in Cairo Cooper among reporters attacked in Egypt Digging up bricks to use as weapons As battles raged between the two sides , some pro-Mubarak protesters were captured by his opponents . Some were terrified to be caught and begged for their lives , screaming that the government had paid them to come out and protest . Others turned out to be carrying what seemed to be police identification , though they were dressed in plain clothes . Shadi Hamid , a Brookings Institution analyst based in Qatar , told CNN that the use of hired muscle to break up demonstrations `` is a longtime regime strategy . '' `` There are usually a line of thugs outside a protest who are waiting there , '' he said . `` They 're dressed in plain clothes , and then they 'll usually go and attack the protesters . Egyptians have seen this for quite some time , and that 's why they were able to recognize what was going on fairly quickly . '' The global rights group Amnesty International said it has documented the use of unsavory forces by Egyptian authorities to disperse political gatherings in election years . `` It looks like much of this violence is being orchestrated by the Egyptian authorities in order to force an end to the anti-government protests , restore their control and cling onto power in the face of unprecedented public demands for them to go , '' said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui , the deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International . An Interior Ministry spokesman denied on state-run television that police identification cards had been confiscated from demonstrators . He said if they had been , they were were stolen or fake . But state television reporting Wednesday did not always match CNN 's own observations of what was happening in Tahrir Square . Several CNN journalists heard from pro-Mubarak demonstrators that they worked for the government . Staff from the national petrochemical company said they had been ordered to come and protest . Amnesty International researchers said witnesses told them of `` lorry loads '' of pro-Mubarak supporters leaving Wednesday morning from Mahalla , north of Cairo . `` These -LRB- pro-Mubarak -RRB- protests were organized by the government and the ruling National Democratic Party , '' analyst Kamal Zakher told CNN . The government mustered government workers and lawmakers whose seats are threatened , he said . Should Obama take Egypt ` behind scenes ' ? Heavy gunfire heard in Cairo Triage on the streets of Cairo `` They were ordered to go out today . They are well organized and that is suspicious -- especially the use of camels and horses . These are abnormal techniques to demonstrate , '' he said , referring to the shocking charge of about 50 or 60 mounted men through Tahrir in the middle of the afternoon . And Emad Shahin , a Mideast analyst at the University of Notre Dame , said `` reliable contacts in Egypt '' told him the counter-protesters were organized `` by Mubarak himself , '' with the aid of businessmen who support him . `` The whole objective is actually to give the impression that there is still support for Mubarak and to force the demonstrators out of Tahrir Square , '' Shahin said . He said the embattled president `` is presenting a very difficult choice before the Egyptian people -- either liberty or security -- and he is hoping that they will choose security at the expense of liberty . '' In Washington , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs expressed concerns about the outbreak of violence . `` The president and this administration strongly condemn the outrageous and deplorable violence that 's taking place on the streets of Cairo , '' Gibbs said . `` Obviously , if any of the violence is instigated by the government , it should stop immediately , '' Gibbs added . State television called the pro-Mubarak demonstrators tourism workers . At least some Egyptians working in the tourism industry are known to be genuinely upset at the anti-Mubarak demonstrators , accusing them of hurting their business by bringing instability . Zakher also said it was suspicious that security forces did not intervene to break up the violence . `` There were no police or military to separate the two crowds at the beginning and that 's also suspicious enough to implicate the security agencies , '' Zakher said . Journalist and protestor Reham Saeed told CNN she saw men with police uniforms go into hotels on the way to Tahrir Square and then come out wearing civilian clothes , joining the pro-Mubarak protesters . She called that an act of `` betrayal . '' State TV interviewed several people at the demonstration who said they backed the president because he had provided stability and independence . `` For 30 years , we lived in peace . President Mubarak kept us safe and secure for 30 years instead of being a country that takes orders from external forces just like -LRB- U.S. President Barack -RRB- Obama now wants , '' Iman Abu Futuh , a pro-Mubarak demonstrator , said on Nile TV . `` They want us to be another Iraq and this will not happen . '' Another man said , `` I did n't cry when my father died . I cried when Mubarak spoke yesterday . I grew up watching him , seeing him , having him as my leader and the great president of this nation . '' And a female demonstrator said : `` Mubarak is our father . No one can insult and ridicule their elders . If we do that , we belittle ourselves . This is how we destroy our country .

"}, {"uid": "201", "dct": "2011-02-02", "dates": [null, null], "text": "The Middle East is starting to look like one big game of dominoes . As the kings , unelected presidents and emirs watch what 's going on in the streets of Cairo , they 've got to be wondering if they 're going to be next . Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's days are clearly numbered . At this point , it seems highly unlikely he 'll even make it through the rest of his term . Mubarak would be following Tunisian President Zine El Abedine Ben Ali out the door after similar popular street movements pushed him out of power . No doubt about it , some sort of genie is out of the bottle . Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh says he wo n't seek re-election when his term ends in 2013 . That 's after more than three decades in office . He also says he wo n't hand power over to his son . Of course , he made that announcement ahead of a `` day of rage '' protest scheduled for Thursday . Thousands of people have already been demonstrating in Yemen in recent weeks . Over in Jordan , King Abdullah has sacked his government and appointed a new prime minister in the face of protests . The king is asking the new government to implement what he calls `` genuine political reform . '' It s funny how `` reform '' has suddenly become a priority in some of these countries after decades of repressive governments . Meanwhile , demonstrators also are calling for change in Algeria and Sudan . And in Syria , there are protests planned for this week . Experts say these protests sweeping across the Middle East and North Africa are `` unprecedented '' and a `` watershed event for the Arab world . '' For now , the leadership in Saudi Arabia and Libya seems secure , but it 's safe to say a new day is dawning . Here s my question to you : What 's next for the Middle East ? Interested to know which ones made it on air ? Jack , Do n't worry about what 's next in the Middle East . Worry about what 's next in America . The riots in the Middle East are economic-related . They 're driven by high unemployment , economic disaster , and a government that does n't do its job . I 'm sure Greece , France and Ireland understand perfectly what 's happening in Egypt . What 's next for the Middle East is playing catch-up on nearly a thousand years of human rights history , from Britain 's Magna Carta in 1215 until a desperate Tunisian set himself on fire last month . In a let 's - get-it-done-by-breakfast world , already precariously balanced , this is not a task for the faint-hearted . I think we can expect to see more people taking to the streets in other Middle Eastern countries seeking change . It 's like a fever that sweeps over an area and everyone catches it . What is next for us is higher oil prices . Nick in San Diego writes : If we side with the people for democratic reform in that whole region and tell Israel to get serious concerning the Palestinians or the money stops NOW , we 'll be ok . If not , brace ourselves for more 9-11 's . What 's next is we finally see if democracy is really all we 've been building it up to be . More of the same . The Middle East has been a hotbed of unrest since God was a little boy . It 's not going to change . And our interference will only result in more Americans being sent home in pine boxes and a bigger hole in our budget . It 's not our business . I doubt seriously that the Egyptians are sitting about asking each other what 's next for Chicago or Des Moines . Whatever happens , if it is not to the liking of Israel , the lid to Pandora 's box comes blasting off . Driven by the victim mentality , Israel is the one to keep an eye toward . With their overwhelming military power , and paranoid leadership , one wrong move by Israel could lead to the end of the world as we know it . The Rapture , in other words . Whatever is in store for the Middle East , the U.S. should let it play out without any interference or threats of action or fleet movements or disparaging remarks about the principle players . It is time the U.S. learned to deal with the world as it is and stop trying to make the world over in its own image . Hamas , Hezbollah and possibly the Muslim Brotherhood are legitimate political parties in some of those countries . It is hypocritical and counterproductive to call for democratic elections , and then to vilify the parties that were democratically elected and refuse to deal with them because they have a different world view than we do . We have to learn to find common ground and work with these groups . February 2 , 2011 at 5:46 pm | The information age gives the people of Egypt the new world view of freedom . They know the results of the nasty leaders in Iran and I believe they do not want to live that way . I have faith in the people of Egypt . Ken Krieger Cape Coral , Florida February 2 , 2011 at 5:48 pm | What 's next for the Middle East ? The Middle East is surely going through a series of domino effect because of these politicians and false promises . One man will surely come out after the death of King Abdullah . He will be from the descendant of the Prophet Muhammad -LRB- PBUH -RRB- . There is nothing to be frightened of . He loves humanity , he will rule with justice and peace and abide by the rules of the Qur ` an . The genie is out of the bottle . It looks like 2011 is going to be the year of massive upheavals throughout the Middle East and , possible , beyond . I would not be surprised if the citizens of Iran return to the streets of Tehran and demand changes in their government . North Africa , the Middle East , and repressive regimes in the neighborhood are liable to be scenes of riots and demonstrations the likes of which we have never seen and will remember for a long time . The task for the U.S. and other democracies is to support those marching for freedom while not seeming to be pushing events in one direction or another . Let them have their revolutions and let us accept the outcomes . We have supported dictators for too long . February 2 , 2011 at 5:51 pm | Glad to see this is happening . At long last people are standing up for themselves instead of beckoning the Western powers to bail them out . Western countries had to fight for thier freedoms -- all of them hoad some sort of uprising 100s of years ago ... from the US to France to Britian and even non-Western Russia . Now all we need is an uprising in North Korea somehow and we 're all set . February 2 , 2011 at 5:52 pm | I am sure this is a sign that the Arab world is now going to fall in line with the West and begin to indoctrinate our values into its newly found democratic culture . The world will be a Utopian paradise in no time ... OR -LRB- more likely -RRB- this means that the status quo of the west hate rhetoric is about to intensify with younger , stronger , more militarized & aggressive leaders . February 2 , 2011 at 5:54 pm | If we side with the People for demcratic reform in that whole region and tell Israel to get serious concerning the Palestinians or the $ $ $ stops NOW , we 'll be ok . If not brace ourselves for more 911 's February 2 , 2011 at 5:54 pm | Next up is the emergence of the Muslim Brotherhood taking over all muslim countries , re-establishment of the Chaliphate , and world dominance of Islam . It is afterall the goal of the MB to establish Islam throughout the worlsd , this is the first of it . February 2 , 2011 at 5:55 pm | What does this mean for the rest of the world ? Will new regimes spark more anti-western sentiment in the middle east , or will they stabilize this volatile region ?? February 2 , 2011 at 5:56 pm | What if some of these new regimes , elected into office democratically , actually provide for their people , but are more authoritarian and Islam fundamentalist , perhaps anti-U.S.-anti-Israeli . Be careful what you wish for . February 2 , 2011 at 5:57 pm | Jack , do n't worry about what 's next in the Middle East . Worry about what 's next in America . The riots in the Middle East are economic related . Driven by high unemployment , economic disaster , and a government that does n't do it 's job . I 'm sure Greece , France and Ireland understand perfectly what 's happening in Egypt . February 2 , 2011 at 5:57 pm | What 's next , you ask ? Increased oil profits for those who last the longest . Middle-Eastern cultures are not breeding grounds for a stable democracy , they are hot-beds of centuries old superstitions , hatreds , igorance and corruption . February 2 , 2011 at 5:59 pm | So what 's new that Revolutions occur with each new generation . Times and needs change according to the new ideas and demands of the populace . The U.S.A. constitution foresaw and provided the Power of Amendments in a peaceful manner . And , all the more reason to avoid uprisings with the utilization of democratic concepts by and for the people . By now , Kingdoms , Monarchies and Dictators should be History , if not for the Human urge to maintain control and power over others . Not wanting to relinquish power , foments Revolution , but the Ego is over powering to those few who think they know what is best for themselves and the Little People . February 2 , 2011 at 6:02 pm | Dominoes ? I will probably be more like a game of potato head - changing parts of the head while the restt of the body stays the same . February 2 , 2011 at 6:03 pm | It is anyone 's guess what will happen next . The people are speaking , with a very loud voice . I think the model to look at is Glasnost with Gorbachev , seems like a similar situation . I think Democracy will rise in these countries and there will be economic turmoil for a while before things stabilize . February 2 , 2011 at 6:05 pm | What 's next ? I fear more violence and bloodshed , but I also hope that the people in the Middle East will be able to achieve what most people want - a decent life with dignity and freedom , a life in which they can achieve their full potential . Some autocrats make do lip-service to reform , but it will only be to silence their critics until those critics can be totally silenced . February 2 , 2011 at 6:06 pm | This is an important opportunity for the U.S but from what I 'm seeing we are not taken advantage of it . Tehran hang three people this week for last year demonstrations . They did it now just in case anyone has any ideas to start the demonstrations again . Ahmedinejad is an evil s.o.b and we can give him some of his own medicine . All Hillary or Obama have to say is `` people should not put up with oppression and small time dictators '' . I guarantee you the Iranian people will get the message . Some day they will hang Ahmedinejad and the mullahs from the balconies of Tehran . February 2 , 2011 at 6:07 pm | The Middle East is heading into a revolutionary phase . First Morocco and now Egypt which is one of the bigger Middle Eastern prodomently Muslim nations . I can see several of the other nations either falling or adjusting to the new trend . The new trend is the Isalmic Brotherhood . The Islamic Brotherhood is a pro-Taliban and promote strict discipline to Allah without question or doubts . Once they are in control , Egypt will be in an even worse off situation . One country that needs to be on heighten awareness is Israel . The Islamic Brotherhood have stated that Israel needs to be destroyed . February 2 , 2011 at 6:09 pm | Do n't know what to believe here , Jack . I hope -- that this is the beginning of the internet being used as a powerful social tool for massive positive change . I fear -- that the change could be a fall to decades of ruin unless reasonable governments are built rapidly -- usually its just a power grab , but this seems different . I know -- that danger lies in masses of ignorant and uneducated people just expressing their anger -- education is the key to any county 's success . February 2 , 2011 at 6:10 pm | Once consolidated the Muslim Brotherhood will turn toward Israel and WWlll will begin shortly after . I have never seen anything like this . The coming together of the Republican and Democratic elitists to denounce Mubarak after 30 years of propping him up . Now both party ` s seem to endorse the Muslim Brotherhood . We , the people of America , have elected the stupidest most self serving congress in all of history . This can not come out good and most probably turn out real bad for us here in the states . February 2 , 2011 at 6:13 pm | Whats going to happen is a new Muslim World Order will start , or you could say the next Khalifa is on it 's way . February 2 , 2011 at 6:14 pm | Ethiopia . Meles Zenawi is another harsh dictator in Africa and will be next in line to be protested against . February 2 , 2011 at 6:14 pm | People yern for freedom , even if they 're not sure what to do with it . US foreign policy has been concerned about the latter to it 's detriment . Our best chance for good future Egyptian relations is to support change now . February 2 , 2011 at 6:14 pm | February 2 , 2011 at 6:14 pm | Never mind the Middle East , which could always take care of itself -- without our interference . How about the U.S. , here at home ? We could take a lesson when it comes to corrupt and lying politicians . February 2 , 2011 at 6:15 pm | Mass exit to the USA looking for work ? Who knows Jack but even if they get their wish of new government where will the jobs come from ? February 2 , 2011 at 6:15 pm | Tell all the arab leadrers : take a number and wait ... ... you could be next on line . . February 2 , 2011 at 6:15 pm | Dictators in this world like khamenei and ahmadinejad are next . This revolution is not based in one country but will affect all of the middle east . February 2 , 2011 at 6:15 pm | A bunch of new dictatorships and\\/or Islamic theocracies . Arabs have no interest in democracy , except as a way to create a dictatorship or Islamic theocracy . February 2 , 2011 at 6:16 pm | Jack , I think that is the only ways to remove those dictators from power . February 2 , 2011 at 6:16 pm | Like you said , after decades and decades of regime , the middle east is finally realizing what `` could be '' with out a form of dictatorship . Maybe some time soon you guys in the media will give Bush some credit for what he did in Iraq , when every one in the media and public thought it America was taking over . February 2 , 2011 at 6:16 pm | The question should be , how will the U.S. manage the new middle east . February 2 , 2011 at 6:16 pm | I HOPE - Israel signs a Peace Treaty with Palestine and takes the Anti -- American Card Off the Table ?! February 2 , 2011 at 6:16 pm | I wish I could say it was piece and prosperity for all , but sadly enough there just does n't seem to a history of that in this part of the world . Middle East ... Middle Class ... this is the face of corruption and greed infecting communities , countries throughout the world . Peace will only come when such distructable forces rule . God have Mercy on us all ... you said there will be days like this . February 2 , 2011 at 6:16 pm | Whats next ? It 's the perfect setting for radical Muslems to take over . People will say no way , but think about how radicals had little percentage in Russia , Iran , etc. ... when revolution took place . It just opens the door for them . February 2 , 2011 at 6:16 pm | People are sick and tired of some jerk thinking he is the supreme leader , they want a say in how the government is ran and just maybe get a little peice of the pie . Same thing will happen to the United States some day , the people will get damn sick and tired of the jerks we have in congress and will throw them all out , the only ones they are interested in is themselves and the lobbyist that stuff their pockets with money . February 2 , 2011 at 6:16 pm | February 2 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | When and under what conditions would UN forces , or the like , take action to help stabilize the situation in Egypt , and the middle east in general ? February 2 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | The Mubarack regime of corrupt politicians will be outsted . Maybe the people in this country need oust the corrupt politicians in the U.S. Oops that would be all of them ! February 2 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | With Israel surrounded by soon to be all anti-semitic countries , it 's safe to say the Middle East is more than likely going to erupt . Also , the US -- no matter if Mubarak somehow regains control or if radical Islamists take over or if democracy ensues -- has just lost their biggest allies in the Middle East . We 'll be lucky if things turn our way ... February 2 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | This is a new age , not only for the Middle East , but for the whole world . Despots , dictators , and torturers alike are seeing what can happen when people gather in the name of freedom , democracy and human rights . They have been forewarned , and we can rejoice . February 2 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | It is my opinion that the Islamists of the middle east , intend to take over the world . They intend to take over all of the countries , and convert them to militant run countries , under the control of Al-Queda , and their allies . Once they have gained control of the middle east , they will move to other countries one by one , and indeed , they have already inserted militant violence into many countries outside of the middle east , including Indonesia , Malaysia , Thailand , and African countries , including Somalia . The Islamic populations of many western countries , are seeing the impact of violence in those countries , already , as well , to include France and Holland , as well as the UK . This is , and has always been , a religious conflict , and it will eventually become world war 3 . February 2 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | Biggest fear would be the middle east countries would become Theocracies . We would have one big Al Quiada to deal with . February 2 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | February 2 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | I believe not only the government of Mubarak will collapse , but a new government will arise , and it will be against the will of the people . Islam will come to be the ruling power , and Egypt will become one of the many countries to experience this change . This is a terrorist attack , but not in the US , instead , a terrorist attack in the Middle East towards the rest of the World . A mastermind plan to continue to unify , a new Empire ... February 2 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | Jack , Tunisia was the beginning , Egypt will not be the end , the people of the middle east have seen that tyrants are vulnerable and can be removed from power , I imagine that next year we will see more much democracy in the middle east Democracy , in my opinion , is a release mechanism for the people in troubling times . A way to make a change . The people do n't rebel if they feel they can do something about their situation . It 's only a matter of time before any of these leaderships get forced out . It 's only a matter of time for Iran or even China . February 2 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Its seems the fall of Israel looms in the shadow of this `` gas filled room '' we can now call the Middle East ! May God help us all ! February 2 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Jack the Elephant in the room is China . How is the Gov. of China trying to block all this info . February 2 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Why does no one mention Iran ? Frustrated youth\\/middle class takes to the street . Repressive , closed government ; economy a shambles . What 's Iranian protesters now ? US allied despots have limits on force\\/repression . Mullas have no such constraint with US military having it 's hands full . Why have I heard nothing about this from the 9 million talking heads discussing the current situation . ? February 2 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | I am saddened over the deaths as well as the injured , however we are witnessing history . We , thanks to live coverage by CNN , are eye witness to history in the making . Leaders in Arab countries , including Saudi and Libya , had better plan on making changes before changes are made for them . Let us all pray for peaceful solutions . February 2 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Because we are boxed in wars of attrition in Iraq and Afghanistan , the radical Islamists will take over power in the Middle East and North Africa and will threaten our security and the security of the state of Israel . watch out for Saudi Arabia soon ! The things that are holding up the Saudi royal dissenters are the influence of foreign expatriates on the locals , and the dividends from oil that the saudi government is doling out to every citizen . February 2 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | It is unfortunate to see the events unfolding in the middle east and the very sad events destroying years of stability in Egypt . I hope the world realizes how grave the current situation is and work hard to bring back stability in the region ; otherwise , we could be heading towards third world war February 2 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | If Mubarak leaves before September , I strongly believe that other oppressed nations , not just Arab nations , be inspired to speak out and will demand change in their governments . February 2 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | February 2 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | February 2 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | I would hope the people of the Mideast could enjoy the peace of what is considered normal day-to-day life that we take for granted here in the US . Maybe that s too much to ask since our complacency hasn t really brought us that normalcy of late . But maybe , someday , for all of us . February 2 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | i hope that Libya would be next . Libya actually has one of the worst oppressive regimen in the region . actually we Libyan used to look to Tunisia and Egypt as a heaven comparing to our Gaddafi oppression , I think the problem is Libya has not usually had a fair share of media coverage as the other countries in the region . Gaddafi regimen has being nothing but a mix of oppression and brutality for 42 years . can you believe that 42 years !! if we think for a minute how many president did USA have since then ? this brutal dictatorship has been in power since the days of president kennedy in USA !! does that sound too long time ?? What 's next for Middle East ? The middle east ... safe and prosperous ... hard working people ... parents raising kids ... good education , good health care and justice for all ... but more importantly , going to sleep every night knowing your government is working for you instead of you slaving for it ... February 2 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Nothing will change no matter who is in charge . The Middle East is mostly desert . The people are complaining food is too expensive and jobs are too few . CNN shows pictures of mother 's feeding babies opium because there 's no food . In Africa people kill anything that lives within miles of their villages for `` bush meat . '' Yet they keep having babies by the dozens -LRB- literally -RRB- . Just how many jobs are there for billions of people ? How much food grows in the desert ? Is anyone talking about this ? Did anyone notice the horses the Mobarak supporters rode in on ? The only thing that will save us now is a massive human die-off . February 2 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | If the rest of the world is lucky , the american government will stop supplying everyone with weapons ... oh I forgot , war is business and everyone has the right to bear arms !!!!!! We supported the Dictator Hosni Mubarack for thirty years because he signed peace agreements with Israel , but we overthrew the Dictator Saddam Hussein because he threatened Israel . Where is our equality ? February 2 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Change is coming . The real question is `` can the unorganized democracy movement catch up to the organized fundamentalist movement in time to take advantage of this opportunity '' . February 2 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Next is Sudan . Remember Sudan people led two uprising in the last 49 years and ignited to close a half century with a third one . February 2 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Jack , Maybe we will finally find the weapons of mass distruction hidden by Saddam and give new life to secular discord in Iraq . . Or maybe there will B a Lesson Learned -LRB- too late -RRB- to our own American Youth . February 2 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | As a Lebanese American I tell you that we are unfortunately losing credibility with the new generations in the Middle East . We seem to be supporting Dictators , Kings etc. . . We need to support the Democracy that the people are fighting for . And relying on the USA to support and help . We can not afford top be on the fence . Mcdonalds on every corner , shopping plaza 's every 200 feet , major corporate profit margins and citizens loosing their homes , starving on the streets without health insurance while their politicians make appearances on the latest hot nightly talk show 's . Just like our great country ! February 2 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | February 2 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | I have always beleived that a dictatorship is very important to pave the way for democracy in the middle east . but who is the honest dictator that is welling to speed up process and be the the first victim of it ! Internet will speed the process . February 2 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | Jack , I really hope that a new day has began for the middle east . It was about time that people there have freedom of speech . I am sure they can find a way to stay true to their habits , culture and religion without being radical and starting to related better with the rest of the world . February 2 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | Jack , if the past is prologue , then we only have to look back at how the world was reformed in the early 1900s . Governments fell , autocratic families lost their reputations and power and all of Europe was reshaped as World War One raged and reformed countries and alliances . Perhaps World War Three will occur in the Middle East -- not between the US and the USSR as we once expected -- and these events will be a historical tipping point affecting the world for the rest of the century . February 2 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | Shades of Tianaman Square . IMubarak was just marking time with his speech while his goons organized to disrup the crowd . I predict the crowd demostrating for democracy will be put down eventually by the military and Mubarak install martial law and keep power . February 2 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | The Middle East is a powderkeg . There has been so much tyranny and violence throughout this area since the dawn of civilization that few in the Middle East will either forgive or forget the past . Too bad , because they will end up disrupting many countries outside of the Middle East . Whats next ... thats easy ... the people of the middle east have had a look around and see themselves being left behind in the 20th century , or in th case of the middle east , the 19th century should they not get moving forward fast ... next is American and other business from around the world opening business there to grow the economy and get peoplw working ... if you area a bad political member be aware the internet is about to uncover your poor efforts ... February 2 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | Mobarak removed ? No risk for the Egyptians and Democracy , for the US and Israel we 'll lose a supporter and follower . February 2 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | Duop Chak , Colorado Springs , Colorado Jack , No doubt , the greater Middle East is heading to a rock solid . I don t think I can live in a country ruled by a King or something on that line because they like to impose their desires on ordinary citizens without consulting them . Dictators , Kings , queens or those who call themselves royal family should think again . It is getting uglier by seconds February 2 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | What 's next for the Middle East ? They 'll be issuing America an apology for all of the whining they did when we liberated Iraq and Afghanistan . Jack , now they 'll see the chaos that ensues when America 's helping hand is n't there . These failing countries are going to lead to a situation where the Middle East is entirely `` for sale '' to Al Qaeda , almost like office space . If America had done what it was supposed to do ten years ago , we would not only have liberated Iraq , but the entire Middle East . These type of situations would never be allowed to happen if U.S. military bases were around . what 's next is going to be better for the US and the people of the middle east . The arab world have been in solation for decades because of there dictatorial regimes and injustice . And , the problem they did n't do anything to there young people who needs to work and live like all human beings all over the world . Corrupted governments who they keep inflaming there people with speeches and hate towards the West and egnoring there injustice rule . So , I think Next will be Democracy for the Arab world and good relations with there neighbors and the world . Cooperation Which is needed in this century for all over the world . These people are asking for simple things like living in dignity and respect and be able to find jobs and being treated like human beings from there governemnt , and we should support those people February 2 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | It seems like the Arab nations are committing a Holocaust upon themselves . For them , some groups hate other groups of themselves . Some totally fear others . They all hate Israel and Jews . Israel must sit back not knowing whether all the Arab nations will eventually blame Israel for the Holocaust the Arab nations are committing upon themselves . It 's too impossible for The White House to figure out . Mubarak must be sitting back and laughing at them all . February 2 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | February 2 , 2011 at 6:24 pm | This barbarian is unleashing his pigs to massacre the egyptian youth the world has to stop him or this is gonna be God only knows what for everybody . An Egyptian American crying for immediate actions you February 2 , 2011 at 6:24 pm | What a question , just a continuation what has been going on already . The place is a powder keg just waiting for a match . Eventually it is all going to burn . February 2 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | It is time for this country and this administration to stand for what is right and for what America is all about and unequivocally be with the people of Egypt . What the Egyptians want is their Freedom from a tyrant and a dictator who oppressed them for 30 years -LRB- unfortunately with American aid and tax payer 's money -RRB- . Next `` God Willing '' Jack is Algeria , Jordan , Yemen , Syria , Saudi Arabia ... etc. . February 2 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | February 2 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | I hate Mubarak , and I want him to leave ! BUT let 's be HONEST , the reason he has been in power for 30years is partly our responsibility . Our generation let him , we did not have a revolution when he got re-elected the first time , the second time , the third time ... , ` God does not change what is upon a people until they change themselves ' ! This generation has made us all wake up . The bigger test to the success of this revolution is the next steps , the next elections , our reaction the next time someone is abused , the next time someone steals , the next time someone corrupts , that is the real test . Corruption in Egypt is more intrinsic then just in the government and just Mubarak -- the real revolution is an awakening of a country to uphold the values we Egyptians had forgotten , and when what is right is very distinct from what is wrong all the time !! Not just during the ten days of a revolution ! February 2 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | Wow , the whole world is in melt down mode , and people say the Bible is a hoax . Ha , the Lord on high laughs , This is happening beacuse men reap what they sow . Its not just happening here , thers stuff goin on all over the place , dont beleive me just watch the news . We havent seen anything yet . These are the last days that Jesus spoke of in Matthew chpt .24 , read it . Want to escape whats coming upon the earth than repent of your sins and beleive in the Lord Jesus Christ and u will be saved . Jesus said that the world would be as it was in the days of Noah before his return February 2 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | Let 's see these dictators fall !! At least this time the U.S. does n't have to get involved to make democracy happen ! February 2 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | Next is Sudan . Remember Sudan people led two uprising in the last 49 years and are ignited to close a half century with a third one . February 2 , 2011 at 6:27 pm | I truly think this is the beginning or the end ... the protester 's have already said they are ANTI American and Israeli and it they WIN and Mubarak just leaves the people who will go into power will turn Egypt into a BIGGER and more dangerous Iran . I fear for all the Middle East . February 2 , 2011 at 6:27 pm | What 's happening is a prelude to an Islamic super-state that will control OPEC for years to come . Get ready for seriously high energy costs . February 2 , 2011 at 6:27 pm | The genie is out , but the chaos will eventually result in extreme violence . Egyptians and Arabs will need to steel themselves and prepare to counter the nefarious individuals who will use violence to seize power . Al Jazeera will play an crucial role , and I am not optimistic that the news organization is up to the challenge . February 2 , 2011 at 6:28 pm | I do believe Washington D.C. best take note . People all over the globe are feeling their governments are not taking notice to their every day plight to servive and care for their famlies . I hope Washington recognizes that many in this country have similar concerns . Our leaders would be wise to understand this and stop these decades of non cooperation between parties . This country was founded upon civil unrest , it could happen again . First and formost , elected officials work for the American people , , , not some lobby , religious group , EXXON , WALLMART , or other big business . You in Washington ... get with it ... do not drive our country to the civil unrest that is happening in the Mid East . February 2 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | Just think about a tsunami sweeping across the Middle East that eventually sweeps to the shores of Israel . That 's what 's next , Jack . February 2 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | Please help the Egyptian people get the ARMY back to Tahrir Square !! Civil war is what is next and the demise of a very crucial Nation is at stake ! Please HELP !! February 2 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | Next is world leaders to stop supporting dictators , monarchy regimes in middle east and start the walk the walk of big talks of democracy , freedom and human rights . Some democratic governments will come out as we expect and some wo n't but that should n't let us support a dictator again . February 2 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | Whatever is next for the Middle East , I hope it does n't further involve US forces . As provocative as the past couple of weeks have been , the issues these citizens have been protesting against are the issues of their nation , and in all honesty , need to be addressed by the powers to be within their nation . My fear is that OUR nation somehow sees this as a problem WE need to fix . Hopefully , that will not be the case . February 2 , 2011 at 6:30 pm | The best we can do is stay out of the people 's way . Whatever governments are formed in the wake of this are going to need aid and when they come knocking on the rest of the world 's door for it -LRB- certainly oil-rich Arab countries like Saudi Arabia wo n't help them - they never give to crisis funds -RRB- , we should negotiate a peace agreement that gives them autonomy over their lands , natural resources and governments but puts pressure on accepting Israel . If they wo n't support that -- no aid . February 2 , 2011 at 6:30 pm | Remember back in the cold war when the Soviet Union was so concerned with western ` propaganda ' contaminating their population ? But they could n't stop the advancement of 20th century communications . It was inevitable that people living behind the Iron Curtain would learn what life was like outside . Now , thanks to 21st century communications via the web , something similar is happening in the middle east . A lot of what happens may be dependent on what they believe the rest of us have , which they have been denied . of the world feel the need to be cautious of what they say publicly maybe the rest of us need to signal our support and encourage the Egyptians to choose a secular democracy that will last instead of just another oppressive theocratic regime . February 2 , 2011 at 6:30 pm | Any conjecture from anyone is simply a guess at this point , Jack . What would be truly ironic , however , would be if Bush 's prophecy and hope for democratic states in the Middle East , came to pass . According to our highly esteemed Vice President , Mr. Biden , Egypt is already in that column . February 2 , 2011 at 6:30 pm | This is history being made right in front of our eyes . This is control by fear and the toxicity of shame being cast aside for democracy and freedom . This is absolute ideology that cripples everyone , even us , being shunned and replaced with truth and imagination by the youth in these countries . Whether the path to God is through Jesus , Abraham , Buddha , or Mohammad , the goal of all of us to come together at the feet of this one God we all seek no matter the path we take . And the young sisters and brothers of the Middle East are beginning on this path of unity and freedom . February 2 , 2011 at 6:31 pm | In the 21st Century , it becomes difficult to suppress and repress human beings . To say that we did not see this coming is foolish . Technology plays a very important role in people 's realization that they do not have to live the way the upper crust forces them to live . An awakening of this sort should not be discarded in the U.S. among the ethnic groups here . Hopefully I 'm wrong ! February 2 , 2011 at 6:31 pm | What is most concerning in the face of the sudden activity in the middle east is the fact that Pres Obama has demonstrated over and over again his absolute inability , or total intent not , to confront , criticise , restrict or take a stand against anything muslim . The only thing that is a predictable and clear outcome from what is going on is that The President needed to take a stand , and as usual , did not , and will notdo so in the future . His inability to stand up for democracy and american values , even in the face of muslims clearly independently demanding it , demostrates the total ineffectiveness of his perceived politically correct policy of non interfearance in muslim foreign affairs . It is totally pathetic that he does n't encourage their desire for freedom , and he does n't use the opportunity to warn against the Muslim Brotherhood who present such a threat to the future of their freedom . February 2 , 2011 at 6:31 pm | Please stop comparing Jordan to Tunisia and Egypt , Jordan has been a haven for refugees for decades , Iraqis , Palestinians , Armenians and Circassians -LRB- who were driven out by the Russians from the Caucausus . -RRB- Jordan is a modern and peaceful country , we have been affected by the rising food and oil prices like the rest of the world , it 's true that jobs are scarce due to the increase in the number of the population , but no one can call our King Abdullah a dictator . There have been calls for the dismissal of Samir Rifaai 's government for months and months , way before what had happened in Tunisia and Egypt , our country is in no way `` in danger '' nor are we `` nervous '' or part of this domino scheme you speak of . February 2 , 2011 at 6:32 pm | It certainly seems that middle east might change dramatically in near future as a result of current developments . I hope that these changes wo n't bring militant religious groups to power but will instead introduce new and strong pillars of democracy , individual freedom and stability to the world . February 2 , 2011 at 6:32 pm | What 's next is that corrupt politicians , military strongmen and anyone else capable of seizing control will double-think their own fate before designating themselves perpetual heads of state . And not just in the Middle East , but everywhere . The Egypt situation clearly shows the enormous power the general public has when it is able to organize and plan collectively . Sure , when the voices of the majority are faint and distant , the Musharrafs and al-Gadaffis of the world can plant themselves at the top and use economies as personal fortunes . But when the population integrates its anger , the guillotine is next . February 2 , 2011 at 6:33 pm | Jack , I am not sure what 's next but it seems that Egypt will destroy over thousands of years of history with the fires . Items that can never be replaced . Mummies that are their ancestors . I understand there pleas but why destroy what is their history in the process . February 2 , 2011 at 6:33 pm | To predict the future in the middle east has always been predictable . Rigged elections , payoffs to rivals and compliance by so called anti factions i.e. US and others same O same O. February 2 , 2011 at 6:34 pm | Do you mean whats next after the middle east ? Well lets try south east Asia -LRB- Bangladesh , and the likes , perhaps countries near Europe : Morocco , Turkey -RRB- Surprisingly Libya will remain relatively stable . America might want to review it 's exit strategy for the region . February 2 , 2011 at 6:34 pm | It is a question that no one can answer conclusively but will take time . If reform equals democracy ; Middle Eastern democracy will not look like American democracy . We in the west need to be open to facilitate the discussions with these countries for them to define what democracy is to them and not place our form of government and governing on them . We need to respect their culture -LRB- s -RRB- . How they do it and what it will look like will be different from how western governments govern but that is not to say that democracy in the Middle East will not work . February 2 , 2011 at 6:35 pm | The people of the Middle East and Africa have come to realize that , people 's power is the Key . This revolution wo n't be isolated only to the Middle East , I 'm convinced it will spread down to the Southern part of Africa harboring many dictators well over 80 , and wish to continue rulling . I think it 's time for people to excercise their power peacefully and kick out people like Mugabe of Zimbabwe , Paul Biya of Cameroon etc , who think dictatorship and bad governace is the way forward . It 's time to bring in modern and 21 st century leaders . February 2 , 2011 at 6:35 pm | Freedom is next . Do n't know what it will look like in the Middle East but the masses are ravienous for human rights . No hitting the snooze now -- watch out -- it 's going to be huge and they , the people will demand to be satiated ! February 2 , 2011 at 6:36 pm | I guess we 'll have to find another dictatror to send our prisoners for torture February 2 , 2011 at 6:36 pm | Are you kidding me Jack ? What 's next for the Muslims in the Middle East is currently being played out on the big screen . What 's next for the U.S. and the Western world depends on our ability to support the democratic ideals that we inspired in the first place . The U.S. must vacate the cowardice idea of supporting Mubarak in the presence of an uncertain outcome . This is our great opportunity to defy history and help forge a new path for the Middle East and a new future for our World . February 2 , 2011 at 6:36 pm | More instability without a doubt . I admire these people as they have the guts to step outside the box . They can see a threat to their freedoms and take complete charge of restoring them or broadening them , even if it means blood shed . Americans , the majority , think this reaction to their government is barbaric . I tend to think it is heroic . These countries have many visible patriots . They truly care about their future and their childrens . February 2 , 2011 at 6:38 pm | It will devolve into an Islamic , fundementalist , theocratic region . Egypt will partner with Iran and put pressure on the 2 remaining western-friendly states , Israel and Saudi Arabia . Democracy in this region of the world means mob rule . Without a foundation built on indiividual freedom , freedom of religion , separation of church and state , and equality for all citizens , democracy is no better than a dicatator . Without a nation of laws , protecting it 's people from the government and placing the rights of individuals above the moral dictates of the ruler , the majority will suppress the minorities , in this case , in the name of religious rights . People do n't seem to understand that Democracy is just a civilized way to transfer power and speaks nothing as to the nature of the power that will be wielded by the winners of elections . In this case the majority view women as inferior and have no tolerance of religions outside Islam . Indeed , good times are ahead of us . February 2 , 2011 at 6:39 pm | One of two things will happen in the Middle East . They will get a real democracy and hate the US or they will get a fundamentalist government , hate the US and do something about it . February 2 , 2011 at 6:39 pm | I 'm afraid I 'm not entirely sure who I should be rooting for -- or against -- in this one . As an American , I am genetically engineered to despise dictatorships : but as a weary citizen of the world , I am also wary of destabilization in highly sensitive areas . I see no Ghandis in this uprising : if I did , I think I 'd feel a bit more optimistic about the immediate future of the Middle East . February 2 , 2011 at 6:40 pm | Jack I just spoke with family in Cairo ... The Egyptian government are recruiting all government employees thru different ministries to organize a pro Mubarak protest tomorrow and Friday to show more support from ordinary people instead of rent a mob protesters . Employees who decide not to join the government will be accused of threatening the national security . February 2 , 2011 at 6:40 pm | February 2 , 2011 at 6:41 pm | Change must come , but violence can be tamped down by real choices and leadership . $ 2 a day earners are internet smart and know it is all about money and power . Change the instruments and policies . An oil energy dependent world is a tinderbox . Oil burns , just like a Molotov cocktail . Even Nigeria and Venezuela are part of the global picture . This is a global phenomenon , not only the Mid-East . Pakistan also understands food and fuel inflation . The wave effect is not just in sports stadia . February 2 , 2011 at 6:41 pm | Away overdue democratic tsunami overtaking Islamic nations . Whether we end up with regimes such as that of Turkey or Iran depends on how fast western democracies line up with the side of the masses . The vacillation of the Obama administration and other western democracies in dealing with Mubarak will prove to be destructive to western interests for decades to come . What 's next is that corrupt politicians , military strongmen and anyone else capable of seizing control will double-think their own fate before designating themselves perpetual heads of state . And not just in the Middle East , but everywhere . The Egypt situation clearly shows the enormous power the general public has when it is able to organize and plan collectively . Sure , when the voices of the majority are faint and distant , the Musharrafs and al-Gadaffis of the world can plant themselves at the top and use economies as personal fortunes . But when the population integrates its anger , the guillotine is inevitable . February 2 , 2011 at 6:43 pm | Only God knows what is next . Who 'd have expected that a frustrated guy in Tunisia could 've sparked all of this . The pressure has been on for a very long time , and too much pressure causes explosion . There are important points that we all should learn from this . Most importantly , in my own opinion is to support the new generation . Those who are protesting peacefuly . We need to show that the protesting peacefuly is the right thing to do , and that resorting to violence is not the answer . We are witnesses the generation of Face Book and Twitter facing off with the generation of horses and camels . If we do the right thing , I can see a different , more peaceful Middle East . Information Technology did not only allow people in the Middle East to express their views , but more importantly , allowed them to see democracy at work in America and Europe , and they deserve no less . This is good for everybody including Israel . February 2 , 2011 at 6:44 pm | Middle East should form a METO just like NATO . Stop fighting each other . Stand side by side and fight everyone who bring war upon METO . February 2 , 2011 at 6:44 pm | America 's Leadership makes decisions by watching the polls and seeing which way the wind is blowing ... because they refuse to stand on absolute values . Thus they appear wishy washy and make poor decisions and lose credibility with the rest of the world . February 2 , 2011 at 6:45 pm | These governments have been leaders in repression for centuries . Fear eventually leads to repression and ignorance . Those who push this fear and supression eventually receive their reward -- revolution . February 2 , 2011 at 6:45 pm | What eds to happen . There needs to be an election held and the winners in each nation should be elevated to the position . Once the American people have spoken the rest of the world needs to sit back and let us take over . February 2 , 2011 at 6:47 pm | This is like a 21st century enlightenment . The domino effect has been so powerful that it is impossible to tell where it will stop . All those who are in power today in that part of the world thought they could oppress the people , exert as much pressure as they wanted to ; silence the educated and knowledgeable ; limit freedom of speech ... the public apparently had been getting ready and they needed something to pull the trigger . That was pulled in Tunisia and the ripples are speading around in all directions . where would it end ? at the Black Sea ? February 2 , 2011 at 6:48 pm | We should revert to verbal neutrality with regards to the transition in Egypt and in the Region . The North Africans know what they want and the timetables for change and governmental restructuring . We ca n't possibly know what all the people want and what is best for them . Our suggestions will only alienate us with one segment of the population or another . It 's not our civil war . February 2 , 2011 at 6:49 pm | What 's next is the following : \\* The insurrection now occuring in Egypt will ensue in Morocco , Sudan , Saudi Arabia and Kurwait as well as Libyia and Chad . \\* Mubarak will either step down as ASAP or be summarily removed . \\* There will be some economic disruption to the economies of the Arab world which will impact the rest of the world \\* Progressive political and more importantly , economic changes will occur in the Arab world . The rest of the world may well benefit from these changes . February 2 , 2011 at 6:50 pm | Next is what will be the first time EVER an Arab country wil Actually ELECT a president and not just accept someone shoved down their throat . The young-in-Hair regimes have reached what they have been trying to evade all along hiding behind boogy-men such as the Muslim Brotherhood to scare off any attempts of calls to Democracy . Alleging that THEIR presence is important to fend off any rise of such groups to power . Hosni game has been dealt the final hand . He has been making the wrong choices all along but has been lucky . Well , time caught up with him and the band of bandits that stole everything from their people . Ghaddafy , is next . February 2 , 2011 at 6:51 pm | as a student living in beirut i have to say that the only way for us to develop is for these totalitarian regimes to dissappear . we need to catch uo to the world and thats not gna happen without freedom and democracy . February 2 , 2011 at 6:52 pm | Jack Cafferty sounds off hourly on the Situation Room on the stories crossing his radar . Now , you can check in with Jack online to see what he 's thinking and weigh in with your own comments online and on TV . Would you ride in a car that drives itself ? Is she the answer ?

How can we defend equal rights and justice abroad and continue to look the other way at home ? February 2 , 2011 at 1:27 pm | If teabaggers took over this country , violent protests would be necessary . The rest of us have to stand up to them . February 2 , 2011 at 1:28 pm | First of all I would n't be in a violent protest . I would protest saying our Government should not interfear with any other country 's problems . Mind our own business we have enough to worry about in our one country . Let other countries and cultures handle their own problems they do n't want anyone telling them what to do in their own country especially the USA . Most countries hate us to begin with . We do n't let anyone tell us how to run our country and we should n't teel them how to run theirs . If we mind our own business and stay out of other countries we wo n't have any problems with them . If they want to destroy their country or their people let them . We should only get involved with another country if they attack us . We have enough to worry about securing our borders keeping the illeglas and terroists out of our country . February 2 , 2011 at 1:30 pm | dont tell them anything they can use against protest or people trying to organize against the gov. dont believe them they will use your opinions and will tell them gov. so when something happens they know what will tick people off . Dont trust them for anything . February 2 , 2011 at 1:42 pm | Just want to suggest why do n't you folks do a little blurb on how Mubarak became who he is . . starting from the kingdom , ... to Nassar ... to Anwar Sadaat ... I think people would like to know this . I would never participate in a violent protest . There is no justification for harming others . I 've been involved in protests against the Iraq war . I might participate in a protest for anything I felt was justified and if the protest would help raise public opinion . I 'm glad we have the right to voice our opinions in this country , though it 's too bad that some have to go too far and hurt others . February 2 , 2011 at 1:56 pm | February 2 , 2011 at 1:57 pm | If we had the courage of our founders , we would already be in the streets . February 2 , 2011 at 2:13 pm | I have a question actually : Is a written protest -LRB- let 's say an official document with the people 's concerns and doubts about governments actions , with , let 's say , 3 millions signatures -RRB- a strong impact as a physical protest on the streets ? Would we the people have a pacific way to express ourselves and get things done if not personally going out there chanting our thoughts out and possibility getting into troubling violent protests . If the government has the power to flick its pen and INK their laws and rules on us ... why we do n't have that option powered as much as they do ? Is our ink perhaps invisible ?? February 2 , 2011 at 2:13 pm | I would protest violently is the Jersey Shore gets picked up for another season . February 2 , 2011 at 2:14 pm | If they turned off my internet I would hit the streets like mad max on roids . February 2 , 2011 at 2:14 pm | I would be willing to protest if our freedom was being threatened . I do not want to live in a Socialist country . I love America and I want it to stay free . February 2 , 2011 at 2:15 pm | I would protest if Obama got re-elected or someone like him got in office and screwed the U.S.A. some more ! February 2 , 2011 at 2:15 pm | I would protest violently if the `` Jersey Shore '' gets picked up for another season . February 2 , 2011 at 2:15 pm | When the Republican Party causes the Middle-class people to suffer to a point that they can not live anymore . especially caused by their greediness and not wanting to pay their taxes for their country ! February 2 , 2011 at 2:16 pm | Please stop using the term `` pro-government '' or `` pro-Mubarak '' demonstrators . These people on camel and horseback are policemen . They use the mounted police to control crowds at soccer games in Egypt and the camel mounted are border patrol police . My brother could see from his balcony in Maadi -LRB- south of Cairo -RRB- the buses bringing the paid crowds from Helwan -LRB- a poor industrial suburb of Cairo -RRB- into downtown . Please have your team on the ground investigate properly and put the right spin on things . February 2 , 2011 at 2:16 pm | if my country ruled by one person for 30yrs , ofcourse i would protest . if the people dont like the president why he wants be a president for ? February 2 , 2011 at 2:16 pm | I would take to the streets if my second amendment rights were being taken away . If honest people ca n't have arms , only criminals will have guns . February 2 , 2011 at 2:16 pm | I would protest via the vote , my life is too precious for me to run out to the streets and risk getting hurt or killed . Pardon my saying but these violent protests that have been going on in the last few months are barbaric . February 2 , 2011 at 2:16 pm | The government forcing me to buy health insurance is more than enough for me to protest in the streets ... and I 'll be armed , not throwing rocks . February 2 , 2011 at 2:17 pm | February 2 , 2011 at 2:18 pm | I have protested in the streets several times in this country . What has caused me to protest is when a government lies to its people , such as the Bush 's invasion of Iraq , or Reagan 's support of the Contras in Nicaragua in the 1980s . I have never been involved in a violent protest , but I can understand the strong feelings that can lead to it . February 2 , 2011 at 2:18 pm | If the birth of the Karl Rove mind control machine , the use of religion as politics , and the loss of science as a frame of reference for America has not made me take to the streets , I do n't know what will ! February 2 , 2011 at 2:18 pm | `` The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants . '' The words of our very own Thomas Jefferson , I say we stay out of Egypt and let it happen we have enough of our own problems ! Themedia keeps asking `` what will President Obama do about the uprising ? '' Why should he do anything at all ? When did the United States of AMERICA become everyones mother ? February 2 , 2011 at 2:19 pm | i would protest if my kids and i had no hope , no job , and no freedom for 30years and to have a dictator like president mubarak . February 2 , 2011 at 2:22 pm | February 2 , 2011 at 2:23 pm | Americans should protest when Hillary Clinton is inside the DNC convention while Americans are being mistreated and abused by police and than she says the people of Egypt have the right to protest . February 2 , 2011 at 2:24 pm | I will fly to Washington and New York to Protest . Against the US Government and Goldman Sachs . If the US Government does not prosecute Goldman Sachs for corruption of the Congress for them to allow the limits to be removed for Speculators to drive up the cost of commodities , then I will never stop protesting . This has driven up food prices , like they did in Credit Default Swaps that crashed the stock market and the housing markets . The spike in oil prices . Creating high food prices and exacerbating hunger in the world should be a prosecutable offense . These are crimes against humanity and this company should be prosecuted and dismantled . February 2 , 2011 at 2:24 pm | If the people are n't out in the streets protesting Wall Street and the Bankers for what they did to this country and for reform of the system , they never will . Insane wars , nothing . Insane gun laws , nothing . February 2 , 2011 at 2:24 pm | I am Egyptian and i am protesting for many many reasons , fraud election for 3o years under Mubarak rule , very very corrupt oligarch that left poverty for most of Egyptians . Now in Liberation Square in Egypt mubarak 's armed militia are terrorizing peaceful protesters and in many other cities . please help us !!!! February 2 , 2011 at 2:25 pm | I would never engage in a violent protest , and never would engage in a protest that hurts the image , economy and political relationships of my country . And most certainly wo n't damage the public and private property of fellow Egyptians . Egyptians who are on the street in Tahrir Square do not realize the negative consequences of their actions and that they are shooting theirselves in the foot . They should stop , listen and learn the definition of Democracy , Economy and Politics before they decide to engage in such absurd violent acts . And step back to see the reforms actually taking place . February 2 , 2011 at 2:25 pm | For poverty , hunger and no jobs . When seeing especially your children , the younger generating suffering from all of that , you do n't have anything left to care about . February 2 , 2011 at 2:26 pm | If there 's anything I should be protesting for right now , I will be protesting against the use of violence in the name of `` Freedom of Speech '' and Democracy February 2 , 2011 at 2:27 pm | If a single governing power was in control over an extended period of years and began to overturn toward that of a Communist like government , pushing it upon the people and the country . If this lead to the downfall of our human rights and freedoms , that would be something worth protesting for and taking to the streets considering we have military fighting daily in other countries for our rights . If we do n't fight for it , then who will ? Your choice to fill air time by inviting responses to such an inane , pointless hypothetical question is the last straw . From here on , I will switch channels when I see you on the screen . Thousands of Egyptians from all walks of life are risking all for the sake of positive change in their country , and your response is this ? Your question is a grievous insult to every Egyptian and a contemptible trivialization of the continuing events in Egypt - events that are important for human beings around the world . It is not that you merely lack empathy . You clearly do not understand the power of the medium that pays you so handsomely ; and you obviously do not take the news , your viewers , your job , or humanity seriously at all . At the next report of famine in Africa will you invite brainless viewers to send you recipe ideas , or comment on how they felt the last time they missed a mid-afternoon snack ? It matters not to me , because I wo n't be watching . Shame on you , and shame on CNN . Alan Misenheimer February 2 , 2011 at 2:30 pm | The people in Egypt have the right to protest . Their lives are terrible over their because of what I call a dictator . There is no democracy and that is NOT fair . Goverments , Presidents , Leaders , Prime Misinters etc. have NO right to supress their people . They are supposed to listen to what the people say and GUIDE them . What a shame this has lead to the violence . Mubarak must have had an idea that the people would become frustrated after 6 days and things could worsen , BUT he did n't care . My opinion is he has blood on his hands . Let 's face it . . after 30 years , it 's time to go . This is 2011 everywhere , times have changed . ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS GO AWAY ! American citizens are strong and intellegent ... I do not believe enough Americans would gather and turn violent . . I for one ... WOULD NOT ! February 2 , 2011 at 2:30 pm | if people said that they wont need the leader any more i believe that there is a big reason that made all of those people to go out and protest , and in Egypt people are dying suffering living for 2 $ a day !!! for the God sake what kind of life that a person could live for only two dollars a day !! emagine that this person has a family to support , kids , parents , wife or what ever ... who could survive for only 2 $ aday , while Mubarak got money from the USA every year around 1.5 bilion dollar !! what the hell did he do with this money !! why is it always work like this at the Arab countries where the government is rich and people are poor the same in Sirya , Jordan , Arabia Saudia and others ... why it musr be this way !!! is it right that arab leaders believe in '' If you want to have peace in your country you must have a poor people so that they will obay you no matter what !!!! '' February 2 , 2011 at 2:30 pm | I am not familiar with the Egyptian government system , but I keep hearing words like President Mubarak will not seek re-election and he will not be on the ballot again in Sept. . My question is , if they hated the President so much why if there were elefctions did the Egyptian people keep VOTING him into office over the last 30 years ?? February 2 , 2011 at 2:32 pm | It has been standard oper . procedure for gov ` t. to spend EVERY extra dime collected from revenues for decades . There has never been any thought to saving for a `` rainy day '' . This is a recipe for disaster . That said , the Soc . `` Trust '' Fund has become a hot-potato . There is talk about moving back the age for `` full retiremenmt '' age , lowering cost of living raises , and even turning over the `` fund '' to the private sector . Now that the Fed has sucked it dry to the tune of 2-5 TRILLION dollars , they want to hand it off to somebody else . If the Fed tries to evade its ratified and inferred contract to manage and disperse the fund with `` trust '' , -LRB- see '' early English law -RRB- our monies extracted thru legal extortion , all Hell is going to break loose . There are millions of Americans already living at or below the poverty level . They can not sacrifice that which is theirs already . I will be in the FRONT of the protestors . I will have nothing left to lose . February 2 , 2011 at 2:33 pm | One Reason for Peaceful Protest is When Freedom of Religion is expunged from the Public Arena . The turmoil in Egypt is incongruous to the original intent of those involved . Both sides were eager to effect a rap-rosh-ma to their bitter feud that unfortunately turned into violence . -LRB- ISAIAH Chapter 19 -RRB- -LRB- KJV -RRB- gives an in-depth prediction of the future of Egypt . this is why I do n't normally bother with these things ... ... ... NavyCWO4 February 2nd , 2011 2:23 pm ET Obamacare and I 'll be armed with semi-auto !! February 2 , 2011 at 2:37 pm | i went to a protest last night in front of the egyptian embassy in ny . i think ev1 needs to be free . i think all the egyptians need to ban together and fight for freedom . no one deserves to be treated like dirt . whats going on over there now is soooo very sad , FREE FREE EGYPT ! February 2 , 2011 at 2:50 pm | If i knew that no matter how hard i worked for a better life and that my destiny is still going to be living in poverty then a protest is definitely needed . February 2 , 2011 at 2:50 pm | Israel future would be promising with democratic neighbors not with dictator oppresses his people . i am sure Israel economy would be more stronger and it would lead the region only when there is justice peace between people in the middle east . We should remember that before 1948 Jewish Egyptian businessmen were admired by the rest of Egyptians because they were honest and trustworthy . February 2 , 2011 at 2:51 pm | I think I would if it was nessessary and it could become nessessary . These days things have gotten to wherethe government is not for the people . I do not think I plan on doing so anytime soon though . February 2 , 2011 at 2:55 pm | After reading some of the comments on here , I 'm not sure America is ready for a revolution . The divide amongst the people in this nation is sometimes seemingly wider than the divide between people who call themselves revolutionaries make between themselves and corrupt , oppressive governments . Indeed , something of extraordinary magnitude would be required in my opinion to ever close that divide we have between the people . At that point , we would maybe be ready for a revolution , but for only one thing , TO SHOW OUR UNITY AS A PEOPLE , and for nothing else ! February 2 , 2011 at 2:55 pm | Everyone talks about how it is unconstitutional to require everyone to have health insurance , but no one ever mentions the most obvious parallel . Auto insurance is required in most states . In South Carolina if your insurance is dropped you are charged $ 5 a day for every day that you are uninsured . If the health care mandate is found unconstitutional then I would love for the auto insurance mandate to also be found unconstitutional . Do n't get me wrong , I 'm all for mandated health insurance . I 'm 44 and I 've had health insurance for 2 years of my adult life . My employer for instance is making all the full-timers part-time so they do n't have to give them benefits . February 2 , 2011 at 2:59 pm | I 'm ready to go to the streets now for what the Federal Reserve has done to this country . I am ashamed of our government which is run by the Federal Reserve and the destruction they have caused the American people who have lost so many homes . If I had the money because everything takes money , I would want to encourage and organize us all to stop making our mortgage payments all at once and maybe that will show them how tired we are all of struggling to feed our families while they all still enjoy solid gold faucets in their homes . Yes , I believe that Egypt has gone to the streets for the same reasons and I just wonder when it may happen here in our streets . How much more can we take . The suicide rate has skyrocketed and where will it all end ? February 2 , 2011 at 3:03 pm | We traveled through Egypt this past September and were in Cairo . If you 've been there you saw what was worth protesting for ... by day the residential sections of the inner city look like ghost towns . But if you look carefully you see that people are living there in that multitude of apartment buildings that are unfinished , like the builders ran out of money and abandoned them . There are no window panes , no lights or doors ... only empty hulls housing the people of Cairo , who are forced to `` steal '' electricity by connecting illegally somewhere else and then hide what they 're doing . You know they are there only because you see their laundry hung out to dry in the mornings ... nights are dark so as not to attract attention to their existence . We were told this was government corruption at work ... buildings would go up and then the government would shut down construction claiming it was illegal . And yet there the people lived , everywhere , illegally and so without any government services available to them . We saw mountains of trash literally mounded and heaped all along the waterways and were told that the government contracted out trash service to another country that never performed ... looked to us more like that money might never have really gone anywhere in the first place ; but clearly no trash or disposal service existed anywhere that we could see . February 2 , 2011 at 3:04 pm | I believe I can protest on the streets if my president does not fullfil and deliver the required leadership that is going to benefitial to his people and his administration . But now like Mubarak , it is authorotrian\\/dictatorship 30 years without improvement in the country as well as the Egyptian people whatsoever . Its now right for the Egptian people yo do whatever is possible for them to oust Mubarak from power so that democracy can prevail in Egypt . February 2 , 2011 at 3:08 pm | How horrendous to bring animals into such a human disaster ... are we back in the middle ages with the Inquisition ? If we allow such horror to become acceptable on the streets of Egypt , as a world , let us stop this madness . Please President Hosni Mubarak , please step forward and denounce this violence on behalf of his support . If he does not do anything to stop this , he should be removed immediately by the army . The government clearly needs a special leader to step forward and express the will of the masses of people , who were non-violent in nature . I hope this demonstration is resolved and these people are treated with the respect they surely deserve . Protest ONE more federal or state job created before they fire , retire and strip the benefits of the thousands of them who have done nothing but collect and succumb their whole sorry lives . Then protest one day for every dollar of foreign aid unless it goes DIRECTLY to qualified non-profit organizations for the relief of people suffering . Once each and every politician learns this , we 'll be okay . February 2 , 2011 at 3:20 pm | The U.S. needs to start taking care of it 's own people . There are no jobs , no S.S. increase , people are losing their homes , food prices are rising , no health insurance and no future for the younger generation ! February 2 , 2011 at 3:23 pm | Lost my home , lost my car , lost all my money , lost my good credit , and unemployed for over 38 months . And the people that '' have '' stay , just be happy with nothing so we can enjoy our life . '' '' That 's what they are protesting about in Egypt . A very small amount of people with to much , and a very large amount of people with to little . '' PROTEST '' There is only one way this world '' not just Egypt '' is going to change . Do I sound angry , what do I have to be angry about . Anger is to small of a word for what I am . February 2 , 2011 at 3:29 pm | Can US Goverment support democracy now February 2 , 2011 at 3:45 pm | Simply put , I 'm ready to hit the streets now ! I am tired to death of watching our government shove money at the Wall Street barron-thieves and the multi-national corporate interests while attacking what little assistance the middle class and poor receive to balance the ledger . Example : for the first time in decades , the amount received by those on SSI has stayed flat for 2 years running while there is -LRB- ha-ha -RRB- `` no inflation '' to adjust for because the government -LRB- conveniently -RRB- took food and fuel out of the index calculation . These folks ca n't work even ONE HOUR PER WEEK at minimum wage without having reductions in their piddly disability payments ! But I 'm sure the poor can appreciate that the cost of private planes , luxury cars and vacation homes is much lower ! Our president is complicit in this scheme to give more and more to the richest in America while looking to the rest of us to pay for it . But what easier target is there than the poor , the handicapped and the informationally challenged to steal from ? It 's only a matter of time until Americans wake up and serious , violent class warfare breaks out . And the U.S. is not like Egypt where no one there seems to have a gun ... February 2 , 2011 at 4:20 pm | Some of the comments on this topic are beyond moronic . How about protesting when the government reaches beyond its Constitutional authority ? Nope -- apparently that 's too complicated for most on here to understand . Instead , we get idiotic social security justifications . Can you be any more selfish ? I swear , our founders would be so very ashamed of what we have become . We do not deserve the sacrifice they made . February 2 , 2011 at 6:02 pm | Nothing would make me ready to burn the country . Not being wronged by a corrupt government or anything else . Killing to repay for killing has not worked in the last 1000 years and will not work in the next 1000 . Let 's give love and kindness a chance . Kindness to repay cruelty . Bryan i think you and i had agreed that cnn is obligated to co-operate with the gov. and use this opinions against us . People think this opinions related blogs are innocent and harmless but their a great tool for the gov. to use against us and control the masses . They know now what most of us are thinking . People just blog stuff that gives them selfs away . Knowing is have the battle cheesy catch phrase but its true . U.S might not have won many wars but they know from experience how manipulate people and gov. to do their will . February 2 , 2011 at 8:08 pm | Who 's says it has to be violent ? We can have a strong protest without it being violent . Martin Luthern King prooved that . Thank you !! February 2 , 2011 at 9:38 pm | I would protest if I felt that policies put in place by the Government would cause my children to suffer . I am very fortunate to be a female born in the United States . February 2 , 2011 at 9:41 pm | i would protest if they tried to take away my freedom to love jesus . . people are hurting each other over the color of skin and how much money you have ... . . it is really small if you look at the big picture . and for those that think that there is freedom there is no such thing unless you are white . February 2 , 2011 at 9:51 pm | Protest ? What is happening in Egypt is a REVOLUTION . A protest is what happens at the G20 summit . This here is an uprising , a true revolution . So the real question you should be asking is , `` What would you revolt for ? '' February 2 , 2011 at 10:34 pm | Is mainland China allowing its people to be informed of the situation in Egypt , or is their government afraid the people will `` get ideas ? '' Do you think any other countries will revolt like Egypt has ? February 3 , 2011 at 12:11 am | Your car model affects your premium . You wo n't get these numbers from your insurer ; in fact , you may not be able to get them at all get all the facts from clearance auto insurance website February 3 , 2011 at 1:10 am | How could you tcouse -LRB- y 'm franch-canadien -RRB- galiany to coment on the situation on egipt considering is vies on Izreal and the link he made wih the terorist of 911 nand wath is the situation in israel ! This person should not have a say in that situation-it 's misgiden eaven dengerus ! February 3 , 2011 at 3:26 am | Not to sound all mushy about being an American , but I ca n't think of one darn thing that would get me out there swinging a baseball bat , except for a baseball . In this country we do n't have to step outside our homes to protest . We can make a nice cup of tea and do it at our computers . Down with ... something ! February 3 , 2011 at 11:21 am | I 'm a christian Egyptian . I see a great danger in forcing Mubarak to step down now . This will destabilise Egypt & throw it into chaos . So please understand that this could lead to a civil war in Egypt & a revolution by the Islamists . February 3 , 2011 at 11:25 am | If religious people changed the rules for separation between church and state . February 3 , 2011 at 12:47 pm | An unjust law is no law at all Saint Augustine I would protest for not having a job and being able to feed my family I would protest for the fear implanted in the hearts of people I would protest for no future that we could see coming ahead Ali bin Abitalib said if poverty was a man , I would have killed him February 3 , 2011 at 1:16 pm | Ultra rich corporations\\/people have bought and sold our democracy . We no longer elect our leaders . The corporations that finance our elections do . And politicians know this . Therefore they know that when elected they work for corporate interests , not American interests . Why are the Banks , financial service companies , insurance companies that caused this recession and were bailed out with our tax dollars -LRB- not theirs , since they do n't pay taxes -RRB- right back to making record profits and the average american is still struggling with no end in sight ? I think that this is the biggest threat to our democracy and we should be out in the streets demanding that elections are reformed so that they can no longer purchase the power that should be ours by right . February 3 , 2011 at 1:19 pm | Ali you have to dig deeper into `` The Muslim Brotherhood '' for the people ! Dont take what they 're saying now as fact and dont believe it ! If the want to change something now then maybe they should change there own constitution which says they dont recognize Israel , they want sharia -LRB- sp -RRB- law , womens rights , etc. !!! Im absolutely not in favor of Mubarick but you have to ivestigate further on the this subject they are not good yet they are the only organized group in Egypt !!!!!!!!! February 3 , 2011 at 1:54 pm | I hope that Egypt and all of those countries tear israel apart and finally get rid of those bastards . After learning of the USS Liberty and what happened to cover up the deaths of innocent Americans , israel can rot in he -- ll for all I care . February 3 , 2011 at 2:05 pm | Gee , lets see , standing up against teabaggers . I do n't think 3000 against 200,000,000 teabaggers would be very good odds . February 3 , 2011 at 2:53 pm | Your comment talking down to those who are concerned about the erosion of our U.S. constitutional rights was very offensive . You say because dictator run countries repress their people , we should be thankful that we have the rights we do . We have them because some people love our country enough to work to protect these rights . We are the only country in the world that has defined those rights . It is hard to understand how huge numbers of people like yourself , could take protecting them so lightly . You just do n't get what a great country America was originally designed to be . I was raised in the 1950s and it is very obvious to me that America as the Land of the Free is barely breathing on life support . Maybe you should do a piece on it . Some honest work and research may just clue you in what America used to be about . Some had wonderfully free lives . Americans should fight hard to raise those who do n't to the same level . Not lower American freedoms for everyone . There is a critical mass working hard to chip away at our basic rights . The small percentage of them we have left . I do enjoy your show . Would watch more if you raised it a few I.Q. points . February 3 , 2011 at 3:15 pm | When they tell me I ca n't believe in MY GOD ANYMORE !!!!!!! When I ca n't go to church and worship my Lord and Savior . Everyone needs to wake up soon , because the Lord is coming and everyone will have to answer then . February 3 , 2011 at 3:42 pm | It did n't start there , it wo n't stop there , but the whole world watched as the people of the nation united , not just for their own good , but for the good of their neighbors , their brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers . They united against oppression and injustice . They united to show the world that a king , a dictator , or even an entire federal government is NOTHING without the support of its people . I think the wording of your question is irresponsible . Asking `` What would make you angry enough to participate in a violent protest ? '' implies that violence is acceptable , when it is n't . Nothing justifies the rock and molotov cocktail throwing or running people down with a car . The question should have been `` Would you ever participate in a violent protest , and , if so , what would make you do that ? '' The answer should be `` No , I would n't . '' I find it scary that some people indicate they would actually resort to violence , especially since most of the people responding live here in the USA . They are talking about possibly inflicting death or seriious injury on people -- is this what we 've become ? By the way , there was a lot of talk after the Arizona shooting about talk inciting violence . I think you should think twice about the way you word your questions in the future . February 3 , 2011 at 8:44 pm | For what would you protest ? Your question suggests that American do n't protest . I would have agreed with that before the Obama administration , and the Republican and Tea Party demonstrations these past two years . John Mayer `` Waitiing '' is no longer . We protest , but we have a democratic system that listens to us so protesters do n't have to go to the extreme that Egypt is . I protested for my union in San Diego , twice . There are lots of ways to protest . I 've been protesting against homelessness and substandard housing through Habitat for Humanity since 1999 . Protesting is n't always with sticks and stones , sometimes it 's with a hammer and nail . February 5 , 2011 at 12:25 am | Again what makes me angry is the people who despite the fact that the president announced that he will leave , they still there demonstrating . A simple employee in a modest company would give a month notice before he leaves , what about a country like Egypt . ? please go back to work this is what Egypt needs now , Egypt needs the youth the people to protect her not to destroy her . He will leave he has dignity and pride . February 5 , 2011 at 7:01 am | I would take to the streets to force reform on our banks . Both the Democrats and Republicans receive too much re-election money from Wall Street and will not put in true reform without protests from the public . February 11 , 2011 at 7:10 pm | I agree with Robert from Tulsa `` If we had the courage of our founders , we would already be in the streets . '' Look around , the government has been taking over for years now . Funding for the Arts & Humanities ? I could go on and on with the list of funding for the American people that is or will be gone . Even our money system is controlled by the Federal Reserve -- which is a PRIVATE corporation , NOT controlled by the government . In Wisconsin they are basically trying to abolish the Union -- that was enough to make them protest -LRB- go Wisconsin ! -RRB- . The banks and big corporations have been bailed out with billions upon billions of taxpayer dollars -- but the unemployed are being denied funds . Wire tapping , internet kill switches , surveillance -- all without warrant . Really people , look around . Things are not as rosy as you would like them to be . There is so much more to be angry about . We are not the countries that are protesting , but we are headed in that direction quickly . I would protest for our Rights , our Constitution , the things that our Founding Fathers believed in -- when the People get angry enough to do something about it . One person a Revolution does not make .

He wo n't install his son to replace him , he said . He also has asked his political opponents `` to re-engage in dialogue in hopes of reaching a sustainable and reconcilable political agreement , '' the Yemeni government said . Saleh made the announcement as unprecedented protests sweep across North Africa and the Middle East . The demonstrations have forced Tunisia 's president from office , and they prompted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to say Tuesday he would not run for re-election this year . King Abdullah of Jordan , meanwhile , has sacked his government and appointed a new prime minister in the face of protests there . In Yemen , Saleh had called an emergency parliamentary meeting ahead of a `` day of rage '' protests scheduled for Thursday . The protests -- which have also caught on to various extents in Algeria and Sudan -- have proved to be `` a real watershed event for the Arab world , '' said Blake Hounshell , managing editor of Foreign Policy magazine . `` It 's really unprecedented . '' Saleh has been in office for 32 years and was last re-elected in 2006 . High-ranking officials around him have started obtaining ordinary passports for themselves and their families -- in addition to the official diplomatic ones they already carry -- as the unrest spreads , Arab diplomatic sources in the capital of Sanaa told CNN . `` There is a lot of trepidation here and no one wants to be in the situation that Ben Ali found himself in after he was forced flee , '' one source said , declining to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation . The Tunisian government recently canceled the official passports of deposed leader Zine El Abedine Ben Ali and his family . In recent weeks , thousands of people have taken to the streets in Yemen demanding the kind of change that forced Ben Ali from office last month . Some of the protesters have called for Saleh to step down as president . Earlier this year , Yemen 's parliament began debating proposed amendments to the country 's constitution . The measures , which would cancel presidential term limits , have sparked concerns among the opposition that Saleh might try to appoint himself president for life . On Wednesday , Saleh said he has requested his party to freeze debate on the proposed amendments until a consensus is reached . The opposition coalition , Joint Meeting Parties -LRB- JMP -RRB- , said the president 's speech was not enough and called on its followers to continue with Thursday 's planned march , said Hakim Almasmari , editor in chief of the Yemen Post . A day earlier , the president also ordered the release of journalist Abdul Elah Haidar Shaye who was sentenced to five years in jail last month after he was convicted of collaborating with al Qaeda in Yemen , according to the country 's official news agency , SABA .

Send your video and images to CNN iReport . -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mohamed Bouazizi , a 26-year-old unemployed college graduate from Tunisia , began a fruit and vegetable stand to earn a living . But he did not have a permit . In December , the local police came after him . `` The police not only confiscated his stand , but they also beat him up , '' said Khadija Cherif of the Federation of Human Rights Leagues , a Paris-based group . His death helped spark a revolution that led to the ouster of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , who 'd ruled Tunisia for 23 years . Since then , unrest has engulfed North Africa and the Middle East , with protesters taking to the streets in Algeria and Egypt , Jordan and Yemen . From a lack of economic opportunities for vast segments of society to governments that provide little say for citizens , there are many factors behind the current demonstrations . But a significant one is the frustration of a generation of young people in the region struggling to support themselves and their families . Violence boils over in Cairo ' A cloud of rocks in the sky ' Cooper recounts being attacked in Cairo Protesters filling the streets in Yemen The region is now home to more than 100 million young people between the ages of 15 to 29 , according to `` Generation in Waiting , '' a book edited by Navtej Dhillon and Tarik Yousef that explores the challenges facing this age group . Most countries in the region have high rates of school enrollment at the primary level . And many have high achievement at the secondary level , according to data collected and analyzed by Samantha Constant and Mary Kraetsch of the Middle East Youth Initiative at the Brookings Institution . But the data can be deceptive . `` They 're getting the schooling , but it 's very poor quality schooling , '' said Ragui Assaad , an expert in the politics and economics of the Middle East and North Africa at the University of Minnesota . He is also affiliated with the Brookings Institution . `` You have tremendous expansion in schooling , more than any other parts of the world in terms of rates of growth of enrollment . But -LRB- it is -RRB- very low quality schooling that does n't provide you with any skills that are useful in the labor market . '' Rany Ibrahim , 32 , who left Cairo , Egypt , in 2003 to study in Canada , told CNN iReport that the public university system there was `` really bad . '' `` I did n't feel I got the education I deserved , '' he said . `` You get the degree , but you feel like you do n't know much . '' Ibrahim said the class sizes were large , and there was little personal time with professors . `` The professors do n't have the power to teach freely , -LRB- and -RRB- the technology is very old , '' Ibrahim said . `` Instead of having a few entrusted qualified graduates , you have many , many graduates but with really poor education . '' For previous generations in these countries , there were two job options after schooling : the private sector or the public sector . However , because of the poor quality of education , it 's difficult for many of this generation to get a quality job in the private sector , Assaad said . Meanwhile , jobs in the public sector -- essentially those provided by the government -- are shrinking as economies transition from a state-led to market-led mode of development and the number of people grows . `` Employers know a government degree is worth nothing , that they do n't really learn much , '' said Ibrahim , the Egyptian expatriate The oil-rich countries in the Gulf -- Oman or the United Arab Emirates , for example -- are an exception , Assaad said . They can still deliver on the bargain because of oil revenue . Across the region , unemployment rates are about 11 percent , according to `` Generation in Waiting . '' Unemployment rates for those between the ages of 15 to 29 are much higher , ranging from 20 to 30 percent in most countries . In Algeria , it is nearly 46 percent and about 45 percent in Iraq . Many wait two to three years to get their first job , the book says . And there is a gender gap , with young women often having the most difficulty finding a job . Many of the region 's young people are having difficulties finding housing and are delaying marriage because of the bleak economic prospects , the book says . `` It was very hard to get a job . I got a couple of jobs , but you have to show connections , '' Ibrahim said . `` My family helped me get jobs , but I always had a hard time to get a job that fit or made me feel fulfilled . '' He eventually won a scholarship and moved to Canada , leaving his family behind , to pursue a graduate degree in information technology . Imagine a generation the size of the baby boomers in the United States trying to find a job in the U.S. economy of the late 1970s or the early 1980s , and you 'll have a rough equivalent of what 's happening across the region , Assaad said . `` There 's going to be a lost generation , in some sense , '' he said . It is a generation whose aspirations and expectations have been stifled , with little outlet for their grievances and frustrations other than to take to the streets .

Supporters of Egypt 's President Hosni Mubarak flooded into Cairo 's Tahrir Square Wednesday after the president 's opponents dominated the scene for more than a week . Separated at first by barriers , the rival demonstrators exchanged insults , then began throwing anything they could find at each other , including shoes , rocks and sticks . Suddenly the barriers came down . People surged toward each other in a chaotic scene that conjured images of a revolution . Digging up bricks to use as weapons Protesters hurt in Tahrir Square Some injured protesters fell . Others stumbled through the crowd . Blood streamed down the faces of the wounded . A few women away from the front line gave the injured water and swabbed at their wounds . Many of the injuries were serious , even though demonstrators wrapped sweatshirts and other clothes around their heads to protect themselves from flying stones . Dozens of wounded were carried away , bleeding from gashes . It was impossible to tell from visits to a makeshift clinic which side was faring worse , CNN 's Ben Wedeman said . He said simply : `` They are all Egyptians . '' A mosque served as a makeshift field hospital , staffed by volunteer doctors , he said . The day was spotted with scenes of brutality . At one point , bloodied men from the pro-regime side were dragged toward the center of Tahrir Square by anti-government demonstrators who beat and kicked them along the way . One man ripped out the hair of one of the captives . Police were nowhere to be seen . Army tanks surrounded the square , but the military proved unable or unwilling to separate the two sides . The hatches on their tanks and armored personnel carriers remained closed . Some brave Egyptians tried to stop the violence , putting their bodies between the sides . Briefly they seemed to succeed . There was a lull in the violence . Some protesters from the rival camps embraced . All at once , about 50 or 60 people carrying clubs and riding horses and camels charged into the square , beating some protesters . At least one man was pulled off his horse and beaten . Supporters on horseback in Tahrir Square And the frenzy intensified . People tore paving stones out of the streets with crowbars and their bare hands , filling bags with rocks to use as an arsenal in the street battle . Some ripped street signs out of the ground , using the metal as makeshift shields . CNN 's Hala Gorani was threatened by a pro-Mubarak supporter who told her to get out of the area . `` I was a little bit fearful , '' she said . Another protester stepped in and protected her , telling the first not to touch her because `` she is with me . '' She said she ran as fast as she could back to her colleagues . `` I 'm fine , but I 've got to say , this is a situation that can turn on a dime . There is a lot of anger coming from those protesters . '' They are attacking journalists , she said , and will threaten anyone who looks Western . It was unclear whether there was shooting on the square . CNN 's Fred Pleitgen and Anderson Cooper said they heard shots being fired , although Cooper suggested it may have been troops on the sidelines shooting into the air to try to restore order . The interior ministry denied there was shooting . CNN 's Ivan Watson , overlooking the square from a hotel , did not hear any gunfire , he said , calling that `` a blessing . '' And somehow , amid the clashes , pockets of peace remained -- including around small groups who , amid the violence , dropped to their knees and faced Mecca . The time had come for daily prayers . But the battle continued for hours , with regime supporters blocking exits from the square as soldiers largely remained on the sidelines . A group of women sat weeping , terrified by the violence they had seen . As night fell , pro-Mubarak forces began throwing Molotov cocktails , and with the sun going down , flames rose from the square . The army deployed hoses from the sidelines of the square , spraying water over the heads of the demonstrators onto the fires . The troops may be able to extinguish the physical fires . Whether they will be able to put out the metaphorical ones sweeping the city -- if they even want to -- remains to be seen . CNN 's Amir Ahmed and Ivan Watson contributed to this report .

For more than a week , opponents of Egypt 's President Hosni Mubarak had the upper hand in Cairo , protesting with near impunity in the face of police and an army that did little to stop them . That all changed on Wednesday . The morning after Mubarak dramatically announced he would not run for re-election in September , his supporters waded into Tahrir Square by the thousands , and suddenly serious , prolonged violence reigned in central Cairo . There were immediate suspicions that the pro-Mubarak demonstrators were not simply average citizens standing up for the man who has led Egypt for three decades -- suspicions that proved at least partly founded . As battles raged between the two sides , some pro-Mubarak protesters were captured by his opponents . Some were terrified to be caught and begged for their lives , screaming that the government had paid them to come out and protest . Others turned out to be carrying what seemed to be police identification , though they were dressed in plain clothes . Shadi Hamid , a Brookings Institution analyst based in Qatar , told CNN that the use of hired muscle to break up demonstrations `` is a longtime regime strategy . '' `` There are usually a line of thugs outside a protest who are waiting there , '' he said . `` They 're dressed in plain clothes , and then they 'll usually go and attack the protesters . Egyptians have seen this for quite some time , and that 's why they were able to recognize what was going on fairly quickly . '' The global rights group Amnesty International said it has documented the use of unsavory forces by Egyptian authorities to disperse political gatherings in election years . `` It looks like much of this violence is being orchestrated by the Egyptian authorities in order to force an end to the anti-government protests , restore their control and cling onto power in the face of unprecedented public demands for them to go , '' said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui , the deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International . An Interior Ministry spokesman denied on state-run television that police identification cards had been confiscated from demonstrators . He said if they had been , they were were stolen or fake . But state television reporting Wednesday did not always match CNN 's own observations of what was happening in Tahrir Square . Several CNN journalists heard from pro-Mubarak demonstrators that they worked for the government . Staff from the national petrochemical company said they had been ordered to come and protest .

In a brief statement to reporters at the White House , Obama pledged continuing U.S. support for both a longtime ally and the aspirations of protesting Egyptians , whose eight days of growing demonstrations led to Mubarak 's dramatic announcement on state television . `` We 've borne witness to the beginning of a new chapter in the history of a great country and a long-time partner of the United States , '' Obama said of the Mubarak statement less than three hours earlier . Noting that he and Mubarak had just spoken by phone , Obama said Mubarak `` recognizes that the status quo is not sustainable and a change must take place . '' Repeating earlier calls for an orderly transition in Egypt from Mubarak 's nearly three decades of repressive rule to a fully representative democracy , Obama said the transition `` must be meaningful , it must be peaceful and it must begin now . '' `` Furthermore , the process must include a broad spectrum of Egyptian voices and opposition parties , '' Obama said . `` It should lead to elections that are free and fair . And it should result in a government that 's not only grounded in democratic principles but is also responsive to the aspirations of the Egyptian people . '' Earlier , sources told CNN that a U.S. envoy sent by Obama urged Mubarak to announce he wo n't run for re-election later this year , a major shift in foreign policy regarding the main Arab ally of the United States and a vital partner in the Middle East peace process because of its 1978 treaty with Israel . According to the sources , who spoke on condition of not being identified by name , former U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Frank Wisner conveyed the message to Mubarak in Egypt . It was unclear if the meeting was Monday or Tuesday . Until now , the street demonstrations in Egypt demanding Mubarak 's ouster had drawn a measured U.S. response that advocated step-by-step reforms for pro-democracy changes while maintaining stability . This week , though , calls increased for the Obama administration to push for Mubarak to step aside immediately or announce he would not be a candidate in the next presidential election scheduled for September . One of Egypt 's leading opposition figures , Mohamed ElBaradei , warned Monday that the United States needed to `` let go '' of its longtime ally . `` You should n't be behind the curve , and you need to start building confidence with the people and not with the people who are smothering the people , '' ElBaradei , the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , told CNN 's `` Anderson Cooper 360 . '' The unrest in Egypt presented Obama with a complex issue that lacked easy answers . Egypt -- the main Arab ally of the United States -- is inexorably linked to neighboring Israel -- the main U.S. ally in the Middle East -- by a peace treaty that guarantees more than $ 1 billion a year in U.S. military aid to Mubarak 's government . Egypt also provides vital logistical and intelligence assistance to the United States , which has urged Mubarak for years to implement democratic reforms but always put the strategic benefits first . Daniel Kurtzer , the U.S. ambassador to Egypt from 1997 to 2001 , said the administration wants to both support `` an exceedingly strong ally '' and promote democratic reform and more openness in `` a closed authoritarian society . '' `` The United States is trying to find comfortable ground in which we can argue for both without abandoning an ally and without abandoning our principles , '' Kurtzer told CNN on Monday . Egypt 's turmoil follows years of social , political and economic grievances that fueled the street protests that began last week and have since escalated . After ruling with an iron fist for three decades , Mubarak had given no indication of giving up power before his statement Tuesday night . However , ElBaradei and other opposition figures immediately condemned Mubarak 's announcement as insufficient , saying the president needed to step aside immediately for a caretaker government of national unity to lead Egypt until new presidential and parliamentary elections can be held . Obama 's statement avoided addressing the opposition demands , instead promising the demonstrators -- particularly young Egyptians looking to the United States for support and leadership -- that America supported their aspirations . `` We hear your voices , '' Obama said . `` I have an unyielding belief that you will determine your own destiny and seize the promise of a better future for your children and your grandchildren . And I say that as someone who is committed to a partnership between the United States and Egypt . `` There will be difficult days ahead , '' Obama continued . `` Many questions about Egypt 's future remain unanswered , but I am confident that the people of Egypt will find those answers . '' In the past week , demonstrators in Egypt have questioned why Obama , who championed human rights and democracy in a 2009 speech in Cairo , was n't condemning Mubarak and applying pressure to help bring the changes they seek . ElBaradei , who returned to his native Egypt last week as an opposition figure last week , said Egyptians need to see that the United States is supporting their aspirations . `` People need to see that you not only talk the talk , but walk the walk , and people need to understand and believe that you really , seriously take democracy , rule of law , freedoms seriously , '' ElBaradei said Sunday . Asking `` a dictator '' to implement democratic reforms `` is an oxymoron , frankly . '' On Monday , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Egypt 's government should engage in `` meaningful negotiations with a broad section of civil society , including opposition groups , '' and hold `` free and fair elections '' in September . The transition called for by the United States `` means change , and what we 've advocated from the very beginning is that the way Egypt looks and operates must change , '' Gibbs told reporters . At the same time , he said it is not the place of the United States to support or oppose the possible ouster of Mubarak . Some U.S. politicians disagreed . One of the U.S. Senate 's most influential foreign policy voices , Democrat John Kerry of Massachusetts , called Tuesday for Mubarak to step down , reflecting the rapidly changing consensus among top Washington policymakers . Kerry , the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee , also said Mubarak 's son , Gamal , should not take the reins of power in Cairo . The U.S. government needs to start paying closer attention to the `` genuine political , legal and economic needs '' of people in the Middle East , as opposed to consistently supporting friendly governments regardless of their domestic politics , Kerry said in an op-ed commentary published by the New York Times . `` For three decades , the United States pursued a Mubarak policy , '' he wrote . `` Now we must look beyond the Mubarak era and devise an Egyptian policy . '' To Marina Ottaway , director of the Middle East program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , the unrest in Egypt showed that the U.S. policy of backing Mubarak despite his poor record on political and human rights has failed to bring desired stability . Instead of what she labeled `` subtle '' language such as endorsing an orderly transition , the United States should call for a government of national unity to take over until fully democratic elections for both the presidency and the parliament , Ottaway told CNN on Monday .

Americans describe seeing history unfold while in Egypt Devon Youngblood : People were n't sure what to expect when protests began More than 2,600 Americans ask to be evacuated `` You 're caught in something for which you have no control , '' tourist says -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It was Tuesday , January 25 . Word had spread for days through the streets of Cairo that there would be protests . No one knew exactly what to expect . Riot police lined the streets around Tahrir Square . Police kept people from gathering into a crowd . Devon Youngblood , a 22-year-old American who had been working since August at an art gallery , showed up near the square around 2 p.m. . She was curious to see how many people would gather . `` Most people I talked with were pessimistic , '' she said . `` They did n't think people would show up . '' She encountered an enthusiastic crowd . At one point , a large group of cheering protesters broke through the police line and into the square . Police lobbed tear gas and used water cannons . But the crowd would not be moved . Gallery : Protesters take to the streets The evolution of Egypt 's protests So began the international crisis still unfolding in Egypt . Several Americans who made it out of the country shared their experiences with CNN ; their stories provide a front-row seat to history in a nation where communication with the outside world is spotty at best . A curfew went into effect at 3 p.m. Tuesday and extends until 8 a.m. Wednesday . The internet has been shut down , as has phone service . The turmoil has paralyzed daily life in other ways , with food shipments spare and many groceries closed . Gas is running low in some areas , and many banks have closed . Nile TV has set up a hotline for citizens to call in and report bread shortages . International leaders are monitoring the situation closely . Amid the chaotic street scenes , foreign governments -- including Australia , Canada , China , India , Israel , Mexico , Russia and the United States -- have launched evacuation efforts to get their citizens out . About 52,000 Americans are believed to be in Egypt . More than 2,600 have asked to be evacuated , a figure expected to rise in coming days . The Americans who left Egypt were students and tourists -- all sharing a passion for Egypt . In Alexandria , Tik Root , a student from Middlebury College , had returned to Egypt in mid-January to continue his studies in Arabic . Like many U.S. students , he left with a mix of emotions : excited , happy and concerned for the Egyptian people . Diane and Gaynor Kelley of Chicago were concluding a dream vacation , a cruise down the Nile River . The couple said they feel lucky to be alive but remain concerned for the Egyptians who helped them escape . One of their tour guides was shot . Taking it to the streets Youngblood left work early last Wednesday , the first day after the protests began . Residents still seemed in awe : `` Wow , people really came together . '' But word spread that police were going to crack down and make sweeping arrests of people on the streets . Many felt it was best to leave before the clashes intensified . As she walked downtown , Youngblood said she was struck by the silence in the city of 8 million . Downtown was abandoned : `` It was really surreal because Cairo is not a quiet place . '' She continued on , still unsure if the unrest would build and what could come next . By Thursday , Facebook and Twitter were silenced . Then , text messaging was shut down . By nightfall , residents were cut off from the internet and phone service . `` The motivations behind it were scarier than the actual lack of information , '' Youngblood said . Egyptians prepared to take to the streets en masse the next morning . On Thursday night , Youngblood 's friends began referring to the movement as a revolution . `` It had n't really hit me until then that people were thinking of this as a revolution , '' she told CNN . `` I had thought of this as a string of protests and people just wanting to protest . I was n't sure what direction people really knew they wanted to take it . '' With communication limited , people worried : What is the government planning if they 're cutting off access to the outside world ? Google connects Egyptians to Twitter Egypt unites , tells Mubarak ` go ' At a glance : Nations facing unrest The streets erupted in protest Friday . Root , the student from Middlebury , stood in the middle of the madness in Alexandria . A government building was burned . Police fired rubber bullets and launched tear gas canisters . `` I saw people coming back bloodied from the front lines , '' he said . At times , a wave of anti-Americanism swept through the crowd . One man picked up a spent tear gas canister . He held it up for all to see . `` Made in America , '' it said . If people asked , Root decided to tell people he was from Mexico . To survive , it seemed the right thing to say . By Saturday , police were gone . Ordinary citizens had taken over . They were directing traffic and setting up neighborhood watches to prevent looting . `` It was one of the coolest things I 've seen in my life , '' Root said . Scary end to Nile cruise The Kelleys had been isolated on their cruise down the Nile . They had heard rumblings of something going on but did n't know quite what . The vacation was wrapping up . They caught a flight into Cairo . Their tour guide remained confident they would be safe . When they arrived , no other flights were taking off . The couple , and the rest of the tour group , were stranded and cut off from the outside world . `` You 're caught in something for which you have no control whatsoever of your own destiny , '' Gaynor Kelley said . Their Egyptian hosts , with the Abercrombie & Kent tour group , helped make sure they were safe . They got them food and put them up in a hotel while working around-the-clock to see how the group could leave the country . The father of one of their Egyptian guides was shot as the group made its way to the airport . The Kelleys have n't heard any updates on his condition . `` Our last day getting to the airport was the scariest , '' Diane Kelley recalled . Military police were stopping cars at roadblocks set up outside the airport . Gunshots could be heard in the distance . She said she thought about the recent bombing at the airport in Moscow . The Egyptian tour guides offered constant reassurance . Once inside the airport , flight after flight was canceled . Gaynor Kelley had a sinking feeling : Will I ever make it back home ? `` You sort of begin to lose confidence that you 're ever going to get out , '' he said . For Youngblood , leaving the country was agonizing . She did n't realize how many friends she had made since August until it was time to say good-bye . But by Saturday night , she said she knew it was time to go as the streets became more chaotic . Citizens were setting up their own neighborhood watches . Outside her building , men stood guard with thick plastic pipes . She was armed with one too , inside her apartment . `` That 's when it hit me that I should get out . '' She caught a flight Monday to Athens , Greece . She said she plans to return to Cairo as soon as it 's safe again . Root is still trying to absorb all that 's transpired in the last week . `` I do n't think anyone 's been able to process what has happened , '' he said , just before leaving for Europe . As a college student , he 's learned more in a week than most get in a semester . `` This has been a very great and meaningful experience . It 's taught me a lot about Egyptian politics , the Mideast and revolutions . '' The Kelleys are left wondering about the folks who got them out of the country . `` I am thinking how grateful I am of the Egyptian people who helped us , '' Diane Kelley said . `` I 'm feeling very sorry for the conditions that they 're in . I 'm feeling very sorry that their homes are being looted , that their families are n't safe . These people helped us .

Nazif Shahrani : Arabs demanding `` liberation from being treated as slaves and subjects '' Isobel Coleman : If reforms come , `` expect Islam to play a larger role in government '' Blake Hounshell : Popular comedy `` Terrorism and Kebab '' revealed , predicted this unrest -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Bowing to the massive pressure of demonstrators , Egypt 's President Hosni Mubarak said Tuesday he will step down in September after 30 years in power . King Abdullah II dismissed his government in Jordan as calls for reform swept across North Africa and the Middle East . Analysts offer their views on what this wave of unrest means for the region and the world . The Arab upheaval , which has been compared to the 1989 collapse of the Berlin Wall , challenges not only the regimes that are falling , but also more fundamentally the entire Arab order that has held since the decolonization of three generations ago . We are witnessing the triumph of people power over the inertia of political power . Overpopulation and corruption are the twin scourges of almost all post-colonial countries across Africa , the Middle East , and South Asia . Tunisia , Egypt , Jordan -- and other Arab societies like Morocco , Libya , Yemen , and Syria -- are all pressed to manage global economic forces and channel them into benefits such as jobs and welfare for their citizens . Even the monarchies like Jordan and Morocco wo n't be considered legitimate unless they deliver the goods . A new governance model will emerge from the wreckage of these regimes . Presidential or executive powers will be curtailed . Strongman states will diminish . Cronyism and clan-based governance will be replaced by more technocratic leadership that will answer to the people as well as to global markets . The old Arabism of anti-colonial rhetoric and failed Sunni unity will be replaced by a new Arabism led by Qatar 's Al Jazeera , Lebanese bloggers , and Dubai-best investors . It is their entrepreneurship , know-how , and capital which are re-shaping the vast young Arab generation 's outlook on the world . This is the kind of fresh , young secular Arabism the West should get behind -- liberating them from the squeeze between autocrats and would-be theocrats . A domino effect does n't have to be a bad thing . Replacing autocracy with democracy and ideology with pragmatism would be a big step forward for much of the Arab world . We should welcome this ushering in of a new era . Ibrahim Sharqieh , deputy director of Brookings Doha Center and Fellow , Saban Center for Middle East Policy : Day of violence in Egypt Today , all Arabs are asking the same question : after Tunisia and Egypt , who is next ? There are , however , many differences between these two countries as well as between them and the rest of the Arab world . In each country , there are certain characteristics that may make replicating the uprising less likely . Unlike Tunisia and Egypt , Jordan is a kingdom ; Syria is a security controlled state , Yemen is a tribal society , and Sudan is ethnically divided . Despite all these structural differences , there is one thing that unites them all . It is the power of successful revolt that inspires all of them to consider launching their own uprisings . This power is stimulating the emergence of a `` can do '' attitude in the Arab world , which is breaking the barrier of fear that has long suppressed popular expression . Every Arab citizen is now reflecting upon the successes of Egypt and Tunisia and considering their shortfalls . The leaders , too , are learning from the successes of Tunisia and Egypt . The strong lesson they have learned is that once people take to the streets , returning to the status quo becomes highly unlikely . Arab autocrats should learn the lesson : Preemptive and serious political reform is the only real means for survival . Shadi Hamid , director of research at the Brookings Doha Center and a fellow at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution : Facing mounting protests , King Abdullah of Jordan sacked his government and appointed a new prime minister . Observers should not treat this as a breakthrough , as some already are . Cabinet reshuffles are business as usual for Jordan , which goes through governments at a fairly rapid clip . In any case , the person of the prime minister does not matter as much as people think . The one with the final decision-making authority is the king . To the extent that Jordan is faltering , both economically and politically , the responsibility lies not with the prime minister but with the monarch . In Egypt and Tunisia , we saw a similar regime strategy : half-measures rather than fundamental reforms that address protesters ' grievances . It did n't work there and is likely to fall flat in Jordan as well . More problematically , the new prime minister is a man named Marouf al-Bakhit , a former army general . And the fact that King Abdullah chose to appoint him sends worrying signals . Bakhit is a military man who , if anything , is known for an aversion to democratic reform . During his previous stint as prime minister from 2005-7 , he launched a crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood , the major opposition group in the country . And in November 2007 , he oversaw one of the most fraudulent elections in Jordan 's history . In other words , Jordan is still stuck . Isobel Coleman , author of '' Paradise Beneath Her Feet '' and a senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York : The specter of Islamism filling the power vacuum left by popular uprisings in Tunisia , Egypt and Jordan has become a concern to many in the West . Though this is certainly a possibility , so far the demonstrations have been led by young people demanding greater political participation and economic opportunity . They represent a broad coalition focused primarily on democratic aims , and motivated in large part by a stark gap between rising expectations and reality : Recent economic growth has too often failed to trickle down to the working poor . In Tunisia and Egypt , as much as 30 percent of university graduates are unemployed . If more democratic political systems do emerge from this unrest , however , expect Islam to play a larger role in government . Indeed , youth across the region increasingly look to Turkey as a political model to emulate , and local Islamist parties are poised to take advantage of greater political freedoms . In Tunisia , Rachid Ghannouchi , leader of the formerly banned Nahda party , returned this week from 20 years ' exile in London . In Egypt , the Muslim Brotherhood has played an increasingly assertive role , and expects to be included in any transition process . In Jordan , where the Muslim Brotherhood is not banned and already has its own political party , leader Hammam Saeed has been actively calling for Arabs to topple U.S.-backed leaders throughout the region . Although strategic interests such as the Suez would not necessarily be jeopardized by a more Islamist Middle East , new regimes with stronger Islamic elements would likely be less cooperative on issues from counterterrorism to the peace process . M. Nazif Shahrani , chairman of the Department of Near Eastern languages and Cultures , and professor of Anthropology , Central Asian and Middle Eastern Studies at Indiana University-Bloomington : The Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia sparked by the self-immolation of a young street vendor brought the regime of the dictator Zine El Abidin Ben Ali down . Now the revolution has spread across the region , unleashing the anger and frustration of millions who have suffered silently for decades across the Middle East . The few who had dared to take up arms against the dictators were at first dismissed as terrorists by the dictators and their patrons . Now , the masses in the Arab streets -- in Tunis , Cairo , Alexandria , Sana'a , Amman , etc. -- have come out to peacefully and persistently demand their liberation from being treated as mere slaves and subjects , and not citizens , by the few corrupt power elites with access to weapons , military and political backing from the West . This citizen-servitude during the past decades has been justified by dictators and their Western backers in the name of maintaining political stability . But these so-called stable regimes are responsible for the poverty , unemployment and poor living conditions of their people , due to corruption , cronyism and oppression by the undemocratic regimes . The educated but unemployed youth of the Arab world are fed up with these regimes and their backers . These regimes can not be reformed , and the people on the Arab streets demand that they must go and make way for popular democratic governance systems which can bring real stability to the region . It is time for the West to stop supporting dictatorships and start listening to the legitimate and much delayed demands of the Arab public for real and popular democracy in the Middle East and beyond . Blake Hounshell , managing editor of Foreign Policy : In `` Al Irhab wal Kabab '' -- `` Terrorism and Kebab '' -- the omnipresent Egyptian comedic actor Adel Imam plays a man who visits the Mugamma , the hulking government building overlooking Cairo 's Liberation Square . The Mugamma symbolizes everything the Egyptian state has become : bloated , inefficient , uncaring , and deeply corrupt . Imam 's character , Ahmed , has a simple request : Can you transfer my children 's school ? As his fellow citizens aimlessly wander the hallways in search of assistance , he gets the runaround from one bureaucrat after another . Finally , exasperated , Ahmed gets into a scuffle with one official and , in the ensuing melee , grabs a rifle from a bewildered guard and fires it in the air . Seizing the moment , he decides to take the entire building hostage . Asked to list his demands , he orders kebabs for everyone -- meat being a rare treat for Egypt 's impoverished masses . The 1992 film was a smash hit , and ranks among the most popular Egyptian films of all time . For all its slapstick silliness , it resonated deeply with a population that , even then , was exhausted after decades of failed experiments in socialism and half-hearted liberalization . Eighteen years later , Egyptians -- or Arabs , for that matter -- are n't going to be satisfied simply by having their basic economic needs met . As the crowds gathering in Cairo 's Tahrir Square and throughout the Arab world are showing , they will accept nothing less than wholesale change -- and are risking their lives to get it . Julie Taylor , a Middle East specialist who lived in Egypt for five years , is a political scientist at the RAND Corp. : There is no clear political party or leader ready to step in , if the regime in Egypt falls . However , this protest is not without leadership ; it is spearheaded by a large network of Egyptian human rights groups and other citizens . They have long challenged the Mubarak regime on humanitarian issues as greater independence of the judiciary , protections for minorities , and maintenance of stated protections found in the Egyptian constitution . Activists in these groups have been trained in nonviolent civic protest tactics . They have networked with democratic activists in other countries for four years or more . The Bush and Obama administrations have followed their activities . Although the protesters make up a disembodied movement , many of their coordinators are known to the U.S. administration . They are the ones handing out water and organizing successive protests . When ElBaradei , the Nobel Laureate and a leading critic of the government , came to Egypt , he met with the main network of civil society leaders to determine if there was support for him . It is this network that is hoisting him to the fore . This network remains highly meaningful . In countries such as Jordan and Morocco , political reform would not require the removal of the monarchy , because these countries could evolve into constitutional monarchies in which the monarch remains as a figurehead . This makes political reform less threatening and more possible . In such cases , the monarch is more likely to be open to political change . This is not an option in republics such as Libya , Yemen , and Syria . The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the writers .

So I hope the United States is using what influence it has to try to make sure that there 's a transition that makes sense and does n't lead to chaos or allowing any one group to capture the political process . '' Mubarak 's announcement that he would end his 30 years of rule in September came after massive protests in Egypt for the past eight days . But many protesters proclaimed they were unsatisfied with his statement and called for him to leave office immediately . The author and host of CNN 's `` Fareed Zakaria GPS '' spoke to CNN on Thursday . Here is an edited transcript : CNN : What do you think of the way the administration is handling the crisis in Egypt ? Fareed Zakaria : I think the administration is getting the balance right now , if reports are correct that President Obama has delivered a message to Mubarak that urges him to announce that he will not seek the presidency again . But privately U.S. officials should be further urging that he announce a transition plan immediately . He wo n't be able to stick around till September . CNN : So what should happen next ? Zakaria : The best course would be for Mubarak to get ahead of these events and announce a process by which it is clear that he is not going to be president . I think there is a technical problem that most people have not focused on . Under the Egyptian constitution , if Mubarak resigns , it immediately triggers a new election within 60 days . And in the midst of everything that is going on in Egypt , that is not the ideal solution . So perhaps what he should do is announce that he 's going to resign at a certain point -- but in the interim create a constitutional committee that can amend or rewrite the Egyptian constitution so that all elections , parliamentary or presidential , take place under new rules which will be free and fair , unlike the old rules that were completely stacked in favor of Mubarak and his party . CNN : What 's the potential path to democracy in Egypt ? Zakaria : I think there will have to be a much greater role for public participation , elections and democracy . The more difficult part is : Will there be a transition to constitutionalism , the rule of law and the protection of human rights ? That 's always been the tricky part in these kinds of circumstances . You want to make sure that you have protections for minorities , protections for individual rights , independent courts , freedom of press , freedom of association and all those things tend to be the real inner stuffing of democracy . That 's why I think having some kind of process and a constitutional order become very important . You know , these sound like technicalities , but at the moment of transition how you deal with these questions has a huge impact on the kind of eventual political system you end up with . CNN : Why is that so crucial ? Zakaria : If you look at Iraq , it was the decisions made in the first month -LRB- after Saddam Hussein 's rule ended -RRB- that ended up creating the climate for what became a civil war . We should try as much as we can to help the Egyptians understand that what they want is a transition that ends up producing stable liberal democracy . Obama on Egypt : Change must happen now Cleric : ` Islamic uprising ' in Egypt The other key is the role of the army . People have n't completely recognized that Egypt is really a military dictatorship , with a civilian at the top . The army is not going to quietly allow for a democratic order that completely takes away all its powers and privilege , so the army will want to have a very strong role in the process , and that is probably inevitable -- and maybe where the United States has much of its influence because we have maintained pretty good contacts with the army . CNN : Is a strong role for the army compatible with a more democratic Egypt ? Zakaria : It 's compatible as long as the army understands it ca n't be the old system . In Turkey the army effectively ran the country and began to yield power . It 's happened in other countries as well . But unless there 's a real process put in place you could easily end up with a pseudo democracy like Pakistan where civilians are elected , but the military wields the real power . CNN : What are the implications of this for the wider Arab world ? Zakaria : The implications of this will be substantial because Egypt is the heart and soul of the Arab world . The two biggest political movements in the Arab world in the past 50 years have been pan-Arabism or Arab nationalism and Islamic fundamentalism , both of them were centered in Egypt -- pan-Arabism with Nasser and Islamic fundamentalism with the Muslim Brotherhood and also al Qaeda , which was largely a marriage of Egyptian brains and Saudi Arabian money . You can already see the implications in Jordan . I do n't think it means there will be a domino effect and you will see regimes all over the Mideast toppling . But I think you will certainly see a greater demand for accountability and reform , and without any question it will rattle regimes like Syria , and Libya . Whether or not they fall will be a case by case situation . Most of these regimes are very tough police states , so it is not really that easy to protest or do things that would undermine the regime . But I think we 're entering a new era in the Middle East , and I think it 's impossible that things will remain the same in any of those countries . CNN : Was America blindsided by these events ? Zakaria : I do n't think that 's true . The Americans for 15 years now have been urging the Mubarak regime to engage in serious political reforms . The reality is that people sometimes exaggerate American influence . And there was in Washington a concern that you did need Egypt to maintain a peaceful border with Israel , to enforce the embargo on Hamas , to fight al Qaeda and other terrorist groups . Now perhaps this led to us not pushing political reform strongly enough . But since the presidency of Bush senior , Washington has been pushing these issues . The truth is that the Mubarak regime was a very tough unyielding regime that had decided that it was not going to do any political reform . I think that in the face of that , it was difficult to see how we could have had a huge impact . But the broader point I 'd make is that the reason this is happening in Egypt is that they are aware of the wider world , they are aware that the United States was pushing for reform . They see openness in other parts of the world . This is partly a desire of Egypt to catch up with the rest of the world and become like other modern countries .

SUZANNE MALVEAUX , CNN ANCHOR : Top of the hour . I 'm Suzanne Malveaux . Let 's get you up to speed . Tanks are so far keeping Egyptians for and against the government separated today in Cairo 's Tahrir Square . The government unleashed security forces on journalists covering the chaos . Now , according to `` The Washington Post , '' two dozen have been detained or harassed , including crews from CNN , the BBC , and The Post A journalist for state-run TV says she quit today because of intimidation . That 's what he do . We will die for our freedom ! MALVEAUX : State television says battles in Tahrir Square left five people dead and more than 800 wounded in the last 24 hours . Makeshift field hospitals sprang up along the sides of the plaza . The primary weapons , rocks and machetes , that left many people with large gashes to their heads . Well , President Obama is at Penn State this hour . These are live pictures you are seeing from State College in Pennsylvania . He is focusing on clean and efficient ways to make energy . Mr. Obama briefly mentioned the crisis in Egypt before leaving Washington . He told the National Prayer Breakfast a better day will dawn soon for the Egyptians . Thousands of protesters are on the streets of Yemen 's capital today demanding the country 's leader step aside after 32 years in power . They 're not satisfied with President Ali Abdullah Saleh 's pledge to stand down in 2013 . Government supporters also rallied . Well , an SUV ran off icy Interstate 44 in northeastern Oklahoma today . The vehicle plunged into the Spring River , which is now frozen . Rescuers pulled five people from the SUV and sent them all to the hospital . Three people who were trapped inside died . Fewer Americans filed for first-time unemployment benefits during the last week of January . The Labor Department reports today it got 415,000 initial applications . That 's 42,000 fewer than the week before . Now , the department releases unemployment figures for all of January tomorrow morning . And here 's your chance to `` Talk Back '' on one of the big stories of the day . Our question for you is about President Obama 's faith . He spoke about it today , addressing the belief by some that he is a Muslim and not a Christian . Our Carol Costello is here with more -- Carol . CAROL COSTELLO , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Suzanne , it was fascinating , really . President Obama got really personal this morning about his faith at the National Prayer Breakfast , talking about how he came to accept Jesus Christ in his life and how he 's asked Jesus to make him an instrument of the lord . Now public opinion surveys show only a minority of Americans even know that President Obama is a Christian , and a growing number of Americans believe he is Muslim . The White House denied the tone of the president 's speeches in response to those who love to call Mr. Obama , `` Barack Hussein Obama . '' BARACK OBAMA , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : My Christian faith has been a sustaining force for me over these last few years , all the more so when Michelle and I hear our faith questioned from time to time . We are reminded that ultimately , what matters is not what other people say about us , but whether we are being true to our conscience and true to our God . COSTELLO : Suzanne , here is something really interesting , though . It 's not just his political enemies who think Mr. Obama is Muslim . According to Pew Research , fewer than half of Democrats and African - Americans correctly identify the president as Christian . So it is time to `` Talk Back . '' What will it take for people to believe President Obama is a Christian ? And we will read some of your responses later in the hour . MALVEAUX : Carol , we know it 's not easy , it 's not comfortable talking about his faith . It 's something that 's personal . But , you know , he feels he has to get it out there , he has to tell people who he really is . COSTELLO : He came on really strong today . He really talked about Jesus quite a bit through his speech , about accepting him into his life . And his pastor sort of suggested that he do that today , although the White House , as I said , is denying that it had anything to do with these polls that most Americans believe he 's Muslim . Carol , thank you so much . We 'll have to see what the viewers have to say . Well , a quick look ahead `` On the Rundown . '' Street triage -- treating the wounded on the streets of Cairo in the middle of the violence . And a giant cyclone slams Australia . Chad Myers surveys the damage . Also , we have got some incredible pictures out of Massachusetts . You 've got to check this out . The roof of a building caving in under the weight of all that snow . And finally , your chance -- this is your chance to `` Choose the News . '' A recap of the three stories you get to pick from . MALVEAUX : There is not much time left for you to `` Choose the News . '' Vote via text message for the story that you want to see in detail this hour . So here are the choices . You 've got Pentecostal churches in Cuba on the rise . Many Cubans turning to religion in tough economic times . Also , second , a young woman searching for her roots , she finds answers on Facebook . The social network connects her with her birth family . And an Egyptian woman who says she is willing to die for freedom . Her story from the front lines of the protests . So just vote by texting 22360 . Vote 1 for Cubans turn to religion ; 2 for family found on Facebook ; or , 3 , for willing to die for freedom . MALVEAUX : These are scenes from Yemen 's `` Day of Rage '' today . Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets in competing rallies . Some demanding the country 's leader step down , others rallying in favor of him . My colleague Mohammed Jamjoom , he 's joining us from the capital of Yemen . And Mohammed , give us a sense of what you are seeing there . What is taking place ? I know there was a lot of concern that there might be some violence . MOHAMMED JAMJOOM , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , that 's right . As of last night and early this morning , officials here , even regular citizens , very concerned this could be a very violent day . They were thinking there could be clashes between protesters and security forces . But we really saw a minimal security presence out today . And even though there were two very big protests , one pro-government , one anti- government , they did not mix . There were no clashes between the different groups , there were no clashes with security forces . But even though it was a largely peaceful protest , there was a lot of emotion being expressed , especially by the anti-government demonstrators , demonstrators out there saying they want a better life , they want a new government , somebody that can provide them with food , with money , with opportunities . On the pro-government side , we saw other thousands of demonstrators saying that , in fact , the opposition , the other demonstrators , were destabilizing this country by calling for the president to step down . They said people should return to the table and have a dialogue , and that things would be better if they followed that route -- Suzanne . MALVEAUX : But what do you think ? The president said he 's not going to seek re-election . Do you think that 's good enough for the protesters ? And do you think the government might make some more concessions ? JAMJOOM : As far as the protesters in the anti-government camp , they said absolutely not . Even though there was a lot of surprise that President Saleh actually came out yesterday and conceded , said that he would not seek re-election in 2013 , they said , you know what ? He 's been in power more than 30 years , he 's had enough time to fix the problems in Yemen . He has not done so . They say they still do n't have the food on the table they need in order to feed their families . So they want change . They see the only way of getting change is by getting a new regime there . As to -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- President Saleh , who would step up to the plate , there was no discernible leader , there was nobody that everybody was rallying around . And , in fact , I should point out that the opposition here is a fractious group . A lot of different parties argue over a lot of different issues . So that 's one of the concerns by governments that are allied with Yemen , is that even if President Saleh stepped aside , who would step in to fill that void , and would the situation here in fact be more tenuous if he did step aside now ? MALVEAUX : Well , we have seen the violence . We 're going to give you a look at what life looks like outside of those protests in Egypt . MALVEAUX : As we watch the uprising in Cairo continue to unfold , my friend Michael Holmes is here for a look beyond the violence in a segment that we are calling `` Globe Trekking . '' And Michael , the friends that I 've spoken with there , having lived in Cairo , they 're not a part of these street protests , but they 're still struggling . Life is hard now . Can you give us the big picture ? MICHAEL HOLMES , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : You 're right . That 's something that we do need to emphasize and bring into context . You ca n't make the point enough , actually , that while the streets of the capital in Tahrir Square are obviously violent at the moment , look , there . There 's some normal life going on . The average Egyptian , regardless of political leanings , they 're not out there in the mob . To get the whole picture , you 've got to remember that Egypt is a country of 82 million people , the biggest Arab country in the world . And while you 're watching on the television as all hell breaks loose in Tahrir Square , the overwhelming majority of Egyptians are just trying to stay out of the way and get on with their lives and try to feed their families . MALVEAUX : But even living their lives is difficult , taking your kids to school , or trying to go grocery shopping and that type of thing . I mean , there has got to be almost a tipping point to have some out there on the streets and the others who just want some stability . HOLMES : There is , and that 's true . I mean , they 're not going to school because the schools are closed . I mean , schools , universities , banks , the train service , all that stuff has been affected by what 's going on , the uprising right across the country . But Nic Robertson was reporting fishermen in Alexandria saying that their business has been interrupted . These are pictures that Nic shot earlier with Scottie McWhinnie -LRB- ph -RRB- , one of our cameramen there . A lot of the markets have run short of basic supplies . We 're hearing reports that in some places , even getting bread is difficult . So check out the scene that Arwa Damon encountered near a local hospital , actually just 10 minutes away from the site of the demonstrations . Ambulances were flying up the road to drop off the wounded outside . The streets , though , as you see there , almost eerily quiet outside of Tahrir Square . MALVEAUX : And tell us what the communication is like , because , obviously , Facebook , Twitter , cell phones , it 's been very difficult to reach people . HOLMES : It has . It 's improved to a degree . The `` Christian Science Monitor '' is reporting that the Internet is back up . Our people have been saying that it is , too . Facebook finally seems to be back up , actually , for most of Egypt . It 's been a weeklong blackout if you are wanting to post your status update in Egypt . The overall point being that for every protester who might be throwing a rock or a Molotov cocktail , there are thousands of families out there just waiting for this all to end and some stability to come back to the region . How long they 're going to wait for that is anyone 's guess . The bottom line , the chaos you 're seeing in the daily lives of regular Egyptians is n't going to change anytime soon at the moment , particularly while this security vacuum is in place . The military , not going to get involved . And the police , the hated police , nowhere to be seen . They 're not likely to come back , because if they came back on the streets to try to quell this , it would get worse . HOLMES : And I have that from Egyptian officials telling me that , that if the police did come back , it would get worse . MALVEAUX : A lot of people are staying away from Tahrir Square . And what a lot of people do n't know is that Egyptians -- there are a lot of suburbs , and they 're out there . And it 's , you know , big driveways and streets just like we have here . MALVEAUX : Just trying to move along with life . HOLMES : Just get the context and keep it in perspective , yes . Thank you , Michael . HOLMES : Good to see you . MALVEAUX : Well , as demonstrators flood the streets of Cairo , business owners with ties to Egypt , they 're watching the developments , of course , extremely closely . Our CNN Money 's Poppy Harlow , she joins us from New York . And Poppy , you sat down with an Egyptian-American entrepreneur who gave their sense of the risk here . POPPY HARLOW , CNNMONEY.COM : Yes , exactly right . We spent the day yesterday with Dr. Hossam Abdel Maksoud . He is an Egyptian-American , Suzanne . He moved here in 1984 . But he 's in the pharmaceutical business , and he does business constantly between the U.S. and Egypt . He 's back in Egypt every few months . And he talked to us about sort of the economic drivers leading up to this crisis , and also what he thinks needs to change as for his business right now . His family members are in the streets with these protesters , blocking off their businesses , trying to protect them from looters . He said all of his business between the U.S. and Egypt has just come to a grinding halt . But here is part of our conversation . Interesting to hear his insight on what he thinks especially led to this uprising . DR. HOSSAM ABDEL MAKSOUD , EGYPTIAN-AMERICAN BUSINESSMAN : I visit Egypt often , and you see the gap between the rich and the poor getting wider and wider . Sooner or later , you knew a crisis was going to come to surface . One of the biggest problems is the persistent unemployment . And for some reason , although we 've seen growth in Egypt since 2004 , this success and this economic growth did not trickle down to the average Egyptian . HARLOW : From your point of view , someone who has done very well in a capitalist society , what are the economic reforms you think would help most ? MAKSOUD : Infrastructure a little bit . HARLOW : Too much red tape ? MAKSOUD : Too much red tape . And there is no really straight , direct , clear guidelines for infrastructure . But in my opinion , giving a young man , an educated young man who finished and spent a lot of time in college and school a job is what leads to security and prosperity . In any society they have to have skills , as well as education . HARLOW : So , Suzanne , clearly , he says it all comes down to having the skills to get a job . That one thing that he says all of these young men in the streets want is that option to prosper in the future . So he said that that 's what it comes down to . And the irony in the short term , Suzanne , is that they 're fighting about the lack of opportunity , economic opportunity in Egypt , and yet this situation it making the economy of Egypt even worse for the foreseeable future -- Suzanne . MALVEAUX : And Poppy , did he share his vision for what he wants for the country ? HARLOW : He did . Look , he said , `` I foresee a prosperous Egypt in the future . We are a resilient people . '' As I mentioned , his entire family is back on the streets in Cairo right now , so that they are fighting for their future , but he says it 's going to be a while before the dust settles and that can happen . And as you heard , he 's calling for fundamental changes to their education system , saying it 's not enough to give them a degree . What you have to do is give them skills that they can actually use to be employed and build up our prosperity for themselves and for future generations . But I think bottom line , he 's hopeful -- Suzanne . MALVEAUX : All right . Poppy , thank you so much . We 're taking a quick look at the markets here . I understand the Dow Jones , down eight points -- sorry , I 'm being told nine points now . The Dow Jones down nine points there for the market . Well , everybody admits that they do n't like it , but no one seems to know how to get rid of it . And I 'm talking about the federal deficit . A new interactive poll shows voters are not only willing to take on the deficit , they 're pretty darned good at it . We sent CNN 's Tom Foreman to Las Vegas for our series `` Building up America . '' And Tom , when it comes to economic problems , you could call Nevada the poster child , yes ? TOM FOREMAN , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Yes , absolutely , Suzanne . You talk about getting jobs , people here really need them . But this interactive poll which is really interesting -- and we 're the first to have it here at CNN -- looked at about 2,000 Americans , including some here in Nevada , and said despite all these hard times , can we deal with the deficit , and how would you do it ? It was done by a group called the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland , and here is how it worked . They gave everybody a computer program that basically said here is the deficit in 2015 . It 's going to be well over $ 600 billion . Now , here are all these parts of the discretionary budget , how you can move things around , make more , make less , make people pay taxes . Imagine like a great big Rubik 's budget cube that people could move things around on the computer . And these folks went to work . On average , when they looked at cuts , the biggest things they went after were defense , intelligence , and federal highway programs . They said those things need to be cut . The majority of the group wanted to cut those . Other people wanted little increases , not great big ones , and there was n't a majority opinion on this . But generally , the group sort of liked the idea of increases for job training and for higher education and for energy conservation , Suzanne . Really interesting on that side of the equation . MALVEAUX : And Tom , it 's not all about spending . What are they saying about the revenue ? FOREMAN : You know , Suzanne , from being up on the Hill all those years around the White House , taxes are the big bugaboo out there that everyone is afraid of . But this group was n't afraid of it . And of course they went after people who are wealthier . They want higher taxes on higher earners and on corporations . But not everybody else gets off the hook . By and large , most of them seemed to see that a lot of people are going to pay more taxes , and they 'd like to see more taxes on alcohol and sugary drinks , at least in this focus group . MALVEAUX : And when you consider all the cuts in taxes , what was the bottom line here ? FOREMAN : Well , the bottom line is , if this group were put in charge of the deficit -- despite the fact that many of the politicians in Washington say voters have no stomach for this , these were average people out here who took part in this big interactive test . If they were in charge of everything , they were able to produce results that said they could average out to reducing the deficit by about 70 percent . That 's pretty big and that 's pretty hefty . But I will tell you this , Suzanne -- it was n't even all the way across the board . The people who were in this self-identified as to how they were involved in it -- and I want to bring up our last little graphic here to show you . In the end , the Republicans were able to cut the deficit by more than half . The Democrats , by a good bit more than that . But the real winners were the Independents . The Independents , more than anyone , seemed to be able to work this puzzle out . That does n't tell you what the real parties , the real representatives would do in the real world of politics , but it is a very interesting study . And I think more than anything , Suzanne , it shows that a lot of people out here who want to build up America again know that part of the equation is going to be this tough battle with the deficit and getting it under control , whatever formula we use . MALVEAUX : Absolutely , Tom . We 're going to see a real battle there at the White House as well . So thank you very much . We 'll see if they can actually get that done . Thank you , Tom . Well , forget the hospital . We 're going to show you the first stop for treatment for many of those wounded on the streets of Cairo . MALVEAUX : A quick look at what 's on the rundown . Treating the wounded on the streets of Cairo in the middle of violence . And a giant cyclone slams Australia . Chad Myers is going to survey the damage . Also , your answers to our Talk Back question . What will it take for people to believe that President Obama is a Christian ? And , finally , the Choose the News winner -- yes , that 's right , the story you picked to air this hour . Battles are under way in the streets of Cairo , Egypt . This is day 10 of protests against the government . Right now , tanks are keeping those for and against the government separated in Tahrir Square . The situation turned violent when pro-government demonstrators stormed the square . State media says at least five people have been killed , more than 800 wounded despite the military presence . International journalists are being targeted . Some are being arrested , others beaten . Now , we want to show you what happened to some of our own correspondents , not because we think they 're unique , but because it shows how quickly things can turn . HALA GORANI , CNN CORRESPONDENT : I 'm a little bit -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- because I was just shoved out of the way here . This is just a completely surreal experience . I 'm being told , walk , walk . This is a little chaotic . I have someone helping me out here . This is the scene . ANDERSON COOPER , HOST , `` AC360 '' -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : I was shooting this video on my Flip camera so as not to attract too much attention . Suddenly a man jumped out of the crowd and tried to grab Neil 's camera . That 's when all hell broke loose . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : Hey , calm down . -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : We only had about a block left to go when another guy came up and punched me in the head . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : I 've been hit now like 10 times . The Egyptian soldiers -- the Egyptian soldiers are doing nothing . MALVEAUX : What a shame . We understand that everybody is OK , but obviously very difficult reporting circumstances there . This morning a U.S. State Department spokesman condemned those attacks calling them a concerted campaign to intimidate international journalists . While many of Egypt 's wounded are being treated in makeshift hospitals , our senior international correspondent Bed Wedeman gives us a look inside of those . BEN WEDEMAN , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT -LRB- on camera -RRB- : All right . Well , we 're right in Tahrir Square , at what is a mosque that a few days ago was turned into a makeshift field hospital for people wounded in clashes and protests and whatnot . WEDEMAN : What we 've been told is some of our other crews who are inside Tahrir Square were roughed up by crowds , thrones of people . And certainly , as you know , our experience was , yes , they 're not very friendly to the media . So we 've been told to get off the square , to stay away and we were told to come back to the office . But given that to go back to the office we would actually have to cross through some of this hostile territory , our determination is that it is better to stay here where people are more media friendly than to go out there where we 're watching every few minutes somebody comes in with a great big gash on their head from a rock . So , we 're going to stay here . Obviously a very difficult situation but some people doing a fantastic job at just trying to deal with the circumstances there . Well , time is running out for you to Choose the News . Cast your vote by texting 22360 . Vote 1 , for Cubans turning to religion during tough times . Vote 2 , for the woman who found her biological family on Facebook . Or vote 3 , for the Egyptian woman who says she is willing to die for freedom . The winning story is going to air later this hour . Well , do you know where you 're going to be watching Sunday 's Super Bowl ? This power couple is heading for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue . One of our entertainment headlines . MALVEAUX : An apology on `` American Idol . '' An appearance on `` Saturday Night Live , '' for a singer with a mixed reputation , and an invitation , yes , to the White House for a superstar couple . She 's in Los Angeles with all the entertainment headlines . Kareen , it is great to see you . Tell us what happened on `` American Idol '' last night because I did n't see it . I did n't get a chance to see it . KAREEN WYNTER , CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT : Well , I will break it all down for you . Here 's the deal . `` American Idol '' made a very public apology last night . But this morning , Suzanne , no one seems to think it was , well , very sincere . They promoted this big apology pretty heavily , in fact , yesterday , leading to a lot of speculation as to just what the show was actually apologizing for . Then at the beginning of last night 's show they ran a statement apologizing for Steven Tyler 's -- he 's one of the hosts -- his behavior . But unless you were plugged in you had no idea what was really going on . Apparently Tyler told a contestant named Jake Muck his last name rhymed with the profanity -- we 're not going to say it . But most people did n't notice or did n't care because it was n't like it caused a lot of controversy . So , this apology is being seen as either a publicity stunt -- shocking -- to promote just how unpredictable Tyler is or a weak joke . But this one really baffles me . What 's going on here , Suzanne ? MALVEAUX : That 's very interesting . Now I understand that Chris Brown is trying to revive his career and clearly his reputation . Can you tell us what happened ? WYNTER : Well , he 's trying and what better way to do it than on `` Saturday Night Live . '' It was just announced , Suzanne , that the singer will be the musical guest on the show February 12th . Russell Brand , by the way , will be the host . Brown , of course , he saw his career and life just take a nose dive , go off track after beating up his then-girlfriend Rihanna . We do n't know if brown will appear in a sketch on the show or if he 'll perform . But this is a huge deal , a big , big public appearance for brown who has a new album coming out in March . So , good for him . MALVEAUX : Certainly is . So the Super Bowl this weekend . The president -- he 's having a few famous friends over . Not you and I. Unfortunately , he did n't invite us . WYNTER : What 's going on ? I know , I checked the guest list . We 're not on there . But , J. Lo and Marc Anthony , they sure are . They 're going to a very , very special Super Bowl party at the White House . 's reps confirmed to us that President Obama , he 's invited the celebrity couple to watch the game at his place . We know the president is a huge football fan and since his Chicago Bears , Suzanne , did n't make it to the Super Bowl , it looks like he 'll make the best of it with Marc and J. Lo . MALVEAUX : Yes , no. . I think they 'll be fine . WYNTER : They 'll be OK . And , they 're not just football fans , but Anthony is part owner of the Miami Dolphins . And , you know the White House better than I think anyone at the network , Suzanne . So what do you think would be the perfect dish to bring to the White House Super Bowl party ? MALVEAUX : Well , it 's funny because they have all these snacks that they have anyway . So they 've got salsa and chips and what I understand they 've got these huge chocolate chip cookies that they serve around on plates and everybody loves that . That 's like the favorite . So everybody 's eating those chocolate chip cookies . But , hey , you know , I guess you could bring anything if you can get it through security , though . Because I do n't think the president is just going to eat anything . WYNTER : That 's a good point . and Marc , they 'll be snacking all Sunday night long . MALVEAUX : All right . MALVEAUX : Nice you see you , too . Today on `` Showbiz Tonight , '' the heat is on Lindsay Lohan as police name her a suspect in a grand theft case . Could this drama land Lohan in prison ? `` Showbiz Tonight '' has Lindsay 's new legal limbo live at 5:00 p.m. Eastern on HLN . DAVID LETTERMAN , `` THE LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN '' : What a storm all across the country . As a matter of fact , in Chicago -- in Chicago alone there was so much snow -- here 's how much snow there was in Chicago . No new relatives have been able to reach Oprah . MALVEAUX : This week 's blizzard will go down as one of the worst in recent memory . It broke records in a lot of places . Chicago , as he was mentioning , got its third biggest snowfall on record . Almost two feet in some areas . While the storm has moved on , there are still some serious concerns . Driving , of course , is dangerous . A lot of roads , highways still covered with snow and ice . Well , a lot of you are responding to our `` Talk Back '' question about President Obama 's religion . What will it take for people to believe that President Obama is a Christian ? Edward says , `` unfortunately , for this president , it will take an act of God . '' More of your responses ahead in our `` Talk Back '' segment . MALVEAUX : We have some new information coming out of Egypt to tell you about . Another incident of a journalist being attacked . As we have already reported today , there are journalists who are attempting to cover the unrest and they are now being targeted in Egypt -- across Egypt . The latest today in Imbaba . This is a poor neighborhood of Cairo . According to our photojournalist Mary Rogers , a woman by the name of Marie Colvin , she is a journalist for `` The Sunday Times '' of London , was almost killed by a gang of men with knifes . And she says that one of them was a policeman in uniform . And our Mary Rogers tells us that if it was not for the kindness of these strangers to help this fellow journalist out from `` The London Times , '' a group of other men , they were trying going to -- they were trying to grab her and so they took her , they put her in a store , they locked it so that she would not have been killed , but they believe that she was just in that kind of danger . That is the kind of situation on the ground that is taking place throughout Egypt , but specifically in places that we have seen the kind of video here -- the chaos . And these are people who are just trying to bring the story to you from both sides who obviously are facing some very difficult conditions . Well , when the rocks and machete 's flew in Cairo 's Tahrir Square , American Hunter -- the American , rather , Hunter Moore , he was in the crowd . Hunter is a young American who was working as a teacher in Cairo . He and a friend , they shot this video that you 're watching for a CNN i-Report while helping the wounded yesterday . And he plans to jump in again today if necessary . I spoke with Hunter Moore just within the last hour . HUNTER MOORE -LRB- via telephone -RRB- : We 've been out there since last Tuesday , the 25th , and sort of assessed the need of what we could do to help . And we realized that we could get some medical supplies and some food to distribute . So that 's kind of the role that we played in -- MALVEAUX : What kind of injuries did you see ? MOORE : I beg your pardon . MALVEAUX : What kind of injuries did you see ? MOORE : Mostly head injuries . Easily 90 percent head injuries . Some that required much more medical attention than we could offer . A lot of it was , you know , many needed stitches . But it was mostly head injuries and a lot of them had come two or three times because they 'd get -- they 'd get patched up and they 'd run right back out there and come back with another head injury minutes later . MALVEAUX : And this was from what ? I understand there were machetes , there were rocks . So -- MALVEAUX : And what were people saying to you ? Was there a sense of despair ? You said they went back out and would fight again . MOORE : Yes , they went back out over and over again . They were screaming about freedom , screaming about democracy . There were -- there was a lot of solidarity in the crowd . They were thanking me . It was a really -- an amazing time to be out there . MALVEAUX : And , Hunter , in light of your experience here , you 've been in Cairo for quite some time . Do you have a sense that this is -- it 's time for you to go ? That you should leave this country ? MOORE : Not quite . You know , I 'm kind of -- just this past day we 've been -- we have n't been able to get down to Tahrir due to some rumors . And we 've tried to go , but we were warned by many people that they were being pretty hostile to foreigners . So we set kind of an ad hoc food drive and also a Facebook group called Medical Aid for Cairo , that we 're trying to organize getting some medical aid and food to the people of Cairo that need it right now . MALVEAUX : Hunter is working on a master 's degree in middle eastern studies at the American University of Cairo . He teaches English on the side . Well , here is your chance to talk back on one of the big stories of the day , President Obama 's religion . He spoke about people doubting his Christian faith at the National Prayer Breakfast earlier today . Carol Costello following this . CAROL COSTELLO , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Oh , it 's time to talk back and people are really talking back . And we appreciate it because the comments are -- they 're actually fabulous and thoughtful and I love them . At the National Prayer Breakfast , as you said , Suzanne , President Obama got really personal about his faith and Jesus . Some suspect he did that because one in five people in this country think President Obama is Muslim . So the `` Talk Back '' today , what will it take for people to believe President Obama is a Christian ? He says , `` the president of the United States is elected to run the executive branch of this country , not be the American version of the pope . Whether he is Muslim or Christian should not matter . '' `` If his name was John Smith , we would n't have this problem . '' `` As an atheist , I 'm supremely offended by this question . The ability and capacity to govern does not solely rest on the leader 's faith but in his skills and expert craft in legislation and public speaking . '' And this from Caesar . `` The heck with religion . There are still people out there that do n't believe Barack Obama is American . '' Thank you , Carol . Our producers are tallying the votes right now on the story you wanted to see this hour . `` Choose The News '' winner , that 's up ahead . MALVEAUX : OK , you voted for it . Now we are going to air it . `` Choose The News '' winner here . An Egyptian woman who says she is willing to die for freedom . That 's the choice . CNN 's Arwa Damon has her story from the front lines of the protests . NOHA TAREK , PROTESTER IN EGYPT : My name is Noha Tarek and I 'm 25 years old . I 'm doing a masters in political science . ARWA DAMON , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : And she wants her country to change . TAREK : It 's written President Mubarak and his police , the ones around him , in trial -LRB- ph -RRB- . DAMON -LRB- on camera -RRB- : So what 's it like for you to see this stuff spray painted all over the capital ? TAREK : It 's great . I mean at least -- and finally we have the freedom to do this . DAMON : You 're saying that , you know , you found your freedom now . Why are n't we -- why have n't we seen this kind of demonstration before ? TAREK : We do n't know . It 's -- we are all amazed . Before the government is -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . The beaters themselves are amazed . DAMON : Noha has been living here among fellow protesters in Cairo 's Tahrir Square since last Tuesday . TAREK : It makes me feel more safe than going back home , you know , -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- the way -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . DAMON : What do your parents say about the fact that you 're out here all day , all night ? I mean they must be worried about you . TAREK : My father is dead , actually . DAMON : Oh , I 'm sorry . TAREK : But my mother , sometimes she 's worried and sometimes she says the country is changing and I 'm proud of you . DAMON : Are you willing to die for this ? TAREK : I guess so , yes . I 've seen people dying in front of me . On Friday it was -- it was like -- Friday was like a war . It 's something -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- something unbelievable to see people dying for freedom . DAMON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Later at what 's been dubbed the million man march , we caught up with Noha again . TAREK : I think , yes , it might be the day . But even if it 's not again today , we 'll stay in the streets until it 's over . Even if we stay in the streets for months . We have our ammunition . DAMON -LRB- on camera -RRB- : And what is your ammunition ? TAREK : I have , you know , those masks because when they do tear gas we have -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- to put them on our -- in our nose . It 's the people 's revolution . It does n't have anything to do with politics even or religion . DAMON : You were telling us that your father passed away . What do you think he would say if he could see you right now ? TAREK : I think he 'd say , I 'm really sad that I did n't live to see this day . DAMON : Do you wish that he could be here with you as well ? But anyway , I 'll meet him in heaven and tell him all the things that happened . DAMON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Arwa Damon , CNN , Cairo . "}, {"uid": "103", "dct": "2011-02-03", "dates": [null, null], "text": "As unrest sweeps through the Middle East like wildfire , it 's worth remembering this crisis will cost all of us - especially at the gas station . And maybe -- just maybe -- this time , the chaos in that part of the world will finally be enough to break America 's addiction to foreign oil . Although Egypt is not a major oil producer , it plays a key role in the transport of oil and gas headed to the U.S. , Europe and Asia through the Suez Canal . Without it , shippers would have to send crude oil and gas around the Horn of Africa . That adds on more than two weeks of delivery time to global markets . With the ongoing violence and protests in Egypt , some shippers are worried about disruptions to the Suez Canal or nearby pipelines . Nearly 2.5 million barrels of oil go through the canal every day -- that 's about equal to Iraq 's output . All this comes as global oil supplies are tightening -- mostly due to China 's increasing demand . And the markets are reacting . Crude is trading at more than $ 103 a barrel -- that 's a 28-month high . Even before the Mideast erupted , some experts were predicting gas at $ 5 a gallon by 2012 . And it 's not just about the money . So much of the politics of the region has always been dictated by our need for oil . It would be nice to do what 's in our best national interest for a change ... instead of being beholden to Mideast dictators for their oil . Here s my question to you : Should the chaos in the Middle East be enough to break America 's addiction to foreign oil ? Interested to know which ones made it on air ? It should be , but it wo n't . We do not have an affordable , long-range , electric-powered alternative to replace our fossil fuel guzzling cars . Until that happens , we are hooked on oil . I 'll bet if BP and the other big oil companies held a majority interest in electric or battery production , we would have efficient , low-cost electric or hybrid vehicles next week . Not as long as the oil companies run this country . The only way America is going to escape the stranglehold of foreign oil is for oil to become so expensive Americans can no longer afford to buy it . Once that happens , then we will start to get serious about alternate fuels and other modes of transportation . Remember gas lines in the 70s ? If that did n't do it , nothing will . Americans are almost more loathe to give up their precious SUV gas-guzzlers than their guns . Mark in New Jersey writes : Of course not , Jack . The oil companies would never allow it , and they have more to say about it than us , the stupid voters . The House and the Senate are owned by the oil companies -- lock , stock , and barrel , no pun intended . Should it be enough ? Will it be enough ? It seems we 're happier to complain than make the difficult decisions to remove ourselves from foreign dependence . Natural gas , offshore drilling or solar panels , I do n't care ! Let 's do all of it and make America strong again ! In the land of two-Hummer families , I do n't think that 's very likely . Does a heroin addict stop buying heroin because his dealer is having a family dispute ? Foreign oil flows through our national veins like heroin in a junkie , so not only can we not stop , we will not be allowed to stop because they are addicted to our money the same way . Terry - Greensburg , IN `` Hoosier Hillbilly '' Should the chaos in the Middle East be enough to break America 's addiction to foreign oil ? Show `` US '' the closest re-hab center ! February 3 , 2011 at 2:59 pm | In the land of two-Hummer families I do n't think that 's very likely . February 3 , 2011 at 3:00 pm | The only way to break the U.S. addiction to foreign oil is to put the entire country into a rehab facility . February 3 , 2011 at 3:10 pm | The caos in the middle east will not affect our addiction to foreign oil because america runs on oil not dunkin donuts . The only affect caos has in the middle east is to raise the price of oil which in turn means more money for the oil companies in the u.s. and more billions for the derivatives gamblers on wall street . All main street can do is to sit back buckle up and pay more money . I thought the reason we are spending billions in iraq and afghanistan was to maintain stability in the middle east . February 3 , 2011 at 3:12 pm | if the price hits five dollars that will break out back . February 3 , 2011 at 3:16 pm | Green Energy pushed by President Obama is the right direction . Has n't the Middle East been in chaos since 1948 ? Nothing has changed our addiction to foreign oil or for that matter domestic oil . Until the greed is taken out of the equation or we run out of oil I see nothing changing . At $ 5.00 , or anything near that , Americans will be screaming for relief . Obama will continue to push for alternatives to fossil fuels . The giant oil companies , and their wholly-owned subsidiary , the Republican Party , will be echoing Sarah Palin 's famous `` Drill Baby , Drill '' chant . A compromise is likely and it will certainly diminish , if not end , our addiction to foreign oil . Of course not , Jack . The oil companies would never allow it , and they have more to say about it than we , the stupid voters . The House , and the Senate are owned by the oil companies , lock , stock , and barrel , no pun intended . February 3 , 2011 at 3:29 pm | Do n't be silly Jack . In the globalized economy what 's good for a multinational corporation is often times at odds with some if not all nation-states . High oil prices benefit Big Oil and Big Oil owns our government , largely dictates our foreign policy , and suppress ' any competitor energy by either buying up the technology and shelving it or discrediting the technology with massive disinformation campaigns . Rest assured that the only thing that will break our addiction to Mid-East oil is the Mid-East running out of oil . February 3 , 2011 at 3:30 pm | Cliff Glass - East Rockaway , NY Maybe you 've forgotten the Supreme Courts Soylent Green decision . When the Republican majority on the High Court decreed that '' Corporations -LRB- read : oil comanies -RRB- is people '' -- decisions for the collective public good have been permanently discarded in favor of campaign contributions . February 3 , 2011 at 3:32 pm | it 's time for us to start drillingwe have enough oil and other resourses February 3 , 2011 at 3:32 pm | Not likely Jack , Dems will never allow offshore drilling to make it happen . And they will use the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico as the reason why . February 3 , 2011 at 3:36 pm | It should be but it wo n't , US oil intrests are too powerful . February 3 , 2011 at 3:39 pm | No this wo n't do it . The only thing that will force us to change is when there is n't any available at all . This is like a confirmed smoker who used to pay 10 cents for a pack of cigaretts who still smokes even when the cost is over $ 10 a pack . We may be forced to use less but we 'll still use it . February 3 , 2011 at 3:39 pm | That would be the best thing to happen to us , then maybe we could mind our own business instead of theirs . Although all know the big oil companies are in bed with the government and they certainly do not want us break up our love affair with oil ! February 3 , 2011 at 3:41 pm | If not NOW , when ? I say to Presiden Obama and all future Presidents it 's time to stop entertaining these Middle East TUGS at the White House . February 3 , 2011 at 3:47 pm | As long as the US is filled with oil lobbyists and aligns itself with dictators , I see no end to foreign oil in sight . Expect any move to a greener form of energy to be labeled as `` job killing '' and immediately shot down . you know the drill . February 3 , 2011 at 3:51 pm | Some time it takes tough love to break an addiction . That might be the case for the United States when it comes to Mideast oil . With this kind of unstable Middle East the price for all oil will go through the roof . The oil companies right now with the help from our gov ' t is our main source for fuel . But when the price for oil goes so high that people are unable to afford it . They will protest as loudly as the people in Egypt are protesting . This will force Congress to give alternative fuels an equal playing field and help to get off the ground . Before the oil companies with all their money and powerful lobbyist were always able to squash any outsiders from getting a foothold into the business . February 3 , 2011 at 3:54 pm | Tom Mytoocents Fort Lauderdale , Florida As America struggles to overcome the theft of our economy and treasury from the Titans of TARP we will be forced to overcome the inevitable $ 4.00 a gallon gas of 2007 . . As our economy heals and inflation slowly overcomes money stolen from the Treasury , petroleum stockpiles will decrease driving the barrel\\/gallon price higher . Once the price exceeds $ 4.00 a gallon US , it really does n't matter if it 's $ 4.00 or $ 10.00 a gallon . People ca n't afford it that signals the end of recovery . We saw this play out in a stronger 2007 economy . Chaos in the Middle East will likely become the `` Change You can Believe '' promised by Obama . The result will be an end of either the USA or our dependance on OPEC Oil . February 3 , 2011 at 3:54 pm | Paul , New Port Richey , Florida America runs on oil , coal , natural gas and nuclear energy . It is the EPA and our own government that is breaking America 's energy back and not the Middle East . They are simply taking advantage of us with the opportunity handed them by our own people and no doubt rewarding same for their help . February 3 , 2011 at 3:54 pm | Every president since Carter has talked a good talk about energy independence but we will only take action if there is enough pain to motivate us like $ 10\\/gallon gasoline . Until then `` Americans for Prosperity '' will continue to funnel millions of oil and gas industry money -LRB- Thanks to Citizens United -RRB- into pro-oil and gas ads and the coal industry will spend more millions promoting `` clean '' coal . February 3 , 2011 at 3:55 pm | Its nowhere near enough to break our dependency . Our country is notorious for learning from mistakes only AFTER the fact . What a refreshing change of pace it would be if we could alter our behavior before another 1970s oil crisis occurred . February 3 , 2011 at 4:01 pm | NO !! Nothing will break our addiction to `` any '' oil . We have been passing energy bills for some 35 years and when an oil crisis hits we buy fuel efficient cars , pass energy bills , grill oil company executives , threaten NYMEX traders , and even threaten to drop bombs on the oil producing nations . As soon as the price of crude drops back , it is once again back to business as usual until the next crisis , and the next , etc. , etc. , etc. . We American 's account for 3.5 % of the worlds population , but we consume 25 % of the worlds oil supply , and that means that we American 's consume 20,000,000 barrels of oil every day . The figures speak for themselves and we will choke to death on our own gas fumes before we demand consumption limits on our love for crude ! February 3 , 2011 at 4:02 pm | It should n't have to take chaos to spur change we desperately need . It 's in our best interest to move away from oil , it would help to stabilize our economy . So just as the fuel crunch in the 70 's helped spur the birth of small cars , a steep spike in fuel prices now should spur interest in electric and fuel cell vehicles . Like Plato said : ` Necessity is the mother of invention ' February 3 , 2011 at 4:05 pm | Nothing short of hitting rock bottom will break our addiction to foreign oil , and we 're still a long way from that . As long as the price of oil escalates there are escalating profits to be made . Foreign devils will pump it , fleets will ship it , middlemen and speculators will flip it and Washington will tax it . Rock bottom happens when profits dwindle , not when prices rise . February 3 , 2011 at 4:08 pm | The sun coming up some 20 years ago should have been good enough reason for us to work toward reducing dependence on foreign oil . A crisis on the African continent wo n't change a thing except for possibly having to loose a few thousand more of Americas youth in order to de nationalize oil rich countries . We are like pigs at the troth when it comes to oil consumption and that 's just the way the oil companies and their elected lackeys want us . Besides all that , how often have you seen the `` powers that be '' who run this country do what 's in our best national interest for a change ? February 3 , 2011 at 4:10 pm | 4000 American lives sacrificed for our occupation of Iraq and yet not a single drop of oil that flows from the earthen taps of Iraq enters a single U.S. port ! February 3 , 2011 at 4:13 pm | Boone Pickens will send us plenty of oil from Canada sand oil at about $ 5.00 a gallon . Sarasota , Florida February 3 , 2011 at 4:14 pm | It should be , Jack , but you know the republicans will not allow it . They are in the pockets of big oil and will not support anything other than their outlandish profits . February 3 , 2011 at 4:20 pm | Jack , I think that the high price of gas per gallon should be more than enough to break our addiction to oil . Gas prices are slated to go to $ 4 per gallon by late spring if not sooner . We should have started kicking our oil addiction 40 years ago during the OPEC Oil Enbargo in the 1970 's . We have another chance to do just that -- Take a page from Brazil !! Also , we can expedite the manufacture and sale of electric cars with fuel cells that regenerate power , eliminating the need to recharge our auto batteries from an electrical outlet . February 3 , 2011 at 4:21 pm | Are you kiddin ' me Jack . Being retired from a major oil company I can assure you we all got together once a week to figure out new ways to screw the public . America 's so hooked on oil there 's not a politician in sight that could control the demand . That includes the guy in the Oval Office . This little `` dust-up '' in Egypt gives us just another opportunity to up the price at the pump . A drug addict does n't stop using just because the cartel has a few shakeups . The only way the situation in the Middle East could break our addiction to foreign oil is if it spreads to the point where it severely impedes our supply , which does n't seem likely right now . Barring a massive `` eureka '' moment from conservatives , the only way our oil addiction will ever be cured is when we 're forced to go `` cold turkey '' , either by far greater turmoil in the Middle East , or when we simply run out . Unfortunately , we will suffer severe withdrawal pains if we wait that long . It is absolutely vital that we break our addiction to foreign oil and maybe the unrest in the Middle East will push us in the right direction . Now , with an intelligent and educated President in the White House and , without two oil men in charge of our country , GW Bush and Cheney , we may have a chance to finally make some progress . February 3 , 2011 at 4:27 pm | I certainly hope so . Our privilege should not be at the cost of freedom from the country 's it comes from . Kathleen Parker , South Carolina Chaos in the Middle East SHOULD be enough to make any rational person push our government to `` fast track '' our own alternative energy programs . However , I am certain that once again , Big Oil and their Hired guns in Congress will spend millions of dollars to convince the clueless that such an energy program would be too expensive . Wake up people , one way or another , expensive oil is coming and our way of life built on oil is going . February 3 , 2011 at 4:30 pm | No , the chaos in the Middle East will not be the watershed event that ends the US 's dependency on oil . Most of the oil consumed in the United States comes from outside the Middle East , and the American public will not accept an immediate shift to alternative fuel sources . At some point , Americans should begin a gradual transition to alternative fuel sources , but it will be one the government will support . Private individuals and companies are too stubborn to change . - Strom In Charleston , South Carolina February 3 , 2011 at 4:30 pm | No. . But it damn sure better make our President step up and open up all drilling for oil & natural gas and get started on the 1st of many new nuclear power plants and oil refineries that are needed . Next , we need to see whatever O 's admin has done -LRB- if anything -RRB- on the new power grid design -- American citizens will not accept new taxes , cap-and-trade , or any such crap before they show us the new grid design and can explain -LRB- without passing legislation , first ! -RRB- how it is going to work . Then , maybe Obama 's Sputnik moment can come in the way of developing solar\\/wind power generating devices so the average homeowner can put a few panels and spinners on his\\/her home and use actually some green power . We will be using oil for the next 20 years even if the ` big green breakthrough ' happens tomorrow . February 3 , 2011 at 4:32 pm | It should , Jack , but it probably wo n't . The only way to break our addiction to imported oil is to use less oil . We use oil because the cost of oil at the pump has been kept artificially low . One major hidden cost we will the face if there is a major disruption is the fact that in the short term we have no alternative to oil . If gas goes to $ 10 a gallon next month , we will be facing economic catastrophe . The only way to use less oil is to slap a $ 1 per gallon tax on the stuff immediately , and raise that tax $ 1 a year forever . But no politician has the guts to do that . And no , we can not produce enough domestic oil to `` drill our way out '' of the problem . February 3 , 2011 at 4:45 pm | Does a heroin addict stop buying heroin because his dealer is having a family dispute ? Foreign oil flows through our national veins like heroin in a junkie , so not only can we not stop , we will not be allowed to stop because they are addicted to our money the same way . February 3 , 2011 at 4:46 pm | Of course it wo n't because the U.S. is already addicted to Canadian oil coming from our tar sands . Americans should know that Canada is your single largest oil exporter . They should also know that the oil industry is making a wasteland in that part of my country . The whole world needs to take alternative energy sources much more seriously . Living off fossil fuels indefinitely is unsustainable . February 3 , 2011 at 4:48 pm | Get real Jack , its mostly accepted that the price of gas must reach the $ 7 or $ 8 per gallon range before that happens . All this happy talk about green energy , electric cars , etc is just that ! It will be a few decades before fossil fuels costs exceed that of alternative fuels . Infraustructure will have to be revamped , not just our `` addiction '' to fossil fuels . If we had concentrated on making fossil fuels cleaner , and used technology to improve the use of fossil fuels , and too , prevent the environmental problems of fossil fuels , we would not be so dependent on foreign oil as we are today . The U.S. dos n't need chaos in the middle east to be free a foreign oil all we have to do is us our own resourses , China and Vietnam are going to be drilling in the gulf of mexico for oil , but our goverment wo n't allow U.S. companies to drill there , costing our economy thousands of jobs and making us even more dependent on foreign oil , while all this stupidity is going on in Washington , the wise people in the last congress that could n't manage to pass a budget were able to come up with 10 billion dollars to give to Brasile to develope their offshore oil fields , in waters twice as deep as what we were drilling !! February 3 , 2011 at 5:01 pm | The Suez Canal does n't have much impact on US oil supplies . The canal is too small for really big efficient supertankers , and even smaller ones have to pay over $ 300,000 in tolls , and then there are all the pirates at the south end of the Red Sea . America needs to get serious about not funding terrorism and dictatorships . I think a $ 1 per gallon 9\\/11 tax is a good place to start , and it 's something our leaders should have had the guts to do nine years ago . February 3 , 2011 at 5:10 pm | Not a chance Jack ! Our Corporate entities would never allow that to happen . February 3 , 2011 at 5:14 pm | I am hopeful that the chaos in the Middle East will not only break America 's addiction to oil , but that we as a nation will finally pursue , in earnest , alternative fuels and formulate a comprehensive energy policy for our country . I am also , hopeful that we are learning that this country no longer can afford to allow partisan politics , race , gender , religion affiliations and sexual orientations to divide us as a Nation . The chaos in the Middle East is a wake up call to America that we must be `` undivided '' ; that we must be `` United '' . We must start to listen to the words in our pledge of allegiance to our flag , and then we must practice those words in our day to day living in this country . February 3 , 2011 at 5:16 pm | I understand that the Paris HIlton of politics is organizing a giant Moose , Polar Bear and environmentalist hunt to clear the Alaskan oil fields of obstacles to oil drilling , as we speak . February 3 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | If the Suez were blocked and tankers had to round the Horn of Africa , the Somali pirates would become some the weathiest people on the continent . Of course it is past time to break our dependenceon Middle East oil . We could produce fuel from coal ; the Germans did just that during WWII ; a fact petrochemical companies want us to forget . The U.S. has the largest coal supplies on Earth . February 3 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | February 3 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | We can only hope so , but as long as the republicans are getting their pockets stuffed with money from big oil it will never happen , same as the wars we 're in , to much defense industry money going to the republicans to stop the war . February 3 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | They pay $ 7 a gallon for gas in England . Other countries pay way more than we do . It will take gas prices rising to these levels to begin to break our addiction . February 3 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | I hope so . It will force our country to become inventive and create newer and better efficient cars , heating and cooling etc. . It 's time for our government to return to building America for their tax payers . Or the `` I want change '' will be come larger and louder with every generation . sounds a little familiar . Maybe , `` it is time '' for our government to read the handwriting on the wall . Maybe instead of addressing Pres. Obama we should address it too congress February 3 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | Jack , once we attain 20 % unemployment we will relax our dependence on gas and oil . Might be cheaper in the long run and save lives if we isolate this country from the interests of big business . Natural gas in the way to go , period . February 3 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | Give me a break ! If I 'm not mistaken most of our oil comes frfom Canada , Mexico and wells in the gulf of Mexico . Most of The oil brought in from the Middle East is refined here and exported to countries that do not have refining capabilities -LRB- like Iran -RRB- . Remaining an oil dependent nation puts us in a highly enviable position . When the oil runs out and we do n't have an alternative we will ... Drastically cut our carbon footprint . Air polution will disappear almost over night . Become much healthier as a nation from all the exercise we get from walking to work . We will eat healthier from eating produce grown in our back yards . Experience significant economic growth in carriage making , saddle making and other related local industries . It can only be win-win for us . February 3 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | In one word no. . Give it all the lip service you want , we do n't have a plan . We do n't drill , the white house only wants to regulate the issue even if we go broker as a country . They want expensive gas and will use green house gases as their excuse . They only want us to look to them for all the answers , while limiting our movements . And guess what the politicians will still fly around in their jets telling us how bad things are and what they can do to help . I 've heard it all before . February 3 , 2011 at 5:38 pm | It should , but it wo n't , sadly . Just think , years ago we could have been the leaders in all things energy efficient . Now it looks like China will lead the way . Gotta love those oil and energy lobbyists in DC doing what 's best for their bottom line instead of what 's best for the US . Same tune , different day . February 3 , 2011 at 5:39 pm | We have lots of oil in u.s. . We are just saving it while we use other people 's supply . Of course at the same time some are demanding to be able to find new supplies wherever there is dirt or water . As long as we have a system where chaos increases the bottom line of international corporations nothing is going to change the oil economic system . February 3 , 2011 at 5:41 pm | February 3 , 2011 at 5:43 pm | I think it is not a problem . It is all about greed . The people are Muslims , so it make a certain amount of sense to be governed by a Muslim leadership -LRB- surprise ! -RRB- . As soon as they discover the benefits of making profits off the oil and canal shipping they will quickly become vested members of the international community , and maintain the flow of oil . February 3 , 2011 at 5:43 pm | My home solar panel blew away in the blizzard . To keep from litterly freezing to death I am burning lot 's of firewood and using lots of natural gas to keep me warm . Ironically , deep water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico provided gobs of domestic oil . As you know , it has been gone now for about 6 months . Possibly we should forget about building a Disney world in Anwar , Alaska 'cause our dependence on oil is going up , whether domestic or foreign . Yeah '' it should , but will the Republicans and the oil companies which they support see it from that perspective . February 3 , 2011 at 5:45 pm | Jack I like too know what the worlds attitude will be toward the middle east when theres no longer any oil to suck out of their sand ? Something tells me they will get the ultimate cold shoulder . Beside headachs and oil , the world gets very little from that area . When oil producing countries have no oil to pacify the worlds thirst , but have access to nukes , I wonder how long before blackmail starts to become the next big thing ! Chaos in the middle east started before Christ was born . It doesn ; t help that the Jews and Palestinian have been fighting over control of the same piece of land for nearly a century . Why did we start a war in Iraq ? Why did we overthrow the elected government of Iran ? Who is running this country ? February 3 , 2011 at 5:49 pm | And what would be our alternative ? You forget that there are places that are NOT served by public transportation . We moved here in 1948 , how long should we wait for the bus to the county seat ? February 3 , 2011 at 5:52 pm | You would think so , but it wo n't happen . I remember as a kid the oil embargo of the early 70 's . It did n't cause any change in the ` car ' culture of the U.S. at that time either . Even a few years back when oil was above $ 125 a barrel and gas prices averaging almost $ 4.00 per gallon it did n't cause a fundamental shift . Nope , the U.S. wo n't wake up till it is way way too late . Nothing will change until the hold by the oil industry on our politicians and country is broken . But even then we are behind the curve in comparison to other countries in electric cars and alternative energy sources . Sad thing is we invented alot of that technology here , and now we are piddling it away . Jack , if the thousands that have died in Iraq has not broken us . What makes you think chaos in the middle east will be enough to break us ? What makes my blood boil is the Trillions we have sent to the Middle East to people who absolutely hate every thing we stand for ! Just think where we would be now if we spent those trillions of dollars on electric cars and the infrastructure to go along with them . Instead of and electric car that only goes 100 miles on a charge , we might have one that would go 300 miles . Its like the US is dating the ugliest girl\\/guy in the world just because their daddy is filthy rich ! Its time to move on ! February 3 , 2011 at 5:54 pm | Of course not , not this Egyptian crisis anyway . Even when gas hits $ 5 bucks a gallon we will grouse and complain but we 'll still drive ... maybe less driving . I cut back on driving 3 years ago and have only driven 42 miles per week since then . I used to drive a few hundred so I 'm saving money everyday . Truth is we have no solution to quickly replace the oil problem ... we just try to tell ourselves we do . Maybe we should grow more corn for ethanol so more people can starve ? February 3 , 2011 at 5:55 pm | I doubt if we will but the US should have more choices . February 3 , 2011 at 5:57 pm | Jack , Nothing is going to break oils grip on our country . If everything we know and has happened so far has n't done it , then nothing will . When the price of gas goes up , it only hurts the poor and middle class who are just trying to support themselves and their families . We have had the technology for alternative energy for many years , and we only pay lip service to it . The electric car is a catch 22 . Do we burn more coal or build nuclear plants to keep up with the huge increase in electric we will need if everyone goes to electric ? We are always going to be sucking at the Middle East oil teat . February 3 , 2011 at 6:03 pm | It should . We are supposed to be so smart but sometimes I think that we are slow learners . Read the writing on the wall already ! February 3 , 2011 at 6:04 pm | If the price of gas goes up to four dollars a gallon it will bring our economy to it 's knees and we will go strait into another depression and Obama will be toast in 2012 . February 3 , 2011 at 6:11 pm | Jack , not even a 12 step program could get us off of foreign Oil . That 's just not the American way , we will stay addicted to anything as long as it makes us feel better about our lives , just ask the Tobacco Industry February 3 , 2011 at 6:13 pm | No , it is not enough . We have to be anywhere we think can sell us their oil . It makes sense for our strategic interest . February 3 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | That whole question is really insane this country is not addicted to oil it is totally dependent on oil we in no way prepared to survive without it our country will be crushed . February 3 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | February 3 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | No , it will not break America 's addiction to foreign oil . America is to fat and lazy ... February 3 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Chris ftom Toronto . . You folks need to remember !! the majority of your OIL and Gnatural gas you consume comes from CANADA February 3 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | That would be nice , Jack . Too bad you worked so hard to help elect Republicans who will do anything for the oil industry , even if it hurts the country . As Wolf pointed out , we 've been talking about ending our reliance on foreign oil for more than 30 years from now . Sadly , based on the lack of leadership in Washington D.C. , the USA will be addicted to oil until the last drop is squeezed out of the desert . Provided , of course , China does n't buy it first . Should it yes , will it no. . When politicans are more enthralled with trying to keep the President from doing anything and trying to reform healthcare we have no chance of an actual debate to try to kick our habbit . Like you said this has been a topic for 30 years and will be for probably another 30 . February 3 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | Not gonna happen . Many Americans do n't even know there is turmoil in Egypt . And our politicians are too indebted to the oil money to rock the boat . February 3 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | February 3 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | Should it be enough ? Will it be enough ? It seems we 're happier to complain than make the difficult decisions to remove ourselves from foreign dependence . Natural gas , offshore drilling or solar panels , I do n't care ! Let 's do all of it and make America strong again ! February 3 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | The Pentagon , military industrial complex and the multinational corporations that own our elected officials and run our country will never let that happen , Jack . -LRB- see Los Angeles during the 30s 40s and 50s -RRB- They 're all more interested in profits than in anything that is best for human beings . They convinced half the country that war is better than peace , illness is more profitable than health , and our addiction to petroleum is the monkey on our back that will make them richer than ever . There are no more leaders of by and for the American people , Jack . Especially when it comes to protecting and increasing their profits . February 3 , 2011 at 6:24 pm | We in the US are not addicted to oil . Most people want a cleaner , more effecient energ . It 's just the need for oil is forced upon us by our governemnt and their corparate masters . The combination of bank debt of oil producing nations , coupled with big oil interests are whats behind our system of burning as much oil as possible . After all , this is the culture of greed . February 3 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | Are you kidding ? It 's so obvious to this old lady that too many Amrican citizens do n't pay much attention to the world news . It 's all about sports like the coming event this Sunday . Where I live it 's like a National Holiday ... the Super Bowl . I know of some who think of others and try to help as much as they can in these ` tight economical ' times ... good people . BUT I reallly do n't know what would have to happen to have many Americans ` do the ` right thing ' . I 'm afraid there are too many selfish , spoiled and ignorant people out there . February 3 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | Although it would still be considered a foreign oil supply for the USA the Athabasca oil sands is a solution to American dependence on at least foreign oil from corrupt dictatorships and unstable nations . The supply of oil that can come from Canada is enough to supply all of North America for the century , but at the moment we are unfortunately seeing more investment into Canadian oil from the Chinese then the USA . We will pay whatever price appears at the pump . I believe Americans should get used to riding MASS TRANSIT or buy a DAMN BIKE !!!!!!!!!!!!! America get ready to open up your wallets !!!!! February 3 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | As long as our politicians worry more about getting re-election money from big oil than doing what is right for our country , we will be addicted to oil , probably until oil runs out . February 3 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | An oil company will soon be in the process of testing a new process for effectively extracting clean oil from shale in Kentucky . The process will allow the production of unbelievable amounts of North American oil . There 's enough oil shale in Canada and the U.S. to get us off foreign oil . Let 's take advantage of that resource first , and we can get off oil altogether later . We are the ONLY nation without an Energy Plan ! We 've had our head in the sand -LRB- and other places -RRB- since the Oil Embargo of ' 73 ... why is this going to be any different ? \\* sigh \\* February 3 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | What percentage of our oil is from the Middle East ? Do n't see the U.S. trying to break the dependency , especially with the support they give to Middle Eastern allies like Egypt . I especially do n't think our country and its citizens has the capacity to sacrifice the standard of living we have enjoyed . Soon we will not have a choice , however . This is only the beginning and I do n't see it getting better any time soon . February 3 , 2011 at 6:25 pm | Your problem is not about foreign oil , but simply oil in general . The current major exporter of oil to the USA is Canada . You will always need foreign oil until you make major changes to your dependence on oil . Renewal energy is the only way to go if you look longterm , rather than the next spike in gasoline prices or international crisis . Oh please , Jack . The Tea Party still needs their SUVs to carry all their ammo and guns , because the 2nd amendment tells them it is the right thing to do . No , their elected neglected to read about the forefathers considering anything not in their progeny to be 3\\/5ths a person when the constitution was recently read in congress . But , this revolt is about the 3\\/5ths and the Tea Party is confused . What 's the fuss ? They just need to fill up their SUV . They do n't care where the gas comes from . Just get it here . I 'm just a 60-percentor . February 3 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | Should it ? Not a chance . . Unless we fundamentally change the way we create , produce , accept and implement newer technology . I fear we will be slaves to the Middle East for the balance of my lifetime and those of the next generation . But boy it would be nice to see how long it takes the Middle East to change its tune if we stopped all need for its oil . February 3 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | Stop calling us oil addicts . For the average working Joe 's , what are the alternatives to foreign oil ? Other than major cities , the US has no decent mass transit . Stop blaming the worker bees and do n't call us addicts . We hate going to the pumps because we are sadly aware that every $ 40 tank of gas supports our dependence . The wealthy corporations may be the addicts . This wo n't break their addiction if they make more profits . Of course we should do whatever we need to do to get off foreign oil -- and begin to replace it with nuclear energy . Tom Friedman went through all the arguments in his book , `` Hot , Flat and Crowded '' several years ago , in which he accurately describes America 's energy future as `` electric . '' If our politicians can find the guts to cut the hose , we will not only be energy independent , we will deprive those Islamic lunatics of their most potent weapon -- our money . February 3 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | ever since the nixon doctrine , you guys have been relying on israel to do the dual job of dividing egypt geographically from other arabs to keep them from grouping and forming some regional power , as well as act as your agent to help you control the massive oil reserves of the middle east . it is precisely this control over world oil supplies that enables the US to be a super power -LRB- by constituting just above 20 % of the world 's gross production of goods using the energy you get out of it -RRB- . i.e. the US will lose this addiction the day it loses world domination . February 3 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | Jack , we have had enough of thier oil . lets be fair and keep the remaining for those youth who share the same dreams of our own natoin . February 3 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | The only way that the addiction would be broken is if the suez canal was closed for an extended period of time and gas prices were driven up to over $ 5 a gallon . With the knowlege that soaring gas prices could come anytime , the funding for altewrnitive fuel resecrch would skyrocket . This should have been done years ago , -LRB- as in the 90 's -RRB- but the outcome still might have mixed blessings . February 3 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | I do n't think that this will break Americas dependency on foreign oil . I think that everyday Americans are blind to the fact that we depend on these nations -LRB- The Middle East -RRB- to supply so much of our oil . Everyday Americans are focused on Health Care reform and tax cuts more than they are concerned about oil and rising prices . Americans also do not see how much we depend on the Middle East for oil , we see commercials about clean oil here in America but not the oil that we get from the Middle East . Foreign oil is not the top item President Obama 's agenda and it should be due to the events in Egypt and Middle East happening . February 3 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | Americans are an independent people with the exception of oil . The only way your going to get Americans off of oil is to outlaw it or come up with a cheaper thing to put in their vehicles . February 3 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | This situation in the Middle East is nothing but a great opportunity for speculators and oil companies to make more money . Arab countries have nothing to do it . You ought to take a serious look at who is really exploiting American people and the rest of the world . February 3 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | Do you honestly think the `` Bush 's '' of the world are going to roll over and let this happen ? This should have happened 40 years ago and not as a result of access or lack thereof to a canal ! February 3 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | I have a geothermally-heated house , and my electricity is solar-generated . I have my own well . I used reclaimed materials in constructing the house , and I conscientiously recycle . And yet I drive many thousands of miles per year -- my greatest environmental sin , and an addiction that 's hard to break when your family is spread all over the country . February 3 , 2011 at 6:26 pm | That will solve our dependency of foreign oil . When you are starving you do n't run out and try to invent how to grow some new kind of food and harvest it . You simply look for a source of what you need that is available ... Now ! You can work on your experimental projects all you want when you do n't have the immediate need . I really hate to hear over and over that Americans have an addiction to oil . The technology to relieve the country of this so called addiction has been in place for a long time . If the alternatives were readily available people would respond by using them . Yes , this has been a problem since the 70 's and it has been only been given a small amount of attention . But , I resent that it is called America 's addiction to oil . Let us definie it for what it is ... big oil companies and oil lobbiests and congress in cahoots for profit . It is way past time to do something serious about this problem . Hopefully , we have not waited to long at this point ! February 3 , 2011 at 6:27 pm | It should be but wo n't be as history over the last 60 years has dictated . To change our way of life , a way that is based partially on gluttony and lack of self control , is the same way it has always been , hit the pocket book and unite through hardship are the ways we seem to find self discipline . The only way we will be rid of Mideast oil is a strict cap and trade law that will initiate strong ingenuity and creativity , and\\/or a total blockade of oil from the Mideast by the Mideast . Do we as a society have the stomach for either ? February 3 , 2011 at 6:27 pm | As long American big corporations continue to make huge profits , forget it . They have lobbysts in Washington to thwart any good intentions . Others will claim , it will kill jobs in America . February 3 , 2011 at 6:27 pm | As long as our politicians worry more about getting re-election money from big oil than doing what is right for our country , we will be addicted to oil , probably until oil runs out . The answer is simple : break off our dependence on Mideast Oil and use natural gas . North America has stockpiles of natural gas in storage . It is a more affordable alternative . February 3 , 2011 at 6:27 pm | The issue is not `` addiction to foreign oil , '' the issue is `` addiction to oil . '' Why are we addicted to oil ? Three reasons : Because we refuse to reduce consumption and we refuse to have fewer children and we refuse to green our economy . If each woman had one child and if we did n't consume things we do n't need and if we insisted that all energy be green , we would not only solve the `` oil problem , '' we 'd also solve global warming and destruction of biodiversity and world hunger , etc. . I 've come to assume that most people in the USA are incapable of cultural change , are incapable of caring about other species , and are incapable of caring about other people , It 's sad . The elites at the top are the worst when it comes to consumption . What is the carbon footprint of a rich child in the USA ? Do people even consider their carbon legacy ? Murtagh at OSU did this research . It 's not just about foreign oil consumption , it 's about the number of children we choose to have and our level of consumption and our trampling on `` the rights '' of other species as well . ~ Tara Waters Lumpkin February 3 , 2011 at 6:27 pm | It is definitely wishful thinking . Every time there is a crisis in the middle east , our dependence on foreign oil is brought to the table . People go into a panic as gas prices rise , and ideas , some wonderful , are kicked around for a few days . Then , our new oil shipments from Venezuela or Brazil come in , and everyone returns to old habits . My , how I would love to see the day come , Jack , but I do n't think that it 's today . February 3 , 2011 at 6:27 pm | You should go back and count the number of times you have asked `` Will -LRB- Blank -RRB- be enough to push us to end our addiction to foreign oil ? '' The answer is simple . When we stop electing republicans , we will end our addiction to oil . February 3 , 2011 at 6:28 pm | It should be enough to break our addiction , but that should have been done long ago . If we do n't get oil from the Middle East , Venezuela , and Russia then what . We do n't have plans in place to make that kind of change . We need these resources considering that green energies account for less than 10 % of our power needs -LRB- electric cars still need power plants for electricity -RRB- We have oil , natural gas , coal , plus solar , wind , and hydro power here in the US , but the government strangles our own innovators . We have enough resources and enough American ingenuity right here to solve these problems if the government would allow the people to work . February 3 , 2011 at 6:28 pm | Not yet Jack . Oil companies pour a lot of money in our politics . They will control the message & spin the same as the Heath Care industry did . Not until there is a major attack on Isreal , or something of that magnitude , will the U.S. take turn on energy . I 'm glad Obama is already focusing on green energy now , as opposed to waiting until crude oil being $ 200 a barrel . February 3 , 2011 at 6:28 pm | February 3 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | The Pickens Plan is the way to go . I 've been pushing for this like crazy . we simply need to convert our transportation fuel to natural gas . all vehicles can be easily converted -- many Taxi and Utility company already have -LRB- why ? -RRB- it 's cheap , readily available and cleaner burning than gasoline . the infrastructure is already in place . we as a nation have over a 100 year supply . it will bridge the gap between oil and whatever comes next . if President Obama would simply sign a one sentence executive order stating all new cars purchased by the federal govt run on natural gas , it would instantly create jobs and drop the price of gasoline in half . like giving the nation a raise in wages and eliminate the dependence on foreign oil it 's a win win win deal the problem is this idea is too right and thats why it wo n't get done and it could be done tomorrow February 3 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | Its a bogus question , Jack , There 's no such thing as `` foreign '' oil . Oil is oil , we do n't own a drop of it in the USA . We lease our domestic oil fields to privately owned oil companies like BP for millions in exchange for their ownership of any oil they find . The only oil we own is what we have in our strategic reserves and we buy that on the futures market . There 's not one single Government owned producing oil well in the United States . All the drilling that 's done here is by oil companies and they own all they oil they bring up . The ONLY way to end our dependence on `` foreign '' oil is to end our dependence on all oil . February 3 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | Good topic Jack . This why in Europe everybody prefer a small car . Besides , if politician think for a moment about the country , a gasoline tax could help to balance the budge and save the planet , but do n't count on that . February 3 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | Oil is no longer needed for energy no matter what Royal Dutch Shell , BP or the Saudis might have you believe ... oil is a commodity to be traded like gold , copper or wheat . If you want the answer to your questions ask a representative of Goldman Sacks or Morgan Stanley ... anyway you look at it , the American Consumer gets screwed every time the world does not move our way ... if anyone honestly wanted to protect themselves from `` oil barons , '' they would put their money where their mouth is , like I did in 2005 when gas hit 2 dollars a gallon , I bought a Toyota Prius . -LRB- Insert hybrid car here , if you do not want to permute a brand . -RRB- February 3 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | No it will not break our addiction . We Have powerful domestic oil money preventing legislation which would move the US toward breaking oil dependency . Exxon made too much money to see US government try to curb US consumption . As a result of the legislative power of big US oil companies , we buy vast quantities of foreign oil and subsidize domestic production . If we want to beat the addiction to `` foreign '' oil , stop the corrupt practice in Washington of bribery in the form of campaign contributions . February 3 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | Sadly , the deadly combination of our addiction to oil and the power of the venal and greedy oil executives over the members of congress tells me to answer your question with a clear `` no '' . Let 's not forget who calls the shots in this plutocracy of ours and it is n't President Obama . Definitely , it is not in the best interest of the oil companies to encourage the development of alternative sources of energy . February 3 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | The Chaos in the Middle East will not have an impact on the United States addiction to Middle Eastern oil . Equally impactful crisis like the oil embargo , the Iranian crisis , and subsequent wars with Middle Eastern countries did not dampened our appetite for their oil . I think this hiccup in foreign policy geared towards the Middle East should be approached from an angle that addresses the spread of radicalism and terrorism more as the immediate danger to the United States . If like a cancer , the chaos in this region spreads , then we can talk about America s addiction to foreign oil . February 3 , 2011 at 6:30 pm | Addiction to foreign oil did not cause the price per barrel to rise to over $ 100.00 , speculators did purely for greed . The shipment of oil through the Suez Canal has not been hindered . Speculators are always looking for any chance to put the screws to the people . I 'm sure the new Republican Congress is celebrating their new fortunes from our misery . Why does that not surprise me . February 3 , 2011 at 6:30 pm | Hey Jack , up here in Canada we have in our western provinces a stable supply of oil , given the present rate of consumption that will last for 300 years ! your energy needs can be found a lot closer to home . think of us like Americans without guns , and hey were friendly ! February 3 , 2011 at 6:31 pm | It is disheartening to hear your concern about your gas prices while Egyptians are dying to make ends meet . My question is how come all the oil in the Mideast have not been influential in pressuring the U.S to stop Israel from building settlements in Israel February 3 , 2011 at 6:31 pm | the Middle East conflict should be a wake up call for America to break the addiction to foreign oil . i have already started to take this matter into my own hands and had a 6kw solar panel system installed on the roof of my home . my electric meter spins backwards on sunny days . Its very rewarding to know i help supply energy to the grid . Solar Power , Wind Power , Fuel Cells Energy , Flywheel Technology , come on America lets get going , lets take charge of our energy needs now and for our future . February 3 , 2011 at 6:31 pm | In a perfect world , America and the rest of the world would be able to kick the addiction of crude oil . This is very far from a perfect world . It is not just America that is addicted to oil ; every country is addicted to oil . The problem does not stop there ; however , the big problem in this picture is the corporate greed that comes with the addiction . If America and the rest of the world can not break the addiction to greed , then we wo n't be able to break the addiction to oil . It is corporate greed that is increasing the price of oil , the price of gasoline , and ultimately : the price of all necessities . My answer to your question would be no. . The price of oil will continue to spike , and we will continue to pay for it by shelling money out at the pumps , as well as for basic necessities . We 've seen oil prices rise in excess of $ 147 per barrel . I believe we should be prepared for prices to rise to $ 175 , or even $ 200 per barrel . February 3 , 2011 at 6:31 pm | The chaos in the Middle East will not be enough to end our dependence on foreign oil . Truth be told , we should have ended it 40 years ago . However , our government has done nothing but prop up the regimes which are responsible for much of the unrest . We citizens will be upset for a little while then we 'll cry for an alternative energy source . Obama will make some shallow speech , then it will all go away quietly . Sadly , our attention spans are short and we 'll be sidetracked by something else , like latest Palin rant , or questions about Obama 's bowel movements , or indicting the latest Ponzi schemer . What are we doing with the huge natural gas discoveries within our borders ? We 're selling the gas to someone else . Let the madness continue ! February 3 , 2011 at 6:31 pm | I am from Romania but I leave most of the time in US , just want to tell you that this is just another reason to finally break the US addiction to the foreign oil and stop making these dictators richer . February 3 , 2011 at 6:31 pm | Now is the time to drill for oil here at home . The President needs to lift all drilling restrictions -LRB- instant jobs and economic growth -RRB- and begin a project to drill in Anwar !! Now ! Reopen all closed nuclear plants to power the country ! Renewable energy makes up less than 10 % of the total energy usage in the US now . It is impossible to make this move to green energy anytime soon . Start drilling for Natural Gas and begin to make the shift from oil resources in the Middle East . This would also stop he dirty business of supporting bad regimes . February 3 , 2011 at 6:32 pm | What are you talking about ? America gets of its oils supply from Canada . Do you think Canadian oil goes though Suez Canal before it reaches the U. S ? February 3 , 2011 at 6:32 pm | It ` s not only the oil producing countries . Our own oil companies are involved in the pricing at the pump . Whenever we start to talk seriously about alternative energy sources , they simply reduce the price and , once again , make oil the cheapest option . Let ` s face it , Jack . They ` ve got us over a barrel . February 3 , 2011 at 6:32 pm | The oil lobby owns the republicans , and the oil lobby benefits when the price of oil goes up . The republicans control the house , so no , we wo n't end our addiction to oil -- foreign or otherwise . February 3 , 2011 at 6:32 pm | I hope chaos makes a lot of people switch to electric , hybrid or alternatively fueled cars . I hope it heralds the return of electric or alternatively fueled public transportation and the return of passenger trains . Big Oil has had the USA in a stranglehold for way too long . Using as many alternatives to Big Oil and being as energy self-sufficient as possible should n't be considered `` sissy '' or `` left-wing '' but part of our patriotic duty as Americans . February 3 , 2011 at 6:32 pm | I have visions of oil filled syringe needles being inserted into Uncle Sam 's veins . The oil addiction of this country is too deep of a problem and will not end . It seems as if we ca n't live without it . Unfortunately , unrest in Egypt will not stop the demand . February 3 , 2011 at 6:33 pm | Yes !! But why is everybody talking about electric cars which can only go 40 miles on a charge -LRB- if you do n't want to run the A\\/C , radio or lights -RRB- ? We could grow our fuel in the form of biofuels . The distribution infrastructure is already in place and farmers and oil companies could make a fortune . Brazil has done it and they are off foreign oil -LRB- they use sugar -RRB- . February 3 , 2011 at 6:33 pm | I disagree , it is about the money . It 's about the people and companies who get rich off oil . Can you break their addiction to money ? February 3 , 2011 at 6:33 pm | Come on Jack , safe your breath . This situation has occurred before and the American people went back to wasting gas and forgetting about alternative sources once the situations went away . Nuclear power , clean coal , waste-to-energy plants , natural gas exploration and others have been forgotten by the liberals . What we need is for the liberals to write some more books on the theory of energy independence . February 3 , 2011 at 6:34 pm | It would be great not to send all that money to the Middle East for oil . But it will be that way for some time , even if green technology expands at the rosiest of predictions . However , one way we could almost immediately deflate the cost of oil , and send less money over there , is to allow expanded drilling in the U.S. , including offshore . Just the announcement that we were going to aggressively pursue our own energy sources , including natural gas , would slow or reverse oil price increases and make us less dependent on the Middle East , and Venezuela . February 3 , 2011 at 6:34 pm | Should it ? Yes , of course . No , of course . There is simply no viable alternative to the public anytime soon to allow us to switch from oil . I 'm sure all Americans that do not have a direct vested interest in the oil industry would switch in a nano second if they could . But we ca n't . We have been raped for decades by the greedy , money-sucking OPEC slime bags , along with our own oil industry executives and political puppets who are all beholden to the oil industry . February 3 , 2011 at 6:34 pm | Sorry Jack , have you not yet noticed that the Mid\\/east problem is simply ` racist ' . Egypt , Yemen , Somalia , Algeria , Yemen , Somalia , Niger , etc. - -- are all governed by a ruling elite of Arab descent . . Their ` indineggess ' people are AFRICAN . !!! Sorry ... . . !! The general Arab concept is that the are destined to ` use ' ` black ' people , ... . look at Saudi Arabia , or any Emirate . How many americans remain addicted to illegal drugs and alcohol ? February 3 , 2011 at 6:36 pm | It should definitely be enough to break America 's use of foreign oil and it may even be incentive to create more American jobs to help convert the country to using wind and solar energy as its primary source . It would be cheaper once implemented and we would only depend on the innovation of the American people , and of course mother nature . Depending on other nations for our energy resources and going further into debt , or relying on whether the sun is going to come up or the wind blow . If Obama is really about ` change ' , he might find a way to relieve our debt , and not having to rely on others for oil may give journalists less reason to have to go into such dangerous situations . February 3 , 2011 at 6:36 pm | we need USA and other countries to buy our oil in Iraq and other meddle east country so we could use this income to develop and improve the life of ordinary people , however USA should change their tactics politically rather than economic interest , i hope Egypt stay as an scalier country other ways we all are a loser if Islamic extremist come to power Jack , very high gas prices will break our addiction to oil . Gas prices are slated to be $ 4 a gallon by late spring of this year . We squandered the opportunity to free ourselves from this addiction when the 1970 Oil Enbargo was imposed against the U.S. by OPEC nations -- Arab oil producing states . We should take a page from Brazil , which is independent of petroleum . We have another chance to finally start freeing ourselves of this curse . We are starting to manufacture celluar fusion electric cars and make greater use of solar technology and natural gas . February 3 , 2011 at 6:37 pm | Not as long as Obama is president . He talks out of both sides of his mouth !! Always watch what he does , not what he says . It 's just like jobs , if he was really serious about getting our unemployed back to work , we would not still be importing 75 + k foreign workers a month and we would not have 8 million illegals still working . HE CAN NOT BE TRUSTED EITHER !! February 3 , 2011 at 6:39 pm | I am perplexed by the question . So what if it is enough ?? What 's the alternative ?? The only alternative has and it has always been that Americans have to lessen our need and dependency on foreign oil , or oil in general by pouring money into R&D for alternative energy sources , alternative heating and cooling systems , alternative transportation , and more efficient use of the current systems that we have in place . Drilling in the Artic National Widelife Refuge , or allowing more off-shore oil wells in the gulf ... . Is definitely not the answer . So what is happening in Egypt should not be a wake up call . Our wake up call happend during the Oil Embargo and look how little we achieved . A greater crisis than the Northern African Revolutions will be needed for Americans to change their habits . February 3 , 2011 at 6:39 pm | In the U : S : states of nort and south Dakota we have over 2000 years of untapped oil reserves but environmentalists are keeping us from getting it . When we tap indto this oik the prce is expected to come down to $ 16 per barrel . The U : S : will be the biggest exporter of oil in the world and the Saudis and OOPEC will be oudt of business as will ALL offshore oil drilling . February 3 , 2011 at 6:40 pm | We need alternative transportation choices ! Here in East Tenn. . I bike everywhere & feel like i stick out like a sore thumb because strangers come up to me to say they see me biking everywhere ... guess that is how rare I am . People need to get out of their cars & find other options . February 3 , 2011 at 6:41 pm | There is a pending -LRB- 3years -RRB- patent for a pollution free engine which would solve all the industries problems and the global warming danger by using Hydrogen in this engine . It is designed to supply Residential Individual generation for homes and businesses along with all engine powered devises and will solve all the nations road congestion . All America needs to do is eliminate the oil industry 's control over allowing this patent from being approved . February 3 , 2011 at 6:41 pm | During WWII we retooled our factories and created the military industrial complex . Now , we should retool all the factories that produce fighter planes that we do n't need or use and have them produce wind turbines and solar panels . February 3 , 2011 at 6:42 pm | This is the USA 's opportunity to make Egypt aware that we rather walk than be held hostage for gas . Why should we succumb to their insanity per a dictator . Mass transit people ... . infrastucture would result in JOBS people !!!!! February 3 , 2011 at 6:42 pm | My guess is no. . It 's simple Jack . Unless we are forced to make changes will continue just as we have in the past . Think back to the Carter administration . We had a nice little oil crisis back then . I 'm sure you remember the k-car and other small cars being introduced into the market . Now we 're back to big heavy suburbans and SUVs that get 10 miles per gallon . All the while our politcians are busy campaigning for the 2012 elections and arguing over where to sit . This is the mentality . It 's business as usual just as it always has been . Sadly , when the real oil crisis comes we wo n't be ready . Imagine gas jumping to 20 , 30 , or 40 dollars per gallon . There will be a crisis eventually and we all know this . Imagine life in America with no gasoline or diesel . I know the republicans will not like the idea but we probably need some gov. regulation at this point . A little `` tough love '' would be good for America . We must pay now or pay a lot more later . Jack you once posed a similar question and in doing so referred to the importance of ending the way we use fossil fuel and in doing so compared the monumental importance of this crisis to the Manhattan project and it 's completion . I agreed then as I do now , it 's that important , getting around this crap must begin now and the people making a blood diamond style profit must end they way they turn huge profits . Our country is married to the middle east , and for one reason only , the end of this country 's enslavement to fossil fuel must begin in government . The same gov that just bailed out GM who just introduced a thirty two thousand dollar electric car in the middle of one of the worst economy 's this country has ever seen . It 's tactics like that which keep Americans the thumb of big oil . I would also add that all political figures running for office be made to declare in very bold text who donates to their campaign . Ps that electric car I mentioned should be available for about 17.500 with a three thousand dollar cash back incentive due at signing ... After all it 's you and I who bailed them out . February 3 , 2011 at 6:44 pm | we need USA and other countries to buy our oil in Iraq and other meddle east country so we could use this income to develop and improve the life of ordinary people , however USA should change their tactics politically rather than economic interest , i hope Egypt stay as an scalier country other ways we all are a loser if Islamic extremist come to power The addiction to foreign oil should have been broken years ago . People tend to forget quickly . Remember gas prices just three years ago . Almost forgotten as quickly as 9\\/11 . Bad times for the US are definitly not far off . Why ca n't all American 's see what is coming . Guess it is easier for some to ignor reality . February 3 , 2011 at 6:44 pm | There is nothing at this point that could break our reliance on foreign oil . For gods sake man , we go to war for that oil . This action in egypt has the BP 's and Exxon 's of the world licking their lips . Profits , profits , profits . Ever heard of the `` oil futures market '' . The big oil companies have . You can count on which way their money is currently bet . Oil period , foreign or domestic , is big money . The world is not as it seems . Big business and wall street stand to gain at either end of the spectrum . Unfortunately , the sleeping people are naive to the the policies of the markets and this country . The corporations as well as the government like it this way . No sir , this will not lead to the independence from foreign oil . February 3 , 2011 at 6:46 pm | Wake up Jack . This socalled `` addiction '' to oil you speak of is what FUELS our entire economy . Anyone who can replace an existing oil-based product with one that does n't use any oil , THAT person would be an over-night BILLIONAIRE . If this were so easy Jack , even YOU could become an over-night billionare . February 3 , 2011 at 6:46 pm | The situation in the Middle East makes it clear that the United States needs to double down on Renewable Energy and all Biofuels as the next driver of economic growth and National Security . February 3 , 2011 at 6:46 pm | The addiction to oil is a form of economic control directed to control the people of countries that produce and buy gasoline . The reasons for this are twofold ; 1 -RRB- The infrastructure of most Arab states are not developed enough to export much , except gasoline . 2 -RRB- If the USA wanted to turn Green -- it could do so very quickly since the technology is there .

Egyptian state television on Wednesday went so far as to portray the protesters as members of a radical fringe and bluntly stated : `` Let the military take over and protect you and Egypt . '' `` We have confirmed reports that there are radical elements heading to cause internal strife . They have balls of fire and they want to start fire in the Tahrir -LRB- Liberation -RRB- Square , '' Egyptian television said . Much international media coverage has focused on the violence in Cairo 's Liberation Square between antagonists and protagonists for embattled President Hosni Mubarak . It remained unclear whether such confrontations were being repeated elsewhere . Contesting rallies in Egypt 's second-largest city , Alexandria , were largely peaceful . Other Cairo neighborhoods also remained calm . Violence boils over in Cairo Mubarak ` borrowing from book of Saddam ' ? But Wednesday 's events in Liberation Square highlighted pro-Mubarak demonstrators charging -- dramatically on horseback and camels -- anti-Mubarak protesters , the first sign of a counter-demonstration after days of mass anti-government protests . In stark juxtaposition , as the violence unfolded , the army did nothing . `` The military 's refusal to act is a highly political act which shows that it is allowing the Egyptian regime to reconstitute itself at the top and is highly , utterly against the protesters , '' said Joshua Stacher , assistant professor of political science at Kent State University and an expert on Egypt . He was among more than a dozen Middle East experts who met Monday with three White House National Security Council officials to talk about the Egyptian crisis . The absence of military action serves two purposes , Stacher said . `` Make the protesters go home , and two , scare the population that is n't protesting , '' Stacher said . `` They want the Egyptian people to submit to the police state , and they want the people to pine for their police state , so that they have stability back . '' `` It 's getting really ruthless , '' Stacher added . In Egypt , Vice President Omar Suleiman issued a statement saying that dialogue with opposition forces , as ordered by Mubarak , wo n't begin until the demonstrations stop . Mubarak had incited another round of protests Tuesday when he said he would wait until the September elections to step down . Demonstrators said they wanted an immediate exit by Mubarak . Meanwhile , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has begun a round of discussions with Suleiman as the Egyptian government has begun defending the pace of change and pushing back against American criticism , according to a senior U.S. official . Egypt 's president is going to move at his own pace and not be pressured by Obama and other world leaders , an Egyptian government official told CNN . At the same time , a senior U.S. official is expressing concern about Mubarak 's ties to the violence in Cairo . Cooper among reporters attacked in Egypt Google connects Egyptians to Twitter What 's next for Egypt 's economy ? U.S. officials are suspicious that Mubarak loyalists unleashed pro-Mubarak forces to intimidate protesters , the U.S. official said . `` Perhaps '' Mubarak is making a mess that only he can `` solve , '' the source added . In a public statement , the spokesman for the State Department called for restraint . `` The use of violence to intimidate the Egyptian people must stop . We strongly call for restraint , '' P.J. Crowley said in a statement Wednesday . However , an Egyptian government official said the government has a `` serious problem '' in how the Obama administration has been `` spinning '' the events yesterday to give the impression that Mubarak 's statement was given under pressure or a `` nudge '' from Obama . Robert Kagan of the Brookings Institution said the military appears to be helping the pro-government demonstrators in Cairo . `` It tells me that the military does n't appear to be playing the neutral , benevolent role that we hoped it would , '' Kagan told CNN . `` It does appear to be not only allowing these brutal pro-government thugs to come in and attack the protesters but maybe even facilitating it , which raises very serious questions about what role the military intends to play in this whole period of transition . `` It 's a very cynical move which I hope the rest of the world , and particularly the United States , do n't fall for , '' Kagan said . Michele Dunne , a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , said it was unclear what the military 's agenda is . `` Does this mean they 're committed to Mubarak , or does it mean that perhaps they 're giving him one last chance , one last try to see if he can get control of the streets and get the demonstrators out ? '' `` I think today we saw a very ugly face of this regime . These are tactics that are well-known in Egypt and have been used many times before -- to send regime thugs to break up peaceful demonstrations , '' she said .

NEW : Analyst : Algeria is affected by `` the ripple effect running through '' the region Protesters recently called on the government to lift the state of emergency It has been in place for nearly 20 years State of emergency imposed in 1992 to quell civil war between the government and Islamists . -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika said Thursday he will soon end a two-decades-long state of emergency in that county , according to a news report . Bouteflika said he would lift the ban in the `` very close future . '' The announcement was reported by the Algerian Press Service . Experts say the announcement is a clear attempt by the Algerian leader to head off the kind of social unrest that toppled the autocratic Tunisian government and now threatens the regime of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak . Bouteflika 's announcement comes about two weeks after government opponents marched in the North African nation to demand that the ban be lifted . The demonstrators also called for the release of detainees and the restoration of individual and collective freedoms . Explain it to me : Arab unrest `` I think you have to consider Algeria just as vulnerable to the ripple effect running through Tunisia , Egypt , Jordan or Yemen , '' said Andrew J. Pierre , a Jennings Randolph senior fellow at the United States Institute of Peace . `` You have a high rate of unemployment . You 've got a lot of societal unhappiness , so you have the potential for a social eruption there as well . '' The state of emergency was imposed in 1992 to quell a civil war between the Algerian government and Islamist forces . However , opponents of the Bouteflika regime say the Islamist threat has long since diminished and that the state of emergency now exists only to muzzle any public criticism of the government . Saad Djebbar , a London-based Algerian lawyer and political analyst , said the regime has clearly been affected by the democratic protest movements across the region . `` My take is that the regime may be preparing -LRB- for public protests -RRB- , '' Djebbar said from London . `` They want to produce some sort of trick that would show that reform is under way , like what Mubarak is doing in Egypt , who appears to be using all of the tricks in the book to avoid being removed . '' A 2001 law indefinitely banned all demonstrations in the capital , Algiers , according to the monitoring group Human Rights Watch . The measure said the government could ban any event that is `` likely to disturb public order and tranquility . '' Public protests have swept across North Africa and the Middle East in the last few weeks , prompting major changes in several countries , most notably in Tunisia , where President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali left power after 23 years , and in Egypt , where Mubarak has announced , amid massive unrest , that he will not seek re-election . Protests also have unfolded in Jordan and Yemen . The king of Jordan recently fired his government and named a new prime minister with orders to implement reforms . Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh said after protests Wednesday that he will not seek re-election . `` Why did n't he announce that six weeks ago as opposed to yesterday , '' Pierre said . `` The answer is obvious . '' Pierre said that whether any of these protest movements succeed , `` there is a wholesale change going on . '' `` These regimes are going to be more and more questioned by their populations in this Facebook\\/Twitter age , '' Pierre said . `` We are entering a new era . '' Djebbar is n't so sure existing regimes , if they remain in power , would adapt , nor would they likely loosen their autocratic control . `` If the Mubarak model of reforming dictatorships succeeds , it would be very encouraging to other , what I like to call ' 21st century mafia states ' in the region , '' said Djebbar . `` That model would be emulated in Algeria and elsewhere . It would be goodbye to the democratization process in this part of the world for many years to come . '' However , he added , the opposite is also true if the pro-democracy movement in Egypt succeeds . `` Dictators are like dinosaurs , '' Djebbar said . `` They have no evolutionary process . They go extinct .

Send your video and images to CNN iReport . Atlanta -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On a lively Saturday night in Midtown Atlanta , George Khalil helps the steady flow of customers who rush into his convenience store . But his thoughts are far from the beer and cigarettes that he quickly rings up . Khalil , 35 , says he 's been trying for days to reach his family in Alexandria , Egypt . The phone lines have been down and internet connection has been blocked since mass protests broke out January 25 . Nearly three years ago , Khalil was running a small , family-owned pharmacy with his sister in Kafr el Dawar , a town outside Alexandria , Egypt 's second-largest city . There , he was able to provide the essentials for his family , a rarity for many Egyptians . Nevertheless , he decided to leave in April 2008 because of economic uncertainties . `` I have children , and I wanted to bring them here for a better life , a better future , '' Khalil says . Explain it to me : Arab unrest Mubarak kicked out by ` bunch of kids ' Khalil , his wife and two young children moved to Atlanta , where Khalil works full time at the Sam 's Mart gas station . Although he was able to survive , he says Egypt 's economic state is so sensitive , that any minor change has a great impact on the people there . Khalil says he is worried about the threat of violence to his mother , father and his two sisters , who still live in Alexandria . After days of trying , he finally talked to family members on the phone Tuesday , a week after the unrest began . They said they were safe but there has been a lot of activity near their home . Anti-government protesters gathered Thursday in Alexandria to resume their demonstrations after a period of calm . `` I am very , very sad , and worried , '' Khalil says . Khalil has returned to Egypt twice since moving to the United States but worries that he wo n't be able to go back anytime soon . `` I think it will take a long time to get better . A long time , '' he says . `` It will keep going until the president gives an answer to the problems . '' Violence boils over in Cairo ' A cloud of rocks in the sky ' CNN 's Cooper recounts attack in Cairo Protesters fill streets in Yemen There 's a heavy sense of uncertainty in Khalil 's voice when he 's asked about the outcome of the uprising and the future of Egypt . `` I hope all the fighting will settle down , '' he says . `` I think -LRB- Egyptian President -RRB- Hosni Mubarak -- the people need him to go . '' But he warns an abrupt shift in power could cause further devastation . `` I think he -LRB- Mubarak -RRB- needs to stay for now , because if he leaves , all the groups beneath him will be fighting to get to the top , '' Khalil says . `` It will be chaos . '' The recent turmoil in Egypt , the Arab world 's most populous nation with more than 80 million people , has raised concerns about the regional implications of its political instability . It follows similar anti-government protests in Tunisia , which led to the end of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 's 23-year rule there . Demonstrators also have called for change in Algeria , Jordan , Sudan and Yemen . Much of the reason for the protests in Egypt and the rest of the region is increased food prices and skyrocketing unemployment as well as underemployment . In Egypt , 20 % to 30 % of the population lives in poverty , according to U.N. data . The country also suffers from a chronic housing shortage , forcing many Egyptians to find shelter wherever they can . And for those lucky enough to find ways of generating income , life is all work , according to Khalil . `` The people there , they have no jobs , no food , no blankets to stay warm , '' he said . `` They have nowhere to use the bathroom . Some people are living underground . They need help . '' As Khalil rounds out the end of his shift , an elderly man , who seems to be a regular , comes in and buys a pack of cigarettes . On his way out , he turns to Khalil and casually asks , `` Mubarak . Do you think he 'll stay or go ? '' Khalil pauses and answers with assurance , `` He will go .

That means Reddit , once largely seen as a geekier also-ran to Digg , has now handily surpassed its better-funded rival in traffic . Reddit was started in 2005 by Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman as part of the inaugural class of Y-Combinator . Conde Nast purchased the site in October 2006 , putting Reddit under the same corporate master as Wired.com . Reddit , with a staff of about 10 now , has seen an extraordinary rise in traffic -- quadrupling page views since January 2010 . Reddit got a traffic spike of about 30 % in traffic in August\\/September , due to an influx of Digg users responding to the the spectacular failure of Digg 's redesign , according to Reddit engineer Jeremy Edberg . But much of the growth must be attributed to Reddit 's ability to retain a sense of belonging to a club , even as the site grows and grows . While the front page is still the most popular part of the site , Reddit also has a wide collection of `` sub-reddits '' dedicated to particular topics and communities , including the not-to-be missed IAMA . That stands for I Am A , and is a section of the site where people who are something -- from a Comcast technician to an Egyptian arrested in the anti-government protest -- offer to answer questions from curious users . Reddit announced the milestone to its loyal and demanding userbase on Wednesday in a blog post by engineer Mike Schiraldi : `` There are only about 100 sites on the entire Internet that get a billion pageviews in a single month , and now Reddit can put on its smoking jacket and join that exclusive club . `` The New York Times is n't on the membership list , nor is Expedia , Weather.com , about.com , or Fox News . In your face , meteorologists ! `` This is an accomplishment that all Redditors should take pride in , because people would n't keep arriving in droves -- and coming back -- if not for the community that you 've created here . '' As a side note , I first wrote about Reddit when they were just finished with Y-Combinator 's summer mentorships , and Ohanian was very excited to tell me the site had more than 600 users . It 's safe to say the site now has plenty more than that , even as Ohanian and Huffman , along with the site 's first employee Chris Slowe are now huddled together working on Hipmunk , a airline ticket search site . Reddit remains in capable hands , and the numerically-limited staff has done amazing work with limited resources scaling the site , even when this reporter , who sits about 15 yards away from their office , shoots foam-tipped darts at their glass door for fun .

The biggest demonstration took place in al Hamza , a relatively poor town in a heavily Shiite region about 200 kilometers -LRB- 125 miles -RRB- south of Baghdad . Two Iraqi interior ministry officials -- who , per policy , did not speak by name due to security concerns -- estimated that that nearly 1,000 people participated . The protesters walked toward a local council building , trying to force their way in as they hurled rocks inside the compound and at police outside , the Iraqi Interior Ministry officials said . Some were heard shouting , `` We 've had enough '' and `` Where are your promises . '' Iraqi police opened fire , ostensibly to disperse the crowd , and wounded three protesters in the process , the officials said . Four others were hurt while skirmishing with police outside the council building . Eventually , tribal and civic leaders intervened to end the demonstration , the officials said . Some of the protesters carried items such as water tubes and oil lanterns to demonstrate a lack of basic services like water and reliable power . Abu Sajad , a protester , said that sewage had flooded the small town 's streets after heavy rain in recent days , and he complained that `` the government has n't done anything to solve it '' even though it happens every year . `` We 've suffered a lot from bad services in the town , '' Fadhil Hussein , a 50-year-old protester , told CNN . `` One government comes and another leaves , and nothing has changed in this town for decades . '' Dozens of protesters in Kut , part of another predominantly Shiite province about 110 kilometers south of Baghdad , Thursday demanded the resignation of Wasit 's provincial governor , Latif Hamed , according to a Wasit police official and an Iraqi Interior Ministry official . These were the latest in a string of demonstrations around Iraq , mostly emphasizing the same themes -- low-quality public services and a dearth of basic commodities . That was the case Monday , when dozens of protesters took to the street in northern Baghdad 's al-Husseinya district .

Today marks the beginning of year 4709 on the Chinese calendar , the Year of the Rabbit . Celebrations were taking place across Asia . The investigating officer in the case of the accused Fort Hood shooter has recommended that the military pursue the death penalty against Maj. Nidal Hasan , according to his lawyer . Col. James Pohl , who acted as a judging during the just completed Article 32 hearing , also recommended a general court martial for Hasan , who faces 13 counts of pre-meditated murder and 32 counts of attempted pre-meditated murder in the shootings at Fort Hood on November 5 , 2009 .

She insists all parties - both inside and outside of the country - must continue working together . Maj. Nidal Hasan is charged with killing 13 people in a rampage last year . -LRB- Updated at 11:18 a.m. -RRB- The prosecution has completed presenting its case against alleged Fort Hood shooter and Army psychiatrist Maj. Nidal Hasan . The investigating officer has recessed the proceedings until November 15th , at which time the defense will have an opportunity to present its case . -LRB- Updated at 10:18 a.m. -RRB- The prosecution said it plans to wrap up its case against alleged Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hasan on Thursday , and Hasan 's legal team will present its defense in more than two weeks . The prosecution has called more than 50 witnesses who have delivered chilling testimony about the shooting rampage that left 13 dead at a Texas military base . Hasan is the subject of an Article 32 hearing , which will determine if there is ample evidence to proceed with a court martial . The former Army psychiatrist is charged with killing 13 people and wounding dozens more in a November rampage . An Army officer said he thought the rapid rate of gunfire meant there was more than one shooter in last November 's Fort Hood massacre . But when the shooting ceased after police brought down Nidal Hasan , it became clear he had acted alone , Major Stephen Richter said . Army investigators said Wednesday that Major Nidal Hasan had 177 rounds left when he was finally shot down by police last November . Hasan is charged with killing 13 people and wounding dozens of others after a rampage last November at Fort Hood . A police officer , Major Mark Todd , told the military hearing on Wednesday that he found extra magazines and a second handgun , a revolver , after Hasan finally was subdued , wounded four times . Todd and his fellow civilian police officer , Sgt. Kim Munley described the gunfight outside the building where the final stand-off occured . `` I challenged him , ` Halt , military police , drop your weapon , ' '' Todd said during his testimony Wednesday morning . `` He raised his weapon and fired . '' Munley , who was widely praised for her role in ending the shooting admitted in testimony that she did not know how many times she had hit Hasan . Even before the Fort Hood shooting ended , nurses and medics rushed to help the wounded . `` Nurses and medics get the -LRB- expletive -RRB- out here now - we have soldiers bleeding , '' Sgt. First Class Maria Guerra recalled herself yelling . `` You train for this , you train for this , let 's go , '' she said as civilians and soliders came out of hiding to save their fallen buddies . A witness in the case against Maj. Nidal Hasan recalled Tuesday the sound that the accused Fort Hood shooter made as he walked down the halls of the processing center where he 'd opened fire that November day . Shell casings were wedged in the tread of Hasan 's combat boots , making a distinctive `` clack , clack '' as he walked , said Ted Coukoulis , a civilian nurse , on the sixth day of the alleged shooter 's military hearing . Coukoulis testified in the Article 32 evidentiary hearing that will determine whether the case will proceed to a court martial and the possible death penalty for Hasan . `` It was a casual walk , '' Coukoulis said , comparing it to how someone would walk through a mall . `` He stopped firing and started walking toward where I was - clack , clack , clack . '' A survivor of last year 's Fort Hood , Texas , shootings testified Monday that the gunman showed no emotion as he killed 13 people and injured dozens more . `` He was n't happy , he was n't angry , '' Sgt. 1st Class Miguel Valdivia said of the accused shooter , Maj. Nidal Hasan . `` It was some kind of passive look . '' Valdivia 's testimony came on the fifth day of an Article 32 hearing at the base to determine whether there is enough evidence for Nasan to proceed to a court-martial in the November 2009 shooting spree on the military base . The distant rumble of big guns on Fort Hood 's artillery range rattles the ceiling tiles in the small military courtroom . But the sounds of war training do n't interrupt the intensity inside the military hearing as dozens of witnesses here recall that day last November when 13 people were shot to death and 32 wounded on the base in central Texas . Training with Paladin howitzers is part of everyday life at Fort Hood , the country 's largest Army base . Most of the shooting victims were preparing to ship out to the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan . But nothing prepared them for what happened to them at home - dodging bullets as a gunman cut down their buddies . -LRB- Updated at 5:19 p.m. -RRB- In response to a question about the telephone video , a Fort Hood official , who insisted on anonymity because of the ongoing criminal investigation related to the shooting , said : `` Since this matter was raised during the Article 32 hearing , it is for the Article 32 hearing officer to decide whether to make further inquiries to the soldier 's chain of command for additional information . '' -LRB- Original post -RRB- The shooting at Fort Hood was captured on video by a soldier using his cell phone camera as he hid from the shooter , but he was ordered to erase it , the soldier said Friday . Pfc. Lance Aviles spoke of the video as he testified on the third day of the Article 32 military hearing for Maj. Nidal Hasan , who is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32 in the 2009 shooting . Aviles said he was ordered by a noncommissioned officer to delete the video on the day of the shooting . He did not describe to the court what the video contained . He said he saw the gunman stop to reload and considered rushing him . But by the time Aviles got up , he said , the shooter `` had already loaded another magazine . So instead of running to him , I ran off to the right . '' The Army psychiatrist accused in last year 's Fort Hood , Texas , shootings faced off with the most severely injured survivor Thursday in a small military courtroom . Maj. Nidal Hasan looked down as Staff Sgt. Patrick Zeigler described his four bullet wounds and how part of his brain had to be removed because of skull and bullet fragments . Zeigler , using a cane , walked slowly to the witness stand at Fort Hood for the last testimony of the day in an evidentiary hearing , which is expected to last for weeks . Hasan is accused of being the gunman in the November 5 shootings that left 13 people dead and dozens wounded . Zeigler testified he heard the gunman shout out `` Allahu Akbar '' just before the firing began . `` After I heard that , I pretty much froze up because I knew what that meant , '' said Zeigler about the phrase , which is Arabic for `` God is great . '' The shooting happened so fast that is sounded like an automatic weapon , one soldier testified . Some said they did n't realize they were wounded until they saw their own blood . And others told how they tried to play dead , hoping the gunman would pass them by . The testimony came Thursday at Fort Hood , Texas , during the military 's evidentiary hearing into the case of Maj. Nidal Hasan , who is accused of the Fort Hood shootings last November that left 13 people dead and dozens wounded . Spc. Keara Bono testified she was reading a book in the Fort Hood building , moving through the paperwork and medical tests to deploy to Iraq . Suddenly , she said , she was wounded in the head . `` At that moment , all I smelled was blood because my face was covered with it , '' she testified Thursday afternoon . Pfc George Stratton said he was at the processing center that November day getting ready to deploy to Afghanistan . It was to be his third deployment . `` All of a sudden my ears started ringing , and I heard loud gunfire right in my ears . Round after round -- pop ! just like that , '' he testified . Stratton says he dropped to the ground , and saw a fellow soldier lying on the ground near him , covered in blood . `` As soon as I turned I saw Maj. Hasan behind me . He was holding an older-fashioned pistol . As soon as I looked at him , he brought his magazine up and loaded it . He looked straight down at me , we made eye contact , and he brought his weapon down toward me . I turned on him , and the weapon fired . It hit me in the left shoulder , my arm went limp , '' Stratton said . `` I could n't feel it at all . '' Stratton says he then hit the ground , and crawled as fast as he could to the door . Testifying Wednesday afternoon , Spc. Amber Barr described how she and her buddies ran for their lives when the shooting began . `` I saw there was blood . I smelled sulfur in the air and I realized it was not a drill , '' she said . `` It was absolute chaos , '' she continued . `` People just trying to shield themselves from the gunshots . '' Barr said she and others managed to get outside and she helped half-carry , half-drag a friend to a nearby pick-up truck which took them and others to the Fort Hood hospital . It was only then , when she tried to sit down , she realized she herself had been shot in the lower back , she said . Spc. Matthew Cooke told the hearing he was shot four times but was so charged up on adrenaline he did n't realize he had been wounded . He still carries bullet fragments in his body . The military is holding an evidentiary hearing into the case of Maj. Nidal Hasan , who is accused of the Fort Hood shootings last November that left 13 people dead and dozens wounded . The first witness in the Fort Hood massacre hearing gave a chilling account Wednesday of how he and others were shot last November . Sgt. Alonzo Lunsford , speaking on the second day of the Article 32 hearing , said Army psychiatrist Maj. Nidal Hasan pulled a weapon from underneath his uniform and began firing . Hasan is charged with the murder of 13 people at Fort Hood on November 5 and the wounding of 32 others . `` I noticed the weapon he was firing had an infrared sight , like a laser sight on the weapon , '' Lunsford said . `` He was aiming at the soldiers . '' The military opened a hearing Tuesday for Maj. Nidal Hasan , the U.S. Army psychiatrist accused of last year 's Fort Hood shootings , then adjourned it almost immediately . Hasan is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32 in a shooting spree at the Fort Hood Army base in Texas . The hearing will determine whether Hasan will be court-martialed - which could potentially lead to the death penalty .

Mohamed Aziz is general manager of Siwa Safari Paradise Hotel & Tourist Village , whose name conjures a different world from the tumult in the the boiling-mad crowd in Cairo 's Tahrir Square . He said the atmosphere in the town of Siwa is normal and safe , and `` nothing is happening '' on the streets there . But he said there 's a sense of `` anxiety '' over daily life and the prospects for the future among citizens in the town . Observers trying to get a handle on Egyptian public opinion say that kind of unease appears to reflect the dissatisfaction with the economic quality of life and the political uncertainty in Egypt , home to more than 80 million people . It 's a mood that appears to pervade the villages , towns and cities where not everyone is taking to the streets and where protests are n't confrontational . Shadi Hamid , director of research for the Brookings Institution 's Doha Center , said that while public opinion is `` notoriously difficult to gauge '' in Egypt , he says the `` undercurrent of anger and frustration is n't limited to a minority . '' `` I think the protesters capture a real building sentiment that has grown and grown over the last decade . They are expressing a widespread public outrage at the current state of affairs , '' he said . `` There 's an overwhelming sense that things have gone wrong . '' Hamid said Egypt has had some of its best growth in recent years , but that growth has served to generate `` popular discontent . '' He said people have been upset that economic dividends have not been evenly distributed and `` the middle class feels it wants and deserves more . '' He said the people who are driving the uprising are n't poorer people from rural areas , where people tend to be a bit more fatalistic and latently supportive of the status quo . They are middle-class and urban people with high expectations who believe they should be employed , but are n't . Some pro-Mubarak demonstrators were also in Tahrir Square on Tuesday morning and some residents said they were opposed to the protests . `` I am upset with the revolution in Tahrir Square , '' said Muna al-Mahdi , her voice trembling as she spoke in her middle-class Cairo neighborhood . `` It does n't represent us . It does n't represent our opinion . We are here sticking with Hosni Mubarak only . Give him two months , give him time to work . And then he can go peacefully .

Here 's a summary of what has happened elsewhere : President Abdelaziz Bouteflika will lift a nearly 20-year-old state of emergency in the `` very close future , '' the state news agency announced Thursday . The move is one of several demanded by demonstrators in recent protests against the government , which imposed the emergency decree in a crackdown against Islamic political parties in 1992 . The clampdown triggered an Islamist insurgency that left more than 100,000 dead , according to human rights groups . Those taking to the streets in recent demonstrations have also called for the release of prisoners and the restoration of individual and collective freedoms . Saad Djebbar , an international lawyer and Algeria analyst based in London , said the Algerian leadership has clearly been affected by the regionwide protests -- but warned that authorities may `` produce some sort of trick '' to convince its population that reforms are under way . Following several weeks of protests over political and economic grievances , King Abdullah II sacked his government , named a new prime minister and met privately with leaders of the nation 's main Islamist group Thursday , the first such talks on record . The Islamic Action Front , the political wing of Jordan 's Muslim Brotherhood , says it plans another round of demonstrations Friday . Secretary-General Hamza Mansour told CNN Thursday that changing prime ministers was not the solution Jordanians needed . Though protesters have stopped short of directly criticizing the king , Abdullah has acknowledged the reform process `` has suffered from many shortcomings '' and young Jordanians were frustrated by lack of opportunity . He has instructed his new government to re-examine the election law and urgently tackle corruption -- but his appointment of former intelligence chief Marouf Al Bakhit as his new premier was also seen as an attempt to shore up support among Jordan 's tribes , the bedrock of loyalty to the monarchy .

'' `` We want -LRB- Mubarak -RRB- to leave , '' said one 19-year-old man hours after the intense day of protests . Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is not gone , but his days are numbered . The leader agreed Tuesday to not seek re-election in September . He told ABC News Thursday he would like to step down right away , but can not because he does not want to risk plunging his nation into chaos . In the bloody blur of days since his announcement that he would not stand for re-election , regime foes and opponents have clashed repeatedly in Cairo 's Tahrir Square , the center of anti-government demonstrations . Eight people have been killed and nearly 850 injured , according to the health ministry . Although his government has made concessions , Mubarak faces another challenge Friday , which opponents have dubbed `` Day of Farewell '' and `` Day of Departure '' -- references to further large protests they hope will prompt the president to step down now . Thursday saw an escalation of attacks on journalists , many of whom asked whether the government was clearing them out of the way so as to cloak its actions . Journalists said it was too dangerous to be at Tahrir Square or to provide live camera feeds . Vice President Omar Suleiman laid some of the unrest 's blame on the media . `` I actually blame certain friendly nations who have television channels , they are not friendly at all , who have intensified the youth against the nation and the state , '' Suleiman told Nile TV . `` They have filled in the minds of the youth with wrongdoings , with allegations , and this is unacceptable . '' State-run Nile TV said a segment of anti-government protesters , called the 25th of January Youth , will leave the square and form a political party to compete in upcoming elections . Meanwhile , CNN 's Anderson Cooper said on `` Parker Spitzer '' Thursday night that , if anything , the Mubarak foes increased the portion of Tahrir Square they occupy in the standoff . It 's not clear if organizers of the protests planned after Friday prayers would be able to rally the numbers they had last week or reach the presidential palace , Cooper said . Tension was building before dawn Friday , he said . Mubarak told ABC News correspondent Christiane Amanpour that he was troubled by the bloody clashes that broke out Wednesday in Tahrir Square .

A photojournalist for CNN-IBN , CNN 's sister network in India , Rajesh Bhardwaj , was detained in Cairo 's Tahrir Square , the site of bloody clashes between supporters and opponents of President Hosni Mubarak . He was taken away by the Egyptian Army and later released , but only after his identification card and tapes were destroyed , said Suhasini Haidar , CNN-IBN deputy foreign editor . Other journalists reported being beaten and harassed by protesters , while some spoke of close calls . `` The threats to journalists on the street were explicit , and increasing . We pulled back accordingly to protect our people , '' said CNN Executive Vice President Tony Maddox . CNN 's Anderson Cooper tweeted Thursday : `` Situation on ground in Egypt very tense . Vehicle I was in attacked . The Greek daily newspaper Kathimerini said one of its reporters , Petros Papaconstantinou , was beaten by protesters in Cairo 's Tahrir Square . Papaconstantinou was clubbed in the head with a baton and stabbed in the foot , either with a knife or a screwdriver , said Xenia Kounalaki , head of the newspaper 's foreign desk . A photographer also sustained minor injuries , Kounalaki said , and both were treated at a Cairo hospital and released . Marie Colvin of the Sunday Times of London said she was approached by a gang of men with knives in Imbaba , a poor neighborhood of Cairo . Another group of men pushed her into a store and locked it to protect her , she said . `` Get the journalists out of the way so we can beat up those loudmouths in Tahrir Square ! '' she said , as a way to describe the thought process of groups attacking reporters . `` Tomorrow 's going to be hell . '' In addition , several human rights groups reported their representatives had been detained . The Hisham Mubarak Law Center , a human rights law firm , was taken over by military police , as was the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights , Oxfam International said in a statement . A total of eight people were detained , including the directors of both centers , the organization said . Oxfam said several of its staff members were among those detained . Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch each said one of their researchers was detained at the law center . They were interrogated before being taken away to an unknown location in Cairo , Human Rights Watch said . All three groups called for the immediate release of their staffers . U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon condemned the attacks . `` The freedom of speech , whether journalists or demonstrators -- they should be fully guaranteed and protected . That is a ground principle of democracy , '' he said . Meanwhile , Shahira Amin , a reporter for Egypt 's state-run Nile TV , resigned Thursday . `` I spent the day at Nile TV yesterday , '' she told CNN . `` I was only allowed to air the pro-Mubarak rallies that were going on , as if nothing was happening at Tahrir Square . We were n't allowed to reveal any figures . There was a near total blackout , '' she said , calling it `` hypocritical ... I just do n't want to be part of it . '' She said she should have resigned `` ages ago . ... I was happy to spend the day in Tahrir Square where the people are . ... I am on their side . '' `` People are too scared to tell the truth , '' she said . `` There is a built-in or inherent feeling that many Egyptian journalists have because of -LRB- the threat of -RRB- detention and arrest . '' She added , `` I have n't been intimidated all these years . I have been telling the truth . I managed to get away with it until now . This time around , I just could n't tell the truth , so I just walked out . '' Jeffrey Schneider , senior vice president for ABC News , said the network is continuing to assess the security situation in Egypt . `` Obviously today was an even more terrifying day ... Nothing is more important than the safety of our troops in the field , '' he said , adding `` we continue to cover this important story . '' CBS News spokesman Jeff Ballabon declined to comment on the specifics of the situation . `` For security reasons , we will not be disclosing our security plans or our personnel 's activities , movements or locations , '' he said . Journalists were also targeted on Wednesday , with some beaten , bloodied , harassed and detained by men , most of them apparently aligned in some way with Mubarak . In several cases , news personnel were accused of being `` foreign spies , '' seized , whisked away and often assaulted . CNN 's Hala Gorani got caught Wednesday morning in a stampede of demonstrators , some of whom were riding on camels and horses . `` I got slammed against the gates and was threatened by one of the pro-Mubarak protesters who was ... telling me to ` get out , get out ! ' '' `` The pro-Mubaraks , whoever they are , whoever sent them , are being threatening toward camera crews , journalists , anybody who looks like they may be onlookers . '' `` It was pandemonium . There was no control . Suddenly a man would come up to you and punch you in the face , '' said CNN 's Cooper , describing being attacked by pro-Mubarak demonstrators along with two colleagues outside of Tahrir Square . A BBC correspondent , Rupert Wingfield-Hayes , and his crew were `` arrested by members of the secret police '' on Wednesday after interviewing a presidential adviser , the BBC reported . They were later released , the network said . The Dubai-based Al-Arabiya news network was among the worst hit , with its office damaged and several of its staff targeted . Among them was correspondent Ahmed Abdullah , who his editor confirmed Wednesday was found bloodied after being severely beaten by his captors . He was transported to a hospital , Maurice Sarfatti told the Brussels-based Le Soir newspaper , which he writes for along with publications in Switzerland and France , that he `` received a stream of blows to the face '' from men claiming he backed leading opposition figure Mohamed ElBaradei . `` I am being guarded by two soldiers with Kalashnikovs -LRB- rifles -RRB- and bayonets , '' said Sarfatti , according to a translation from Le Soir . `` They say I will be taken before the intelligence services . They say I am a spy . '' The Committee to Protect Journalists claimed that such accounts were all too commonplace around Cairo . In a news release , the group detailed about two dozen incidents , accusing men -- most of them described as pro-Mubarak demonstrators , `` plainclothes police , '' uniformed officers and military -- of perpetrating attacks on reporters seen with cameras and notepads . The group laid the blame for this violence squarely on Mubarak 's administration , accusing it of scheming to suppress and stifle news coverage . `` The Egyptian strategy is employing a strategy of eliminating witnesses to their actions , '' said Mohamed Abdel Dayem , the committee 's Middle East and North Africa program coordinator . `` The government has resorted to blanket censorship , intimidation and , today , a series of deliberate attacks on journalists carried out by pro-government mobs .

In fact , the anti-government protesters have only become more emboldened since Mubarak 's announcement that he 'll step down from the presidency - but not until September . But they want him gone now . They think 30 years is long enough . However , that does n't seem to matter much to Mubarak . He told ABC 's Christiane Amanpour that he 's sick of being president and would like to leave office now . But he says he ca n't for fear of the country slipping into chaos . That 's as opposed to what we 're seeing in the streets of Cairo right now . As for the people shouting insults at him , Mubarak says , `` I do n't care what people say about me . Right now I care about my country , I care about Egypt . '' Earlier this week , President Obama seemed to suggest Mubarak step down sooner rather than later , saying an orderly transition to a new regime `` must begin now . '' U.S. officials say the protest movement is n't going away - it 's only getting bigger . They worry that the longer the crisis goes on without a resolution , the worse the economic impact and violence will become . Already there are food and fuel shortages and bank closures . Other world leaders have also called on Mubarak to step aside , including Turkey 's prime minister , who says Mubarak should `` satisfy the people 's desire for change '' without hesitation . Others are suggesting an interim `` caretaker government '' that could oversee the upcoming elections . Here s my question to you : Should Mubarak be forced out now rather than waiting until his term expires in September ? Interested to know which ones made it on air ? The Middle East is starting to look like one big game of dominoes . As the kings , unelected presidents and emirs watch what 's going on in the streets of Cairo , they 've got to be wondering if they 're going to be next . Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's days are clearly numbered . At this point , it seems highly unlikely he 'll even make it through the rest of his term . Mubarak would be following Tunisian President Zine El Abedine Ben Ali out the door after similar popular street movements pushed him out of power . No doubt about it , some sort of genie is out of the bottle . Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh says he wo n't seek re-election when his term ends in 2013 . That 's after more than three decades in office . He also says he wo n't hand power over to his son . Of course , he made that announcement ahead of a `` day of rage '' protest scheduled for Thursday . Thousands of people have already been demonstrating in Yemen in recent weeks . Over in Jordan , King Abdullah has sacked his government and appointed a new prime minister in the face of protests . The king is asking the new government to implement what he calls `` genuine political reform . '' It s funny how `` reform '' has suddenly become a priority in some of these countries after decades of repressive governments . Meanwhile , demonstrators also are calling for change in Algeria and Sudan . And in Syria , there are protests planned for this week . Experts say these protests sweeping across the Middle East and North Africa are `` unprecedented '' and a `` watershed event for the Arab world . '' For now , the leadership in Saudi Arabia and Libya seems secure , but it 's safe to say a new day is dawning . Here s my question to you : What 's next for the Middle East ? Interested to know which ones made it on air ? Somebody suggested , `` The devil you know is better than the devil you do n't know . '' When it comes to Egypt , Hosni Mubarak is the devil we know . Ruling for the last three decades , Mubarak has maintained Egypt as a moderate regional force in the face of extreme Islamist nations . He 's also helped keep peace with Israel . Now Mubarak says he 's not running for re-election and it 's unclear how much longer he will cling to power . Which brings us to who 's the devil we do n't know ? History suggests we might want to watch what we wish for : Remember when the Bush administration pushed for democratic elections in Gaza and Hamas won ? Or go back a little further : When the Shah of Iran was toppled 30 years ago , the ayatollahs took over and Iran became an Islamic republic . The Iranian Revolution was originally backed by many groups - much like the one in Egypt - but the extremists took control of the movement - and look where we are today . Some worry the same thing could happen in Egypt . They fear the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood . Even though the extremely conservative Islamic organization is banned from Egypt , it 's still the largest opposition group . But not everyone agrees . Egyptian opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei rejects the idea that Islamic fundamentalists will take over . The secular ElBaradei says he 's reaching out to the Muslim Brotherhood and that they need to be included in any new government . Here s my question to you : What are the risks if Mubarak is removed from power in Egypt ? As Egyptian protesters demanding reform fill the streets by the hundreds of thousands , it 's worth remembering that the U.S. helps control the purse strings in that country . American taxpayers give $ 1.5 billion dollars a year in foreign aid to Egypt , second only to Israel . Although the White House has said it 's reviewing this aid depending on the military 's behavior - One top Republican says now is not the time to threaten to withhold any of this money . Congresswoman Kay Granger - who chairs the house subcommittee in charge of foreign aid - says we should n't use the money as a stick to force Mubarak into reforms . Granger says most of the $ 1.5 billion goes toward the military - which seems to be a stabilizing force among the demonstrators . Granger says Congress should only consider withholding aid if there 's evidence that U.S. military equipment is being used improperly . Several top Democrats are on the same page , saying the U.S. should remain committed to assisting Egypt . They point to the close relationship between the two countries . Nonetheless , some experts think cutting financial aid is the best way to get results . A bipartisan group of former officials says the administration should suspend all aid to Egypt until the government : Agrees to elections as soon as possible , allows banned candidates to run , immediately lifts the state of emergency that 's been in place for decades , releases political prisoners , and allows for freedom of the media and assembly . Here s my question to you : Should the U.S. withhold any of its $ 1.5 billion in financial aid to Egypt ? Interested to know which ones made it on air ?

It seemed so easy for Egypt . Just order a shutdown of the country 's internet connections and -- bam -- it happens . But is such an authoritarian action transferable ? Could the U.S. government shut down American internet connections ? And is it possible for the global internet to be toppled ? Technically , yes , internet experts said Wednesday , shortly after Egypt 's government restored internet connections there as violent political protests continued . But it 's highly unlikely . `` Could you break the internet ? Can you shut it down ? Shutting down the entire internet would be pretty much impossible at this point , '' said Jim Cowie , co-founder of Renesys , an worldwide internet tracker . Cowie spoke of the internet as if it were a giant , adaptable worm . `` The funny thing about the internet is even if you break it in half , the two halves will function as -LRB- separate -RRB- internets , '' he said . How Egypt shut down the internet Understanding what happened in Egypt helps frame the discussion about what could happen to the internet in the United States or around the globe . According to internet traffic monitors and experts , Egypt 's government likely called the country 's five main internet service providers -- like on the phone -- late last week and ordered them to barricade online traffic . That 's sort of like calling all of the post offices in the country and telling them to throw the mail away instead of delivering it , said Robert Faris , research director at Harvard 's Berkman Center for Internet & Society . But instead of shredding paper mail , the Egyptian internet providers altered their Border Gateway Protocols , the software that routes online information . `` There 's not an on-off switch , '' Faris said . `` What it is , it 's a list of IP addresses that route information between nodes on the internet . And what they did -LRB- in Egypt -RRB- is they changed all the software and the list in there to something called null routing . So all the traffic going in and out was essentially thrown away . '' Faris called these measures extreme . They have been carried out in only two other instances , he said : In Myanmar during 2007 protests ; and in Nepal in 2005 , when the king seized power . Iran and China filter the internet instead of blocking it , he said . Could the United States do the same ? Technically , the United States could do the same thing Egypt did to block internet access , Faris said .

Top members of the Obama administration stated Thursday their desire for embattled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to leave office and for inclusive negotiations to begin immediately with his political opponents . National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor added that U.S. officials have also discussed with Egyptian officials `` a variety of different ways '' in which that new government could take shape . But Vietor stressed `` all of those decisions must be made by the Egyptian people . '' A senior Obama administration official knocked down a New York Times report that the Egyptians and Americans were near consensus on a specific proposal . `` It 's simply wrong to report that there 's a single U.S. plan that 's being negotiated with the Egyptians , '' the official said . U.S. officials have made clear in recent days their desire to jumpstart talks between opposition and ruling forces in order to lay the groundwork as soon as possible for a governmental transition . That includes pressuring , besides Mubarak 's government , opposition groups to engage immediately in talks . Mubarak has announced he will not seek re-election in September . Protesters , however , continue to demand that he step down immediately , with a caretaker unity government running the country until the fall elections . While some , like former Foreign Minister and Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa , believe concessions made by Mubarak presented an opportunity to build upon , members of the opposition Muslim Brotherhood have insisted no talks should take place until the president leaves office . `` It 's time for both of them to roll up their sleeves , '' a senior State Department official said . `` The government has to take some steps , but the opposition has to be willing to participate in negotiations as well . '' Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman made `` important statements '' about a political dialogue , the senior official said . Still , he added that the Egyptian government should allow the opposition to bring its own ideas , rather than dictate the pace and scope of a transformation to democracy . The urgent call for talks comes as the Egyptian government pushed back on what it described as `` vague '' statements from the Obama administration about the pace of transition .

Friday 's demonstration in Amman was the smallest in weeks Amman , Jordan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Several hundred protesters braved rain and cold temperatures here in the capital to protest against Jordan 's new prime minister Friday . The demonstration , called by the Islamic Action Front , passed off without incident amid a low-profile police presence . The protesters chanted `` Alahu Akhbar '' -LRB- `` God is Great '' -RRB- , demanded political reforms and railed against government corruption . Most of them marched from Friday prayers at Salahuddin Mosque the short distance to the office of Prime Minister Marouf Bakhit , who was appointed by King Abdullah II a few days ago . They then moved on to the Egyptian embassy before dispersing . It was the smallest Friday demonstration in Amman in several weeks . Other groups involved in previous protests decided not to join this week , leaving the Islamists and a small leftist party as the only groups involved . Earlier this week , King Abdullah promised the new government would launch a national dialogue on political reform , tackle corruption and review Jordan 's restrictive election law to involve a wider range of political opinion . The king met with Islamist leaders Thursday , among them the leadership of the Islamic Action Front and Muslim Brotherhood . Afterwards , the Islamists described the meeting as `` clear and frank '' in which they asked for political reform beginning with a new more democratic election law and a government chosen by Parliament rather than the king . The Palace said the king had emphasized inclusive reforms that could overcome `` external forces '' who are resisting change for their own personal interests . The general secretary of the Islamic Action Front , Hamza Mansour , told CNN Thursday that democracy in Jordan was marginalized and warned that when political and economical conditions worsen , social violence surfaces .

BECKY ANDERSON , CONNECT THE WORLD , CNN : United in prayer and in protest . Tens of thousands keep Egypt uprising against their president alive before an 11th day . The Friday of departure has n't quite worked out . President Hosni Mubarak is still in office with an hour to go until midnight . From Cairo 's Tahrir Square to these jubilant demonstrators of Alexandria there is no giving up . ANDERSON : We 're going to go live to Cairo in just in a moment first . We want to show you what a difference a day makes in Egypt uprising after clashes this week killed at least 11 people in Tahrir Square . Many fear the worse for this Friday . The mood was far different . Protestors were festered happy to have held their ground and hopeful the change is just around the corner . ANDERSON : As light broke across Tahrir Square this morning a sense of anticipation filled the air for what many dubbed the day of departure . Government troops in circled the square early after two days of bloody battles between pro and anti-Mubarak protestors . Security check points was set up to search the 10s of 1000s of people before they were allowed in . By 9:00 in the morning the square was getting full . People who stayed overnight shared breakfast with one another . Many brought in their own supplies . Next to them piles of rocks in case fighting broke out . According to our reporters there the mood early on was largely optimistic and peaceful . Egyptians stood side by side singing and dancing . Many chanting for Mubarak to finally leave . At noon , the crowd kneeled for Friday prayers momentarily transferring the square into a place of worship . Many of our CNN correspondents were tweeting photos from the demonstrations . These photos from Fred Pleitgen showed crowds chanting and waving flags . The demos were largely festive for most of the day . But by 6:00 p.m. local time there were reports of running battles between pro and anti- Mubarak protestors . Gun fire could be heard in the air on the outskirts of Tahrir Square but it last for only a few minutes . As night fell , 10s of 1000s still remain determined to see through their demands to the end . ANDERSON : Well before we go live to Cairo a lot -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- this hour reports the US wants Mubarak out immediately . We 're going to go to Washington for more on that and ask an expert why he thinks that might be a bad idea . The role of the Muslim Brotherhood remains crucial . Ayan Hirsi Ali will tell us how she was once a part of that group and what they 'll mean to Egypt 's future . And later the bigger picture , were going to explore what people in the region have been asking for and what they are really getting . This is the 11th day of protest in Egypt drew to a close demonstrators got a new promise the government . Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik says force will not be used to clear Tahrir Square . Well let 's get the latest on these situations on the ground . Arwa Damon joins us from the Cairo . ARWA DAMON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Hi Becky . Well part of the reason that we did see that relatively speaking a sense of calm over Tahrir Square despite the clashes that happen on some of the side streets is because throughout the day he Egyptian military did maintain a much heavier presence that anything that we had seen in the past . They were blocking off some of the major routes leading to the square . And we did see the pro-Mubarak group keeping their distance . But that at around 10:00 pm local time around an hour ago we also saw the military with a drop on some of those positions handful of pro-Mubarak groups moving in taking up their usual positions on one of the over passes leading to the square . And despite that their presence was absence in Tahrir Square it felt for the most part it most certainly was felt once a person ventured past the square as we did today . We came across small gatherings of pro-Mubarak demonstrators . We squirted past them for the simple reason that it was by in large the pro- Mubarak groups that were those who were attacking the media . And at this point , it does really appear that attempt to truly diffuse this crisis have fallen flat . The opposition groups denied be by President for political to meet with him over the last few days . There is talk of a group of wise man as its being dubbed up trying to form some sort of an agreement between the opposition and between the governments . And although speaking relatively of course from the last few nights there is this sense of calm . There is always that overriding concern that violence could erupt at any moment . When we have an interrupt it has happen immediately , suddenly and very surprisingly Becky . ANDERSON : All right . Arwa Damon on the ground there in Cairo . Let 's bring in anti-government demonstrator . He 's become a regular contributor to our show over the past week or so . Gigi Ibrahim has been protesting in Tahrir Square right from the start and she joins us now on the line from Cairo . How are things at this point ? We just heard from Arwa . What 's the mood in an hour to go until midnight ? GIGI IBRAHIM , PROTESTOR : The mood is really different today considering the violence that we had in the past two days . Really a lot of people turn out today to for the Friday prayer and it was such an amazing , beautiful , emotional scene . People were praying and crying for those who died since really the revolution has started and there 's a lot of self-organization . You can witness coming into Tahrir you were searched maybe by 10 times by just the volunteers and average citizens who are taking up this role on themselves to make sure that there are not violent intruders within in the Tahrir Square . ANDERSON : Gigi you think part of what is being quite a remarkable people 's revolution as it were . At this point on the 11th day what sort of progress do you feel that you made ? IBRAHIM : Excuse me , I did n't hear you . ANDERSON : What sort of progress do you think you 've made given that Mubarak is still in Egypt ? IBRAHIM : I think the progress is really Egypt had you know gained its self-confidence again . The people , the people have this sense of pride and honor of being Egyptian and that is reflecting in every part in Egypt . You look at the neighborhoods being protected by its own citizens . And in some sense we taken control back of our country and that 's putting a lot of pressure on Mubarak and making those people demand in Tahrir Square even more powerful . And the world is completely watching and supporting - and completely supporting the Egyptian people . From all the messages have been receiving over you know the course of this whole thing and it 's truly , truly remarkable . ANDERSON : And yet the demands from protestors , well there 's simply one demand is n't there , that Mubarak go . He is still there . IBRAHIM : What happens is that really the people over in Tahrir Square will not leave . The determination is persistent and of staying there until Mubarak officially steps down . Everybody is you know knows that his time is over . Like he 's obviously not going to continue to be in power but the more people stay in Tahrir Square and the more violence and the more people that die because of the whole revolution it makes the people more and more determine to fight for freedom and justice and human dignity really by demanding and being more persistent for Mubarak to step down now and not in September . ANDERSON : The pictures and crowds have been quite remarkable but if he were n't to go - I mean are you confident that he will go ? And if he does n't go will you continue to protest ? How long can you keep this up ? IBRAHIM : I think , I think the people from my own perspective from just how I 've been there every day . Every day I see I see it go up a level and the determination and the wiliness of the people to stay there as long as it takes for Mubarak to officially step down . I do n't think it will end peacefully at least . If Mubarak does n't step down anytime soon these people can be there for weeks and days . And if the government you know will basically force the people to go out of Tahrir Square then it 's going to be obviously a massacre because these people are not going to give up easily . Alright Gigi you 've joined us through the week and one hopes you 'll continue to be with us as we move through the days to come . Gigi Ibrahim there from Tahrir Square . We 're staying with this story throughout the hour . Later from Tunisia to Yemen , Sudan and more the feedback loop from the regions protest and where that 's headed . Also Ayan Hirsi Ali joins me to talk about the Muslim Brotherhood . You want to listen to her she 's been part of that group . And right after this break why you need to care about Washington imagination in Cairo . Sixty seconds away stay with us . UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT : Will your country ever be ready in your opinion for democratic reforms ? HOSNI MUBARAK , EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT : The democratic reform is an ongoing process . We started economic reform , political reform , and social reform at the same time . When you go back to 1981 until now in 18 years so many reforms took place . ANDERSON : Egypt 's Hosni Mubarak there talking about a -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- for democracy way back in 1999 . Well for many protestors it 's not enough their president has agreed to go by September they want him out now . Well according to the New York Times the White House who has been discussing plans for him to leave immediately . More on that in a moment first listen to this . We caught up with the foreign minister today . Here 's how Ahmed Gheit responded to those claims . AHMED ABDUL GHEIT , EGYPTIAN FOREIGN MINISTER : We Egyptians were not like oppositions from abroad . UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT : But this is your own people asking you to do this . GHEIT : No , no , it is not our own people . UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT : There are protestors out there saying we want -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . GHEIT : The President to transform the country and we all of us will transform the country . And we will transform the country through chaos but we will transform the country through an orderly transformation . And I call it transformation and not transition . Because I read the New York Times today and you relinquish power to your Vice President illegally because if you transfer power or your relinquish you relinquish power to the Speaker of parties . ANDERSON : Well yes President Obama just spoke in Washington . He did n't directly address the New York Times report but he did hint at a different strategy . Saying any details of a transition needs to be worked out by Egyptians . PRESIDENT BARRACK OBAMA : Second , the future of Egypt will be determined by its people . It 's also clear that there needs to be a transition process that begins now . That transition must initiate a process that respects the universal rights of the Egyptian people and that leads to free and fair elections . Now the details of the transition will be worked out by Egyptians . And my understanding is that some discussions have begun . But we are consulting widely within in Egypt and with the international community to communicate our strong belief that a successful and orderly transition must be meaningful . ANDERSON : Must be meaningful . Well our next guest pleads there 's some major risk associated with any plans to force Mubarak out immediately . Tarek Masoud a professor at Harvard University . For years he 's been a leading scholar and voice on Middle East and politics . He 's got a personal stake in this story as well he 's of Egyptian origin with family in the country . Sir thanks for joining us tonight . You say he should n't be forced out immediately . TAREK MASOUD , PROFESSOR , HARVARD UNIVERSITY : Well I 'm not he needs to be forced out immediately . I 'm just saying that there are some risks associated with forcing him out immediately . And the main risk there are two risks . The main one is that if you are forced out immediately the you could imagine that the crowds would dissipate and then it would be much harder for the opposition leaders to actually negotiate anything with the military . But even more important than that I guess is that it would trigger a new election within 60 days a new Presidential election within 60 days . And the presidency in Egypt is kind of imperial institution . It 's got Victoria powers and one of the things you would want to do before triggering a presidential election is amending the Constitution . And you ca n't amend the Constitution if the president - unless there 's an elected president sitting . If there 's an interim president you ca n't dissolve the Parliament . I mean you could amend the Constitution but it would have to be the current Parliament that would amend it and that 's an illegitimate parliament elected through fraud . So you need to dissolve the Parliament and only an elected president can do that and set that process in train . So there is that Constitutional issue involved . This sounds complicated but it is important . So let 's pursue this . So how should this orderly transition or transformation as the Foreign Minister -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- earlier on . How would it work and is n't the operative word here then orderly ? So this is but one path of many paths that could be taken and I do n't want to you know push to have for one path or the other . But it seems to me that if you want to follow the Egyptian Constitution and get from where we are now to a more democratic order then the first thing you would do is dissolve the parliament . And that requires Mubarak to stay . Because if Mubarak left whoever succeeded him could n't dissolve the Parliament and their be an election within 60 days . So you dissolve this kind of illegitimate Parliament , you have new parliamentary elections within 60 days . This new Parliament amends the Constitution to you know make it easier for independents to run for the presidency , to reduce some the powers of the presidency . And then Mubarak resigns and an interim President is you know appointed and that would be the Speaker of the new house , the Speaker of the new Parliament . And then you would have new presidential elections for this diminished presidency . So that 's one way to do it is you follow a kind of constitutional process and there are advantages to that . I mean if you want to really deepen this principle of adherence to law , adherence to the Constitution what better way to do that than to you know insist on it hearing even to a Constitution that is really quite flawed . ANDERSON : Let me throw a spanner into the works here a hypothetical spanner into the works . I 'm going to put you on the spot here . There have been talks today , nothing that we can standup but talk that the military could actually takeover at this point . Whether or not Washington will be prepared to back that is another question entirely . How would that change things ? MASOUD : Well so the military does not have the right to takeover according the existing Constitution . So once the military takes over if that were a possibility now were in a land of extra Constitutionalism outside of the Constitution . And then we would be really relying on the good graces of the military to relinquish power , to set and train a reform process . And this has happen in other countries . This is not to say that that could n't work in Egypt . But in Egypt you have an experience with the military entering politics and taking control . It happens in 1952 and Egyptians have had a devil of a time getting them to go back to the barracks . And so one worries about that particular path . ANDERSON : I 'm going to put you on the spot again . I 'm going to ask you to your mind you 're Egyptian so you got of sort you know you got an interest in this more than just the fact that you academically absolutely proficient in what you 're saying tonight . So to your mind at this point given what you 've seen and given what you 're hearing we have no idea who 's talking to who at this point . What do you think going to happen ? MAOUD : That 's a very hard question . I will note that we 've been paying a lot of attention to Mohammed -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- the committee that has been put together of leading opposition figures to presumably negotiate with the government . We have n't spent as much time focusing on this committee of wise men . -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- who are led by a man name -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- another gentleman name -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- who 's one of the Egypt 's billionaires . And they 're actually , they 've got about you know two dozen people on this committee and they 've got a plan for a transition that does seem to be a more constitutional path and that might offer a way out . What they 're proposing is that Mubarak delegate to Omar Suleiman , Omar Suleiman . ANDERSON : Great stuff , interesting , watch out for the wise men . Obviously something keep an eye on them . I 'm sorry that we lost him just at the end there coming out of Harvard for you this evening . Well it 's not just Egypt that 's plotting a new future . Across Africa and the Middle East of course protestors are transforming the political landscape . Coming up a look at what they 've achieved and ask where it might all end . Plus , it 's not first time we 've change sweep across an entire region . Later we 're going to hear from one man who 's witnessed history in the making first hand . But next , we 've heard a lot about Muslim Brotherhood recently but what part could they play in Egypt 's future ? I 'm going to ask a former member . ANDERSON : Well I see of first support for democratic reform and freedom . Tens of thousands of people gathered in Egypt second largest city Friday to demand President Hosni Mubarak resign . Nobel Peace surprise winner turn dissident to Mohammed ElBaradei was amongst those taking part in Alexandria 's day of departure . Many Muslim Brotherhood members also in the crowd . You 're with CONNECT THE WORLD I 'm Becky Anderson in London . There 's no doubt this uprising was all in the street reflecting the anger of average Egyptians against an oppressive regime . With the inclusion of the Muslim Brotherhood has got some highly concern about what might happen post Mubarak . Well it 's hard to say for sure how much support the Brotherhood has . Egypt 's largest opposition group is officially band . It does contest elections with candidates running as independents . In 2005 , the Brotherhood gain about 20 percent of the seats in Parliament . But this may not accurately reflect their strength as the elections were not free and fair . Muslim in Brotherhood has evolved over the years renouncing violence decades ago and clearly condemning groups like Al Qaeda . But its principle goal remains unchanged . It wants Islamic law to Egypt . Interesting then that it 's now teamed up with secular reformer Mohammed ElBaradei of course it does n't mean it will stay with him long - term . Well the New York Times reports a Brotherhood spokesman told Al Jazeera earlier in the uprising political groups support ElBaradei to negotiate with the regime . Tuesday that same spokesman said and `` it 's too early to even discuss whether ElBaradei should lead a transitional government or whether we would join him . Well another Brotherhood spokesman tells CNN they 're not a political force to be feared . Saying , they support freedom of press and freedom of religion for all . Well out next guest says there is plenty of reason for alarm in Egypt secular have better get their act together . This is somebody you 're going to recognize . Ayan Hirsi Ali is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute , she 's also author of Nomad and Infidel books that describe her own upbringing under Islam . Thank you for coming tonight there 's a reason for this . You were a member of the Muslim Brotherhood as a youngster . AYAN HIRSI ALI , AUTHOR , `` NOMAD '' AND `` INFIDEL '' : I was 15 years old and they were the only movement the individuals were offered as a moral frame walk that was familiar . The individuals who came to school were of us , they were among us and they were not corrupt , they gave us life full of purpose . And compared to all the other organizations who came up with dreams about freedom , my father was a freedom fighter . He was all about democracy . But he and his groups were unable to agree . They were unable to reach a conclusion of what it is that they wanted once they have driven away the strong man . The Muslim Brotherhood invoked Allah , they invoked the prophet Muhammad , they invoked the hereafter . All of that was familiar and they provided services that the states did provide and that our tribes and clans did not provide either . ANDERSON : Say you were of the Muslim Brotherhood it has to be said has legitimized Hosni Mubarak 's regime in the west . The president says if he quits the result would be chaos . This is what he told ABC News last night . And a movement Brotherhood takeover that is what he says . What would a greater role then do you think for the Brotherhood mean for Egypt ? ALI : I think Hosni Mubarak position is the fallacy of presenting the west in particularly America with the binary vision either a tyrant or -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . But it does n't have to be that . Secular movement especially the liberals , I consider myself a liberal would have to organize only present to the people of Egypt their improvement on mobile regime but also the other side the shadow side of the Muslim Brotherhood . What does it mean when -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- is implemented and brought to the Egyptian people ? What will it mean for women ? What is it going to mean for religious minorities ? What is it going mean for the economy ? You see a lot of people in the Arab world now demonstrating for bread and butter . Do you think that -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- is going to deliver ? The Egyptian people have an example to learn by the history of a people like Iran . If you consider the gay movement in 2009 it was not an opposition to a strong man . It was a no to -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- that 's the people of Iran who had voted in I think in a moment of absent mindedness in 1979 . ANDERSON : The difference between a democracy and theocracy of course . A theocracy would be run by clerics . I did n't think anybody is suggesting the Muslim Brotherhood is suggesting that . Amr Moussa he 's the Secretary General of course of the Arab League , former Foreign Minister and -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- of Egypt and -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- has hat into the ring as far as getting involved in the Unity Government . Was on CNN earlier on and when he was asked about whether people should fear the Muslim Brotherhood this is what he said and our viewers are just going to have a listen to this . AMRE MOUSSA , ARAB LEAGUE SECRETARY GENERAL : Fear that the Egypt future will be -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- within that -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- either Muslim Brotherhood or left or right . I would assure you that Egypt is looking forward for a more liberal future and that Egypt by nature , by the mood of its people and the mood of country will be part of the 21st Century and look for modernism and the future more than anybody thing . ANDERSON : Liberal , modernism a group that wants to be forward thinking that 's Amr Moussa 's point here . He 's trying to put to bed those fears and concerns that people have . What do you think the challenge is for the secular democrats faced with what is you know a movement that could be divisive going forward ? ALI : Well the secular movement need to interview something that is local that is Arab that says yes to Islam but no to -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . In other words a separation of religion from politics . I think if they devise with the help of the west or without the help of the west but in any case I would say with the help of the west . If they devise programs and institutions civic and economic institutions that can maintain that separation of church and state , they have religion and state affairs . They could in the long run defeat the Muslim Brotherhood . The Muslim Brotherhood offers -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- law and that is a theocracy . I have had votes . We know from history before Khomeini was elected he was dismissed as a peaceful man and somebody was n't going to be elected . Look at the Taliban in Afghanistan , look at the rise of Al Qaeda . Look at the -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- coming to power . So I think one of the things that is working for the Muslim Brotherhood is the fact that they are systematically underestimated . ANDERSON : Many people will say they 'd only get something like 20 percent of the vote . You say you think that they are systematically underestimated . Would you go so far as to say that they should n't be part , though , of a unity government going forward ? ALI : I would go so far as to say , when a new constitution is devised , that clauses have to be put in the constitution , for instance , comparable to that of Kemal Ataturk 's , Turkey , that Sharia Law , or a theocracy , that that is not democratic , that that 's not constitutional . So , there have to be safeguards built into the constitution to prevent a theocracy . But I think , once they meet that , they should be able to take part . And I believe that , if secular groups , especially the liberal groups , if they try and offer a program of liberation and economic prosperity to the Egyptian people , they could win . ANDERSON : Fascinating stuff . Ayaan Hirsi Ali , always a pleasure to speak to you . We thank you very much , indeed , for coming in tonight . We 're following this story to the very end , but for some of our reporters on the ground , it is a struggle to stop the story from following them . After the break , we 're going to show you some of the challenges that go into tracking these remarkable events . And , of course , we 'll be live in Cairo . Do stay with us . You 're watching CNN . I 'm Becky Anderson in London . ANDERSON : Welcome back . You 're watching CONNECT THE WORLD here on CNN . Let 's get you a check of the headlines this hour . Tens of thousands of protesters filled Cairo 's Tahrir Square again Friday for what they called the `` Day of Departure . '' It did n't live up to the billing , as President Hosni Mubarak is still in power . But protesters are hopeful he 'll resign earlier than promised . Barack Obama says the world is watching Egypt and that the transition process must now begin . In a statement a short time ago , the US president called for free and fair elections and says any negotiations must include a broad representation of the Egyptian opposition . The ripple effect from the Egyptian protests is continuing across North Africa and the Middle East . Hundreds of demonstrators in Jordan called for political reforms and an end to government corruption , although these protests were smaller than those held in previous weeks . And Australian prime minister Julia Gillard surveyed the damage from Cyclone Yasi on Friday . The Australian prime minister flew into northern Queensland to promise government and military aid after the huge storm slammed into the region earlier this week . And the trading week has come to an end on Wall Street . Disappointing jobs numbers meant the Dow only finished slightly higher . The US economy adding 36,000 jobs last month , but analysts expected more than four times that number . There 's the closing figure for you , still over the 12,000 mark , so not a bad week . Those are your headlines this hour . Well , covering what 's been going on in Egypt can be dangerous . Our team on the ground are definitely up against it . But here 's a taste of what they 've been able to deliver on Day 11 of these protests . IVAN WATSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- on camera -RRB- : CNN crews in other locations in this city overlooking Tahrir Square have been ordered by the Egyptian police not to provide live images of what 's going on in here . We are doing it right now , but our neighbors at this location have warned us that suspected secret police are outside trying to get in to shut our -- potentially shut us down . And we have a report from the Al Jazeera news network that a gang of thugs raided their Cairo office today and set fire to it . So , the effort to crack down on foreign media continues here in the Egyptian capital . ARWA DAMON , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- on camera -RRB- : We are seeing the military that moved in overnight taking something of a more proactive role . A complete difference to what we have seen them do in the days past , where they were taking something of a neutral stance , allowing both camps to fight it out , even allowing attacks on international and local media to take place . There is still great concern about the potential of violence , with many Cairo residents saying they are still remaining under self-imposed house arrest . The predominant emotion throughout the capital is still fear and uncertainty . FREDERIK PLEITGEN , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- on camera -RRB- : We 're right in front of one of the checkpoints leading into Tahrir Square . And , of course , one of the problems the protesters have , here , is getting enough food , water , and enough supplies in to keep all of these people going for such a long time . Because some of them have been here for over a week . And their system is one where everybody brings a little bit and , therefore , everybody has enough to survive . We are all together . You have the bread , we have cheese , we all gather with the food . PLEITGEN : And you give other people , as well ? Not for us only . PLEITGEN : So , it 's a spirit of sharing , here , then . UNIDENTIFIED : That 's right , it is , yes . PLEITGEN : Thank you . All right , so , a lot of people are actually coming in , one for the camera woman , as well , and they 're giving us and other protesters groceries , food , and bread to survive . ANDERSON : All right , let 's bring in Ivan Watson , who is on the ground for us . Some of our reporting on Day 11 . With 30 minutes to midnight in Cairo , Ivan , we 've been talking about the mood , and perhaps we should move on and really talk about how you 've been reporting this story . It 's about as tough as it 's got , for you , I guess , in your career ? WATSON : No , no. . The attacks on the journalists over the past three days , they 're substantial . Everybody I 've talked to has been harassed or had much worse occur to them . According to the Committee to Protect Journalists over the past few days , more than 100 incidents of journalists being attacked , detained , or having their equipment destroyed . This is not a coincidence , Becky . ANDERSON : You 're there on the balcony , now , I guess . I mean , do you feel comfortable in reporting now ? WATSON : I think among the opposition activists at the time being , the foreign media , the local media is welcomed by them , as they have been struggling to get their voices heard , both in Egypt and in the outside world . And these people have been putting their lives on the line to hold onto this patch of territory , as well . So , for the time being , with these people here , we feel quite comfortable . It 's a different story when you move beyond the barricades to the areas where the Egyptian secret police are operating and the pro- government , as many have taken to calling them , `` thugs , '' who have been carrying out the systematic attacks on the journalists . ANDERSON : Yes , it is it any clearer just who is behind this intimidation at this point ? WATSON : No , it is n't , and I think government officials have denied even playing any kind of role in the attacks that have taken place on Cairo 's Tahrir Square over the course of the past three days . They have even said that they are going to investigate who may have been behind what the vice president called was `` a conspiracy . '' ANDERSON : Ivan Watson , there , in Cairo for you . Ivan , we thank you very much , indeed . All right , let 's move from Cairo , shall we , to the port city of Alexandria . As you can see from this Google Earth image , Alexandria is roughly 200 kilometers north of the Egyptian capital , and the tensions have reached there and are exposing some divisions in society . Nic Robertson has been talking to some local residents for you . ROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Inside cafes , the talk is of the violent clashes in Cairo , pausing only to watch as protesters pass by . A week ago , this man was one of the protesters trying to oust the president . ROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Inside the same cafe , anti-Mubarak activists claim pro-government factions stalking Alexandria 's streets are paid to attack them and tell me they 're not going to give up until Mubarak goes . By the seafront , far from the protests , patience among this ancient city 's fishermen long since ran out . Net maker Ali Farhad -LRB- ph -RRB- is furious . `` This is wrong , '' he says . `` They 're destroying the country , stopping business for all the people . We 're with Mubarak . We need calm . '' His son , Mohammed Ali is angry , too . `` The protesters are hurting our business and bringing armed thugs to the streets . '' Battle lines are being drawn , the middle ground evaporating . TAREK EL-TAWIL , SENIOR JUDGE : The regime is panicking , are frustrated , they do n't know what to do . But never -- there have been never used to see this kind of demonstration . ROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Tarek el-Tawil , a senior judge , thought Mubarak was backing down , until he saw the violence in Cairo . Now , he says , the president should face trial for war crimes . EL-TAWIL : It 's against humanity , what they did yesterday . They massacred -- call it a massacre . Of course , of course . We 've seen very recently that international lawyers and stuff like that and human rights organizations will start to push , of course . ROBERTSON -LRB- on camera -RRB- : And will that convince him to step down ? EL-TAWIL : Of course , of course , if they have no choice . ROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : It 's a very , very uneasy calm . Over there on the corner are Mubarak loyalists waiting for anti-Mubarak demonstrators to come along , waiting for confrontation . So far , at least the anti-Mubarak supporters have been able to avoid violent clashes . Nic Robertson , CNN , Alexandria , Egypt . ANDERSON : All right . So , in the past week , we 've seen two Arab leaders vow to stand down and an entire government dismissed . So , what more can protesters hope to achieve ? We 're going to discuss a region in turmoil , up next . ANDERSON : It 's about 17 minutes to midnight in Egypt . In just a few short weeks , an entire region has been turned on its head , has n't it ? Its people are finally getting a taste of freedom , and the desire for democracy is spreading far and wide . In Egypt , anti-government demonstrators forced President Hosni Mubarak to promise not to run for reelection . Well , their inspiration came , in part , from Tunisia , where a protest against corruption led to the ousting of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali . In neighboring Algeria , a decades-old state of emergency will reportedly be lifted after demonstrations there . And in Jordan , public anger prompting King Abdullah II to dismiss his government and appoint a new prime minister to carry out political reforms . Well , after decades in power , Yemen 's president , Ali Abdullah Saleh , bowed to protesters ' demands this week and vowed not to seek reelection in 2013 . Mass protests have been organized online in Syria , but one planned for today saw few people take to the streets . And in Sudan , students have staged a series of demonstrations over corruption and rising prices . So , where is this regional unrest heading ? Well , I 'm happy to say I 'm joined to discuss this by CONNECT THE WORLD panelist and regular guest on this show , Fawaz Gerges . I do n't even have to say who you are these days , because everybody knows you as well as they know me . It 's not clear , at this point , who is talking to who in Egypt , whether the military may take over , whether the president may go now , or whether he may stay through September . What is , though , clear is that the wall of fear , not just in Egypt , but across the region , has fallen and changed the very nature , the psychology of a culture , has n't it ? FAWAZ GERGES , INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS PROFESSOR : It really has . I mean , you 're talking about the barrier of fear has been removed . One of the major reasons why Arab dictators have been able to dominate their populations and subjugate their population is because of the security apparatus . And that 's why you had political apathy and fear . What has happened in the last few weeks , now , is that people have become active and , basically , the barrier of fear has been removed . And you 're seeing , now , millions , not just hundreds of thousands of Arabs , now , realize they can own their future , they can determine their own history . ANDERSON : We are seeing movements across the region , but they do n't parallel each other , do they ? What we 've seen in Syria is really sort of protest-lite , dare I call it that . We see concessions by ruling parties and rulers across the region , but it 's not as big as we 've seen in Egypt or Tunisia , for example . GERGES : Not at all , and I think you 're absolutely correct about drawing attention to differences as well as similarities . Tunisia is not Egypt . Syria is not Jordan . Jordan is not Yemen . There are some major differences . But there are also similarities , and the similarities are the following , they are shared by almost every Arab state . Family-based states as opposed to rational , modernizing by various states . And dismal economic conditions . Dismal -- on average , Becky , you have on average between 40 and 50 million -- 50 and -- between 40 and 50 percent of the 300 million Arabs live either in poverty or below the poverty line . The population -- take Egypt . In 1952 , when the military officers carried out their coup , there were 15 million Egyptians . Today , you have 84 million Egyptians . How do you feed , how do you educate , how do you provide for the 84 million people ? You also have systems and institutional systems that have been decimated , that have been shattered . ANDERSON : All right . We know that there is change afoot , change amok , as it were . But history shows , and you and I know this , and most of our viewers will know this , that removing a corrupt , authoritarian leader through people power is , to a certain extent , the easy part . Constructing a new system which is inclusive and transparent , with institutions that work , is much , much harder . GERGES : In fact , the huge challenge facing the Arab world is the morning after . That is , the morning after you get rid of your dictators . There are no institutions . We have been talking the last few days , the Egyptian military is the most respected institution . It should not be the only respected national institution . What has happened to the parliament ? What has happened to other institutions ? There are no institutions . You have to build institutions . Institutional building , Becky , takes decades . How do you feed and provide for the -- how do you create a productive base ? On and on , so many difficulties and challenges . ANDERSON : Which is , perhaps , why we have heard the rest of the world calling for an orderly transition at this point . The people on the streets of Egypt want their president to go . We 've seen , as we say , people protest around the region . But is this orderly transition , and `` orderly , '' here , being the operative word , important at this point ? GERGES : Well , Becky , this is the question . What do we mean by `` orderly ? '' Do we mean by an orderly transition , that is the army manages the transition , the army puts its own people to replace Hosni Mubarak . Now you have the vice president , Omar Suleiman . You have the prime minister , a military general . The interior minister , and the defense minister . So , what kind of ch -- the reality is , even though the challenges are massive , you have to begin somewhere . You have to begin the process of institutional building . You have to give people a say in their political and economic well-being . ANDERSON : Let 's sit back . It is -- we 're into the first week of February . We 're into the 11th day , and just before midnight in Egypt , the 11th day of the protest in Egypt , we 've seen this wave across the region , the sort of shifting sands , dare I call it that , across the region . When you sit back and just take stock of where we are , what 's your first thought ? GERGES : Truly , this is historic . If you had asked me a few weeks ago , I would have said never in Egypt . Now , what I call -- I call it the Arab anti-father . People now realize that the authoritarian role , not just the barrier of fear , has fallen . This is a critical moment , because people realize they have power . And now -- and what 's beautiful about what we 're seeing , Becky , you 're not seeing American flags being burned . You 're not seeing people talking about Western imperialism . They 're talking about their dictators . They want to take charge of their destiny . This is really what matters . ANDERSON : You just talked about the day after , the day after in the Arab world . Does that worry you ? GERGES : A great deal . There are tremendous risks . And this particular transition is not assured . It will be messy , it will be prolonged , you might have some setbacks . But at the end of the day , the Arab world -- the Arab world has been living under dictatorship since the end of colonialism . You need to begin -- the Arab world must join what I call the democratic wave . The democratic wave had just reached the Arab shores . It 's a beautiful moment . If the Arab -- if the Arab intellectual and political and economic elite can manage this particular transition , in two or three decades , I 'm willing to -- this would be truly -- it would transform the Arab world and the relationship between the Arab world and the West . On a Friday evening in London , and at ten minutes to midnight in Egypt , Fawaz , we thank you very much , indeed , helping us out over the last couple of weeks . Just ahead on CONNECT THE WORLD , how scenes from the streets of Egypt are stirring up memories for one photojournalist . A look back at some of the famous revolts against powerful world leaders . You 're with CNN , we will be back in 60 seconds with CONNECT THE WORLD . ANDERSON : Those powerful images from Friday in Egypt . There it 's seven minutes to midnight , now . Well , in this evening 's Parting Shots , I want to show you how Egypt 's demands are reverberating right around the world , not just in the region . First to Iran , where after Friday payers , worshipers chanted for President Mubarak 's removal . In Turkey , pro-Islamic groups demonstrating in Ankara demanded an end to the ruling regime in Cairo . A protest in Kuala Lumpur outside the Egyptian embassy was later broken up by police using water canon . And in Paris , the group Reporters Without Borders campaigned against the attacks on journalists in Cairo . Regardless of age , Egypt 's protests have been gathering momentum . Egyptians in Prague called for the immediate resignation of Mubarak outside their embassy . In South Africa , this woman marched on Pretoria with around 250 other campaigners for the president to be ousted . Since January the 25th , the Egyptians ' chants have been echoed across many cities . Here in London , a series of rallies have been held supporting the uprising . While in Rome 's Republic Square , around a hundred people gathered to show their solidarity . And in the US , many Egyptian sympathizers have been out on the streets calling for change . This photo from a gathering outside the UN Egyptian mission in New York . Well , all of us have been watching events , have n't we , in Cairo , wondering whether , after almost 30 years of rule , Hosni Mubarak might , just might , be on his way out . Well , Peter Turnley is a photojournalist and colleague who told us it not only brings back memories of Mubarak 's rule , but it makes him think of all the strongmen like him that he 's photographed , all the uprisings , all the turmoil . Take a look at this . PETER TURNLEY , PHOTOJOURNALIST : Well , what has come to my mind as I have been witnessing these events unfold is that I had a photo session , a one-on-one photo session with Mubarak all the way back in 1986 , this was 25 years ago , and he has now been in power for 30 years . Watching these events unfold , it has occurred to me the quantity of popular revolts against authoritarian leaders . Ceausescu , Erich Honecker , Assad , Khomeini in Iran , Saddam Hussein in Iraq , Cedras of Haiti , Baby Doc Duvalier , Fidel Castro , and the list goes on and on . TURNLEY : I first met Ceausescu in 1989 . I had a photo session for a cover of Newsweek in August of 1989 at Ceausescu 's summer house . It was one of the most surreal experiences of my career . I pushed him around for an hour and a half in a photo session where he literally obeyed me almost like a child . Four months later , I found myself in his own personal office in the presidential palace in Bucharest with -- watching a television where Ceausescu 's dead face was looking up at the screen in his own office on his own set . TURNLEY : I recall very vividly that in 1989 , I photographed Honeker standing next to Gorbachev on a reviewing stand during the 50th anniversary of the East German state . They both were laughing , chatting leisurely . No one could have known , that very night in East Berlin , there were huge riots and protests by Molotov-cocktail-throwing young people against the Stasi , which was the beginning of the end of the East German regime , which folded with the fall of the Berlin Wall only several months later . TURNLEY : I have also experienced popular revolts that started with much passion , much enthusiasm , such as the Tiananmen Square uprising in China that was a very moving uprising of literally millions of young people that simply were expressing a desire for a better life . That revolt , though , ended being crushed by military hardware when Chinese troops came into Tiananmen Square , as we all know . And the consequences of that uprising , I think , are still yet not known today , this many years later . TURNLEY : As Mubarak was turning to walk into the presidential palace , I simply called out to him , and I said , `` President Mubarak , my name is Peter Turnley , I 'm trying to do a photo session for Newsweek . '' He turned and he said to me , `` When would you like to do it ? '' And I said , `` Right now . '' And he said , `` Let 's go . '' He chose to take a stance where his hands were folded and crossed in front of him , and it was a rather proud , strong , and possibly somewhat defiant look . TURNLEY : It has often seemed extremely surreal that some of the world leaders I 've photographed , notorious for the iron-fisted manner in which they have held power , have been quite cooperative during a one-on-one photo session . What matters most is how they will be judged by their own people and by history for the manner in which they have wielded power , and for how their regimes have impacted the lives of the citizens of their country . ANDERSON : Pictures that tell a story . I 'm Becky Anderson . That is your world connected . Thank you for watching . The world headlines and , then , `` BackStory '' will follow this short break .

PIERS MORGAN , HOST : When will Mubarak go ? BARACK OBAMA , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : The future of Egypt will be determined by its people . It 's also clear that there need to be a transition process that begins now . MORGAN : Tens of thousands pray and protest in Tahrir Square with one word for their president -- leave . And we 're here until the president goes . MORGAN : While gun battles rage on the streets , I 'll ask the country 's top money man what 's really going on . Is he sorry for attacks on journalists ? And my exclusive with the new prime minister of the country where the flames of revolution was first lit . Where will they spread next and what could it mean for security back home ? This is a special edition of PIERS MORGAN TONIGHT . You 're watching live images here of Tahrir Square in Cairo where there 's an eerie calm . But earlier this evening there was heavy gunfire , a defiant Mubarak clings to power . The American president is pushing publicly and privately for him to go and to go now . And then there was this . A video circulating on YouTube showing what looks like a white diplomatic van running people over in a crowd . It happens in a street that appears to lead right into Tahrir Square . Now the U.S. embassy in Cairo issued a statement tonight , saying , `` We are certain that no embassy employees or diplomats were involved in this incident on January 28th . However , a number of our U.S. embassy vehicles were stolen . Since these vehicles were stolen we 've heard reports of their use in violent and criminal acts . If true , we deplore these acts and the perpetrators . '' Let 's go straight to Anderson Cooper in a secret location in Cairo live tonight . Anderson , what do you make of today ? It seemed a strange day , a day that started very promisingly , massive crowds in the square . What 's going on , do you think ? ANDERSON COOPER , HOST , ANDERSON COOPER 360 Well , first of all , that video is from -- dated January 28th which was last Friday . That was the day kind of all hell broke loose here in terms of violence . So it was a very difficult day here . The U.S. embassy , as you 've said , has said a number of their vans were stolen . That 's about all we know . It does n't seem to make sense . The U.S. embassy was placed on lockdown on that day . So the idea that there would have been U.S. personnel driving around seems highly unlikely . So there seems no reason not to believe the idea that the vans were stolen . In terms of today , Piers , it was an extraordinary day . We think of the violence that we have seen for the last 48 hours , nevertheless despite that , in the face of that , bravery won out . People , tens of thousands of people here , Egyptians who are against Mubarak decided to go down to the square , even though they had seen their compatriots attacked with rocks and Molotov cocktails . Even though they must feared at times for their own safety , they went in huge numbers , Piers , in numbers that matched what we had seen earlier in the week before the violence began . And it was an extraordinarily jubilant crowd of people . And also significantly the Egyptian military finally after 48 hours of literally standing by watching rocks being thrown and Molotov cocktails thrown and watching and allowing , I should point out , pro-Mubarak demonstrators to descend into an area where they could attack anti-Mubarak protesters , the military finally set a perimeter , a cordon . They set out concertina wire . They actually checked people to try to prevent infiltrators from coming in . Checking people 's IDs , doing body searches . They made it -- they helped it be a peaceful day . And the earlier reports of the shooting that we heard a short time ago from the square , early reports indicate , though I ca n't confirm it myself independently , early reports indicate that some pro- Mubarak demonstrators were attempting to get close . The military was firing in the air in order to keep them back . That is certainly another good sign , Piers . MORGAN : It 's been a quite remarkable 48 hours , Anderson . I ca n't remember a situation like this where you have extraordinary violence against both the media and protesters and then this eerie calm and serenity in the square , almost . Do you think that Mubarak and his government officials realize that the full force against the media and protesters backfired on them in terms of PR around the world ? COOPER : I think -- I mean , I hate to try to analyze events without just knowing -- without just reporting complete facts , but my impression is that these protesters , these pro-Mubarak protesters were allowed to get close to the square perhaps in the hopes that they would push out the anti-Mubarak protesters , that they would end this once and for all . Clearly that did n't happen . I 'm not sure anyone anticipated the ferocity of the defense that the anti-Mubarak protesters put up . The ingenuity of building barricades , of tearing up pavement stones , arming themselves with rocks in response to rocks that were being hurled at them . No one was searching the pro-Mubarak demonstrators for weapons , I keep pointing out , but I think it 's an important point . So they were n't able to be beaten back . The military clearly could not have promised not to shoot into the anti-Mubarak protesters . So perhaps now we 're seeing a situation where they would be allowed to remain in the square , but the attempt is maybe just to kind of -- try to wear them down , wear them out . And as others have pointed out it is very difficult for the protesters in the square to remain there . The conditions are tough . You know you can only imagine . It 's like sleeping out in a public space for 12 days . It 's not an easy thing to do -- Piers . MORGAN : Anderson , it 's great to have you back on camera tonight and we 'll come back to you a little later in the show . The uprising in Egypt has brought the country 's economy to a complete standstill . The man in charge of fixing that is Finance Minister Samir Radwan who was sworn in on Monday . He joins me now by phone . Dr. Radwan , what will happen when the banks reopen on Sunday ? Will you be able to keep the Egyptian economy from collapsing ? DR. SAMIR RADWAN , EGYPTIAN FINANCE MINISTER -LRB- via phone -RRB- : Certainly we will do our best . It 's not the best situation , but we are extremely well prepared for that eventuality . RADWAN : We have been -- yes . MORGAN : How bad is the situation , sir ? If you do n't mind me asking . RADWAN : Not at all . I mean the situation of the stocks has changed as very well known . It 's clear we have lost something like seven billion pounds before the closure of the stock exchange . There is also the damage to the departure of one million tourists and the tourists are not coming in the same numbers Egypt was expecting . This is the height of the season . So -- and then there is , of course , the damage to property and so on that resulted from the demonstration . So all in all , I think the damage is quite substantial . But we are extremely well prepared . I am in constant touch with the central bank governor . We are coordinating together to make the opening of the banks and eventually the opening of the stock exchange as smooth as possible . MORGAN : You also -- you also have a problem with foreign investors . We 've already seen companies like Coca-Cola and GM beginning to rein back on their investments because they 're concerned about the stability of the country . How much of a problem is that going to be , do you think ? RADWAN : Certainly it is a problem . But what we are trying to do is that we shall not go back on any commitment that we have made to our foreign investors . That 's why the governor of the central bank has decided and declared that the outflow of money will not have a ceiling , will not stop . The second thing is we are trying to make money available . For the rush , we expect a rush on the banks as soon as the banks open on Sunday . So we have made absolutely sure that the ATM machines have cash . That the banks can cope with the payment both of Egyptian pounds and foreign exchange . MORGAN : And in terms of basic foodstuffs like wheat and flour and so on . MORGAN : What is the situation in relation to those kind of imports ? RADWAN : Well , as you know , Egypt is dependent on imports of foodstuffs from abroad . And one of the -- one of the first decisions I have taken on Monday was to allow the release of foodstuffs and essential commodities from the port of Egypt , Alexandria and Suez and so on -- without asking , without obliging the importers to pay customs duties at the moment . All they need to do is to give an undertaking that they will pay it later when conditions are better . I have arranged with the army to ensure the transport because transport was really a bottleneck to ensure the transport of these foodstuffs so that they can reach through the different towns and the front markets in Egypt . MORGAN : Dr. Radwan , we 've noticed that today it seems remarkably peaceful in Cairo in particular compared to previous days . Why do you think that is ? RADWAN : I think , you know , the president , and the vice president , and the prime ministers have gone as far as possible to respond to the demands of these young people . These young people , you see , have come out to the streets like at the beginning of their demonstration with very fair demands . They are talking about jobs . They are talking about corruption . They are talking about , you know , the freedom and so on . And so all these poverty , income distribution , all these are very legitimate demands . Now the fact that there are other political agenda that interfered with the situation and unfortunately on Wednesday the situation turned a bit nasty . But I think people realize that it is the future of this country at stake . For instance , unemployment . The longer these demonstrations continue , the longer the situation continues in the country , the more difficult unemployment problem would be solved . MORGAN : Finally , Dr. Radwan , I have to ask you this because you 're the first member of the Egyptian government I have spoken to . But there were some appalling scenes yesterday involving a large number of western journalists being beaten up , and stabbed and in some cases kidnapped and threatened with beheading by people apparently acting at the behest of the government . Would you like to take this opportunity to apologize ? RADWAN : I would apologize to any journalist or any foreigner or any Egyptian for that matter that has been subjected to this harsh treatment . The instructions are very clear . I have -- because other colleagues of yours from the international media told me about this . I inquired and I was told that there is zero tolerance , zero tolerance of this government on attacks against foreigners , let alone journalists whom we need to have them on our side , to watch this situation unfold and convey a much better image to the outside world . MORGAN : Doctor Radwan , thank you for your time . You have a huge task ahead of you and I wish you every success with it . RADWAN : Thank you very much indeed . MORGAN : President Hosni Mubarak tells ABC 's Christiane Amanpour he blames the Muslim Brotherhood for the bloodshed in Tahrir Square . Christiane joins me now from Cairo . Christiane , first of all , congratulations on a terrific scoop yesterday with your meeting with President Mubarak . What was his demeanor like ? CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR , ABC NEWS : His demeanor was well . He greeted me warmly . I had been to that palace many times before in my life as a foreign correspondent for CNN and I had interviewed him several times before . So we knew each other and he greeted me and really wanted to tell me that he had made that decision to step down . And he said to me , you know , it 's been 62 years that I have been in public life , Christiane , and it 's really enough . I 'm fed up . But I ca n't go right now , he said . Because otherwise it would be chaos and the Muslim Brotherhood would take over . That has been his line , the government line . That 's what they 're telling allies . That 's what they 're telling the United States . MORGAN : Tell me , Christiane , I mean , do you think he 's right ? I mean you know the area better than most people . Do you think he 's correct in his reading of the situation ? If he was to suddenly leave it could actually provoke more chaos than if he stays for the transition ? AMANPOUR : Well , two issues here . There is the struggle between whether he should leave now and try to prevent more chaos and instability or , as you say , if he stays and leaves precipitously , could that open a whole new can of worms and a whole new vacuum . And people have a lot of different ideas about that . What we have found is that there are people obviously who are concerned about the Muslim Brotherhood . We 've even seen and talked to people in the square today . Some young people who say , we do n't want our uprising , they call it our revolution , hijacked . Others saying , no , the Muslim Brotherhood is part of Egyptian society and that it only represents 20 or 30 percent of society . And they 're not going to win without the accession of the people . So -- also the Muslim Brotherhood knows about these fears that the west and the rest have . So they issued a statement . And I spoke to one of the leaders today who said that we 're not going to field any presidential candidates . We do n't even want any ministerial positions and we 're ready to enter talks on the future . And I asked why they would n't field any presidential candidates and they acknowledged that there is this fear about them around the world . And that they wanted to respect what they told me the civil democracy that they hope would come to replace what 's happened with -- to replace Mubarak 's regime . MORGAN : There was obviously an appalling day yesterday in terms of attacks on journalists , Christiane . Have you ever seen anything quite like that in terms of a concerted effort by a government to gag the media in such brutal way ? AMANPOUR : Well , you know , it certainly has been really appalling what 's happened . And I have actually been in so many places around the world where , when things go wrong , when a certain group does n't like what 's going on , they immediately blame the media . And here the Foreign Ministry -- and it was broadcast all over state television -- basically said that the uprising was a foreign conspiracy led by international journalists , so people who watch state television and that 's the only place they get their news , believe it . In addition , we believe that there were people who were deliberately targeting journalists , who were looking for them , who were harassing them , sometimes hurting them in the streets . We were surrounded by angry mobs , for instance , on two days . And also people who went into hotels and started to take and dismantle broadcasting equipment . I asked the Minister of Information yesterday , would he please put a statement out that the foreign press is to be respected , that we 're here to do a job , to cover the story , to cover the facts . We have no agenda other than to do our job . And he promised to me that he would put that out on state television and state media . And certainly today , the situation is much calmer all around . Whether it 's about journalists or indeed whether it 's about the protest , the army is deployed to give a bigger buffer zone between the protesters in the Liberation Square and there have not been the kinds of pro-Mubarak protesters , organized or not , who have come to try to break up these protesters in the square . It 's totally different today . MORGAN : Christiane , I know you 've got more of this on `` Nightline '' later . Thank you very much for taking the time to join me . MORGAN : When we come back , a very tense night in Cairo and a young woman , her family under fire , stopping at nothing to get her story out . And later the revolution will be tweeting . My exclusive with the prime minister who came to power thanks to Facebook and Twitter . MORGAN : We 've been following her story all week , the Egyptian journalist who 's risking everything to get her story out . Sarah Sirgany is deputy editor of `` The Daily News Egypt '' . She joins us again via Skype . Sarah , good evening . SARAH SIRGANY , DAILY NEWS EGYPT\\/INTL . HERALD TRIBUNE : I 'm fine , thank you . MORGAN : Before we go any further I 've had so many people commenting on my Twitter about how you 've become their new heroine . SIRGANY : There are a lot of heroes out here , it 's not just me . MORGAN : I think what they like is the fact that you 're putting yourself at risk and yet you 're determined to keep getting the story out . And that 's a really important function at the moment . How has the day been for you out there ? SIRGANY : So far the protests in Tahrir have been very peaceful . People have a great time . The spirit there is great , but it 's actually when people were trying to leave the protests that problems started to happen . There are thugs still out there in downtown -- the downtown area . Anyone who looks remotely foreign is being checked . Anyone with a camera is being checked . The army is very helpful , but the problem is when people gather up around reporters or activists or anyone just happens to be coming up from the downtown area . It 's a dangerous situation . MORGAN : I heard that your own brother had a bit of a run-in with some thugs today . And it 's not the first time . The day before he was trying to protect some journalists , some foreign journalists , and that was not even near the Tahrir area . And then another time , and today when they were coming out of the demonstration in Tahrir , people stopped them , asked to see their IDs , accused them of being foreigners . All of them were Egyptians and actually looked Egyptian as well . But the fact that they were coming from the area made them look suspicious . And it was just a random attack . And then even when they 're going home after the army released them , it 's -- they 're still being stopped . One of them had a camera and that seemed enough for people just to accuse them of anything . There are still some same people out that are trying to get people out . But it 's still very dangerous and it 's deterring a lot of people from actually going out to do anything . MORGAN : So tell me , what is your take on the mood of the people now because we have very violent day yesterday , not so violent today . No one seems quite sure whether Mubarak is going to stay or go . Do the people want him gone now ? Is he going to go now , do you think ? SIRGANY : I do n't think he 's going now . But the people in Tahrir they stayed there . They have seen people die . I do n't think they 're -- I do n't think they 're leaving until there is some drastic change . And so far there has n't been any . MORGAN : Do you think they still want Mubarak gone now ? SIRGANY : At least the people I 'm speaking to over there . MORGAN : Sarah , keep up the great work . I 'd love to talk to you again . I think you 're doing , as I said , an incredibly important job . And really you keep going . When we come back , does President Obama really like what he sees in Egypt tonight ? And later , blowback . I 'll ask security experts , does the chaos in Cairo put you at risk ? OBAMA : The Egyptian government has a responsibility to protect the rights of its people . Those demonstrating also have a responsibility to do so peacefully . But everybody should recognize a simple truth . The issues at stake in Egypt will not be resolved through violence or suppression . And we are encouraged by the restraint that was shown today . We hope that it continues . MORGAN : That was President Obama just a little while ago sounding optimistic about Egypt . I 'm joined now by Wolf Blitzer . Wolf , is he right to feel optimistic ? WOLF BLITZER , CNN 'S SITUATION ROOM : I 'm not sure he really does feel optimistic . I think he was encouraged that today we did n't see the kind of violence that we saw yesterday and the day before , but based on everything I 'm hearing from inside the Obama administration they are deeply worried . This is by no means looking rosy right now . They 've got a game plan . What they would like to see , they 'd like to see President Mubarak step down in a graceful , dignified way . Maybe go to his home in Sharm el-Sheikh , the southern tip of Sinai , or some place else . But they certainly would like to see , at least in a transition , the Vice President Omar Suleiman take charge with the military and set the stage months down the road for some sort of free and fair elections . But that 's their wish . They are not convinced at all that that 's necessarily going to happen . It 's going to happen if all the things fall into place . But right now there is so much , Piers , that can still go wrong , can still go in the other direction . So they 're very , very nervous . MORGAN : I mean I 've been hearing very conflicting reports . A good source of mine close to the White House said to me today that actually one of the scenarios that may play out is if there is n't much violence over the next few days that Mubarak may actually hang around to be part of a transition period and that this comes down to the Egyptian sense of pride and honor that they should be doing this for a man who 's led them for 30 years and who has , whether you like him or not , whether you think he 's a dictator or not , has been a good ally to America for all that time . BLITZER : Well , I think there is a whole group of people that would believe that . And as far as everything I can tell that 's a lot of wishful thinking . As far as the protesters are concerned , those who are at Tahrir Square or elsewhere in Egypt , they do n't want President Mubarak hanging around at all . They would like to see him go away right now . And I sense that that 's what the administration would like to find . Yes , he was very helpful in the peace process . He had a peace with Israel . He was very cooperative with the United States in the war on terror . He fought al Qaeda . The U.S.-Egyptian military to military has been excellent over 30 years . So they like Mubarak but recognize that the average person on the street or at least the people protesting now want him gone and it 's not going to stop , the demonstrations , until he leaves . So it 's a delicate dance they have to play out right now . MORGAN : It really is . Is this one of the most difficult foreign policy decisions you have seen an American president have for quite some time ? BLITZER : It 's a very difficult foreign policy decision . From the U.S. perspective there can be a positive outcome , there can be democracy . Potentially there could be a great new pro-western secular government , free and fair elections that emerges in Egypt , maintains good relations with the United States , maintains the peace treaty with Israel , works to promote an Israeli Palestinian agreement . That would be the best of all worlds . But they also see a real possibility that it could be a disaster for the United States that the bad guys take over , that there could be a military coup on the one hand or even further an Islamist regime that takes over in Egypt . So there is a whole range of options out there . They hope there is a secular , democratic , positive regime that emerges . That will require an enormous amount of finesse and work . And I think what 's clear to president Obama now and the top national security advisers , the U.S. has limited influence . It has to put together a coalition . I noticed the White House put out a statement that the president spoke with the prime minister of Turkey tonight , and I think they are trying to coordinate a strategy . But if you look at the other U.S. allies in the region like the Saudis , for example , they are not happy with what they see , and they think the United States is sort of pulling the rug out from underneath President Mubarak . And the Saudis are a critical ally , as quote , and that 's a severely flawed regime as well . MORGAN : Wolf Blitzer , thank you very much . MORGAN : When we come back , exit Mubarak and to terror -- what we need to know before power changes hand . And later , a revolution in 140 characters -- wait until you hear what started the wave of rebellion halfway around the world . MORGAN : What are the implications for Egypt 's neighbors in the Middle East ? Joining me now is Chuck Hagel , chairman of the Atlantic Council and a former member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations . I heard John McCain say this was potentially the most dangerous situation the Middle East has faced in our lifetimes . How worried are you about Israel which is seeing its number one protector in many ways now being exposed to the will of the people and that could go anywhere ? CHUCK HAGEL , CHAIRMAN , ATLANTIC COUNCIL : Well , I think John 's comments were correct . Not since the 1967 and 1973 wars in the Middle East have we seen such a dangerous time . But this is even maybe more dangerous because it 's more unpredictable , that the bilateral relationship , the first peace treaty with an Arab country that Israel had and still has and has been very important to Israel 's security has been with Egypt . If new leaders take over in Egypt , which I believe is going to happen , it 's just a matter of how and when , then where does it put that relationship between Israel and Egypt ? And that certainly is not only in Israel 's interest but in America 's interests , other countries in the Middle East . MORGAN : What happens if the Egyptian people simply do not want to go along with the timetable that would suit America ? Clearly a peaceful , relatively well-organized transition is the preferred option for everybody because it 's less chaotic , but if the protests continue , they get bigger , they get angrier and there is more violence , is n't Mubarak just going to have to go ? HAGEL : I think we have to recognize and accept that it will be the people of Egypt that will ultimately determine the course of Egypt , including its leadership . We have few controls here . We have some controls , we have some instruments of power we must employ wisely . But it 's the people . That 's what this is about . What happened in Tunisia , what 's happening in Jordan , what 's happening in Yemen . This is the human condition manifesting itself . Yes , we want an orderly , peaceful transition and I hope that 's how this comes out , but I think it is yet uncertain . MORGAN : Unpredictable times . Senator , thank you very much , indeed . MORGAN : Michael Chertoff was Homeland Security Secretary under George W. Bush and he says it is a matter of time before Mubarak leaves . Michael Chertoff , When will leave ? MICHAEL CHERTOFF , FORMER HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY : I think it 's clear he 's going to leave no later than September , but my sense is he will probably leave before then although I do n't think he will want to appear to be chased out of office . I think much of what you see now is a question of timing and transition . MORGAN : Presumably it is not in America 's interest that he 's seen to be chased out of office or the protesters may think , hang on , we are onto something here and start chasing everybody out of office . CHERTOFF : There are two elements here . First , we do n't want to create an appetite for upheaval just for the sake of upheaval , but the process has to be managed . That means there has to be plan in place and ultimately transition to free and fair elections . And I think a precipitous exit , particularly one that appears to be a matter of being forced out of office works against that transition . MORGAN : As somebody who has been a leading light in Homeland Security , what do you see now as the threat to America 's security by what you are seeing in Egypt ? CHERTOFF : First , let me say I think it 's a wonderful thing to see democracy in action and people going into the streets not to be violent but to demonstrate peacefully . We have largely seen the people who want change are peaceful . Obviously we 've seen the pro Mubarak forces being more violent . But in long run a stable regime which is Democrat and free and probably in America 's best interest . I think what we worry about again is where are we headed and how quickly are we headed there ? We certainly do n't want disorder to see things spin out of control . Nor do we want to see a government in place that would be anti-American , because Egypt has been an important partner to us , to the region , and of course if we were to have an anti-American regime that would be a problematic issue especially from a security standpoint . CHERTOFF : People keep playing down the Al Qaeda for Egypt and there certainly have been links . How seriously should we take the threat ? Could it get worse ? CHERTOFF : Piers , from what we are seeing it does not appear to be going on . But you 're quire right to point out that if you look at the people around bin Laden they have been drawn from Egyptian radicals who were enemies of the regime for 10 , 20 years and frankly originally focused on Egypt as the location they wanted for the first radical revolution . So I have to believe people around bin Laden are watching very closely looking to see if they have the opportunity to really seize the advantage and turmoil . The good news is we have a lot of people who are not radical extremists , and one hopes there is enough time to manage the transition so people who are rational and want to have a democratic and free regime can maintain control . MORGAN : Finally , what would you say is the doomsday scenario here ? Whenever there is a void like this , there is always a danger when things are unpredictable that anything could happen . What would be the worst that could happen from America 's point of view ? CHERTOFF : Well , Piers , right now the army appears to be playing the role of a stabilizing force . They have been disciplined in the way they deal with demonstrators . They appear to be invested in managing a transition . The doomsday scenario I do n't would be one in which order breaks down and what happens historically is even small groups can take control of the revolution because they have the discipline and they may have the weapons to do so . If you go back to 1917 , you know , that 's how the Bolsheviks took power following on the first wave of the Russian Revolution . We do n't want to see another Iranian revolution scenario in Egypt . I think there are real differences which are positive in the direction of a democratic outcome . But we 'd be unwise to be complacent or take it for granted . That 's why I think negotiating with the military and with Mubarak about a disciplined transition is very important for America 's interests as well as for the safety and security of the people in Egypt . MORGAN : Thank you very much for your time . MORGAN : Next , my exclusive interview with a man who took power after his country 's youth logged on throughout the government . Later we go back live to Cairo where we are hearing heavy gunfire again . MORGAN : That woman was chanting `` No , Mubarak , we will not be ruined , and tomorrow with our shoes we will step on you . '' She 's one of tens of thousands of protesters in Tahrir square all of them fighting for Egypt to go the way of Tunisia where strongman Ben Ali was overthrown last month . Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi is now in charge . The prime minister mentioned the role of Twitter in Tunisia 's revolution . I want to hear your views . Tweet me at Piers Morgan . Prime Minister Ghannouchi , thank you for joining the show . Can I ask you immediately , you have been in charge of your country for 22 days now . Have you managed to achieve stability ? MOHAMED GHANNOUCHI , TUNISIAN PRIME MINISTER -LRB- via translator -RRB- : We went through difficult times . There were security issues that are fortunately now in the past . We are now working on social challenges given the urgent demands to improve living conditions , but that has not stopped us from preparing for the future . We adopted concrete measures to ensure the historic change that our country needs so that the changes towards democracy , freedom and respect of the fundamental rights of the Tunisian people be assured so there will never , ever again be a dictatorship in Tunisia . MORGAN : Mr. Prime Minister , can I ask you , have you been surprised by the events in Egypt , and do you believe that President Mubarak should now go immediately ? GHANNOUCHI : We are worrying about our own country . Our revolution is unique . It was caused by the young . Facebook and Twitter were the levers . It has been held in a peaceful way . Today , we were able to break with the past thanks to what we have in our DNA . Tunisia , as you know , is an exporting country , but we do not pretend that we export revolutions . We have friendly relationships with all peoples , regardless of the region where they live . MORGAN : Mr. Prime Minister , what happened in Tunisia was that the young people decided they wanted revolution . They were unhappy with the regime . And we have seen the same now happen in Egypt . Do you believe that this is a crisis for the whole of the Middle East ? GHANNOUCHI : I have n't really thought about it . Since January 14th , we have been totally focused on bringing order to the country , getting back to normal , and accomplishing this challenge of democracy . It is a difficult task . We are all mobilized -- youth , adult , elderly , women , children -- to succeed . What preoccupies us today is Tunisia and only Tunisia . MORGAN : Prime Minister , if President Obama is watching this interview , what would you like to say to him and the American people ? How can they help you in Tunisia ? GHANNOUCHI : First of all , I would like to thank the American people that have always helped Tunisia since our independence . We never forget what the American people did for Tunisia in critical moments of our history . What I would say to him is that since January 14th , we have received many messages of sympathy and support . One of the first messages Tunisia received was from the United States . During the conversation I had with Ms. Hillary Clinton , I was really touched and sensitive to the message she relayed to me from President Obama so that I would convey it to the people of Tunisia . MORGAN : Prime Minister , finally , let me ask you , when do you expect to hold elections in Tunisia ? Is it true that once they have been held , you intend to retire from politics yourself ? And do you believe that you 're going to find successful peace and prosperity in your country in the next few years ? GHANNOUCHI : We have already entered negotiations , and a commission has been formed to revise the laws to make this election free and transparent , an election that will allow all parties to participate with the same chances . It is the task of the national commission working on political reform that must be undertaken . That will allow us to find out in a few days the schedule so that the elections can be held in a way to uphold our objective that the elections be at the level of the hope generated by this peaceful revolution , a revolution that 's reinforced our duty to succeed . In my first interview with Tunisian television , I said that my political career will end the day when the baton is passed to the next government , which will be formed once the elections are held . We have lots of young people , great talents . We have to leave room for those who want to serve this country and who want to give Tunisia a chance to become a democracy , to make Tunisia a free country , a country where energy is freed from every constraint , a country that is dignified for its 3,000-year history . I have confidence in our people . I have confidence in our youth . I have confidence in all political parties that today are eager to preserve fundamental freedoms . Those that respect women 's rights , women 's freedom , freedom of religion , freedom of thought , we have confidence that these men will succeed in steering this country towards the shores of freedom and democracy . MORGAN : Prime Minister Ghannouchi , thank you very much for your time . I have been to Tunisia . It 's a great country . I hope to come again , and I wish you every success with your democratic , free elections , and with your career personally . GHANNOUCHI : I would be happy to host you in Tunisia so you can see our country post-revolution . MORGAN : Prime Minister , thank you for your time . GHANNOUCHI : Thank you very much . MORGAN : And as I said before that interview , that was the Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi from Tunisia fascinatingly revealing the role of Twitter in his country 's revolution . I want to hear your views about that . Tweet me at @piersmorgan . Coming up , the latest from Cairo where heavy gunfire broke out in Tahrir square this evening . MORGAN : We 're going now to Ivan Watson live in Cairo . Ivan , it 's been a weird day in my ways , calm for the most part , but gunfire this evening . What is your take on what 's going on right now ? IVAN WATSON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , we 've again experienced some remarkable changes , Piers . When I spoke to you this time last night , there had been attacks on the journalists . We were seeing soldiers deployed around the opposition controlled barricades here in Tahrir Square , and there was an ominous feeling that something terrible was coming . Little did I expect that space would be named and tens of thousands of people would be allowed to move into this place where a large political rally was able -- allowed to basically take place in what had been a war zone , where you had an opposition enclave under attack , and allowed to have emotional , peaceful political rally calling for the resignation of Hosni Mubarak . A remarkable change of events and showing that this symbol of defiance has survived two days and two nights of fighting and is that much stronger for it . MORGAN : We just heard the prime minister of Tunisia talking about the power of Facebook and Twitter in particular on the revolution there . And we 've seen similar things going on in Egypt . Are you back on in terms of technology ? Can you tweet from there ? Can you get on the Internet ? Are mobile phones working ? WATSON : Mobile phones are working , and the Internet did come back on several days ago . I saw an estimate that the cost of shutting down the internet and the telephones in this country was something astronomical and truly a sign of really the dramatic and potentially self-destructive decisions that the government made in the first days of what can safely be called a political stages , or the early stages of one in Egypt here . MORGAN : How do you see the next 24 , 48 hours , Ivan ? Is it possible to make any kind of prediction with any certainty ? WATSON : No way , absolutely not . I do n't think any of us from one day to the next predict what could happen next . So all I 'm going to say is that in this place , in this opposition , anti-Mubarak enclave now , because that 's really what it is now . You have these barricades that have been established , the kind of barricades that could have been in Paris in the 19th century when revolts started up . These people are now stronger . Their morale is higher . They have fought and bled and died , and they 're still here . And they have gotten more popular support . They 're not going away . MORGAN : Ivan , thank you very much for another excellent report . Please stay safe there . It 's unpredictable and it 's dangerous . That 's it for us tonight , `` PIERS MORGAN TONIGHT .

It has abused its citizens . But , until last week , one thing it did n't do was crack down on online communication . To be sure , Egyptian authorities punished outspoken dissidents , but that control was exercised offline . As Egyptian human rights lawyer Gamal Eid noted , Egyptian government authorities did n't bother censoring their critics , they simply beat them up . In a particularly brutal case , last year Egyptian police officers beat a man to death outside an internet caf in broad daylight . The regime was cruel but not technologically sophisticated . So last week , when the Mubarak regime decided to shut down the internet , human rights advocates , civil society groups and dissidents were caught flat-footed . They had never developed the work-arounds that others in societies with a history of online censorship had . Of course , by shutting down the entire internet in a failed attempt to disrupt pro-democracy forces , the Egyptian government also disrupted commerce and tourism and brought the country 's economy to a standstill . Meanwhile , China 's more evolved system of online filtering is limiting its citizens ' ability to access information about the Egyptian protests by blocking queries for `` Egypt '' on its Twitter equivalent . The Great Firewall is curtailing free speech , but the Chinese economy keeps chugging along . Who is instigating the Cairo violence ? Fire truck mows down protester Google connects Egyptians to Twitter There are a lot of questions that need to be answered about how Egypt was able to pull the plug so easily on the entire country 's internet . In particular , internet users need to know how and to what extent companies decided to comply with the Egyptian government 's request to do so . But one thing is clear for the future : Countries looking to suppress popular unrest undoubtedly will seek to emulate China , not Egypt . Censorship appears to be less costly to authoritarian regimes when it 's done with virtual firewalls , not a wrecking ball . What this means for the Obama administration , which has been slow off the mark to align its statements and policies on Egypt with its professed commitment to human rights , is that there 's a chance to get ahead of events in the next round of the fight between censor and citizen . American companies are producing the technology that will allow governments to filter and track speech on the internet . Companies such as Cisco , Netgear and Sonicwall ship orders for firewalls containing Deep Packet Inspection technology -- which allows monitoring of data traffic -- to China , Jordan or Belarus . Before they do so , the Obama administration should urge due diligence to ensure that these products will not be used to restrict the free speech rights of the people of those countries . Technological innovation need not only benefit autocrats . The U.S. State Department has begun to make important investments in a variety of initiatives to promote internet freedom . The recent promise of $ 30 million in support for projects and services to advance the cause of internet freedom has the potential to speed the development and deployment of technologies designed to help internet users in closed societies gain free and safe access to the internet . A year ago , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton articulated a vision of a world with `` one internet , one global community and a common body of knowledge that benefits and unites us all . '' A step toward making that vision a reality is recognizing that the lessons from today 's upheaval in Egypt have implications for internet freedom around the world . We can be sure that the leaders of closed societies are fortifying their online firewalls now . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Elisa Massimino .

Top members of the Obama administration stated Thursday their desire for embattled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to leave office and for inclusive negotiations to begin immediately with his political opponents . National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor added that U.S. officials have also discussed with Egyptian officials `` a variety of different ways '' in which that new government could take shape . But Vietor stressed `` all of those decisions must be made by the Egyptian people . '' A senior Obama administration official knocked down a New York Times report that the Egyptians and Americans were near consensus on a specific proposal . Egypt losing a lot of money Hosni Mubarak : In his words Crowley : We 're worried about the media Camera rolls as Cooper , crew attacked `` It 's simply wrong to report that there 's a single U.S. plan that 's being negotiated with the Egyptians , '' the official said . U.S. officials have made clear in recent days their desire to jumpstart talks between opposition and ruling forces in order to lay the groundwork as soon as possible for a governmental transition . That includes pressuring , besides Mubarak 's government , opposition groups to engage immediately in talks . Mubarak has announced he will not seek re-election in September . Protesters , however , continue to demand that he step down immediately , with a caretaker unity government running the country until the fall elections . While some , like former Foreign Minister and Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa , believe concessions made by Mubarak presented an opportunity to build upon , members of the opposition Muslim Brotherhood have insisted no talks should take place until the president leaves office . `` It 's time for both of them to roll up their sleeves , '' a senior State Department official said . `` The government has to take some steps , but the opposition has to be willing to participate in negotiations as well . '' Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman made `` important statements '' about a political dialogue , the senior official said . Still , he added that the Egyptian government should allow the opposition to bring its own ideas , rather than dictate the pace and scope of a transformation to democracy . The urgent call for talks comes as the Egyptian government pushed back on what it described as `` vague '' statements from the Obama administration about the pace of transition . An Egyptian government official told CNN the White House has shown support for its `` roadmap '' for a transition up to when Mubarak 's term ends in September , but said President Obama 's calls for an `` orderly transition '' are at odds with his call for an immediate one . The official said Mubarak is seen as a `` receding figure '' in Egyptian politics , but warned that deposing him immediately would lead to a murky political process that would make free and fair elections difficult . According to the Egyptian constitution , the presidency would be transferred to the speaker of the parliament if Mubarak leaves power without enacting certain legislative and constitutional reforms . `` Institutionally , there is support in Egypt for this roadmap among the military , vice president and prime minister , '' said the Egyptian official . Egypt : Lay of the land Will the Egyptian crisis ever end ? U.S. officials said they believe what transpires Friday -- when another massive anti-government protest is expected -- will be an important barometer on whether serious negotiations can take place . Demonstrators may be less willing to talk if attacked . `` It 's hard to imagine if there is a day of very bad violence , it will lead to the type of dialogue that needs to take place , '' the senior State Department official said . These backroom discussions involving the U.S. and Egyptian political players come as the White House and legislators stepped up their public pressure on Mubarak 's regime . On Thursday , Vice President Joe Biden talked with Suleiman and pressed him that `` credible , inclusive negotiations -LRB- should -RRB- begin immediately '' with opposition political groups , a statement from Biden 's office said . That sentiment was reiterated by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs , who told reporters `` it is important that we all begin to see meaningful steps , and that negotiations take place between the -LRB- current -RRB- government and a broadly based group of members of the opposition as we work through the transition toward free and fair elections . '' U.S. lawmakers have also chimed in , with foreign policy veterans Sens. John Kerry , D-Massachusetts , and John McCain , R-Arizona , among those calling for Mubarak to step aside for the sake of his country and people . Thursday night , the U.S. Senate gave unanimous approval to a resolution calling for Mubarak to `` immediately begin an orderly and peaceful transition to a democratic political system , including the transfer of power to an inclusive interim caretaker government , in coordination with leaders from Egypt 's opposition , civil society , and military , to enact the necessary reforms to hold free , fair , and internationally credible elections this year . '' The Obama administration also sharply condemned the violence that erupted Wednesday in Cairo , when pro-Mubarak supporters attacked anti-government protesters . At least eight people were killed and 836 injured , according to the Egyptian Health Ministry . State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Thursday `` elements close to the government or ruling party '' carried out the violence . `` I do n't think we have a sense of how far up the chain it went , '' he noted . The United States continues to walk a fine diplomatic line in the crisis , encouraging Mubarak to transition from power while stopping short of publicly asking him to step down . Officials say the restraint is needed because the White House is mindful that allies in the Middle East are concerned about American loyalty . Government contacts have expressed reservations about how vocal the Obama administration has been in pressing Mubarak , a close American ally of three decades . Other regional allies are concerned about how quickly the United States might turn on them if protests start in their countries , the State Department officials said . The White House , meanwhile , has made a deliberate decision to let Adm. Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , take the lead role in communicating with the Egyptian military about its role in the current unrest , according to two senior U.S. officials . Mullen has not told Egyptian military leaders to pressure Mubarak to step down , the officials insisted to CNN . `` That 's not his role , '' one official said . Mullen is , however , trying to push the Egyptian military to maintain security , not move against peaceful protesters , and keep the violence from escalating . The U.S. government believes Mubarak will not issue a direct order to the Egyptian army to do anything because he is uncertain his orders would be followed , one official with very direct knowledge of evolving U.S. policy in the crisis told CNN . A refusal on the part of the army to obey Mubarak would spell the end of the Egyptian leader 's rule , the official noted . At that point , Mubarak would have to leave the country . The U.S. belief right now , the official said , is that Suleiman is letting the army feel it is `` representing the flag of the nation '' in trying to help without making a massive move against the government . While Mullen is communicating with his Egyptian counterparts , the CIA has set up its own task force to monitor the crisis . `` The Central Intelligence Agency always surges personnel and resources as needed to meet any crisis head-on . This situation is no different , and we 've established a Middle East Task Force , '' CIA spokeswoman Jennifer Youngblood said . `` Our 24\\/7 operations are focused on ensuring we provide the best possible insights and freshest intelligence to policymakers , '' she said . The chaotic situation has raised concerns that terrorist entities could try to exploit the situation . `` People are watching for signs that terrorists or militant groups might try to take advantage of the situation in Cairo and launch attacks , '' a U.S. official noted . `` We expect groups like al Qaeda to take advantage of instability anywhere as a means to promote their cause publicly . '' Overall , the Obama administration is handling the Egyptian crisis relatively well so far , according to Nicholas Burns , a former Clinton State Department official . `` We 've got to stand up , as the president is doing , for reform and democracy , '' Burns told CNN . The U.S. government needs to `` use our influence behind the scenes , and we 've got a lot of influence there with President Mubarak to move him towards a fast transition . '' Burns noted the importance of Egypt in terms of the Arab-Israeli conflict , shipments through the Suez Canal , and the containment of Iran , among other things . `` We 've got to preserve those very real American interests , '' he said . `` This is about as difficult a challenge diplomatically as I think we have seen in many years . '' Michael Rubin , an analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute , said that while it 's `` tempting to try to score political points '' in the current crisis , he 's not sure Obama has responded any differently than a Republican president would have in a similar situation . In terms of backing Mubarak , all of Obama 's predecessors `` kicked the can down the road until the road ran out , '' he said . The real difficulty , Rubin said , will come in the months ahead as U.S. policymakers try to prevent Egypt from following the path Iran took after 1979 , when the fall of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi led to the rise of the fundamentalist regime still in power today . The U.S. needs to make clear the Egyptian elections happen `` come hell or high water , '' Rubin said , but at the same pushing to ensure armed extremist militias are n't allowed to claim the mantle of democratic legitimacy .

The Mubarak regime has n't discriminated in which sorts of journalists are being attacked : Egyptians and other Arabs , Russians , Americans , Europeans and South Americans all have been targeted , the committee said . Speaking on state-run Nile TV Thursday , Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman mentioned the role of the media and , at least in part , blamed journalists for the country 's current unrest . Protests on ` until Mubarak steps down ' What 's the role of Egypt 's military ? Reporting in Cairo by Twitter Meanwhile , in Washington , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned the attacks Thursday , `` in the strongest possible terms . '' Pro-government journalists and officials have been engaging in a campaign the past two days accusing foreign journalists of being spies or , in particular , `` Israeli spies , '' the committee said . In one instance , a woman whose face was obscured `` confessed '' to having been trained by `` Americans and Israelis '' in Qatar , where Al-Jazeera is based , the committee said . NPR journalist Lourdes Garcia-Navarro and her Egyptian-American colleague Ashraf Khalil , provided a typical account Thursday of how routine street reporting quickly turned in a thuggish assault on them . While interviewing a taxi driver about food , money and security in a middle-class neighborhood across the river and a good distance from the often-violent Tahrir Square , at least a dozen men suddenly surrounded them , Garcia-Navarro said on the NPR website . They asked for IDs and whether they were Israeli spies or worked for Al-Jazeera , an Arabic-language media outlet whose extensive coverage has angered the Mubarak regime . The men surrounded Garcia-Navarro in her car and repeatedly punched Khalil in the face . After 10 minutes , the army showed up , calmed the mob and protected the journalists . `` What happened today -- I 've lived here on and off since 1997 -- I did not think they had it in them , this kind of violent paranoia and xenophobia , '' journalist Khalil said . `` I 've never seen Egypt like this . '' The attacks against reporters targeted some of the most prominent news organizations in the Western and Arab worlds alike . The Al-Jazeera network said Friday that a `` gang of thugs '' stormed its Cairo office and burned the facility and the equipment there . Al-Jazeera said that over the past week `` its bureau was forcibly closed , all its journalists had press credentials revoked , and nine journalists were detained at various stages . '' The network said it `` faced unprecedented levels of interference in its broadcast signal as well as persistent and repeated attempts to bring down its websites . '' Like other networks , Al-Jazeera said it wo n't let such obstacles stop it from gathering news . `` We are grateful for the support we have received from across the world for our coverage in Egypt and can assure everyone that we will continue our work undeterred , '' a network spokesman said . Meanwhile , the French Foreign Ministry said it has had no word on the whereabouts of three French journalists and a French researcher in Egypt . The journalists work for Le Figaro newspaper and Magneto Presse , and the researcher is employed by Amnesty International , it said . A prominent blogger , Wael Abbas , said a group of people who said they thought he was a foreigner detained him Friday afternoon . They turned him over to the military , which released him , he said . And the Egyptian military secured 18 journalists who were captured by thugs and took them to a `` safe place , '' Egyptian state media reported Friday . It was unclear which news organizations the journalists worked for or where they had been taken . CNN could not independently confirm the report . Journalists attempting to cover unrest in Egypt have reported being beaten , arrested and harassed by security forces and police Thursday , leading to sharply limited television coverage of the protests . Along with Al-Jazeera , other news outlets -- including the BBC , Al-Arabiya , ABC News , the Washington Post , Fox News , and CNN -- said members of their staffs had been attacked or otherwise targeted . Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch also reported that staffers were detained . U.S. State Department officials told CNN earlier that they had information that Egypt 's Interior Ministry was behind the journalist detentions , citing reports from the U.S. Embassy in Egypt . `` The threats to journalists on the street were explicit , and increasing . We pulled back accordingly to protect our people , '' said CNN Executive Vice President Tony Maddox . The Islamist group Muslim Brotherhood reported that its website office was stormed Friday by security forces , who arrested `` the journalists , the technicians and the administrators '' in the office . A `` gang of thugs '' accompanied the forces , the Muslim Brotherhood said . Some of those individuals were later seen being taken near the Interior Ministry headquarters , the website said .

'' The central Cairo plaza transformed from a bloody battleground to the scene of a largely peaceful political rally dubbed `` Day of Departure '' as Egyptians gave embattled President Hosni Mubarak until the end of the day to relinquish power . Protesters did not get their wish and thousands remained in the square well into the night , defying a curfew that has been widely ignored . Heavy gunfire was heard in and around Tahrir Square . Among the demonstrators were the secretary-general of the Arab League and the spokesman for the largest center of Sunni Muslim learning , two men representing pillars of authority . Attempts to defuse the crisis , meanwhile , were halting but ongoing . Government brass had signaled a wish to meet with opposition leaders but those talks have not yet gained traction , a senior U.S. official told CNN Friday .

The president must go , '' said Mohammed Habib , deputy chairman of the Muslim Brotherhood , an opposition Islamist group officially banned by the government . Some opposition parties that had previously refused to meet with government officials , however , told CNN Friday they have agreed to meet with Suleiman on Saturday . Refat Said , head of the left-leaning Tagammuparty , said his group will meet with the vice president , as will the liberal Wafd party . Ayman Nour , head of the al-Ghad party , said members of his group will decide soon on whether they will accept the government 's invitation to meet . `` Based on promises that the government gave us that they will investigate into the Tahrir Square clashes , we agreed to meet tomorrow , '' said Fouad Badrawi , secretary-general of the Wafd party . And 19 men , including veteran diplomat Amre Moussa , have formed a so-called `` Committee of the Wise '' in a bid to calm the crisis . The group of independents , which wants to be at the table during crucial government talks , has called for Mubarak to remain as a symbolic leader and to delegate to Suleiman responsibility for the transition period . Day 11 of the uprising was mostly jubilant in Cairo 's downtown square , but tensions remained high . In another plaza just half a kilometer away from Tahrir Square , supporters and foes of Mubarak fought running street battles . Youths wielding sticks and rocks engaged in fights and the sound of gunfire rang out . The Muslim Brotherhood reported that a security force accompanied by a `` gang of thugs '' stormed the office of its news website Friday and arrested the journalists , technicians and administrators . The satellite news network Al-Jazeera reported a similar attack on its Cairo office . Those attacks came after two days of violence and a government crackdown on journalists and human rights activists bearing witness to the crisis . Some had predicted the demonstrations might lose their momentum . That was hardly the case as anti-government protesters jammed TahrirSquare chanting slogans like `` He leaves , we do n't leave '' and `` The blood of the martyrs will not be forgotten . '' A massive banner in the middle of the square said in English : `` The people demand the removal of the regime . '' The demonstrators built a barbed-wire barricade and stacked piles of rocks throughout the square , surrounded Friday by soldiers in riot gear and tanks . Volunteers checked identification cards of people entering the square and searched them for weapons . Others stood by with emergency medical kits . Large screens showed coverage of the demonstrations on state television and Al-Jazeera as people played music , sang patriotic songs and danced . A man with an Egyptian flag wrapped around his head sat on a curb , flashing a victory sign . It was a remarkable change from the scenes that unfolded in the square Wednesday and Thursday when pro- and anti-Mubarak supporters clashed repeatedly , leaving at least 11 people dead and more than 900 others injured . Journalists , citizens attacked in Egypt Who is instigating the Cairo violence ? The Health Ministry reported that at least 5,000 people have been injured since the demonstrations began in Egypt early last week . Many believe the violent clashes were orchestrated by the embattled regime and on Friday , the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights called for a `` transparent and impartial '' probe . But defenders of Mubarak were notably absent from the square Friday . Instead , they staged a `` Day of Loyalty '' rally at a nearby mosque . Mubarak has said he will not seek another term in the September election , but now faces increasing pressure from the United States and other world powers to step aside much sooner . U.S. President Barack Obama skirted the question of whether Mubarak should resign immediately Friday , saying instead that the `` key question '' the Egyptian president should be asking himself is `` how do I leave a legacy behind '' that helps Egypt get through the current transition . `` There needs to be a transition process that begins now . That transition must initiate a process that respects the universal rights of the Egyptian people and that leads to free and fair elections , '' Obama said . Later , a senior U.S. official said that Obama 's remarks reflected the fact that the United States recognizes that certain legitimate legislative hurdles must be taken care of before Mubarak steps down . While pressing for Mubarak to act quickly , the U.S. official said the White House recognizes the process will take some time . The Obama administration is hopeful negotiations will begin Saturday between members of Mubarak 's government and various opposition representatives , the senior U.S. official said . Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq told the Al-Arabiya network that it would take until September to work out constitutional issues so that a new government could come to power . At this juncture , said Shafiq , compromises were key as the country pursues dialogue with opposition groups . Opposition leader ElBaradei told CNN 's Eliot Spitzer late Friday that he has been in contact with various parties , united in their belief that Mubarak must go . `` We have been in agreement right now that we 'd probably have a presidential council of three members including somebody from the army . We have a caretaker government ... who would then run the country for a year , prepare the grounds for the necessary changes in the electoral process to ensure that we will have all what we need for a free and fair election , '' he said . ElBaradei did not rule out the possibility of his running for president . The thirst for immediate change was evident as rallies took place in several Egyptian cities . In Alexandria , thousands made their way from the city 's central mosque down the wide seaside Corniche . `` This is a great revolution and the whole regime , the entire system needs to be changed . The revolution must continue until all objectives are met , '' the mosque 's imam told the crowd . Writing on the walls leading to the mosque , where police and anti-government demonstrators clashed last Friday , said `` Game OVER '' and `` Pharaoh 's last day . '' Roughly 35,000 people took to the streets Friday in the city of Suez , a spokesman for opposition leader Ayman Nour told CNN . Among the protesters in Cairo was Moussa , the Arab League 's secretary-general , and Muhammad Rifaa al-Tahtawi , spokesman for Al-Azhar University , the prestigious center for Sunni Muslim education . Al-Tahtawi told CNN he resigned from his Al-Azhar position and joined the anti-government protesters in Tahrir Square . `` I am against the regime . And I am supporting the revolution , '' he said . Mubarak told ABC News Thursday that he would like to step down right away , but can not because he does not want to risk plunging his nation into chaos . `` I do n't care what people say about me , '' Mubarak told ABC . `` Right now I care about my country , I care about Egypt . `` I was very unhappy about yesterday . I do not want to see Egyptians fighting each other , '' he said in the interview conducted at the heavily guarded presidential palace , where the embattled leader has been staying with his family . He accused the Muslim Brotherhood for instigating the violence , while his deputy also laid blame on the media . `` I actually blame certain friendly nations who have television channels , they are not friendly at all , who have intensified the youth against the nation and the state , '' Suleiman said on Nile TV . `` They have filled in the minds of the youth with wrongdoings , with allegations , and this is unacceptable . '' The government cracked down Thursday , arresting and beating journalists and human rights workers documenting events . The harassment continued Friday with the storming of Al-Jazeera 's office in Cairo . The network reported its office was attacked and burned by `` gangs of thugs . '' In the last week its bureau was forcibly closed , all its journalists had press credentials revoked , and nine journalists were detained at various stages . Al-Jazeera has also faced unprecedented levels of interference in its broadcast signal as well as persistent and repeated attempts to bring down its websites , the network said . Late Friday , Human Rights Watch , a rights organization , said that Egyptian authorities had released researchers from its group , Amnesty International and two foreign journalists . It called on officials to also free its Egyptian colleagues , who it says are still detained . `` Why does n't the government want us around ? '' asked New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof , `` What is it that it plans to do in the next few days that it really does n't want cameras to be able to report on ? '' The Committee to Protect Journalists , a New York-based advocacy organization , said Friday it has documented at least 101 attacks on journalists and news facilities this week . The advocacy group cited numerous media reports claiming that Ahmad Mohamed Mahmoud , a journalist working for the newspaper Al-Ta ` awun , had died of wounds suffered while filming the protests . White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said the administration continues `` to receive very disturbing reports '' of `` systematic targeting '' of journalists in Egypt . Appalled by the attacks , U.S. officials encouraged Mubarak 's government to plan a path out of power . Vice President Joe Biden urged his Egyptian counterpart to ensure that `` credible , inclusive negotiations begin immediately '' with opposition political groups to expedite the creation of a new democratic government , according to a statement from Biden 's office . The U.S. Senate , meanwhile approved a resolution calling for Mubarak to immediately begin a peaceful transition and transfer power to a caretaker government . CNN 's Amir Ahmed , Ivan Watson , Jill Dougherty , Nic Robertson , Saad Abedine and journalist Ian Lee contributed to this report .

The men entered the crowd -- enough people to fill three small city blocks -- in the West Bank city of Ramallah chanting `` The people want Mahmoud Abbas , '' a reference to the Palestinian Authority president . Tensions quickly escalated and several fistfights broke out between the demonstrators and those who were seeking to disrupt the gathering . At least two people were injured . One of the demonstrators , Jamal Tamimi , a professor at Al-Quds University and a member of the president 's Fatah party , criticised what he called a government-sanctioned crackdown on free speech . `` These security measurements are against democracy , this is a security regime , '' said Tamimi .

This is something that does not belong to the Palestinian culture , and Abbas should see what is going on here . '' A spokesman for the Palestinian Authority security services , Maj. Gen.

This demonstration had all the permits needed , and it is our duty as the Palestinian security to protect the demonstration , which the police and the security did . Our duty is to protect and serve the people . '' The afternoon demonstration against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was joined by Palestinians of all ages .

This is his account of a frightening encounter he and his crew had with a menacing crowd on the increasingly chaotic streets of Alexandria . Alexandria , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The longest walk is when you do n't know where it will end . The longest minute is when you are worried about what 's coming . In Alexandria , both are in easy reach . Two hundred yards , that 's all that separated us from thousands of chanting demonstrators . They 'd been marching all afternoon listening to calls of solidarity . Now it was night , rain was falling and stragglers were leaving toward us . As we walked toward them , the dark , gaping , cavernous sidestreets were oozing menacing , stick-wielding men . Makeshift power lines sagged between the aging apartment blocks . CNN ordered not to film Egypt protests A trip outside of Cairo 's Tahrir square Americans getting out of Egypt First they were calling us , then grabbing , demanding passports . The men with the sticks were swarming us . The men escorting us were telling us to be calm not to worry . Our passports were taken , inspected and handed back . That 's when the confusion began . Who were we , why were there . Within the past few days , state media has raised paranoia to fever pitch . Always wary of outsiders ' intentions , the government is succeeding in dividing protesters . Not just for and against the government but over the very nature and portrayal of the uprising . They are trying every means to break unity . We 'd come with a group organizing the anti-Mubarak protest we wanted to cover . We were driven on the dark streets past checkpoints manned partly by soccer-playing boys , partly by soldiers and partly by what looked like the same stick-wielding , marauding men crowding around us now . More of them were closing in now . The tiny gaggle around us was swelling and seething . Everyone passing by was drawn to the drama that was becoming our inquisition . Everyone wanted a say , everyone looking to get involved , take sides , take charge , make a decision . We should have an official government paper , an angry man in the black leather jacket was shouting . It was becoming chaotic . Everyone had an opinion . Division and disorder were rampant , people pushing and shoving , our guides apologizing . No one person in charge . The police are gone , the army guard their bases and government property . The streets at night belong to the strong , a sort of semi-self-regulating anarchy rules . As suddenly as he stopped us , the man in the leather jacket let us go . Hands placed on our backs , we were pushed onward toward the demonstrators . He had given in to the crowd , been pushed down , persuaded we had a right to cover the protest . For a few moments , we were free . Then we heard his voice again , shouting behind us . This time he had others with him , leather-covered sticks embedded with brass nailheads in their hands . Now he was determined . Now the angry in the crowd outnumbered the apologetic . Now the minute began and so did the walk . He told us we were being taken away to `` another place . '' The shouting was reaching fever pitch , people grappling with one another , we were being spun around . My cameraman , Todd Baxter , and I were being separated from our producer , Saad Abedine , and Alexandria fixer Mohammed . The hands were pushing us the other way now . We were spies , the man in the leather jacket was shouting . Impossible to know where we were being taken . He kept marching us down the street , his henchmen at his heel . We tried to slow and move to our car at the roadside . To my dismay and concern , our driver was gone . That was my hope blown , any chance of a run for it gone . And still no idea where we were being taken . Our unintended escort was telling us we were to blame for portraying Egypt in a bad light . We were bringing the image of the country down . It 's a fuzzy logic that defies the obvious . What 's happening is willed by Egyptians on their own countrymen . He was n't listening . No punches were being laid , but the menace was clear . The walk ended at the army base . The crowd circling , still pushing , shoving , shouting . The soldiers cut through the chaos and took us in . It was as night turning to day . They were polite , organized , calm and courteous . They took a cursory glance at our passports and camera , let us wait behind their heavy gate until the crowd moved on . It 's chaos out there , and they know it .

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , speaking at the Munich Security Conference , urged support for the man Mubarak named to carry out that transition , Vice President Omar Suleiman . `` There are forces in at work in any society , '' Clinton said , `` in particular in one that is facing these kinds of challenges , who will try to derail or overtake the process to pursue their own specific agenda , which is why I think it 's important to support the transition process announced by the Egyptian government actually headed by now-Vice President Omar Suleiman . '' -LRB- Update 1:15 a.m. in Cairo , 6:15 p.m. ET -RRB- U.S. President Barack Obama emphasized the importance of an `` orderly , peaceful transition '' to a government that is `` responsive to the aspirations of the Egyptian people .

'' -LRB- Update 10:45 p.m. in Cairo , 3:45 p.m. ET -RRB- Anti-government rallies outside of Egypt continued Saturday in major cities worldwide , including New York , Washington , Atlanta , Paris , France , and the West Bank . In Washington , iReporter Inga Lukaviciute captured video of a group of loud but peaceful protesters carrying signs and Egyptians flags as they marched from the Egyptian embassy to the White House chanting anti-Mubarak slogans . Check out a complete timeline of the unrest in Egypt . It 's been almost two weeks since 20,000 protesters spilled into the streets of Cairo in an unprecedented display of anti-government rage , inspired in part by revolts in Tunisia that forced the collapse of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 's 23-year rule . Organizers of the January 25 protests that triggered the unrest chose that day - Police Day - to highlight the role of police corruption in addition to frustrations over the rising cost of living and failed economic policies . But all those concerns were distilled into one overriding demand : the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak , who has survived would-be assassins and illness , crushed a rising Islamist radical movement and maintained the peace with neighboring Israel that got his predecessor killed to rule Egypt for three decades . -LRB- More on Mubarak 's reign -RRB- Initially , it appeared that Mubarak had no intention of abandoning his post . Over time , he has taken steps that appear to some as gradual steps toward relinquishing power , and to others , mere gestures . Below we chart the major events in the apparent tide of transition : Mother Nature smiled Saturday on ice-weary metro Dallas residents and Super Bowl visitors , providing sunny skies and snow-melting temperatures in the lower 50s . After four days of often-miserable driving conditions and closed schools and offices , millions were out and about , shaking off cabin fever and stocking up for the nation 's annual ode to football , food and fun advertising . `` We are so thankful , '' said Tiara Ellis Richard , media relations coordinator for the Arlington Police Department and a member of a joint public safety task force established for the Super Bowl . Sunday will be cloudy and chillier , with a chance of a rain and snow mix by Sunday evening 's kickoff , but it should n't be that big a deal , CNN forecasters said . Very light accumulations of snow are possible on grass and elevated surfaces . The lawyer representing two U.S. hikers jailed in Iran has been denied a request to visit his clients on the eve of their trial for allegedly trespassing into the country , he told CNN on Saturday . `` I asked to see them before the trial , but the judge told me I could n't , '' said Masoud Shafii . The judge has granted Shafii permission to visit Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal for a few hours on Sunday prior to the start of the trial , Shafii said . Bauer , 28 , Fattal , 28 , and Sarah Shourd , 32 , were detained July 31 , 2009 , after they allegedly strayed across an unmarked border into Iran while hiking in Iraq 's Kurdistan region . Prosecutors in Iran have charged them with spying and trespassing . Last September , Iranian authorities released Shourd , on bail because of a medical condition . Shourd has not responded to a court summons this week to return and stand trial on Sunday , Shafii said . Iranian authorities said she will be tried in absentia if she does n't appear in court . Human rights groups have condemned their arrests and their lengthy wait for a trial in Iran 's notorious Evin prison .

RANDI KAYE , CNN ANCHOR : Good morning . A quite morning so far in Tahrir Square , as hundreds gather for Muslim prayers and protesters dig in for Day 13 . In Iran , the trial of three U.S. hikers now under way , all accused of spying and trespassing . And paying tribute to Ronald Reagan . He would have been 100 years old today . Events across the country will honor his life and legacy . We 'll take you there . It 's early and we 're on it . From CNN Center , this is CNN SUNDAY MORNING . It 's February 6 . Good morning , everyone . Glad you 're with us . I 'm Randi Kaye . It 's 6 a.m. on the East Coast and 1 p.m. in Egypt . We want to give a special welcome now to our troops watching us on Armed Forces Network . We start with Egypt , where it 's the start of the workweek . And for the first time in more than a week , some banks in Cairo are open . They had closed at the height of the anti-government protests . The stock market remains closed . Also today , leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood group are expected to meet with Egypt 's new vice president . Brotherhood members originally said they would not talk until President Mubarak was out of office . VP Omar Suleiman met with other opposition leaders yesterday . Suleiman also got a call from his American counterpart , Joe Biden . They talked about the transition and the need for a concrete plan . Biden also set a clear timeline is needed . We 've also seen some high-level shuffling in Egypt 's ruling political party . Several leaders handed in their resignations , including one of President Mubarak 's sons . While some of the banks are reopening in Cairo , life is n't exactly back to normal . Protesters are gathered in the city 's main square for the 13th straight day . CNN 's Ivan Watson joins me live now from Cairo . Ivan , I understand that the Coptic Christians are expected to be gathering in the square today to show their support for the protesters . Have you seen any sign of this ? IVAN WATSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : That 's right . We saw Muslims and Christians holding hands together upfront at the stage and hold side by side , Randi , a cross and a copy of the Quran in a show of brotherhood here . We 've also just had some evangelical Egyptian Christians playing music on the stage . And that was moments after hundreds of Muslim Christians prayed on the asphalt . And that 's a big deal in a country where just about a month - a little bit more than a month ago , there were some bloody tensions between Muslims and Christians erupting in different parts of the country . Now , we 've heard that one of the main opposition parties , Randi , the Muslim Brotherhood , has said it is willing to sit down now and engaged in a dialogue with the new vice president , Omar Suleiman . Meanwhile , the demonstrations continue here , and there 's a new twist that 's emerged since yesterday : All night last night , some of the demonstrators , scores of them , sat outside the barricades that really protect this enclave here in the heart of Cairo - they sat with campfires making a human chair to prevent the Egyptian military from being able to come in . We saw a standoff earlier yesterday where two tanks were approaching . They are putting their lives on the line , and they do not trust the Egyptian military to come in in large numbers . They say they do not want them to push this demonstration out of Tahrir Square . Take a listen to what one man had to say to us . WATSON : And you can see there , people sitting around - and they 're still doing that now - around an armored personnel carrier . They do not want it to be able to move . Why some of the distrust ? Well , one argument might be that the Egyptian military police is one of the secret police - plainclothes police organizations that has been involved in a number of the tensions of journalists and aid workers and human-right workers around Cairo in recent days . I 've talked to at least four or five people who say they have been detained by the military police . Some of these people saying they 've been blindfolded and handcuffed , taken in for hours of interrogation . And that 's despite the fact that a spokesman for the interior minister recently claimed in a press conference that the military will remain neutral in this standoff between Hosni Mubarak and the demonstrators here in Tahrir Square - Randi . KAYE : All right . Our Ivan Watson for us there in Cairo . And I 'll tell you , take a look at those crowds , and you 'd think after - what ? - Day 13 now , the protesters might be feeling a little bit defeated . But you just look at those crowds , and it seems as though more and more protesters are making their way today to Liberation Square . Ivan , we 'll check back with you later on . Before Egypt erupted , the anti-government protests brought change in Tunisia . But new demonstrations there have now turned deadly . Two people were killed and more than a dozen others were injured when police fired shots into the crowd . Protesters threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at a police station in the northern city of El Kef . Tunisia 's president fled after protests last month . It 's not clear exactly what sparked these new demonstrations . Iraq 's prime minister is n't wasting any time announcing his political intentions . Nouri al-Maliki now says he wo n't run for a third term as Iraq 's leader . He has another three years left in his current term , Al-Maliki also says he 'll back a term-limit amendment to Iraq 's constitution . Time for our `` Weekend Wheel , '' a look at other news you need to know as you get started this Sunday morning . Check out this police stop of a suspected drunk driver in Frankfort , Kentucky . This is from a gas-station surveillance video . That 's Office Brian Redman -LRB- ph -RRB- there in his car . You can see him trying to get the driver to stop . But that 's not exactly happening . The officer was injured . The driver was later found arrested - and he was arrested later on and has a court appearance tomorrow . The officer is recovering at home . Some restaurants in Southern California are being warned that their ground beef could make customers sick . The beef shipped to those restaurants by one California company may be contaminated with E. coli bacteria . We 're talking about 3,000 pounds of hamburger patties and other products . We have n't heard of any reports of people getting sick from that bad beef . Two American hikers are on trial today in Iran for spying and trespassing . Shane Bauer , Josh Fattal and Sarah Shourd were detained in the summer of 2009 after they allegedly strayed across an unmarked border from Iraq into Iran . Shourd was released last fall because of a medical condition . She did not return for the trial . Well , as if I really need to remind you that the Super Bowl is today . The Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers will battle it out in Arlington , Texas . For your planning purposes , kickoff is at 6:29 p.m. Eastern time . More than 90 million people are expected to tune in . But many are n't really watching the game ; they want to see the commercials , and of course the halftime show . This year , is the Black Eyed Peas . I. AM , BLACK EYED PEAS : We were inspired by the Olympics in China , where everyone came together as - as one . And I do n't want to give too much , but it 's - it 's to that level . Last year 's Super Bowl actually set a record with more than 106 million people watching . Former Vice President Dick Cheney is remembering the legacy of former President Ronald Reagan . Today would have been the Great Communicator 100th birthday . DICK CHENEY -LRB- R -RRB- , FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA : When all of us think back to Ronald Reagan and try to sum up all that he was and all that he accomplished , ` thank you ' is still a pretty good place to start . We associate idealism with youth . But the oldest man ever elected president was also the most idealistic . And he brought out that quality in the American people . He inspired the kind of affection that even great men can not claim by right , but goes only to the truly good . KAYE : California Governor Jerry Brown has declared today Ronald Reagan Centennial Day . If you wanted to preorder the iPhone 4 from Verizon , well , forget about it . Verizon sold out of its preorder iPhones in less than a single day . It had expected to take preorders right up to Thursday 's launch date , when the iPhones will be in stores . Verizon says there will be one more presale starting - mark your calendars - at 3:01 a.m. - 3:01 a.m. Eastern - on Wednesday morning . So set your alarms . It seems like Lindsay Lohan just can not keep herself out of trouble .

Lohan 's lawyers says his client did not do anything wrong . The 24-year-old actress is already on probation in a drunk-driving case . It is a good thing the Super Bowl will be played under a dome because the weather in Dallas has been downright dreadful . Will it finally warm up for the fans to come out and play ? Plus , how long will Christina Aguilera hold that last note when she sings the national anthem at Saturday 's Super Bowl . Millions of dollars could be riding on it . Got snow , like they did earlier this week in Dallas ? Well , what do you do ? You build an igloo . That ' exactly what Jon Kettles did . He credits his Canadian family for teaching him the fine art of melting and refreezing snow to build this . How cute is that ? One hundred snow block sin all went into constructing it . His son and daughter selling hot chocolate for a buck . That 's a very unique hot - chocolate stand . The igloo chimney and all is the hit of the neighborhood , as you can imagine . KAYE : Are you willing to take a gamble this weekend ? Experts figure about $ 10 billion will be bet on Sunday 's Super Bowl . And half those wagers will have absolutely nothing to do with point spreads or even football . They 'll be propositions bets . For example , you can place a wager on how many times the Fox announcers will mention former Packer Brett Favre 's name . The over - under there is two-and-a-half . Or , who will the Super Bowl MVP thank first after the game ? His coach , 10-to-1 odds . His family , 4-to-1 odds . He 's actually a 3-to-2 favorite . You can even bet on how long it will take for Christina Aguilera to sing the national anthem . The over-under is one minute , 54 seconds . Or maybe even how long she 'll hold that final note . The over-under there is six seconds , a bet comedian Jimmy Kimmel may be planning to place . JIMMY KIMMEL , COMEDIAN : I am going with the under . I 'm going under six seconds . I think she 's going to do it under ... KIMMEL : Almost every person I talk to thinks she 'll go longer to show off because it 's the Super Bowl . But I say , no , I do n't think Christina Aguilera is a showoff . Do you hear that Christina ? I do n't think you 're a showoff . And only a showoff would sing the word `` brave '' for more than six seconds . -LRB- END VIDEO CLIP -RRB- KAYE : Seems like he 's up to no-good there . So that 's how the Super Bowl can actually change your personal finances . But what about the overall impact of the big game ? The numbers are actually staggering . CNN 's Jason Carroll takes a look . JASON CARROLL , CNN CORRESPONDENT : You ca n't talk about football without throwing in a few interesting stats . Here 's the bottom line : More and more out there are watching . This past season was a runaway hit . Each game had almost 18 million people watching . And if you just look at Super Bowl viewing , the audience has quadrupled since the mid-1960s . Last year , over 160 - 106 million people watched , making it the most-viewed TV event in history . All that popularity coming at a high cost . This year 's Super Bowl ads run $ 3 million for a 30-second spot . Well , apparently , it 's worth it . Advertisers know they can reach out not only to a large number of men , but women , too , who are now watching in higher numbers . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : It 's a social thing , and you want to be involved in a social thing . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Because of very attractive football players like Miles Austin . You know , it 's a Sunday thing . It 's definitely like an American sport . CARROLL : So what 's behind all the football fever ? It goes beyond the Bowl . Take a listen to one expert . MARK WALLER , NFL 'S CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER : There 's now in - in this country and around the world so little that people can huddle around and - and are kind of word is , it 's America 's last campfire . LINDA KAPLAN THALER , MARKETING EXPERT : This is an event that everybody is part of , and you 're not - you 're not going to watch a - you know , you 're not going to DVR it . That 's - you know , it 's going to - it 's very , very immediate . CARROLL : Well , some companies do n't even need to buy a Super Bowl ad in order to cash in on the day . Sunday is traditionally one of the busiest pizza-buying days of the year , along with the day before Thanksgiving and New Year 's Day . Retailers also looking for a Super Bowl bounce in flat-screen TV sales in anticipation for the big day . KAYE : Jason mentioned that last year 's Super Bowl broke the record for most-watched TV show in history . So what show held the old record ? The answer coming your way in just 90 seconds . KAYE : Before the break , we asked you what show was knocked off the most-watched list by last year 's Super Bowl . Well , the answer is `` M \\* A \\* S \\* H. '' The finale of the long-running series was watched by more than 105 million people . The Super Bowl beat it by around a half a million viewers . And just for fun , we threw in the numbers for the No. 2 most - watched Super Bowl . Time now to go cross country and see some of the stories our CNN affiliates are covering .

Twenty-two minutes past the hour . People in the United States are showing their support for the people of Egypt . Supporters gathered outside the White House , in New York City and here in Atlanta . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Down , down with Mubarak ! DON LEMON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : While most of the protests last week were focused on Mubarak , this week they 're focusing on this : `` Egypt means Muslims and Christians , '' meaning unity among people who had once been separated . Why are you passionate about this ? The Christians are protecting us in Tahrir Square . -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- Christians and Muslim in Egypt is one -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- , not two . LEMON : People would say , Why is a 10-year-old out here ? Every age should have equal rights , no matter how small or old you are . CROWD : Down , down with Mubarak ! Down , down with Mubarak ! UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I want to tell all Americans that if you 're for freedom , if you 're for democracy , get out here . They deserve freedom just as much as anyone else . And please , please , President Obama - I know you have the power to get him down . So just tell him that he needs to go . SANDRA ENDO , CNN CORRESPONDENT : The protesters here are energized . They are in front of the White House that they say they want change . They are calling for President Mubarak immediately . They also had this message for President Obama : UNIDENTIFIED MALE : The message to the White House and especially to Obama : Just supporting , like , dictatorship and let people live free . And do n't ever , every like , you know , dictator to implement , you know , injustice in the world . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : We 're mainly out here to support the Egyptian people back home . I know they 're dying every single day for their freedom . I 'm just hoping that they will stay calm and stay united and not go off in a civil war or anything . And just stay strong . Things are happening slowly , but we 'll definitely get our freedom very soon . ENDO : Now , this is one of many protests that have been held for days now in solidarity with Egypt . And protesters here say they will not stop getting their message out until there 's actual change . SUSAN CANDIOTTI , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Randi , about 100 people or so gathered out in front of the United Nations for the second time in as many weeks here , protesting the current government in Egypt and calling for President Mubarak to step down . There were fewer people here than last week . But those who were here were just as committed . Their message is simple . They said , for example : The number of people that have resigned from the national ruling party does n't matter . They call it purely a cosmetic change . The real change , they say , can only come if President Mubarak leaves . They are vowing to be back here again next week and in the coming weeks until he steps down - Randi . KAYE : As you just heard , many people are calling on President Obama to take a stronger stance against Mubarak . But here 's why the tensions in Egypt have the president between a rock and a hard place . The United States has strongly supported the Mubarak government since he took office nearly three decades ago . And in return , Egypt has been America 's most reliable ally in the Arab world . So this crisis has been difficult for the Obama administration to navigate . Our Suzanne Malveaux has more . SUZANNE MALVEAUX , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : The assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat ushered in a new era of U.S. relations with Egypt . Radical Muslims , threatened by Egypt 's peace with Israel , took out Sadat . The U.S. , desperate to protect Israel and eager to keep its most important Arab ally embraced Egypt 's new leader , Hosni Mubarak . That was October 1981 . The U.S. has held on to Mubarak as a critical friend ever since despite his autocratic rule and documented human-rights abuses . Egypt 's alliance with Israel is at the heart of the U.S. ' alliance with Mubarak . The Egyptian leader has steadfastly supported numerous attempts by several American presidents to establish peace between the Israelis and Palestinians . HOSNI MUBARAK , PRESIDENT OF EGYPT : The exercise of the right to self determination can not be denied to the Palestinian people . MALVEAUX : Mubarak also gave President George H.W. Bush the troops he need for the 1991 Persian Gulf War . Mubarak 's cooperation with the U.S. in taking on terrorists , including al-Qaeda , has often made Egypt a target of their rage . In 1997 , radicals killed dozens of tourists in Luxor and struck again in 2005 in the resort enclave of Sharm El Sheikh , slaughtering 88 people . Mubarak has tried to moderate Hamas and keep radical Islamic groups at bay , ruling with an iron fist . His cooperation with President George W. Bush 's war on terror became even more crucial after the September 11 attacks . Oil also plays a critical role . While Egypt is neither a major oil producer nor a consumer , the Suez Canal , which cuts through the country , is a vital waterway that keeps oil from the Arab region flowing to the west . KAYE : At a meeting of security officials in Munich , Germany , yesterday , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton backed the transition to a new government . She said the region - quote - `` is being battered by a perfect storm of powerful trends . Leaders can hold back the tide for a little while , but not for long , '' she said . For troops deployed overseas , today is one of the most anticipated days of the years : Super Bowl Sunday . Over 100,000 pounds of chicken wings and thousands of pizzas on the way to Iraq and Afghanistan for the big game . We 're going to take you there live next . KAYE : Welcome back , everyone . I ' Randi Kaye . It 's half past the hour . In Egypt today , the man put in charge of the government 's transition is meeting again with opposition leaders . Vice President Omar Suleiman is talking with leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood . The Muslim Brotherhood is one of the highest profile opposition groups . They had originally said they would not negotiate until president Mubarak resigned . But the group 's spokesman now tells CNN that they have decided to take the people 's demands to the negotiating table . As millions protest in Egypt and around the world , one very key element is missing , solidarity . The fragmented opposition agrees on one thing , Mubarak must go , but there is no clear leader is pulling them together . CNN 's Fred Pleitgen takes a look at what might happen if Mubarak does step down . FRED PLEITGEN , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- voice over -RRB- : Roaring speeches and cheering crowds . Change is in the air in Cairo 's Tahrir Square . Abu Elezz Harari is a leftist politician with a large following , but says he 's not willing to step up and lead anti-government protesters . ABU ELEZZ HARARI , EGYPTIAN OPPOSITION POLITICIAN -LRB- through translator -RRB- : We have not chosen a leader yet . There is a group that represents the people that can lead in the transitional period , and then the people will choose a president and a government . PLEITGEN : Former IAEA Chief Mohamed ElBaradei is part of the group , and so is Amir Mousa , the head of the Arab League . But many of those who have battling on the front lines for over a week do n't want anyone representing them . This belongs on our shoulders . It 's grown up on our shoulders . It belongs to the people , the youngest people . This is our revolution , not belong to them . Understand me or no ? PLEITGEN -LRB- on camera -RRB- : Yes , but what about Mohamed ElBaradei , Amir Mousa ? We want Mubarak to move out . PLEITGEN : The protesters here have sacrificed a lot and they 've achieved a lot . However , Hosni Mubarak still remains in power and the opposition has yet to offer an alternative . -LRB- Voice over -RRB- : The conservative Islamic Muslim Brotherhood is the largest opposition movement in Egypt . But although their members are taking a leading role in the protests , they say they will not put up a presidential candidate . MOHAMMED BELTAGY , MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD : Our society activities , but no presidential candidate . PLEITGEN -LRB- voice over -RRB- : Several leaders of the established opposition parties have been negotiating with Omar Suleiman , the newly appointed Egyptian vice president . One of those who took part says the talks are in a stalemate . MUNIR FAKHRI , WAFD PARTY LEADER : As long as the protesters are not ready to lower the level of their demands , very bluntly , their demands is that President Mubarak leaves , quits . And as long as the regime refuses to take steps towards meeting at least part of those demands , I think it 's very difficult to reach a compromise . PLEITGEN : Without a leading figure in the anti-government movement , many fear Egypt could remain in a state of paralysis for months . Protesters entrenched in Tahrir Square , Hosni Mubarak clinging to power , and a nation on the brink of chaos . Fred Pleitgen , CNN , Cairo , Egypt . -LRB- END VIDEOTAPE -RRB- KAYE : Checking top stories for you now . Former Vice President Dick Cheney is calling embattled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak a , quote , `` good friend and ally , '' but he is not predicting whether Mubarak will step down . Cheney says despite pundits and politicians , Egyptians will decide their own fate . DICK CHENEY , FMR . VICE PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES : I think it is important for us all to remember that this issue will be resolved by the Egyptians . You know , there 's a lot of people with opinions outside of the government . Commentators on the cable news shows , but bottom line in the end , whatever comes next in Egypt will be determined by the people of Egypt . And we need to remember that .

Who would you like to see win the big one ? CMDR. KEITH STEUSSI , U.S. NAVY , AFGHANISTAN : Well , I think this hat says it all . I -- I 'm a huge Packer fan . Grew up in Wisconsin . And we were talking before you came on that I 'm predicting the Packers are going to win 24-23 on a last-minute drive by Aaron Rodgers , maybe you know , 10 , 15 seconds left . That 's how it will end up . KAYE : And Captain Armstrong , I believe have you a different view how this is going to turn out ? CAPT. SARAH ARMSTRONG , U.S. ARMY , AFGHANISTAN : I do have a very different view . I see the Steelers winning their -- the Super Bowl . It 's going to be close I think , but I definitely think the Steelers have it in them to win this one . KAYE : I think the game is on in the middle of the night for both of you . So , Commander , what is your plan to watch the game ? Anything set up for you ? STEUSSI : Yeah , well , we -- I run a clinic over here , and we have a pretty large sized TV in our conference room , so I 've got about 10 to 15 friends who will be coming over and we 'll watch the game there . So it should be a lot of fun . KAYE : And , Captain , what 's it like . Help us to understand what it 's like to watch your favorite team play halfway across the world , while serving your country ? It 's a great experience , and it really brings me close to home because I get to experience something with my family back in western Pennsylvania and really cheer for the home team . KAYE : I do n't see your Steelers hat with you . Do you have one ? KAYE : One advantage of being overseas and serving your country is all the food certainly that you get delivered to you on big game , on Super Bowl day . What do you get ? 4,800 pounds of mozzarella cheese sticks , we understand , are going to Afghanistan alone ; 4,000 pounds of jalapeno poppers , 4,800 pepperoni pizzas , 3,600 pizza and supreme pizzas . What do you plan to eat ? I 'm sure you 'll have more than chips and dip today ? STEUSSI : I think we can go to the dining facility , and maybe we 'll have to bring some home . As you may know the timing , as you mentioned , is a little off here . We 're going to-the game starts at 3:30 in the morning . So we 'll probably have a dinner and then have a second dinner when the game comes on for sure . KAYE : I understand , Commander , you actually have some big plans , if the Packers do win , what 's your plan for a celebration ? STEUSSI : Well , you know , my celebration actually , it 's pretty big , I 'm going to take a half day off of work I think . I 'm going to just sleep in and celebrate probably . But we -- we have a little running bet in my clinic with another physical therapist , Commander Shane Vath -LRB- ph -RRB- , he 's a big Pittsburgh fan . We 've each got little side bets I ca n't disclose on TV . But if we-whichever team wins , we 'll have to do that tomorrow afternoon , probably , so -- KAYE : I know we 're here to talk about the Super Bowl . But , Captain , I want to give you a chance to say anything you 'd like to your family this morning . It will be great to see everybody when I get back . KAYE : And , commander , would you like to say hello as well ? STEUSSI : Yeah , my parents live in Florida . I think they are watching this . Hi , mom and dad . My wife is in San Diego . Say hi to them , and my kids , and I have two brothers who are also probably watching . Hi , to everyone . And just like captain said , we 'll be coming home relatively soon . And go Pack , that 's all I can say . KAYE : I knew she was going to follow with that one . We want to thank both of you . Captain Sara Armstrong , Commander Keith Steussi , I want to thank you both for , not only for joining us but for serving your country . STEUSSI : Thank you very much . KAYE : How nice . What a celebration they will have over there . When it rains it pours , or so the saying goes , but what about when it snows a whole lot . We are taking a look at the best videos to come out of this week 's storm . You are definitely going to want to stick around and see the rest after that giant snowman . That is coming your way next . KAYE : Welcome back . Thunder snow , sliding dogs , and a fire - breathing snow creature , oh , my . CNN 's Jeanne Moos on the crazy winter weather . JEANNE MOOS , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- voice over -RRB- : Having to abandon your car on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago is bad , but not as bad as having your car 's nose rubbed in the snow . There were accidents like this one in Salem , New Hampshire and roof collapses . But as some things went down , others went up and up and up . This 35-foot snowman in Champion , New York , has a snow cone for a nose and a swimming pool for a top hat . It 's enough to give Frosty button envy . These buttons made out of racing tires . iReporters have sent in Packers and Steelers helmets in Wisconsin , a snow squirrel in New Jersey , a giraffe in Staten Island , and our personal favorite -- Nick and Anna Berte -LRB- ph -RRB- of Bel Air , Maryland , call their creation -- MOOS : Godzilla out of snow . The fiery breath is supplied by a flame thrower made out of carburetor cleaner and a butane lighter . It does n't melt the snow that much . MOOS : Now if there is a buzzword coming out of this latest mega storm it 's -- DAVID LETTERMAN , LATE NIGHT WITH DAVID LETTERMAN : Thunder snow ! It 's -- it 's God 's first new work in 500 years . It 's thunder snow ! MOOS : Thunder during snow , is a weatherman 's snow fantasy . Son of a -- MOOS : Weathermen get dumped on by comedians during snowstorms . MOOS : CNN 's own Ed Lavandera got the Jimmy Kimmel treatment . ED LAVANDERA , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Sorry . You have to be careful as these cars drive by I want to make sure they do n't lose control or anything like that . MOOS : From sliding dogs , to a joker who thought it would be funny to go shirtless in Chicago . How you view the snow can help you weather it . It 's kind of a fun challenge , do n't you think ? REGIS PHILBIN , REGIS & KELLY : I love those glasses . KELLY RIPA , REGIS & KELLY : She has four inches of snow on her glasses alone . MOOS : And a 100 percent chance of near zero visibility . Would n't it be great if some dusty old vase lying around the house turned out to be worth more than a million bucks , say ? That 's the story for one lucky man in England . We 'll go there in our `` Morning Passport '' . KAYE : It is going to be a big week in Washington , with President Obama and the Tea Party making some major moves . CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser has the rundown . PAUL STEINHAUSER , CNN DEPUTY POLITICAL DIRECTOR : Good morning , Randi . President Barack Obama heads into what some consider politically enemy territory tomorrow , when he speaks in front of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce . Last year the Chamber opposed Mr. Obama 's push for Wall Street and healthcare reform . And in the mid term elections , worked to defeat many Democrats who had backed the president 's programs . On Tuesday , here in Washington , what 's being touted as the first - ever Tea Party town hall . Among the lawmakers attending the event , Senator Rand Paul and Congresswoman Michele Bachmann . On Thursday , the annual Conservative Political Action conference kicks off . There is controversy this year , with some social conservative groups boycotting to protest the inclusion of a pro-gay Republican group . Speaking at the event , many of the Republicans who may -- may -- run for the White House . The conference ends Saturday with the straw poll for the GOP presidential nomination , Randi . KAYE : An arrow straight through the heart of ancient Japanese tradition . Some of Japan 's most respected sumo wrestlers admit-get this-that they have been cheating . Plus , a shout out to reggae 's biggest icon ; Bob Marley would have been 66 today . We 're taking you to Japan and Jamaica , all in our `` Morning Passport '' . KAYE : 2,000 years of Japanese culture and tradition , undermined by modern-day cheats . Sumo wrestling in Japan dates back 2,000 years . It 's the country 's national sport . But it 's honor and image has now been tarnished . Just this week , by allegations of match rigging . Say it is n't so . Nadia Bilchik joining me to talk about all of that . NADIA BILCHIK , EDITORIAL PRODUCER : Exactly . It 's so bad , in fact , that the match rigging may result in them canceling the season . BILCHIK : Now , the season has not been canceled since 1946 , post World War II , when they had to cancel to repair the stadium . We are looking at sumo wrestlers , and as you said , dates back 2,000 years . KAYE : This is a little tough in the morning for me to watch . We 'll go with it . BILCHIK : Shinto is the native religion of Japan . And it means Way of the Gods , but there is much more to sumo than just large men eating each other up . In fact , what is really incredible is it is about entertaining the gods . And the pre-bout traditions are what makes it sumo so fascinating . They do all kinds of things like throw salt into the stadium as a way of purification . So there is so much more to sumo than just fighting . KAYE : Do we know how they even figured this out ? BILCHIK : Well , what they did was they confiscated the phones of 13 sumo wrestlers and they found - BILCHIK : Now , do you want to know how sumo wrestlers get so large ? They have 20,000 calories a day and 85 percent body fat . So , if you want to know how to get fat , go on the sumo diet . KAYE : I do n't think I need to go on the sumo diet . That does n't sound like a good thing . But they were texting each other to what ? You go down and I 'll get - BILCHIK : Yes , they were rigging it . It would be like rigging the Super Bowl . I mean , this is part of national pride . The prime minister has weighed in , saying you are betraying the Japanese people . KAYE : I just want to talk about an icon 's birthday today , before we run out of time . BILCHIK : Before we get to the icon 's birthday , can I tell you about a Ming vase ? BILCHIK : If you do n't mind ? Because in London this week , a gentleman walks in , a 79-year-old retired worker walks into an auction house with a box . In the box there is a vase . Now take a look at that vase . We 're looking at it . If you notice , the handles are of an Islamic design . So , it is a Chinese Ming vase with exceptional handles , that makes is so precious , that it is worth 1 million pounds , about $ 1.6 million . KAYE : Would have been 66 ? BILCHIK : Is n't that incredible ? Would have been 66 today ; the year of the Rooster , he was born in 1945 and he died in his 30s . There he is , the icon , the person who popularized reggae music and the Rastafarian movement . What would our lives have been like without , `` No Woman , No Cry '' , `` One Love '' and `` Buffalo Soldier '' ? So , personally , thank you , Bob . KAYE : `` Buffalo Soldier '' , big fan . BILCHIK : We honor you . This is Reggae Month in Jamaica , man . KAYE : Nicely done . Thank you , Nadia . KAYE : Thousands of T-shirts , hats and sweatshirts have been made proclaiming both the Packers and Steelers the Super Bowl champs , just in case . Once a team wins the merchandise will be rolled out to the masses . But did you ever wonder what happens to the shirts for the losing teams ? KAYE : Welcome back everyone . We are getting close to the top of the hour . Whichever team loses today 's Super Bowl , plenty of poverty - stricken children will be very grateful . CNN 's Mark McKay explains . MARK MCKAY , CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT Almost like magic in the moments after a new Super Bowl champion is crowned , the players on the winning team are sporting hats and T-shirts . There is no magic involved . All of that merchandise is preprinted . What happens to the apparel on the team that did n't win ? The NFL donates it to the aid organization , World Vision . Both championship games and the Super Bowl , we get about 300 shirts and 300 hats . But then from the pre-buys , each year , we get more and more of the pre-buy product from the retailers , and that has really helped a lot . Our stipulation with the league is it has to go out of the country . We ca n't keep it in the U.S. or Canada , and from there , they leave it up to us to determine where the most need is . This year , we know there is good needs in Zambia , Romania , Armenia , and Nicaragua . Those are poor countries we 're keying in on now . Basically , just strictly on need . If we do get some sweatshirts in , which I 'm sure we will , because all four teams are cold weather teams , we 'll look to the cold weather countries we are serving like Mongolia or Armenia . We 're working in areas where there is generally no electric , unfortunately , a lot of times no running water . They have in idea who the Chicago Bears , New York Jets , Pittsburgh Steelers , Green Bay Packers , any of the teams are . They are just glad they are getting a brand new shirt that is in great shape . A lot of them never received something new like that in their lives . It 's really life changing . MCKAY : So , now you know . By the way , World Vision 's international distribution center is located in Pittsburgh . I wonder which team 's apparel they would rather be shipping out next week . Mark McKay , CNN , Arlington , Texas . A quiet morning so far in Tahrir Square as hundreds gather for Muslim prayers and protestors now dig in for day 13 . In Iran , the trial of three U.S. hikers now underway , all accused of spying and trespassing . And paying tribute to Ronald Reagan . He would have been 100 years old today . Events across the country will honor his life and legacy . And later today , John King hosts special coverage of the centennial celebration starting at 2:00 p.m. here on CNN . It is early and we 're on it . From CNN Center , this is CNN SUNDAY MORNING . It 's February 6th . Glad you 're with us . I 'm Randi Kaye . It is 7:00 a.m. now on the East Coast ; 2:00 p.m. in Egypt . Thousands of people filling Cairo 's Liberation Square again today , and it looks like there 's some movement between the embattled government of Hosni Mubarak and one element of protesters . Leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood group have just wrapped up a meeting with Vice President Omar Suleiman . Brotherhood members originally said they would n't talk until President Mubarak was out of office . There 's also been some high-level shuffling in Egypt 's ruling political party . Several leaders handed in their resignations , including one of President Mubarak 's sons . CNN 's Frederik Pleitgen is in Cairo and joins us by phone . Good morning , Fred . Can you describe the scene there for us ? FREDERIK PLEITGEN , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- via telephone -RRB- : Well , it is a very peaceful one , Randi , certainly much more so than the past couple of days . As you said , I would say , right now , it 's 4,000 to 5,000 people who are in Tahrir Square . And we are hearing that there 's also some Christian masses that are due to be held there today to commemorate those , of course , who were killed in the protests that have gone on . Of course , well over 100 people who are killed in that . Otherwise , what I 'm seeing , an Egyptian capital that tries to get back on its feet . There 's more traffic in the streets . I was sort of driving around town today and it seems as though more and more shop owners are trying to open their stores . The banks are open for the first time since the cries began . I saw some very long lines in front of ATM machines and inside banking centers . But it does n't seem to be the kind of panic that many had feared here . I saw -- a lot of people we were talking to who were saying , yes , they are withdrawing a lot of money right now , but the main reason for that is that they could n't withdraw any money over the past couple of days . So , they certainly have some catching up to do . So , at this point in time , it seems as though the Egyptian capital is sort of trying to get back on its feet . Of course , it 's still very much scarred by the past couple of days and , of course , this protest still is really going strong , we have to say , for the numbers I can see there on Tahrir Square right now , Randi . KAYE : And , Fred , is there anything that you can tell us anymore about the meetings with the opposition and the government ? We know that the Muslim Brotherhood has apparently just wrapped up a meeting with the vice president . The Muslim Brotherhood has wrapped up a meeting . And that , of course , as you said , is significant , because beforehand , the Muslim Brotherhood had said it would not talk to the government unless Hosni Mubarak resigned immediately . So , it seems as they have softened their stance . I 'm not exactly sure what came out of that meeting . Also , apparent representatives of the people actually on Tahrir Square , known as the Movement of January 25th , they also are going to meet with the government today . Now , I do have some inside information from an opposition leader who met with the government yesterday for a similar meeting . It was the Waft group , which is one of the biggest opposition groups here in Egypt . And they met yesterday with Omar Suleiman and they said that the talks were quite friendly , but they also said that the government very , very much entrenched on the issue of keeping Hosni Mubarak in power . They said that the government was not willing to move an inch and the government told them Hosni Mubarak would stay in power and would finish the end of his term . So , there are a lot of people who do n't see those negotiations coming to very much , unless , of course , the protesters drop their demand for Mubarak to leave or the government relents at some point . But it does n't look that way right now , Randi . KAYE : The military has really been s trying to stay neutral and trying to keep the peace . Do you see any presence of the military today in Liberation Square ? PLEITGEN : Oh , yes . I mean , yes , you see a lot of presence not necessarily on Liberation Square , but sort of all of the entrances to the square , probably mainly to try and keep pro-Mubarak groups away from that area so there 's no trouble . But the military is massive presence not just in the Tahrir Square but throughout the city . I mean , it was driving through vast parts of the city and you see a tank on almost -- down almost every two intersections or an armored personnel carrier . Also , when you go out of town , on the main roads , there are checkpoints there , there 's tanks stationed there . The military has a massive presence , not just here in downtown Cairo , but pretty much everywhere in Cairo and also outside . But they are pretty much the only law enforcement entity that 's out there . Although I did see a few traffic police officers . But clearly , they would not be able to deal with any sort of violent situations that would arise . So , yes -- I mean , the military , a massive presence , and you see a lot of tanks on many streets here in this country , Randi . KAYE : All right . Fred Pleitgen for us in Cairo , watching it all happen this morning . Thank you , Fred . Let 's take a look at the one institution that could prevent a breakdown of civil society in Egypt . That 's the military , which we were just discussing with Fred . Egyptian generals overthrew the monarchy in 1952 basically to set up a less corrupt , more responsive government . And they 've been at the heart of Egyptian power , culture , identity , ever since . All of Egypt 's presidents to date have been military men and they 've ruled with emergency powers that parliament routinely renews . All Egyptian men have to serve , and the officer corps enjoys decent pay and serious prestige in a relatively impoverished country . Let me show you how this force actually measures up . China has the most , 2.3 million troops on active duty , more than any other country by far . The top five countries all have more than a million troops , not counting reserves or paramilitaries . Egypt is actually tenth , with just under half a million active duty fighters . Its force is well-equipped with modern planes and tanks . And for that , it has you and me to thank . Last year , Egypt got $ 1.6 billion in U.S. military and economic aid -- most of it , military aid , used to buy big-ticket weapons from U.S. defense contractors . Over the years , the U.S. has funded Egypt faithfully . Generally , Congress gives Egypt $ 2 for every $ 3 that it gives Israel . The reason for that goes back to 1979 when Egypt and Israel signed the Camp David peace accords . Through it all , the U.S. and the Egyptian militaries have maintained very close military ties and that has not changed to this date . So , what next for the land of the pharaohs ? To talk about that , we turn to Fouad Ajami , professor of Middle Eastern studies at Johns Hopkins University . He 's joining us by phone . Professor , this weekend -- this week , we 've actually seen some big cracks in Egypt 's regime . Key members of Mubarak 's ruling party resigning their positions , including his son , also the vice president now having talks with the opposition leaders , including the Muslim Brotherhood . So , how significant would you say all of this is , or is it really just for show ? PROF. FOUAD AJAMI , MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES , JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV. -LRB- via telephone -RRB- : Well , I think the regime has fallen . If you really look at the house of Mubarak and at President Mubarak himself , he has lost the mandate of his people . His moral case has fallen . When millions of people come out every day and ask you to leave , and you hold on to power , you can see the fraud of this regime and you can see the moral abdication of this regime . But also on trial now is the American response to what has been going on in Cairo . We have become -- we have come close to betraying the democratic aspirations of these people . We sent to Cairo -- the United States sent to Cairo , an envoy , Frank Wisner , who is extremely close to Mubarak . We now have seen Ambassador Wisner make a statement , remarkable in the annals of the American diplomacy , he identified totally with the despot in Cairo and basically put the word out that this man needs to be there to lead Egypt to a democratic -- through a democratic transition . It 's laughable to think that Mubarak would lead anyone to a democratic transition . So , here you have it . KAYE : President Mubarak has said this week that he would n't leave Egyptian soil even if he does resign . Do you think that the opposition needs to see him physically leave the country before they believe he is truly out of power ? AJAMI : Well , the opposition , and I think even the vast majority of Egyptian people , do n't believe that Mubarak -- do n't believe anything that President Mubarak says . They 've known him for a very long time . Thirty years is a long time . Some 35 million Egyptians , the bulk of the young people , have been born while President Mubarak has been in office and they know about the thievery of his family , about the looting of the country 's wealth in a very poor country , and they understand that he is playing for time . Should he be allowed to stay ? Should he stay between now and September ? He may create conditions where another deeper state of emergency could be declared . So , you 're right , the Egyptians need to see him out of the country . There is no way about it . And also , the leading figures in the opposition are surely worried about themselves . If he does n't leave in a few months , they may all be in prison . I think this is the great standoff between a dictator and his population with America in the middle , backing this terrible dictator . KAYE : All right . We 'll have to leave it there . Thank you for your insight , Professor Ajami . KAYE : He was called the great communicator . But he was so much more than that . Broadcaster , actor , and the nation 's 40th president -- Ronald Reagan is being remembered today on what would have been his 100th birthday . We look back at the Reagan legacy and more , next . KAYE : Welcome back . Twelve minutes past the hour . One hundred years ago today , America 's great communicator was born and 40th president was born . Ronald Wilson Reagan , the modern day icon of conservatism , is being warmly remembered this weekend at his presidential ranch and museum in California . Our Ted Rowlands takes us there for a tour and more . TED ROWLANDS , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Randi , it 's a weekend of celebration here at the Reagan Library . Nancy Reagan will be here to cut the ribbon on a $ 15 million renovation of the museum portion of the library . We had an opportunity to take a sneak peek at it . It is very impressive . RONALD REAGAN , FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT : Mr. Gorbachev , tear down this wall . ROWLANDS -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Video and sound are a constant feature . Reagan 's movies and speeches played throughout . JOHN HEUBUSCH , EXEC . , REAGAN PRESIDENTIAL FOUNDATION : We have right over here to my right , the very famous debate with President Carter where he asked the question , `` Are you better off now than you were four years ago ? '' ROWLANDS : There 's also a Berlin Wall , with tunnels and interactive videogame table and an inauguration day exhibit complete with Reagan 's speech on the teleprompter . His diaries have been digitized for people to flip through . There 's also an exhibit dealing with the assassination attempt on President Reagan after 70 days in office . As in many presidential libraries , you can see an exact replica of the Oval Office and Air Force One , the actual plane used by seven U.S. presidents and the one Reagan flew in during his eight years in office . HEUBUSCH : They get to see where the president sits in the aircraft . They get to see his working quarters . They get to see where the Secret Service would sit , where the traveling press corps sits . They get to touch and feel the airplane . It 's just a great experience . ROWLANDS : An Iran-Contra affair exhibit deals with the low point of the Reagan presidency . Also on display , the letter Reagan wrote , with the audio of him reading it , announcing to the world he had Alzheimer 's . REAGAN : My fellow Americans , I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be affected with Alzheimer 's disease . ROWLANDS -LRB- on camera -RRB- : Everything here at the library this weekend is closed to the public , but the new museum inside the library opens to the public on Monday . They are expecting a lot of people . They 'll be serving cake throughout the day to celebrate Ronald Reagan 's 100th birthday -- Randi . KAYE : Ted Rowlands from Simi Valley , California -- thank you , Ted . Stick with CNN later this afternoon for live coverage of the festivities at the Reagan Library . Our John King hosts . It all begins at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time . It 's a good thing the Super Bowl will be played under a dome , because the weather in Dallas has been down right dreadful . The whole area is under ice and snow . Will it finally warm up for the fans to come out and play ? We 'll let you know . KAYE : And welcome back . People at Cowboys Stadium today can keep their eyes on the game instead of looking up constantly to check out the roof . We told you how ice and snow slid down 60 feet off the road Friday . Six workers getting ready for the big game were injured , but luckily , they are all OK . Well , it is about 16 minutes past the hour . Here to check in with Karen on the latest I guess there in Arlington , Texas . And I guess we 're seeing more snow and ice in that area ? Or have things warmed up a bit ? KAREN MAGINNIS , AMS METEOROLOGIST : Yes , I 'm going to show you what our latest prognostications are looking like , Randi . And this is what we anticipate over the next 24 hours . What we 're looking at so far across the panhandle , yes , you can see this snow coming a while away . There is Dallas right there . You can see , it looks the eastern edge of Dallas is going to be kind of a rain event . But then for the west -- now , this is as about 11:00 in the evening . Everybody is probably still milling around the Cowboys Stadium , but just to the west , this is where we 've got the snowfall , but there 's going to be a fine line as to where the rain or the ice and snow are going to be located . So , it 's going to be kind of an interesting set of events that take place over the next 12 hours or so . It moves in and out fairly quickly . So , that will be the good news in the forecast . However , here as we take a look at the specific forecast at game time , it looks like it 's going to start out as rainfall . And then be a rain\\/snow mix . Temperatures in the upper 30s , but then dropping down fairly quickly after that . Speaking of , we 're watching temperatures across the northern tier states . Now , typically for Minneapolis , and I know , Randi , you 've worked there before . They should be around 25 , 30 degrees . But they 're looking at high temperatures coming up around five for a high . KAYE : All right , Karen . Stressed out by the heavy snow ? Check out this canopy that collapsed just before midnight last night at the Indianapolis International Airport 's parking garage . Nobody was injured luckily , but a few rental cars sure took a beating from the falling ice and snow . The area is now off limits to parking . Then there is this department store roof that collapsed in the greater Tulsa area last night . Two employees were inside at the time when they heard the rumbling , and the ceiling of the store began to cave in . They ran out just in time . Boy , were they lucky . Just in time before it collapsed . He grew up as the son of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker . His life is all about religion . But at one point , he wanted nothing to do with God . Now , Jay Bakker preaches the word punk style . He explains it all in his new book `` Fall to Grace , '' and we 're going to chat with him after a quick break . KAYE : After getting exposed to the ugly side of religion , Jay Bakker turned his back on God . But now , the prodigal son of Jim and Tammy Faye is leading a congregation of his own . He is joining us live from New York to talk about his journey back to grace and his new book on our `` Faces of Faith '' this morning . Jay , good to se you . Glad you 're with us this morning . JAY BAKKER , AUTHOR , `` FALL TO GRACE '' : Good to be here . KAYE : I 'm well . Your parents , PTL Network , Praise the Lord Network , reached 13 million homes . Tell us what it was like for you growing up before the television cameras ? BAKKER : It was really surreal . I mean , it was all I knew . So , growing up , it seemed normal . But looking back , it was quite just an amazing thing to just constantly be on . You know , constantly wondering , you know , how you look and what you 're doing and what 's going on . And also , also I grew up in my parents ' church . I mean , the school was there , everything was there . So , I was like growing up in a big Christian bubble . And I know that later on , you struggled with alcohol and drugs as you got older . Would you say that was a direct result of what you had to deal with when you were younger with your family ? BAKKER : Maybe some . Also , I think it was just natural rebellion , trying to fit in in high school and stuff like that . You know , I mean , especially when everybody knows what 's going on with your family , it can be a little awkward . Having all of your business out there . You have since started your own church , called Revolution , a very unique name . What is the message of your church ? BAKKER : The message is inclusion . You know , everyone is accepted . And just -- we 're a church for everybody . And we do n't say you have to be a Christian , you got to be this . We just want to let people know that they are loved and they 're included and created in a safe space for people to come , and discuss issues that are going on in their life . KAYE : And it 's also what comes with that that was a little bit of controversy , because you are you a Christian minister , but in your book `` Fall to Grace , '' you talk about gay people and how you consider yourself a gay-affirming minister . So , in other words , you think homosexuals have a place in the church . What was the reaction to that ? BAKKER : The reaction right away was as we lost all our finances . I had to let the staff go because we could n't raise finances . All of my speaking engagements got canceled for a year . So , it was quite a backlash . But it 's definitely worth it because I -- that 's my conviction . I really believe that the LGBT community is poorly treated by the church and that we 've got to open the doors completely . KAYE : And really , in a way , you 're carrying on the beliefs of your mom in speaking out this way . BAKKER : Yes , my mom was -- you know , my mom was a gay icon , and , you know , she just loved people . And so , what I 've tried to do is take it to the next level of , you know , we do a lot for gay rights because it seems like a civil rights issue . So , we 're not just wanting to be welcoming , but we 're wanting to be affirming and inclusive . KAYE : And when you think about grace , just leave us with why you think grace is so important . BAKKER : Because it accepts even the unacceptable , and it allows us to live our life and work with the things that are -- that are -- that are tough , and so , I think grace helps us to accept that we 're accepted and it will transform our lives . KAYE : All right . Jay Bakker , glad you 're with us this morning . Thanks for joining us . BAKKER : And thanks for having me . A quick check on today 's top stories , and the latest on the situation in Egypt -- that 's up next . Former Vice President Dick Cheney is calling embattled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak a , quote , `` good friend and ally , '' but he 's not predicting whether Mubarak will step down . Cheney says despite pundits and politicians , Egyptians will decide their own fate . RICHARD CHENEY , FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT : I think it 's important for us all to remember that this issue is going to be resolved by the Egyptians . A lot of people with opinions , outside other governments , commentators on cable news shows -- but bottom line is , in the end , whatever comes next in Egypt is going to be determined by the people of Egypt . And we need to remember that . KAYE : Two American hikers are on trial in Iran for spying and trespassing . Shane Bauer , Josh Fattal and Sarah Shourd were detained in the summer of 2009 after they alleged strayed across an unmarked border from Iraq into Iran . Shourd was released last fall because of a medical condition . She did not return for the trial . Some restaurants in southern California are being warned that their ground beef could make customers sick . The beef shipped to those restaurants by one California company may be contaminated with E. coli bacteria . We 're talking about 3,000 pounds of hamburger patties and other products . We have n't heard any reports of people getting sick from the bad beef . Well , as you know , it is Super Bowl Sunday . So , we thought it would be a good time to talk about youth football and injuries suffered by kids and teenagers . If you 're looking for ways to keep them safe , we think CNN 's chief medical correspondent , Dr. Sanjay Gupta , might have found the perfect program to help .

CNN continues to have many teams in place . It was a hard decision to leave . '' Now back in New York , Cooper will sit down for a lengthy interview on `` Piers Morgan Tonight '' Monday to talk about his experience . What do you want Piers Morgan to ask Anderson tomorrow ? Leave your questions below ... So Glad You stayed safe , , You did A wonderful Job And suffered enough , , , You Are The Best Thank You Amen , Jen . We all have a point beyond which we can not go -- at that time -- at that place . Anderson Cooper and many , many of the journalists have done a magnificent job in bringing us to the tragic and heroic places and people with whom we share this planet . It is unbelievable how the new technology opens the world to everyone -- but a picture is only a picutre -- it is the journalists who bring the pictures to life and afford us the understanding of what is occurring . I humbly thank each and every one of them . I thank them too , but I hope they will reconsider and go back to Egypt . Those who want to retain their grip on power and lock democracy up in a police state want to do that outside the view of cameras . That is precisely why they harried Anderson Cooper out of the country . I realize it takes incredible courage to face that police state and demand free access to the democracy movement now being kept away from journalists in the center of Cairo , but I hope Anderson Cooper will reconsider his decision . If he can not go back - and I will still respect him if he does n't - I hope he will lend his considerable visibility and prestige to working with organizations like the Committee to Protect Journalists to get his Eygption counterparts out of dungeons and I hope he will support getting the truth out of Egypt to his American viewers . They are taxpayers - and it was their tax money that was used to beat him up in Cairo . February 7 , 2011 at 7:57 am | Report abuse | AC : Were you ever scared ? Do you want to never go to dangerous events ever again ? Muslims and Christians had each others backs for prayers in the square . Nice change from Shia and Sunni killing fellow Muslims in Iraq . Is that normal in Egypt , or more good result from the protesting ? Is that a message to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt ? Anderson , you brought us some incredibly tense video . I truly feared for your safety . Clearly the thugs were willing to throw punches . But you know they had knives and guns . Why do you think they stopped short , God forbid , of bringing any more harm to journalists if their goal was truly to silence them ? Could have been the Beatiin in the Head several times . Most likely CNN has played this out , we 're tired of hearing about it . At the height of your visit to Egypt , , when you had to hide . What went through your mind ? Did you make a bucket list ? Did you make a promise to yourself to do something you have been procrastinating ? Piers , please tell Anderson , how much I loved the -LRB- Reports Notebook -RRB- February 6 , 2011 at 4:00 pm | Report abuse | Reply Did the government -LRB- US or Egypt -RRB- have anything to do with your departure ? Good question , Tawni . I had n't thought of that -- I hope he asks it ! Please hug your Mom tonight . . and spend some quality time with her . . As a Mother of a soldier during `` Shock and Awe '' , I know EXACTLY how she felt watching your reports . I thank God , both of you were brought home safe . In what way will the Cairo uprising impact China , if at all ? I wonder how the Hong Kong , Vietnam , Indonesia , Malaysia , Philippones , Taiwan , Communist China 's press\\/TV And the people are reacting ? Afterall , the future economic and intellectual powerhouse are or will be in Asia . There are lots of similarities , and tons of differences . But no TV reportings have even mentioned one word except mentioning Tien Ghan Min Square massacre . My biggest question is why the reporters were attacked by the Egyptians demonstrators when considering that reporters were doing them a favor by telling the world about their current conditions ? 2 different `` factions '' One pro Government , One against the present Government . do u think that the muslim brotherhood will ever respect isreal Does it make a difference to us ? We just need to stay home and put our money in `` our '' mouthes . I 'm happy of your safe return and I hope that you will continue to cover the current crisis in Egypt . My question is if you can elaborate on how exactly is Egypt 's current situation affecting other countries and if so , is it very damaging or something we need to keep a look out for the future ? Anderson : As per usual , terrific reporting in Egypt . Glad you 're safe and back home ! After experiencing the violence during your time in Egypt , do you regret going there to begin with ? Or , did it make for an even bigger experience ? Were you really punched in the face ? What was your most intense experience while there ? Anderson , You such a hard worker and I have to ask when do you ever sleep while you are on these trips ?? Your family must be so proud of you . What was the final straw for you to decide to fly back ??? Keep safe , we love your shows Anderson I am so glad u are back and safe The whole world has been concerned When a country goes against our Freedom of Free Speech we come out fighting like Wildcats I admire your Bravery Your Bravado Your Courage to bring us The Truth whatever the cost Will EGYPT TAKE AWAY THE FREEDOMS OF THEIR PEOPLE WILL IT BECOME A CONTROLLED ARAB STATE I WAS SO SCARED FOR U HOW SCARED WERE YOU I WOULD BE SO AFRAID I WOULD TRUST NO ONE EVEN THOSE CLOSEST TO ME HOW IS YOUR MOTHER I KNOW SHE IS SO HAPPY YOU ARE BACK GOD BLESS YOU ANDERSON WE ALL ARE PROUD OF YOU WARMEST REGARDS JUDY OF CHICAGO If the segment is taped and airs at a much later date , who is gonna care when it is broadcast ? Through no fault of your own , you went from reporting the story to being part of the story . How do you feel about that ? Can I be the first to say , while I completely understand why you are upset to be coming home early , we are all so incredibly happy to have our silver fox home . My question for you is : as an American , what do you believe our country should do in regard to Egypt ? Why did you not get to interview more significant people -- e. g , Christiane Amanpour got the VP and the President , Piers Morgan had the minister for finance -- outside of the elbaradei interview , you only had other reporters on your show . -LRB- Frankly I found Piers Morgan 's coverage way more interesting and educational -RRB- 2 . Did you purposely go for the `` people ' side of the story rather than the political one ? Did you lose sight of the story once your safety was compromised ? Keeping them honest -- why not cover the fact that the US for 30 years has endorsed Mubarak and on the heels of a few days of rioting , the US changes it 's position ? Keeping them honest again - in light of the fact that there are 82million people in Eygpt , is there any way to know that the protesters -LRB- a mere 100-200k or so of the population -RRB- are indeed the voice of the majority ? -- you seem to have a chip on your shoulder . Some -LRB- not all -RRB- valid questions , but you start out attacking ... AC , with all due respect , but where is the objectivity in your reporting about Egypt , ? you took the rebels side and started calling Mubarak folowers as thungs . You come and say let 's keep it honest . I am sorry for your eventful run but again the tension is high and many Egyptians see CNN reporting acting like a Jazeera which is well known for its liaison with Iran and radicals . -LRB- btw I am not Egyptian -RRB- . you will be surprised how many egyptians still feel passionately about Mubarak . I did not see you going all up in arms when we were watching the Green revolution in Iran . All what we heard was US should not involve and it is an internal issue ... wake up and adjust your reporting . . you had a great potential and I still remember your reporting in 2005 out of Beirut during the great coverage of the Cedars revolution . . Many of you fans , including myself have made the comparison of your reporting in Egypt being similar to your reporting in Sarajevo . Can you elaborate on it - did you make the connections also , or is each reporting experience new and completely different for you ? Thank you so much for all your hard work and effort in Egypt and other reports . You are truly wonderful and amazing ! How do you think the uprisings in Tunisia , Egypt and other Arab countries and countries in the Middle East will affect US relations with those countries ? Secretary Clinton condemned censoring in Egypt . However , she did n't mention that China blocked words like `` Cairo '' and `` Egypt . '' Why do you think that is and how do you think had she mentioned it , China-US relations will affected ? : Thanks a great deal for providing poeple with a really breathtaking chance to read critical reviews from this site . It really is very brilliant and as well , full of fun personally personally and my office co-workers to find your site nearly thrice inside a week to find out the latest secrets you might have . Obviously , Im also usually motivated for your wonderful suggestions you serve . Selected 2 points about this page have been in truth the very best weve had . How is it that many other journalists equipment was confiscated , and they were jailed , but you and your crew managed to escape this ? What made you decide to come back when Egypt is still in such a state ? On Friday , when the army was evidently out in numbers to prevent violence , I expected you reporting from Tahrir Square , but you were in a hotel room . Was it still unsafe for you to be at ground zero ? Other reporters on other channels were reporting from Tahrir Square , so it was surprising to not see you there as well . Do you plan to go back to Egypt in the near future ? When did you sleep ? can `` t instigate more fights so run home ? So you got a poke in the nose apparentlyllll covering several thousand young protesters and ignoring the fact that there are some 82 million Egyptian who were not protesting seems a little one sided to me . How come you all stayed fixated on the square and did not even try to get the working man ? The protesters are still there , they are not the poor working average Egyptian . believe me the average Egyptian doesn ' have a cell phone . internet etc. and they ca n't afford to sit around shooting their mouths off !! they work . Morgan please Ask Anderson if he personally see Mohammed El-Baradei as a betrayal to World Security ? Does he belive the world should stand publicly NOW in support for president Muhammad Hosni Sayyid Mubarak for the security of this World ??? .

THIS IS FOR PAULETTE : HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOU WERE THE ONE BEING ATTACKED NOT JUST ONE DAY BUT MORE THAN ONE DAY FORCED TO GO IN HIDING DUE TO JOURNALISTS BEING ARRESTED INTERROGATED JAILED TORTURED ANDERSON MADE A DECISION THAT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT ONE I RESPECT THAT DECISION AND ADMIRE ANDERSON ALL THE MORE FOR MAKING IT This hero worshiping of journalists who tell only one side of the story and the safe side at that is why so many of them feel they are the story themselves . They make the news not tell it . But that 's what makes the world go round . Far be it from me to upset your love in >> When journalists are attacked to prevent them from showing the military abusing human rights , the journalists are the entire story . Do you seriously suggest CNN report on the attacks without mentioning what happened to Cooper ? February 7 , 2011 at 7:26 am | Report abuse | Ask him how long you have to be on CNN before they let you have a video podcast . Piers Morgan Tonight only gets an audio version for now , as ratings improve will that justify video as well ? Anderson , I commend you for your exceptional reporting . I want to know if you see much change in the government so far . The people want Mubarak to go , but he still is n't leaving . The prime minister has been blaming the media for this chaos . He seems to be just as bad as Mubarak . These thugs that the govermnent has hired are still attacking you and other journalists . From what I saw yesterday , the general tried to get people to leave Tahrir Square . This also seems to be what the government is trying to do to defuse the situation and for everything to go back to normal . They claim that they are making changes , but so far I have n't seem much . They outsted his son , which from what I have read the people like much more than Mubarak . The people of Egypt want freedom and it seems the goverment is not doing much to allow this . Mubarak claims there will be chaos if he leaves , but he and his goverment are the ones creating this chaos . He claims if he leaves that the Muslim Brotherhood might take over and it would be very bad for the people , but from what i have read they are very peaceful and they are only speaking with the goverment about change . They are not trying to lead the country . Even Obama said he should listen to the people , but not enough is being done . He needs to go now . How soon do you think Mubarak will leave ? when Piers is interviewing he will ask a question but never lets the guest finish what they are saying . What the hell is that about ?? Very Very rude and unprofessional . It 's most irritating and I have n't even watched it very often . Hope he 's replaced ... . . SOON !!!! I made the same comment here about his interruptions . It is indeed so frustrating ! At least Larry King did n't try to take over the show to bring emphasis on himself . He remained objective and allowed his guest to remain the center of attention . Also , some of Piers ' questions are inappropriate . While Piers Morgan filled the Larry King time-slot , he did n't replace him . They 're both excellent for different reasons ; Piers Morgan will be even better 3 months from now than he is today . You 'll know he 's reached a certain level of excellence when they give him a video podcast , for now it 's just audio February 7 , 2011 at 5:47 am | Report abuse | Good evening , Wanted to let Anderson know thank you for risking your own personel safety , and health not sure , if this is something that I could do . Also , I hope its not ture but is he leaving CNN . Who cares if he 's gay or not he is a fantastic journalist I would put him right up there with Walter Cronkite ... Peter Jennings ... . Thank you Anderson for all the wonderful reporting . You may like Anderson Cooper but to even try and compare him with Walter Cronkite or Peter Jennings is a real stretch !! Whether he is gay or not is of no concern ... he is just more of an personality then a reporter\\/journalist . The real journalists like Jennings and Cronkite gave you all the accurate details as much as they could and tried to ensure the information was correct ... Now the media just tries to fill its 24 hour news slot with the same video over and over again and interviews with any person who call themselves `` specialists '' who seem to know everything long after the fact !! Yes Lynn , you are right . The true newmen of yesteryear are gone and that is unfortunate for us all . They had real principles and they did investigative journalism with honest fact checkers . A station like the animal network and the people on it , would never have been accepted back in Cronkite 's day . It really got bad when Bush took office and his people knew they were going to tell a lie to get us to go to war . Some of the stories they wanted to fool the public with would not past muster with the Cronkite 's of the world . So they got rid of the honest unbiased newmen , Jennings , Rather , Brokaw , Koppel . They even set Dan Rather up because they did not think he would go quietly . None of the old timers would play the game that the special interest lobbies who are tight with the network owners wanted to play . We have done a foolish thing by allowing a handful of people to own the majority of our media . And we have really done a foolish thing by not having FCC rules that you must be American born to own and control any media outlet in the United States of America . When you control the media , you can control knowledge and thinking . Put that together with the dumbing down of Americans or ones who are too lazy to research and read , then you have the robots and their followers at the animal network . We claim to have freedom of the press but that is not totally true . Example : what do you think would happen if one of these news personalities went on air and said `` We have to pull back off the story and Mubarak is staying in power because Israel prefers it that way '' They would be fired and thrown off air faster than Rick Sanchez . I agreed with Charlton Heston when Michael Moore asked him why he thought crime had increased , people caalled me racist but I 'm not . Another example would be the way the media started out reporting the aids epidemic , special groups wanted them to stop connecting the word `` gay '' to it and put pressure on the Center for Disease control to watch how they release their findings . Look at what happened to Lou Dobbs just because he was fighting against illegal aliens who broke the law and companies out sourcing jobs . He lost me as a fan when he started on the Commander in Chief . No matter how much you disagree with him , the Cronkite 's of years ago would never disparage our President the way he did , especially on International Television . That was left to politians and others , not newsmen . That 's why he is now on a network without principles . I do n't believe in hate or intolerance , we need to be able to hear the factual truth without fear , not opinions and personal commentaries . February 7 , 2011 at 2:15 pm | Report abuse | When will the Colin Firth interview on Piers Morgan Tonight be rescheduled ? MARON There was one report that Muslims were going to protect Christians while they had a Mass in the Square . I would be interested if you think that the Muslims , Jews and Christians will be supportive of each other in whatever new government is developed . Craig , that is a good question for Anderson . I think they will all be supportive of each other , if they all got equal treatment . Whenever there is inequality , you will have problems . Stand two children next to each other , then give one a big popsicle and a hug , and give the other a smaller popsicle without a hug , then watch the latters reaction . You can use the same concept with adults or nations . There must be equality and fairness for all . God Bless I know I 'm off topic , but I do n't know where else to write . I have been tuning in for the past 10 days and yet somehow I missed the interview with Colin Firth and Jeffrey Rush . Did it actually run or is it still pending ? The Firth interview has not been shown yet ... Mr. Morgan seems to think that all anyone is interested in is constant repeat information about Egypt . He has advertised the Firth Interview now twice and then at the last minute pulls it . A real insult to his viewers . I find it hard to fathom how he thinks jerking viewers around like this ... advertising a program and then without notice changing it will get him a loyal audience . But if you check further on this sight you will see how angry the people are at him for this constant bait and switch !! As news change so must scheduled line-ups . When important news stories come about you have to move things around a bit . February 7 , 2011 at 11:19 am | Report abuse | I 'm as big a Colin Firth fan as the next ridiculous hero-worshiping American woman , but really ... such venom ! It 's a friggin ' news channel . Honestly , the interview is n't going anywhere ... it 'll air ! Hmmm ... lemme see ... should CNN programming revolve around unrealistic , unsatisfied romantic women who want to drool over an English actor or covering a world changing revolution about democracy as it was unfolding . It 's not like Piers signs a contract in blood when he announces his lineup , for cryin ' outloud ! I think most rational people udnerstand it is `` SUBJECT TO CHANGE '' . Kind of like what 's for dinner . Honestly , I think Colin is probably patient enough to know his interview will air as schedules and BREAKING NEWS AROUND THE WORLD allow . The rest of us should , too . BTW , Colin - you are devastatingly handsome and I do love you , but I 'm willing to wait for you . February 7 , 2011 at 4:57 pm | Report abuse | Just wanted to let everyone know , I am one that thinks Anderson made the right choice . I realize someone has to cover the news in the hot spots . However , I love Anderson 's sense of humor , and would like to see more of it . I think he has had enough Drama in his life and it is time for a change . I do not want any-one to come home in a body bag , but the world would loose a great heart if Anderson was bagged . Anderson has so much more to give with his words and needs to share his talent of writing with us . - Paul Stathakis from Montreal , Quebec -LRB- Canada -RRB- Anderson you and Wederman , not Christianne deserve an award for your coverage . Mubarak gave an interview to the person he knew would soft peddle his dictatorship and removal . Please take the stand that the female reporter in Egypt took , and do n't be a part of the media controlled groups . No country or group is a true friend if they ask America to do something wrong that goes against who we claim to be and what we claim to believe in which is , freedom and democracy for all . A true friend would not ask you to do something wrong . There are people who put pressure on the U.S. Media to sway this story and make the public believe if Mubarak leaves office , the big bad scary wold -LRB- muslim brotherhood -RRB- will move in . Those people will not trade one dictator and oppressor for another . Those protesters are begging us for help in obtaining freedom and democracy and if we turn our back on them , they will feel hopeless and that is what will make them latch onto radical groups . When we sent thousands of young American men and women to war in Iraq saying we were there to liberate them and bring freedom and democracy , how to we turn our backs on Egypt ? How do we call a brutal dictator like Mubarak a friend just because he did what we paid him to do ? Can you begin to imagine what will happen to the protesters or family members of them , especially the ones who work to get the messages out , once the media leaves Egypt ? Murbarak is so desperate to stay in power , he will stage a phony terrorist act against his own people or even Israel , to make it look like he must stay in power to help Israel thwart any additional acts . He could set up some of the protesters like he alreay tried to do with this phony story about an assassination attempt on the new VP . , and this mess with a broken gas pipe on fire . Won `` t trade one dictator for another ... wow you must be very young !!! ever hear of Iran ? Just because we score lower academically than several other countries does not mean we Americans are stupid . Mubarak is getting rid of the journalist , and will fool the protesters away from Liberation Square , then do some serious damage to Egypt and the protesters . That is why he must be made to step down now , not later . Concessions , when I see these reporters act as if Mubarak has made some great concessions and the protesters should be satisfied , they are either brainless or being told how to swing the story . The first and only concession Mubarak should make is to leave . A sinister game is being played . All of the sudden Mubarak will hold talks with the bug bad wolf -LRB- muslim brotherhood -RRB- the very people they painted as sooooo scary . It does not matter if the whole world is watching , Mubarak can change laws today and unchange them tomorrow , and no one in the world will go to the rescue of those people . We are hippocrits if we turn away . Mubarak is on his way out in September , so why not get cozy with the next group who will take his place by helping to bring freedom and democracy , they will owe us , and remain friends . Or they will remember when they were begging for it and we turned our backs . Iran is not Egypt , an education will help you truly understand the differences . Not only are the cultural and religious beliefs different , but they do n't even like each other . Eygpt is fighting for personal rights and freedoms as citizens . Sorry Lynn , they are right . Iran and Egypt very different people and causes Kudos Anderson for great coverage of Egypt . I agree with the person who said you should get an award . This is a Yes , or No , answer . No smoke and mirrors roundabout answers please . Former Secretary James Baker has admitted Mubarak is a dictator and should leave , Do you think dictators are ok , as long as they do what we want ? Why do you think American Journalist are now down playing the need for Mubarak to go immediately ? If Journalist from around the world came to cover Americans uprising against their government , do you thing our security agencies or others would find a way to prevent them from covering the story , and would our government cut off our ability to get the story out , such as Twitter , Internet , etc. ? During the Iraqi war , we did almost the same thing . Americans were prevented from gaining access to Al-Jezeera 's news and website , so we could read other points of views of what was going on in Iraq . If you find time to give an answer to any of these questions , Thank you . I think Anderson went in there and stirred the pot but did n't finish the job . A reporter at Democracy Now was able to go into the square and capture footage when Anderson went into hiding . Not a fan of this new style of reporting where a lot of questions are asked by the reporter and then they do n't stay around for the answers and resolutions . To me a lot of the field reporting today is full of fractured sound bites and incomplete thoughts trying to support one agenda or another . That is why most people are going to the internet , you can scan a lot more information more readily , read tweets from the people on the ground and get different points of view . I do not really trust any television reporter to give me the news . Those days are long gone . Bravo !!! someone not easily taken in by the 24\\/7 hype . How come the reporters seemed to spend all their time in the square instead of going out and actually talking to the other 82 million egyptians who have to work for a living . If all these protesters are so poor how come they all have cell phones ... internet ... and can sit in the square for two weeks ! I admire courage as much as the next person and I hope Egypt ... a great people ... get out of this with a better ... freer ... life ... however the re ; porters are just stirring the pot ... as always . CNN should show the `` abuse '' of journalists in Egypt and what better way to show this , than to show what Anderson Cooper went through . I think it sneds the message straight home to people . That foregin news correspondents are no different than military men and women who risk their lives everyday for us . Unfortunately , media does not have weapons to help in defending themselves . I think Anderson Cooper coming `` home '' was the right decision everyone needs a break , not to mention the mental stress that this has to cause . If in a couple of months he can go back than good for him . If not than that 's okay to . He can do just as much good reporting from New York , and being safe and still bringing the events of the day to the American people . Like a Military personnwl I will say thank you to Anderson Cooper and all the media people for risking their lives , and sometimes people around the world do n't realize how dangerous these assignments are for you both mentally and physically . What are the chances that women will be represented in the new Egyptian government . Are there any prominent woman Egyptian leaders who have emerged and will have a seat at the table and\\/or can take a leadership role going forward ? Frst of all I would like to tell you how inspired I was of how courageous and brave of a reporter you are . I would like to know is , what was the most shocking scene that you witnessed while being in Egypt ? I too could n't help thinking ... what is poor Anderson 's mother going through . I love your reporting and humility . Always apologizing for broadcasting conditions like low lighting Really ! Do n't apologize you are out there risking your life . My question is do you actually BELIEVE ANYONE . Every expert has a different take but I think they have a different agenda and I have come to not trust or believe anyone . Whom do you believe is being forth right here ? El Baradei , Muslim Brotherhood , Mubarak etc ? Thank you In retrospect , was covering the protest the correct story for a recognized and respected American international journalist to cover in Egypt , or do you think it would have been more relevant and appropriate for you to have covered why and how the US government at the heart of a democracy came to and continued to endorse Mubarack , a dictator , for so many decades ? Its a shame that the US supports and prop up many governments that are tyrants . Mubarak and Omar Suleiman need to be removed ; however , that leaves a void for any militant organization to take charge . Therefore , the Egyptian people need to decide on whom they would like to be president and vice president so they can slide in when Mubarak and Suleiman slide out ! Does anyone know why the interview with Anderson did n't air on Monday ? : That is such a perfect rrsouece that you are providing and you give it away for free .

Unless the pipe is repaired quickly , it could become a big problem for Jordan , a country already spending heavily in fuel subsidies , a Jordanian senior official said . Read more ... February 6th , 2011 11:14 am ET Current events in the middle east have become very clear . Here are a few details which will help you understand . OPEC is an oil cartel\\/monopoly which is run by 11 heads of state from the middle east . American statesmen have declared that the price of oil is inflated because of this monopoly . They think OPEC 's monopoly threatens Americas need for cheap oil . They think if OPEC should be broken up -LRB- Lets say OPEC group A & OPEC group -RRB- then competition between rival OPEC A & B would drive down the price of oil . Next you must be aware that the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt has been set up and funded by Britain 's MI5 since the 1920s . The Muslim Brotherhood were used by the British to revolt against President Nasser during the Suez crisis . The Muslim Brotherhood are calling for revolution throughout the middle east . This equates to Britain and her allies wanting revolution throughout the middle east . Couple this with Americans calling for the breakup of OPEC and it becomes clear that the plan by the west is to dismantle this area . For example , if Saudi Arabia exploded into revolution it may split into North Saudi and South Saudi . With all the middle east in revolution the 11 OPEC members could be split into 22 OPEC members . But the 22 will be rivals , form separate groups and create competition in oil sales which will drive down the price . However the game cant end with a breakdown of OPEC . The resulting cheap oil will also be available to China . For America to control the cheap oil , it will need to keep the area in a state of constant chaos and on the edge of war . This will create the excuse for America to deploy its military and pretend that its in the region to create peace . The exchange for this calculated peace will be for the cheap oil to be directed to America . Some will argue that most of the dictators in the middle east are puppets installed by America and that the USA is already in control . This is correct , but only to a certain level . Most of the American backed middle east dictators have become +30 year family dynasties . They will follow America to a point . But if the USA wants utter turmoil which can threaten the succession of the family dynasty , the dictators will defy the will of America . i.e. for Mubarak it was more important that his son takes power , obeying the USA had become a secondary priority . America threw the stone of revolution in the middle east and tried hide its hand . Thats why they started with claims of support for Mubarak . It was not supposed to look like an American driven revolt . But when Mubarak found a way to cling onto power , the Americans realized their plan may fail . Hence the Americans started to announce Mubarak must go . There is no confusion in America , only a fear that their plan may not work . America hopes ElBaradei will take control of Egypt as he is their man and will follow the instructions needed to help break up OPEC and spread revolt . Israelis will now find that for 60 years they have been sleeping with the American mafia . It was fine for them as America -LRB- once the only super power -RRB- would back Israel in any crime or illegal occupation . Israelis were laughing at the Arabs as the grabbed more and more land with American support . But now America has a plan for middle east rebellion and instability to breakup OPEC . The instability needs to last generations , so the USA can have its military there to ensure the USA gets all the oil it wants . With this agenda , Mubarak and peace between Israel and Egypt is expendable . With turmoil in the middle east both Muslim and Jew will die and suffer . Israel is about to learn that when you sleep with the mafia you are expendable . Now some Israelis have a dream of a greater Israel which includes parts of Egypt , Jordan , Syria and Saudi Arabia . Some Israeli leaders may see the turmoil as a chance for more military victories and a chance to grab more land . They will sell the idea of conflict on the Israelis as they believe it will be for the countries greater good . Nevertheless , the price will be paid in Jewish and Muslim blood . Mubarak has played some extremely difficult cards with brilliance . He knows he has been betrayed by America and is probably buying time to establish better relations with Russia , China and Turkey . All the other Arab dictators have also seen how America may betray them . So do n't be surprised if China or Russia are invited to open naval or air bases in the middle east soon . America has taken an enormous gamble which will be paid for by everyone in the middle east . My guess is ; in the long term it will also accelerate the decline of American influence in the area . Conclusion , Israel better get to the negotiating table quickly and offer something that can be considered reasonable and serious . Get as much regional agreement as possible while you still hold the upper hand . The dynamics of the middle east are changing and you ca n't rely on the benefits of American mafia styled politics . America can wait for Mubarak to leave in September . The next opportunity for the USA to generate chaos now looks like it will be after he steps down . The next vote will be crooked as always and the dissatisfaction of the people will again be whipped up into anarchy . February 6th , 2011 4:45 pm ET p.s. Egyptian people have genuine concerns . Most of these concerns are based on the cost of living and limited chances to feed their families . The IMF -LRB- largely run by USA & UK -RRB- instructed Egypt to cut food subsidies or face a reduced credit rating . Its called banking poor countries into submission . They new Egyptian people would not be able to afford to eat and then they would blame the government . The IMF was the political tool used to spark this crisis . The the people of Jordan were then inspired by Egyptian protest and also start to protest themselves over their poor living conditions . And surprise surprise they have their gas cut off . An act intended to increase dissatisfaction in Jordan . How many more dirty tricks will we see in the Anglo American attempt to destabilize the middle east , cause revolt and breakup OPEC . People of the world from America to Jordan , from Egypt to Israel better start realizing they are all expendable pawns in the game played by our out of control governments -LRB- Goverments who serve the military industrial complex and banks , they dont serve you -RRB- . On a closing note Liberty and human rights are not subjects for governments to meddle with . On the other hand Democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on whats for lunch . Instead of crowing about democracy in the world , we should be focusing on Liberty . The founding fathers of America said , `` Give me Liberty or Give me death '' . They did not ask for democracy , as democracy can be interpreted in so many different ways -LRB- As we have discovered via wiki leaks -RRB- . If the West 's focus was on human liberty our politicians would be greatly limited in their ability to manipulate the lives of the people they were elected to serve . February 7th , 2011 4:18 am ET Good Analysis . We need more about Mahdi coming and Jesus coming to face the anti christ and the armagadon . The MI5 is a British domestic counter-terrorism force . They would have had little role in Egypt of the 1920s . If the British had any role in supporting the creation of the Muslim Brotherhood it may have been their interest in the social institutions they were setting up in British controlled Egypt but , as has been proven many times , this was only one element in their agenda . It is rediculous to suggest that while the British were trying to prevent German infiltration in the 1930s they would be supporting the Brotherhood who were working with the Nazis to defeat the British . Although doubtless there have always been British Arabists who would do anything to promote the Arab cause even to the detriment of their own nation . Your comments are little more than anti-Western conspiracy and propaganda . Miriam , you are so sweet and simple in mind . The Egyptians did n't like it . So Britain created a radical group to convince the people anarchy would replace Britain . Does that sound familiar to you . But in your sweet simple world there are no spies or dirty tricks . In fact the thought of a country manipulating information is a wild conspiracy theory . Do n't you think its time to grow up . The real world does n't guarantee a Walt Disney happy ever after . Where do you get your facts from ? They are not supported by anything to be found on the internet . Do you have a secret library of sources only available to you ? I have covered a lot of issues . Name the ones you would like more information on and I will point you to the sources . In fact you will find them on the web if you try a little harder with your research . But be warned , if you can support facts on this web site , some will try to say its just cut and paste . If you do n't offer sources of information , others will say the sources do n't exist . Meanwhile most people just type in blogs that have no thinking behind them at all . I love your analysis becuase they align with my thinking about America and her allieds , particularly when it comes to political and economic interest . But they often forget that what goes around comes around . I think the solution to these problems confronting humanity is to form a universal government where all humans are giving equal liberty . Meaning that the more we tolerate geographical barrier , entry visa , racial distinction , all sorts of political associations etc. the more humanity sinks into these problems . The Arabs were not the only ones trying to negotiate with the Nazis . `` As late as 1941 , the Zionist group LEHI , one of whose leaders , Yitzhak Shamir , was later to become a prime minister of Israel , approached the Nazis , using the name of its parent organization , the Irgun -LRB- NMO -RRB- ... -LRB- The proposal stated : -RRB- ` The establishment of the historical Jewish state on a national and totalitarian Pd bound by a treaty with the German Reich would be in the interests of strengthening the future German nation of power in the Near East ... The NMO in Palestine offers to take an active part in the war on Germany 's side ' ... The Nazis rejected this proposal for an alliance because , it is reported , they considered LEHI 's military power ` negligible . ' Allan Brownfield in `` The Washington Report on Middle Eastern Affairs '' , July\\/August 1998 . February 9th , 2011 11:38 am ET Izma says , `` the solution to these problems confronting humanity is to form a universal government '' A universal government means one leader for all the world . This is in fact a definition for dictatorship . Be very careful for what you wish for . In my opinion the real solution is less government , more law which protects human rights and the let people manage their own lives . People manage their lives better than government . What governemnt actually is popular and successfull ? Sad answer : non . So lets drop the global goverment idea which is more or less the meaning behind the story 1984 . What you fail to mention in your regurgitated anti-Israel propaganda is that the Lehi , a group with no single political , religious or economic ideology whose members ranged from the far-right to the far-left before and after the re-establishment of the Jewish state , was unpopular within the Jewish population and rejected by the Jewish leadership for its terrorist activities . Many members had served with the British against the Nazis at the start of WW2 but with the British Mandate anti-immigration policy which left thousands of Jewish refugees fleeing Europe having to return straight back to extermination camps , some became staunchly anti-British and anti-imperialist . A wild , and for obvious reasons , unpopular proposal sent to the Nazi party suggested that they could solve their `` problem '' with the presence of Jews in Europe by allowing their emigration to a Jewish state . At the same time , they would continue with their shared aim of defeating the British . Claiming that the British established the Brotherhood is as stupid as suggesting that the British created the Lehi , that is , excluding the reactionary contribution . But then again , some of the conspiracies we read here are that stupid . The proposal by Shamir is not a conspiracy theory but a fact and people were so outraged that they elected him PM of Israel . The spin you have tried to put on facts of history is just so much BS . . As we say '' this dog wo n't hunt '' . February 11th , 2011 8:38 pm ET Do n't think America is behind this at all ! This was all precipitated by the backwards economic programs in all these Arab nations , run by Monarchs or Totalitarian leaders . The spark that set it off was a Tunisian setting himself on fire over the problems in Tunisia , and Egyptians responded that they were all suffering from the same thing . All over the Arab\\/Muslim world , including Iran , the problems are the same . The rest of the world is progressing faster and these people were being left behind , largely because of the ineptitude of their leadership . Revolution is the hardest thing until it is done , now the hardest thing will be establishing a new order , one that actually fulfills some of the people 's aspirations . There is no reason Egypt 's people ca n't be productive or modern as anywhere , but it will take time to achieve that and in the meantime they have to worry about feeding themselves . All they have done is gotten rid of a bad leader , that does n't mean they do n't have real problems that need to be addressed before things get better . Are n't the people in Egypt going through what America did in gaining it 's independence ? Ultimately political power lies with the people , if the Army wo n't fire on them , then their will is more likely to come into being . They need a full overhaul of their government , their constitution and their policies . Many regions of the world which were once colonized have eventually emerged with a hope to rule themselves . We have many examples from Africa and South America . Unfortunately all newly liberated countries soon wake up to reality . Their history included occupation by a foreign military . This is quickly replaced with stealth colonialism controlled by banks . No country is free through the word `` democracy '' . Freedom is built via fair trade and resultant financial stability . Freedom also requires laws to protect human rights . The post colonial powers and America have always spoken with hypocrisy . They claim they want a democratic and prosperous world and then use their established power to ensure the people of developing regions can not compete within a fair market place . Besides if Egypt freely and democratically elects a government which calls American & Israeli corruption to account , we know western media will declare Egypt to be a hostile Islamic state . This in itself will be hypocritical , because in America its okay to have a Jewish state , but its wrong to have an Islamic state . Egypt is far from being free , but its suppressors are not all within Egypt . One good thing I noticed is that all Egyptians interviewed on the street are aware of American hypocrisy . As one said so well after Obama 's latest speech , `` We started this revolution without the help of America and we will end it without the help of America '' . Needless to say America now busily does all it can to ensure Egyptians choose a leader wanted by the Whitehouse . Now if we really care about democracy , we should do everything possible to ensure that the Egyptians choose who they want and the world community supports their choice without economically pressuring them into a leadership the west prefers . Who called it a conspiracy theory ? You are correct it is a fact but over exaggerate it 's significance . Not only did almost all the Jewish leadership reject the proposal including other Lehi members , the Nazis rejected it primarily because it contradicted their objectives in collaborating with Arab leaders . WRT Shamir 's election to PM , as is common in virtually all societies , those who fought for independence are often elected as political leaders although in Israel 's case , they were given many years to prove that their militant activities had been well and truly abandoned . This is was you wrote : `` some of the conspiracies we read here are that stupid . '' At least get right it right . Enough already with your BS ! Conspiracy in relation to the Brotherhood being created by MI5 . You do n't need to twist my words . you are the BSter , you have no idea about facts , you lie , falsify history and support the jew hating antisemite john cut-and-paste A February 20th , 2011 10:56 am ET Proud Zionist has escaped from his nurses again .

From CNN 's Anderson Cooper , to ABC 's Christiane Amanpour , from CBS 's Lara Logan to Fox 's Greg Palkot , correspondents have been attacked , beaten , chased , threatened , arrested , and detained . How do you cover a dangerous story when you become a target for the mob ? Our guests include Katie Couric , just back from Egypt , and Sam Donaldson . From Cairo to Jerusalem to Britain to here in Washington , we 'll look at the way the crisis is being portrayed , the coverage of President Obama , the unorthodox criticism by Glenn Beck , the Egyptian television reporter who quit in protest , the trashing of Al Jazeera 's offices , and why the press never saw this coming . I 'm Howard Kurtz , and this is RELIABLE SOURCES . Journalists who race off to hot spots are accustomed to taking risks , but when violence erupted between Egyptian protesters and pro- government agitators , correspondents were not just caught in the crossfire , they were specifically targeted . It 's a harrowing list , reporters from `` The New York Times '' and `` Washington Post '' arrested and released . Lara Logan and her CBS crew first marched back to her hotel at gunpoint and later detained by police before being released . ABC correspondent Brian Hartman threatened with beheading by a group of angry Egyptians who let his crew go only after a plea from their Lebanese cameraman . Fox News correspondent Greg Palkot and his cameraman , badly beaten , then detained before being hospitalized for the injuries , released only after the Obama administration interceded . Some of these incidents were captured on tape , beginning with the one involving Anderson Cooper , who later started reporting from an undisclosed location . ANDERSON COOPER , CNN ANCHOR : We were set upon by a crowd of pro- Mubarak supporters , punching us , trying to rip the clothes off my producer , trying to take the camera from my cameraman , punching me in the head several times in the body . All of us were punched . I do n't mind telling you , I am a little scared because we frankly do n't know what the next few hours will hold . And I think there 's a lot of people who are scared tonight in Egypt . CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR , `` THIS WEEK WITH CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR '' : We left that angry crowd and got into our car . They forced us into our car . And as we started to drive off , they hit the car with their fists over and over again , and threw a rock through the front window . The glass is shattered all over our driver . Did they hurt you ? ARWA DAMON , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : As we are filming from a bridge , this man starts yelling at us to stop . `` Why are you filming ? '' `` Is this a nice image ? It 's ugly . '' He threatens to break our camera . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : Why is everybody so angry with the media ? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Because it does n't give a very good picture about us . KURTZ : One of network anchors who went to Egypt was Katie Couric , who found herself in the thick of the story . KATIE COURIC , CBS NEWS : This ancient city is the epicenter of an uprising by the people of this country who say now is the time for a new Egypt . And when the man many believe represents the old Egypt finally spoke to the people today , it only stoked the fires of rage and resentment . KURTZ : I spoke to the anchor and managing editor of the `` CBS Evening News '' a few moments ago by phone from New York . KATIE COURIC , `` CBS EVENING NEWS '' : Hi , Howie . KURTZ : You waded into that crowd in Cairo . We just saw that clip . Why did you decide to do that ? It looks like things got pretty tense there for a few minutes . COURIC : I think that was in the initial stages of the tension . You know , we had been shooting from other things . I had an interview with Amr Moussa , who is the secretary general of the Arab League , and then went and talked to Mohamed ElBaradei . And we had heard that things were getting a bit dicey in the square . So of course we decided , well , let 's go and find out what 's going on . And it was very clear as we tried to get into the square itself -- we were just actually on a road leading to the square -- that things had taken a very ugly turn . The atmosphere had changed dramatically from the night before , when it felt , as I said on the `` Evening News , '' like a turbo charged street festival . All these pro-Mubarak industry protesters were marching into the square sort of in pretty big numbers . And their attitude toward the media was very , very different than the anti- government protesters . At first I thought -- COURIC : Well , yes , I was a little nervous . But at first , I just thought it was a boisterous crowd . You know , when you have a television camera , it sometimes attracts some pretty crazy behavior , people wanting to get in the shot , wanting to scream and yell and carry on and make faces and signs , et cetera . So I thought , really , it was just one of those situations , but it became clear pretty quickly that this was a very different scenario , that this was fueled by a great deal of anger and animosity towards the press , towards the United States . And when I got surrounded , and this one sort of young Egyptian man pushed me , I thought -- I looked at his eyes , and they were so full of rage . I thought , gee , this is a pretty precarious situation I need to walk away from here , and so that 's what I did . I just kind of walked away and got out of there . KURTZ : It kind of leads to my next question . Some people are saying , you know , maybe American anchors should n't go into these volatile situations . They attract so much attention . Perhaps they become targets and distract from the story . I can see both sides of that argument . What do you think ? COURIC : Well , I do n't really see the one side of the argument . I mean , first of all , no one knew I was an anchor . They saw me as another journalist , as far as I know . And , you know , hopefully people who are in anchor roles have spent years out in the field reporting and have covered some of the biggest stories that have unfolded across the world for a fair amount of time and are experienced . And so , you know , I think that you have to be smart and responsible and use good judgment . But I do n't really think that we were necessarily targeted in terms of being anchors . I heard of journalists getting abused from `` The New York Times , '' from French news agencies . I talked to a couple of still photographers who had their cameras taken by the police and their film confiscated . So I do n't think people were making judgments and saying , oh , she 's the anchor of the `` CBS Evening News , '' let 's go after her . But on that point , clearly they were going after some journalists . And when we reached that 48-hour period where Anderson Cooper of CNN was attacked , where your CBS colleague Lara Logan was arrested and eventually released , what was your reaction to these attacks being in the middle of that cauldron ? COURIC : Well , obviously , it was very unnerving . And , I mean , I think it was pretty clear why they were doing it . You know , I think heretofore , most of the coverage of the anti- government protesters had been pretty positive . And the government clearly knew they were losing the propaganda war , if you will . And they wanted these images coming out of Tahrir Square and elsewhere to stop . So what 's the best way of doing that ? It 's obviously to intimidate , threaten and attack reporters . KURTZ : Of course , but that then became the story . And the government got a whole new wave of bad publicity . While you were in Egypt , Katie , to what extent were you able to get a sense of the passion of these protesters and why some of these people who were not especially political in the past were joining a mass protest that frankly none of us had seen coming ? COURIC : Well , I think that , clearly , this had been simmering for a long time . I had Lara Logan go a piece in Alexandria last week on Khaled Saeed , who was a young Egyptian man who had been beaten up by the police because he was really what ignited this -- partially ignited this tinderbox of simmering anger and rage . He was beaten up by police . A Facebook page was started . I think it 's fascinating , the role social media played in this . I do n't think you can say it was solely the result of social media , but I think it spread the word like wildfire and got young people incredibly engaged and organized in this process in a way that they would n't otherwise have been able to do . But I think that , you know , people -- the joblessness , jobless rate , the lack of employment is so terrible in Egypt , the poverty rate is so intense and severe . And I think people were just -- their anger just came to the surface . And I think that they -- it was really a people 's revolution . People felt empowered , and you felt that when you went in Tahrir Square the first night I got there , because it was a peaceful protest , and you felt like people were actually going to speak out and try to enact change . And it was actually an incredibly inspiring thing to witness . KURTZ : And a revolution that is still unfolding before our eyes . Katie Couric , we 're glad you 're back home safe . Thanks very much for joining us . -LRB- END VIDEOTAPE -RRB- KURTZ : And we 're continuing our coverage of the unfolding events in Egypt . Joining us now from Cairo , Christopher Dickey , Paris bureau chief and Middle East regional editor for `` Newsweek . '' In Jerusalem , Janine Zacharia , who covers the Middle East for `` The Washington Post . '' She 's just back from Egypt . And here in Washington , Frank Sesno , former CNN Washington bureau chief and now professor of Media and Public Affairs at The George Washington University . Frank Sesno , to some extent , these brutal attacks against journalists by these thugs who are working for -- or in the employ of the Mubarak regime , did n't they backfire ? FRANK SESNO , THE GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY : Yes , they did backfire , because they turned an even harsher glare on the regime in Egypt , they distracted the world , in a sense , from the debate of the street , and put it on these sort of -- the human rights essentially , the human rights record . And it turned the -- I think you could argue that it turned the Obama administration , many other governments around the world , even more harshly toward the notion that there needs to be real deep and lasting change , because this veneer of civilization is being challenged . KURTZ : Chris Dickey , in Cairo , as somebody has been there through most of this story , what was the government hoping to gain by going after journalists , arresting them , threatening them , in many cases physically attacking them ? It just seems like this has made the coverage more negative toward that regime . CHRISTOPHER DICKEY , MIDDLE EAST REGIONAL EDITOR , `` NEWSWEEK '' : Well , absolutely , it has . But the regime was n't thinking about the coverage in that sense . It was thinking about its domestic constituency , what it was going to tell the people here in Egypt . And it wanted to tell them that this protest in Tahrir Square , that 's not Egyptian , it 's all a foreign conspiracy . It 's all being run by these -- these journalists are all part of that foreign conspiracy . And that 's why although we 're talking about journalists , really , it 's worse than that . You 've not only had attacks on journalists , you 've had attacks on people just because they were foreigners . And this has just been the constant drumbeat of the Mubarak administration , even as the people who have been appointed to run things now , Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq and Vice President Omar Suleiman are saying , oh , we 're against attacking foreigners , we 're against attacking journalists . What we 're seeing is one thing being said to the outside world and another thing being said to incite the people inside Egypt . And that 's a very old game by this regime . And Janine Zacharia , the pictures , of course , speak very loudly . And I wonder whether you think journalists kind of became the face of the thuggish tactics of the Mubarak regime when they were , in effect , providing first-person witness to the fact that people were willing to use guns and people were willing to use clubs and rocks against those who were trying to cover the story . JANINE ZACHARIA , JERUSALEM BUREAU CHIEF , `` THE WASHINGTON POST '' : Well , it 's no doubt that journalists became part of the story when it becomes this kind of high profile and you have senior top anchors flying in there . That 's going to be the case . But I thought , you know , one of things to point out here is that what this really showed -- and it echoes a little bit what Frank said , is sort of the history of how the Egyptians deal with their own media . I mean , they just do n't have a culture of free media , of people coming in . Even when I was there in Cairo the day -- the Thursday before the `` Day of Rage , '' so two days after that first protest , they had a press conference at the party headquarters , and you saw -- I was reminded again of how the Egyptian media are so cowed , they could n't ask the most obvious question that day , which namely was , where is President Mubarak ? We had n't seen him yet . They asked very simple questions . So , then , here you are , you 're the Egyptian regime , and you 're seeing all these people reporting all these things . You try shutting down their Internet and their phones , and that does n't work , so , instead , you arrest them . And it really shows the Egypt that the media has not covered -- the foreign media -- in any kind of serious , sustained way , at least for the last coupe of years . SESNO : There 's one other thing very interesting , Howie , that has been the backlash , as you say , from all this . I got an e-mail earlier this morning from Theo May , a young man who 's over there as a freelance journalist who spent a lot of time on the ground . He says one of things that these beatings and the harassment of these journalists has done has made it harder to write a story from the point of view of the Mubarak government , that he 's found , actually , in a lot of his travels , that there 's a fear bit of support for Mubarak in terms of the security -- the oasis of relative security that Egypt has become . You have activities like this on the street with reporters being targeted and harassed . Not going to write a story that 's favorable or has the point of view very favorably of the Egyptian government . KURTZ : But to some extent , Chris Dickey , it worked for a while in the sense that I saw fewer live shots for several days , we saw Anderson Cooper of CNN broadcasting from his hotel room , not in the streets . NBC 's Richard Engel has done an extraordinary job , up on a balcony for many of his live shots . So , did the regime get what it wanted , which was to kind of tamp down the live pictures of the clashes in that square ? DICKEY : Well , to the extent that that 's all it wanted , yes , it did reduce some of the coverage . The other vital thing that it did was shut down a lot of the camera positions in high-rise hotels around the square . That 's where it really started to black out the coverage . It was n't just the people going into the square . And yes , it 's been very scary going in and out . Often , when you 're in the square , there 's not that much of a problem . But going in and out , you wind up , all of a sudden , confronted by people , you 're not sure who they are . They 're carrying clubs , they may be very angry . You know , what you need to understand , though , is that this is something that the Egyptians have lived with for a long time . A lot of these thugs are normally employed by government party parliamentarians , and they 're used during elections to intimidate voters . It 's not like they just sprang out of nowhere . This is part of the system . And this is something that -- this is precisely what the people who are protesting are protesting against . DICKEY : And to the extent that they created a situation where the international journalistic community identified directly with those people and their problems , they created a disaster for public relations in Egypt . KURTZ : And now the whole world is seeing it close up . Janine Zacharia , I wonder if there was some irrational exuberance , to use a Wall Street term , in the early coverage of these protests . You have a front page story in `` The Washington Post '' today saying that maybe some observers , some journalists were expecting the Egyptian governments to topple rather quickly like Tunisia , and now it looks like it will be more of a long slog . ZACHARIA : I was n't one of those journalists , really . But I was wrong on the other end . I really thought this was going to be over in four days , having covered Egypt in one way or another for the last 15 years , knowing the way that they deal with these kinds of situations , and having been there just a few months ago and taken the pulse , and it was so different . So I think , yes , there was that euphoria of expectation . But I have to tell you , on that Friday night , that `` Day of Rage , '' when I 'm sure everybody was watching at home , those battles on the bridges , I was one of those journalists up in my hotel room , on the balcony , along with a lot of other journalists , because you could not physically breathe outside . They must have fired 2,000 cans of tear gas . Plus , the building next to me on fire . And I got a sense that night when the army rolled in . I did n't read it the same way everybody else did . I did n't think that , oh , this is the army with the people . I saw it more as , this is going to be a long stalemate , the army is here , it 's not really clear what their role is . And even now , today , we 're not rally sure how this is going to end , as I pointed out in my piece today . So it 's really -- ZACHARIA : I think we 're headed into a long battle here , yes . And where the pictures may not be quite as vital because the violence has subsided , at least for a moment . Let me get a break . We 'll continue our conversation in just a moment . KURTZ : And we 're continuing our conversation about the unfolding events in Egypt . Let me go back to Cairo and Christopher Dickey . Chris , it 's no secret that American media appetite for international coverage has shrunk over the years excepts in extraordinary situations like this . If the violence were to continue to subside , and we do n't have the dramatic pictures of protesters being -- you know , clashing with the pro-government agitators , and the story moves behind the scenes , negotiations , diplomacy , do you think coverage of this story within days will begin to fade a bit ? DICKEY : Oh , I think it 's already fading . I think you 've seen a lot of people leave . You know , the big anchors , they 're gone . The television coverage of not just the violence , the overall television coverage , has diminished considerably , and it will continue to do so . But the people who are in sort of quasi-leadership positions of the protest and of this movement , this democracy movement , they understand that perfectly well , and they 're looking for new ways to keep continuing the pressure on the government . And I think they are going to looking to the Americans to help them , but I think they also will have a lot of different tactics from boycotts and other kinds of measures that they can take , which wo n't be as mediagenic , but which may still help them achieve their goals . KURTZ : Frank Sesno , just because NBC 's Brian Williams and CBS ' Katie Couric and CNN 's Anderson Cooper have either left , or are in the process of leaving , does n't mean the coverage has to fade . But it seems to me that there was a narrative early on -- this was driven by Twitter , this was driven by Facebook -- and that Mubarak , somebody joked , will he be gone by the Super Bowl ? It does n't always work out quite so neatly , does it ? SESNO : It does n't work out quite so neatly . And the problem is , Howie , that we are utterly addicted to the picture . We are addicted to the narrative , to this great dramatic story . And when the great dramatic story of these millions of people in the streets suddenly fades , even though the story , what 's happening behind the scenes , is going to be more important , probably , to what happens to Egypt 's future , more important to the region , that 's going to require more and better and smarter coverage , not less . And we are in real danger here of missing the real story if everybody bails out of town -- not everybody , because this wo n't go away . We 'll still get the coverage , but will it get the attention that it needs ? And will we seize this , what needs to be a teachable moment for the world ? This a pivotal part of the planet , and what happens there matters to everybody . KURTZ : And Janine Zacharia , since you 're in Jerusalem , this is playing out very differently , is it not , in the Israeli press , which does n't welcome the toppling of Mubarak , which might be cheered in many corners in America ? Do Israeli commentators care less about the fact that he has been an autocrat for nearly three decades and looking at it more through the lens of Israeli security ? Clearly , the Israeli security issue definitely trumps . The narrative here is one of deep concern about what 's going to happen , especially the expectation that the Muslim Brotherhood will have some role in any new government . So you definitely see a lot of editorials along those lines . In terms of the news coverage , I would say though that even here , where this is really like an existential issue for Israel , the new coverage is starting to fade . Today 's front page does not have a story about Egypt . It 's trumped by a fire at IKEA that burned down yesterday , and the story about the appointment of the next chief of staff . So , yes , it 's certainly of concern to the leaders . But how long Israelis will sustain interest , I 'm not quite sure . And , of course , tonight the big story will be the Super Bowl here in the United States . And Bill O'Reilly interviewing President Obama . He 'll do a big number for that . Janine Zacharia in Jerusalem , Christopher Dickey in Cairo , Frank Sesno , here , thanks very much for joining us . We 're going to take a commercial break . Our coverage continues on the other side . HOWARD KURTZ , HOST : Welcome back . We 're going to go now to Spokane Washington and talk to Lawrence Pintak . He 's a former Middle East correspondent for CBS News , the founding dean of the Edward R. Murrow College of Communication at Washington State University . Lawrence , you 've written about Al Jazeera and its crucial role in the Egyptian events of the last two weeks . Why is that Arab satellite network , in your view , been so important ? LAWRENCE PINTAK , FMR . MIDDLE EAST CORRESPONDENT , CBS NEWS : You can draw a direct line from the birth of the Arab media revolution which started with Jazeera 's launch in '96 and this uprising . Social media has been very important for the activists to organize in this uprising . But the fact that people can watch this play out on television has been the game-changer . KURTZ : Why are we -- you lived in Cairo for some time . Leaving aside the pro-Mubarak thugs who were sent out there to rough up protesters and journalists , why are we not seeing from the crowds more hostility toward Americans , American journalists in general , and in particular ? Was that revealing at all ? PINTAK : Well , there 's never been hostility toward American journalists on the part of the average Egyptian . There has been hostility toward the media on the part of the government . And what American journalists are enduring now is something that Egyptian journalists and other Arab journalists have endured for a very long time . KURTZ : There was , as you know -- I was going to play the clip , we do n't have it right now , a reporter for Nile TV who was going -- I 'm sorry , we do have it . Let 's roll that . I want to ask you about it on the other side . She resigned from the state-run television . Here 's her explanation . SHAHIRA AMIN , FMR . CORRESPONDENT : We were just covering the pro-Mubarak rallies , which I thought was ridiculous . And I do n't want to be part of their propaganda machine . And I heard the chants of the protesters and decided to get off in Tahrir Square and join the protesters , because I 'm siding with the people , not the regime . KURTZ : That was Shahira Amin . And I 'm sorry , she was surprised that Egyptian state-run television is n't fair and balanced and that she was only covering one side of the story ? PINTAK : Well , I suspect she was n't surprised . But the fact is that Arab journalists have been moving forward in how they approach their job for a long time . And obviously , the holdouts are those working for the overtly government-owned stations and papers . But we did a survey of Arab journalists a couple of years ago , and we found that 75 percent of them said they saw it as their mission to create political and social change . And that was even true of those on government-owned papers and TV stations , but they were a little more constrained in what they could do . KURTZ : All right . Lawrence Pintak , I have to interrupt you . We 're going to toss now to Candy Crowley for some breaking news . She 's going to talk to the Egyptian prime minister by phone -- Candy . CANDY CROWLEY , HOST , `` STATE OF THE UNION '' : I 'm Candy Crowley in Washington . We do indeed have the chance to interview Ahmed Shafiq . He is the prime minister of Egypt , and we have him on the phone now . Mr. Prime Minister , can you hear me ? AHMED SHAFIQ , EGYPTIAN PRIME MINISTER : Now I hear you good . Thank you so much . CROWLEY : Let me ask you first -- there are reports that the state of emergency , which I believe has been in place in Egypt since 1981 , has been lifted . Can you confirm that or deny it ? SHAFIQ : May I ask you kindly to repeat your message in a more louder voice , please ? I was asking , has the state of emergency in Egypt been lifted ? SHAFIQ : If you are speaking now concerning the emergency now in Egypt , the emergency situation , I do n't say that the problem be over now . But the situation today is extremely better than yesterday , and the discussion between the old factions are going on . We spoke together today with all the ideas , reaction -LRB- ph -RRB- , in the fields . Hopefully tomorrow or after tomorrow we will get better raises now , because I think the ideas are nearer each other now than before . CROWLEY : Mr. Prime Minister , our reporters on the scene in Cairo tell us that while you negotiate about a democratic process , there are still arrests of local and international human rights activists , as well as journalists . Why are you arresting them ? SHAFIQ : I did n't understand you . I did n't understand you . CROWLEY : We are told that you are arresting human rights activists and journalists . I do n't hear well . I do n't hear well now . CROWLEY : Can you tell us about President Mubarak ? Do you expect him any time soon to resign ? SHAFIQ : If you are speaking about the situation with President Mubarak now , you know that President Mubarak will leave in September . And now the discussion is if he 's able to leave before or not . We insist here in Egypt to continue his period until the end of September , the month of September , because during this period we will be headed by the president , and a lot of points must be covered before he leaves . So I think we are in bad need for the president -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- because that will be easier for us to fulfill the mission we are looking to get . CROWLEY : Will the demonstrators accept President Mubarak staying until September ? SHAFIQ : Because he 's -- the former period must be ended in September , and we have another six months to work with him , changing all the points , or working on changing all the points that we discussed with the majority of the ideas existing in the market here . And we think that this formal action must be respected , and no need to change this time as far as we are already changing all the needed points to be changed . CROWLEY : Mr. Mubarak will not leave until September . SHAFIQ : Yes , exactly , in September . CROWLEY : Let me ask you by arrests by the military police . Why are they arresting -- CROWLEY : About the detention of human rights activists . Why are you detaining them ? SHAFIQ : Oh , frankly speaking , there is some problem . It 's not intended at all , my dear . Frankly speaking , I insist to assure all the authorities here not to ban -LRB- ph -RRB- anyone or not to bother anyone doing his work -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . But during some periods as such the period we are passing now , we will not be -- it 's rather difficult to be sure 100 percent that this man or either man gets some bad behavior concerning the foreigners here , and he does n't understand their work or their job or something like that . So we have to excuse him for such action done with this group because this is not at all intended , my dear . And we insist to cover this point . And I repeat again , hopefully that will not be -- this phenomenon will not be existing after that . CROWLEY : We were told by our reporters today that you have arrested another Al Jazeera reporter from Al Jazeera English , as well as more human rights activists . And it 's the Egyptian military police . Do you have a way to get them to stop those arrests ? SHAFIQ : After our telephone now , after our call now , I will go directly to check this point . And if you permit me , I will give you an answer if there is something like that . But they are not allowed at all to do something like that . CROWLEY : We would appreciate a return call . That would be great . And finally , let me try one more time . CROWLEY : There are reports that the state of emergency that was imposed in Egypt in 1981 has been lifted . SHAFIQ : Frankly , I did n't understand your meaning now . Can you repeat it for me ? CROWLEY : A state of emergency declaration . Has that been lifted ? SHAFIQ : Do you want to say that keeping the case of emergency during the oldest period since 1981 until now , or something like that ? CROWLEY : Has the state of emergency been lifted ? SHAFIQ : I think if I understand perfectly your paragraph now , I think even this point is discussed now . And I do n't know . I ca n't give you my answer perfectly now because I ca n't get the meaning exactly that you mean . Thank you so much for taking the time . We look forward to talking to you again when you 've checked into these things . We totally appreciate your time . SHAFIQ : Please be sure that concerning our friends working here with us , I will assure now that nothing is banning the work , and excusing for any action like that against them . CROWLEY : Thank you so much . We look forward to that . I appreciate your time . Thank you , my dear . We 're going to take a quick break . When we come back , reliable sources . KURTZ : We pick up our coverage of the crisis in Egypt . Joining us now via an Internet connection , from Cambridge , England , is John Burns , chief foreign correspondent for `` The New York Times . '' And here in Washington , Abderrahim Foukara , Washington bureau chief for Al Jazeera English . Our thanks to Lawrence Pintak , who we spoke to earlier . Mr. Foukara , Egypt first banned Al Jazeera , as we discussed when you were on the program last week . Your Cairo office has been ransacked and burned . You 've had a couple of staff members detained and then released . Other news organizations as well . Do you feel like your network is being singled out by Egypt ? ABDERRAHIM FOUKARA , WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF , AL JAZEERA ENGLISH : Well , the feeling is that all networks and all news outlets have been targeted by these measures in Egypt . KURTZ : But only Al Jazeera has been banned . FOUKARA : But Al Jazeera in particular . And the reason is that Al Jazeera Arabic , which I work for , that 's obviously the most watched channel in Egypt and in the rest of the Arab region . So the coverage of Al Jazeera Arabic is of true consequence . But Al Jazeera English is of true consequence to the world at large , particularly here in the United States . So we have seen both channels actually harassed in different ways . KURTZ : You have managed to stay on the air most of the time , despite the fact that , officially , you 're not allowed to broadcast from Egypt . I mean , we have found all sorts of different ways to go around the ban . Both the Arabic and the English continue to operate from inside Egypt . Egypt continues to be the main story on both channels . KURTZ : John Burns , you reported for many years from Iraq , a very dangerous place for journalists . But the danger in Egypt is very different , is it not ? JOHN BURNS , CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT , `` THE NEW YORK TIMES '' : Hello ? KURTZ : We seem to be having an audio problem . We 'll see if we can go back to John Burns . So I 'll pick up with you , Abderrahim . Fascinating , that the Web site of Al Jazeera English , the traffic has increased 2,500 percent since this crisis began . That is the only way that most Americans can get Al Jazeera coverage . You 're on in only a couple of markets across the United States . Frank Rich , writing in `` The New York Times '' today -- the columnist -- saying that , this is censorship , his word , by America 's corporate gatekeepers . He compares Al Jazeera to the Voice of America behind the Iron Curtain . Now , censorship happens to be a term used for government , but do you feel like there 's been a concerted effort to keep Al Jazeera English off of the American airwaves ? FOUKARA : Well , I mean , we 've had different things and different interpretations over the years since Al Jazeera English was launched a few years ago . But , look , what matters now is that this is a huge story . It 's a huge story not just for Egyptians or Arabs , it 's a huge story obviously for the United States as well . The fact that Al Jazeera does provide this coverage is food for thought , whether it 's a conspiracy against Al Jazeera , censorship , whatever it is , but it provides a service that in crucial times like this , Americans do need to have it to see what 's going on in a story that affects them directly . KURTZ : There are those who say -- are very critical of Al Jazeera , say that it 's anti-American , say that it 's anti-Israel . I know you 've heard these criticisms before , but that -- I mean , you know , to some of these cable operators , these big companies , you have been kind of radioactive . FOUKARA : Well , look , criticism , you 'll always be criticized for one thing or another . All news media are imperfect media in an imperfect world . Talking of the Israelis , it 's interesting that the Israelis have over the years sort of appreciated the coverage of Al Jazeera more , perhaps , than people in other parts of the world like the United States or Canada . But ultimately , when you have a big story like this , and when you have not just the public , but even the international community scratching their heads and saying , how come this has come about ? And you have a channel that has been focusing on this story not just for weeks , but for months , it tells you something . That regardless of its flaws , it does provide crucial coverage of a crucial story . KURTZ : But do its flaws include a point of view ? Or are you trying to be fair , even to Americans , even to Israelis ? Certainly , there 's an American appetite now for Al Jazeera English . But are you trying to be fair , or do you have a point of view ? FOUKARA : Well , the reporters , for example , do sometimes approach the story from different angles , and that creates a controversy for sure . But both Arabic and English have provided open platforms not just to governments in the Arab world , but governments in Israel , governments in the United States , governments in Canada , other parts of the world . Everybody who has a point of view and is willing to express it comes to express it . If they do n't want to express it , that 's their problem . KURTZ : Abderrahim Foukara , appreciate your stopping by this morning . My apologies to John Burns of `` The New York Times . '' We could see him , but we could n't hear him , which is sometimes the danger of relying on an Internet connection . Let me get a break . Sam Donaldson and John Fund join us from the Reagan Library in California in just a moment . KURTZ : Joining us now at the Reagan Library , in Simi Valley , California , Sam Donaldson , longtime ABC correspondent and former host of `` This Week '' ; and John Fund , columnist for `` The Wall Street Journal . '' Sam Donaldson , I want to briefly touch on Al Jazeera . I just interviewed their Washington bureau chief . You had some nice things to say about the network 's coverage . Bill O'Reilly took issue with that . He said , `` Al Jazeera makes a living blaming most problems in the Middle East on the USA . SAM DONALDSON , FMR . ABC CORRESPONDENT : Yes . Do n't tell all the people here at the Reagan Library , will you ? Keep it under your hat . You know , Al Jazeera , I thought , performed a service in fanning the flames in Egypt . But , hey , is that so bad ? If Al Jazeera brings information to people in the Arab world , it makes them think they should throw over their dictators , should we complain ? Now , Howie , Al Jazeera says things about us we do n't like , and some things that are not true . And I certainly do n't subscribe to that , except a news service of any kind has got to be able to say whatever it wants , otherwise it 's a contradiction in terms . KURTZ : All right . Let me let John Fund say whatever he wants right now . JOHN FUND , COLUMNIST , `` THE WALL STREET JOURNAL '' : Well , I have toured Al Jazeera 's headquarters in Qatar , and I think they have come a long way . I remember back in 2003 and 2004 , they had one of their correspondents who was a paid spy for Saddam Hussein . I think they 've cleaned up their act . I think they 're providing better information . And frankly , the Arab street is never going to trust Western media . Al Jazeera is about as good as we 're going to get in terms of objective analysis for the Arab world , and I 'm glad that it 's there . KURTZ : Almost a qualifying endorsement from John Fund . Let me play for you a bit of Glenn Beck from Fox News Channel , getting a lot of attention this week for things he is saying about the situation in Egypt . We 'll ask you a question on the other side . GLENN BECK , FOX NEWS : Please , if you take anything away from this show , please be prepared . Look at Egypt right now . These were people that were not prepared . Tomorrow , the radicals here in America that are operating as Marxists and communists , that are in support of this -- but the Muslim Brotherhood is n't just operating overseas . We 're not done with them yet . We showed you in their own words that their goals include the transformation of America into an Islamic state , the destruction of the Western world . KURTZ : Sam , now , Glenn Beck has got a following . He 's got a rather unique style . He can say whatever he wants . But is there a point when he tries to tie the American left wing to the caliphate that 's going to take over the Middle East , where other commentators need to say , hey , this is pretty out there ? DONALDSON : You should have heard what Father Coughlin -- and I 've heard the radio tapes in the '30s -- call Franklin Roosevelt . We could n't use it on the air . It 's too bad when people want to make their case by just calling names . But I say to people , hey , if I 'm arguing with you , and you ca n't beat my argument with another argument , but you just to have call me a name , I win . So I would n't pay that much attention to him . It 's nonsense to think that we are going to have an Islamic state here . I mean , not in the lifetime of my great-great-grandchildren . I do n't know what the future is going to hold after that , but the diverse views in this country , I think , are a good thing . KURTZ : John Fund , no less a conservative than Bill Kristol of `` The Weekly Standard , '' writing the other day that when Beck uses this kind of language , he sounds like the John Birch Society and he marginalizes himself . Do you agree with that , or would you disagree ? FUND : Look , Glenn Beck is a commentator . And I think that part of his analysis is accurate . Look , we have to remember that the Iranian regime , when it collapsed , was going to be a democracy . Then it was hijacked by Islamic extremists , and we are still dealing with them 30 years later and their nuclear weapons . And obviously Europe has a lot more to worry about . You know , by 2030 , nine percent of Europe is going to be Muslim . But to carry that and take it into apocalyptic conspiracy terms about America becoming an Islamic state , that goes too far . And I think if Glenn Beck had to do it over again , he might rethink that . KURTZ : All right . I 'm coming up on a break . Let me get a 30 - second answer from each of you . Do you think that the media coverage has engaged in the traditional blame game toward President Obama and his handling of the Egyptian situation ? It seemed like that might be happening early on . Lately , it seems like the situation has kind of gotten so far out of any other country 's influence , that maybe there is less of that . John Fund , we 'll start with you . FUND : I think there 's finally some humility not only in American politics regarding Egypt , but also the American media . The situation is complicated enough , the cultures are different enough . I think we 're holding back , and I think that 's a good thing . Humility , good thing . DONALDSON : I think the media really swings with the story . Media really swings with the story . And often we 're wrong , and sometimes the story is messy , as it is now , and we do n't know what 's happening . I just -- stick to it . There is sometimes a tendency to think that a president can control almost anything . And right now that 's not the case . Got to get that break . And when we come back , we 'll talk about the reason that you folks are there , the 100th anniversary of Ronald Reagan 's birth . KURTZ : Ronald Reagan 's 100th birthday would have been today . The press was far more critical of the 40th president when he was in the White House than is the case today . Just look at how he dealt with some of those pesky reporters . DONALDSON : In talking about the continuing recession tonight , you have blamed mistakes for the past and you have blamed the Congress . Does any of the blame belong to you ? RONALD REAGAN , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : Yes , because for many years I was a Democrat . KURTZ : Sam Donaldson , he used humor there to slap away your question . And that was not unlike Ronald Reagan , was it ? DONALDSON : That 's right . That was game , set , match . We all sat down and laughed . He would turn things around with one line . He went on to explain what he meant on that , but the president said whatever he -- came into his mind . And often , his staff would run round after a news conference and say , `` Well , what the president meant to say was '' -- you understand it was just a hypothetical case . Reagan had very little guile that I saw . He would say what he thought the case was . And I 've maintained , John , that if you put a polygraph to anything he said , he would pass . He believed what he said . KURTZ : At the time , John Fund , the press often depicted President Reagan as kind of uninformed , detached , somewhat insensitive toward the poor . Do you think there has been a marked correction since his death in that , in effect , journalists have given him more credit for an essential -LRB- ph -RRB- presidency than was the case at the time ? FUND : Oh , sure . We now have his diaries and we now have his correspondence . So we know he was a pretty sophisticated thinker and he read a lot . We also know that the media , I think , has stepped back and realized that Reagan was sometimes playing a game with them . Reagan loved being underestimated , because in being underestimated , he was able to accomplish a lot more . And he loved the fact that people thought of him as just an actor . Actually , what he told David Brinkley just before he left office was fascinating . Brinkley asked him , `` How in the world could you do this job , Mr. President , if you have been an actor all these years ? '' And Reagan said , `` I 've often thought about that . How in the world could I do this job if I had n't been an actor ? '' KURTZ : All right . Well , with that , we 're going to have to bring the curtain down on John Fund and Sam Donaldson . And CNN will have live coverage of the Reagan centennial celebration starting this afternoon . That 's at 2:00 p.m. Eastern . That 's it for RELIABLE SOURCES . We 're going to go over now to `` STATE OF THE UNION '' with Candy Crowley . Thank you for watching . Glad we were able to bring you some breaking news , the interview with the Egyptian prime minister , during this hour . And we 'll be on this story next week and probably for some weeks to come , whether it stays on television or not . That is to say , whether the pictures , the dramatic pictures that we have seen from Tahrir Square , whether they fade or not . It 's important for journalists to stay on this story . Sometimes we have been accused of not sufficiently covering stories when they did n't have dramatic pictures . I think that perhaps will not be the case this time . `` STATE OF THE UNION '' with Candy Crowley begins right now .

Demonstrations were held in Atlanta , Los Angeles , Paris , New York , London , Tokyo and in the West Bank city of Ramallah . In Washington , protesters marched from the Egyptian Embassy to the White House , carrying posters and chanting . They observed a moment of silence for the people who have lost their lives since the protests in Egypt began late last month . `` Mubarak staying in Egypt is not going to be beneficial for the security of Egypt . It 's just going to fuel most protests in the streets , '' said Ahmed Fathi , head of the Alliance of Egyptian-Americans , who attended the New York protest . He said Mubarak is simply taking `` cosmetic actions '' and refusing real change . On day 12 of the unfolding unrest , apparent fissures in Egypt 's regime surfaced as key members of the embattled ruling party , including Mubarak 's once heir-apparent son , gave up their party leadership posts and the vice president began talks with opposition leaders . It was a strong gesture . But for many of the protesters in Egypt , and for those who support them elsewhere , it was not enough . In Tokyo , more than 200 demonstrators marched through the streets for about two hours , chanting and waving flags . One protester held a sign that read : `` Freedom is a demand for all nations . '' In Atlanta , activists rallied at a downtown street corner . They asked motorists to honk in their support and many cars blared as they sped past . In New York , demonstrators met outside the U.N. building in the freezing rain for the second weekend in a row . They chanted , `` Hey , hey , Ho , ho -- Mubarak must go ! '' and carried signs that read , `` Free Egypt , Jail Mubarak . '' Protesters in the West Bank city of Ramallah were forcibly disbanded when a few dozen men in plain clothes disrupted their demonstration . The afternoon rally against Mubarak stretched about three small city blocks . In London , activists rallied outside the Egyptian Embassy , while in Paris , CNN iReporters said that protesters marched in the streets . One demonstrator carried a sign that read , `` Tunisia , Egypt . Long live the revolution ! '' Meanwhile , protesters in Los Angeles rallied outside the Federal Building on the west side of the city . Some held a large banner that read , `` End U.S. Aid to the Mubarak Regime ! '' -- an idea echoed by many in attendance . `` I want democracy in Egypt . And I want my president to stop sending my tax dollars supporting a dictator over there , '' said demonstrator Dan Henrickson . CNN 's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report .

It 's not clear how much effect the move will have on Egypt , which has been wracked by anti-government demonstrations for nearly two weeks . France did not deliver any arms to the country between 2005 and 2008 , according to a U.S. Congressional report . The United States is Egypt 's largest arms supplier by far , delivering $ 4.8 billion in weaponry to the country in that period . China was second with $ 500 million in deliveries , according to the Congressional Research Service report , `` Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations , 2001-2008 , '' published in September 2009 . CNN 's Eleonora Corsini contributed to this report .

FAREED ZAKARIA , HOST : This is a special edition of GPS , THE GLOBAL PUBLIC SQUARE . Welcome to all of you in the United States and around the world . I 'm Fareed Zakaria . We have a terrific show for you today . First up , the latest from Egypt . We 'll talk to reporters stationed in that country . I will also bring you interviews with two important Egyptian voices with different views . In a disorganized opposition movement , Mohamed ElBaradei might be the closest thing Egypt has to a leader of the opposition . Ever since the crisis started , he 's been saying Mubarak has to leave , but Mubarak 's still there , so what 's the next step ? Then , a unique insight into the mind of the Egyptian government . Rachid Mohamed Rachid was Egypt 's trade minister until President Mubarak dissolved his government nine days ago . He 'll talk to us about what is going on in his country . Then , you heard last week what British Prime Minister David Cameron thinks about Egypt . Today you 'll hear his thoughts on the crucial question that everyone is watching . Can you cut deficits and get economic growth ? He also talks to me about everything from Europe to the royal wedding . First , my thoughts on Egypt . A specter is haunting the West , and it is the specter of Iran . The analogy everyone has in mind is 1979 , the fall of the stalwart American ally , the Shah of Iran , and its replacement with an Islamic Republic . This fear comes from all over the political spectrum , though if you listen to some of the more conservative voices , you 'd think that Egypt is about to become the center of a new caliphate , spreading Islamic terror across the world . Now , there is some danger that events in Egypt could spill out of control , that nasty forces could come to power through the ballot and seize control of the state . But Egypt has many elements within its state and within its society that will check the role of Islamic forces . The Muslim Brotherhood , the leading Islamist party , is thought to have the support of about 25 percent of the population , and most of the other political groups in the country are secular . Now , the danger of some imagined future has blinded us to the present , and the problem in the present is military dictatorship . Egypt is not run by the Mubarak family , it is a military dictatorship . Since the officers ' coup of 1952 , all of Egypt 's presidents have come from the armed forces . The county is ruled under martial law . Military courts trump civilian ones . Military leaders enjoy huge privileges and a fat budget in the current setup , and they will work very hard to preserve that position . In fact , right now , what appears to be happening is a consolidation of military power . The civilians and business leaders who are in the cabinet have been fired . The new cabinet is 50 percent military . The governors of Egypt 's provinces are now 80 percent military . The military leadership has fought economic reforms because these reforms threaten the many industries which the army owns . It has also opposed political reform because it fears losing its tight grip on power . And yet , as events unfold , it seems that while having decided to sacrifice Mubarak , the military intends to stay formally in power . But what Egyptians out on the street are protesting is not just Mubarak personally , but the whole system , the military dictatorship . If the United States is seen as having helped orchestrate a continuation of military rule under a democratic facade , we will deeply disappoint and frustrate the opposition in Egypt , which will inevitably turn more extreme and more religious . And then , some years hence , the Iranian scenario might well come to pass . You can read much more about what I think about democracy in the region in my cover story in this week 's `` Time '' magazine , also online of course at Time.com . Up in just seconds , ElBaradei and Rachid Mohamed Rachid and then David Cameron . Mohamed ElBaradei is one of the best known Egyptians on the world stage . He 's a Nobel Laureate for his work as - at the world 's nuclear watch dog , the International Atomic Energy Agency . He is now one of the leading voices of the Egyptian opposition . ZAKARIA : You have been very clear that your demand as a leading figure of the opposition is that President Mubarak has to step down . But Omar Suleiman , the vice president , has said unequivocally that the president is not going to step down . The - President Obama 's representative , Frank Wisner , at a conference recently said the president must stay in office in order to steer changes through . It appears that President Mubarak is going to stay . MOHAMED ELBARADEI , FORMER IAEA DIRECTOR : Well , I think , Fareed , this is - well , it 's continuing the standoff . I think the - the people are very clear that Mubarak has to retire in dignity , but he has to go . There 's a huge question of credibility , Fareed , that Mubarak is a symbol of an outgoing regime and people have no credibility , that if he has n't - if he does n't leave , you know , the regime would retrench and then come back , you know , in - with vengeance . And you hear - you hear different - different voices . I mean , there you asked -LRB- ph -RRB- , it was very clear that he should go . Frank Wisner yesterday came with his statement , saying that Mubarak must stay , which created a lot of confusion , a lot of disappointment , I should tell you , here in Egypt . People were very happy with Barack Obama 's statements that - that the time for transition is now . Mubarak would be , you know , stubborn but it 's not really a personal issue , it 's an issue of the future of the country and people want to see a new regime , and Mubarak to - to step down is a - is a clear indication that we are on the throes of - of the second republic , if you like . And unless he does that , we would continue the standoff , and I can tell you , people are very determined that he should leave . And also , Fareed , that the whole process of transition should not just be managed by the outgoing regime , by the - by his vice president , his prime minister . They are all military people , but there have to be a heavy engagement by -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- people , by the - by the civilians . So we are not in the greatest situation right now . It 's a very opaque situation , and it 's a very tense situation , Fareed . ZAKARIA : But what leverage do you have ? At some point people have to go back to work . You already get a sense that there is some degree of normalcy . The protests are getting smaller . Is n't the regime hoping to outlast you ? ELBARADEI : Well , I think yes . I think that 's part of the regime tactics . It 's - it 's a war of frustration . When people do n't have enough , you know , basic of the - basic needs , enough to eat , they do n't have the daily wage , that they would then turn against the demonstrators and say enough is enough . Let us - let us go on with - with our daily lives . But the basic problem , Fareed , as I see it , is it 's not just President Mubarak leaving office , it 's a question of credibility . While the - Omar Suleiman was talking about freeing all the detainees , all the young people that have been detained . I got nine people detained immediately after meeting with me at my - my home . He - they - they were kept for a couple of days . They were just released yesterday . So there is - while you get also the feeling that we are - we are extracting a wisdom tooth , you know , they first come and say , we would change one -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- institution , then they get additional pressure . Then they would say that we 'll - we 'll do another . But people do n't get the feeling that they are really buying into - into change , into democracy . I mean , we have n't heard anything , Fareed , about the ability to establish new parties really , the abolishing of martial law . So a huge part of the problem is people , the young people in particular , do not have any sense of credibility , that these people mean what they say . ZAKARIA : Is n't another tactic of - of the regime to try to divide the opposition ? And is it not succeeding ? The Wafd Party has already engaged in negotiations with Suleiman . The Muslim Brotherhood says that they will talk with him . Are you getting isolated , and is the opposition fracturing ? ELBARADEI : Well , I 'm not - I 'm not - I do n't think I am isolated . I 'm one of - I 'm one of many , Fareed , who - particularly the people who are camping in - in the - in the Tahrir Square and many other parts of the Egypt . They are determined that they would continue this week for -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- a week of resistance . And they will have a huge demonstration today , on Wednesday , on Friday . And so it is - it is a complete standoff , and I hope somebody will send the message , you know , I do n't know in which way , to President Mubarak that for the sake of the country , for - for his own dignity , to defuse the - this crisis , he better step down and everybody is ready to give him the dignified out he is entitled to as the former president of Egypt . But - but he needs to go and you need to engage - you need to engage the civilians . You need to - it should not be just the military . The outgoing regime , running the process of change , people are not - are not believing that , and any feeling people will get , Fareed , that there is an effort to abort the - the revolution , the peaceful revolution , it would turn violent . ZAKARIA : So you are saying under no circumstances , unless Mubarak resigns , will you negotiate with the regime ? ELBARADEI : Well , I 'm ready to express my views , but I am not ready to negotiate with the representative of Mubarak . I mean , the whole idea was to - to move from that regime to a new regime . Mubarak continues to be a symbol of that old regime , and I will not give any legitimacy to the existing regime because the whole idea is that this regime has no legitimacy , has no - has lost whatever credibility . And , yes , my - my position remains the same , Fareed , that I would not talk with these people until - until Mubarak - Mubarak steps down . ZAKARIA : And what specifically happens then ? Because a number of people have pointed out that under Egypt 's constitution then the speaker of the - takes over , not the vice president . You have a national - presidential elections triggered in two months . Do you want all of that to happen ? Or how do you abort that process ? If Mubarak is to resign , it sets in chain a set of transitions that many people say would be destabilizing . I - I think - I think what I 'm - I 'm calling for , Fareed , is a presidential council of three people , with Suleiman or somebody from the army would be one member . The other should be civilian . A year of transition of a government of national unity , of a - of a - of caretaker government that 's prepared properly for a free and fair election . I think any election in the next coming of months before the right people to establish parties and engage , and it will be , again , a fake - a fake democracy . So we need - we need a year of transition . We need a government - a transitional government . We need a presidential council . We need to abolish the - the present constitution . We need to dissolve the current parliament . These are all instruments of the dictatorship regime , and we should not be - I do n't think we will go to democracy through that - the dictatorial constitution . I mean , my - my expert on constitutional law said the easiest way , Fareed , is to start a new era , with an interim constitution , set aside the present parliament , which is rigged , set aside the present constitution , which has nothing to do with democracy , and give our self a year for a peaceful and safe transition . And then we will get a proper president , a proper parliament and - and then work again a full fledged democratic constitution . That 's the way I see it , Fareed . ZAKARIA : Mohamed ElBaradei , a pleasure to have you on . Thank you so much . ZAKARIA : Up next , the latest live from Egypt , major protests in Cairo , Alexandria and more . ZAKARIA : CNN 's Nic Robertson is live in Alexandria , Egypt this morning . Nic , we 've been talking about this issue of dividing the opposition . You 've spoken to people on the street who are talking about the very same thing . NIC ROBERTSON , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : There 's a real frustration here , Fareed . There 's a frustration at several levels . One of those is that a lot of the young people we talked to feel that their great revolution , as they put it , is being usurped by political parties , Muslim Brotherhood and others , who 've been waiting in the wings to sort of ride this wave that they 've been able to build up . They 're very frustrated about that and they do n't feel that they 're being properly represented at the moment . Some of the other political groups that we 're talking to on the streets here feel that what the government is trying to do as well at the moment is buy time - buy - sort of through political chicanery and hope that it can outmaneuver this great movement of protest , and they really feel that the government in its way of doing that is to divide them and conquer them . So by appearing to give some concessions , they feel that the government is - is in effect trying to buy some of them off . And we 're actually seeing the effects of that on the streets , people saying , look , there 's been too much chaos now , the government has given us a little . There will be elections . He would n't stand again . That should be enough . So it 's those kinds of divisions that are now becoming - pulling some real anger on the streets here , Fareed . ZAKARIA : A fascinating turn in the story . Up next , a former member of President Mubarak 's cabinet . What is going on in the corridors of power in Egypt ? ZAKARIA : Rachid Mohamed Rachid was the first business leader ever in the Egyptian government . He was one of the liberals , the so - called reformers . Nine days ago , he lost his job when Mubarak fired the entire cabinet . Egyptian prosecutors have since banned him from traveling and frozen his assets . He offers a rare insider 's look at the highest levels of the Egyptian government . ZAKARIA : Do you think President Mubarak was deeply disappointed by the fact that President Obama has in the end asked for him to resign ? RACHID MOHAMED RACHID , FORMER EGYPTIAN TRADE MINISTER : Well , I - I can tell you now , not an official person , I can say almost whatever I want to say . I think the position of President Obama and the position of the American government was extremely short sighted . I do n't want even to say stupid . There is so much interference . They should n't actually have gotten involved in this . I think , at the end of the day , the record of the United States ' interference in many of these events in the past have showed how disastrous it end up to be . I think it is positive for the rest of the world to support Egypt in making the democratic transition , but I think it is not in the right of President Obama or the American government or any other government to dictate on Egypt what to do . ZAKARIA : If Mubarak leaves , the - the military stays , the regime stays in power , the ones , you know , who oppose the reform stay in power . RACHID : Well , I personally believe that the best scenario for Egypt is for President Mubarak to stay , finish his term . I think what President Mubarak have said four days ago is a very - a clear and a very strong message for the transition . Since his speech , action have been taken on the ground . I believe that Egypt needs that transition . I believe that Mubarak can do that transition . I personally believe that he will push towards these changes to be done . And it 's not easy . We all know it 's not easy , but I believe that the - the alternative is chaos and the alternative is just jumping into the unknown . And I believe that he has the will to do that . There is a lot of people that have changed in the last few days . There are so many faces that have been removed . We - we have some promising faces , but we still , of course , have a lot of resistance . We still have people who assume that things will go back to normal , but they will not . Egypt is a great country . It has a great young population . It has a great future and I think it is time now to let the future happen by the young people , not by history . ZAKARIA : Why did you not join the government that was created about a week ago ? The - the old government was fired , but you were invited to - to join - join the new one . You chose not to . RACHID : Well , the reality , of course , was that we had to resign the old government on Saturday . On Sunday , the new prime minister asked me , invited me to join the government . I personally felt that what is happening in Egypt now and the consequences of the events of the last few days will probably need a new direction . The prime minister has his own views about what he would like to do . He has a right to choose new faces . He has a right maybe to change some of the policies . And that was the reason why I presented to him my apology , and he gracefully accepted that . But even after that discussion , we had a lot of discussion about how to help him to set up the succession . But I was very clear that what we are going to face in the next few weeks is going to be different from what we had in the past . ZAKARIA : But then you face these prosecutors ' investigations . Do you have any sense as to - are these an attempt to in some way keep you quiet ? Or what do you think is - is behind these prosecutor 's charges ? RACHID : Well , I do n't know . I - I have all respect to our prosecutor , but I only know one thing , that if I was a minister in Egypt on Sunday or Monday morning , I would not have had that situation today . But I believe that this thing will be cleared and I know that the general - the general prosecutor will be dealing fairly with all the issues here . ZAKARIA : Do you worry about the people out on the streets ? Do you worry that they - this is - this is a Muslim Brotherhood movement that will take over the country and turn it into a kind of Islamic state ? RACHID : Well , we have many challenges . It is - it is well known that there is , of course , a strong Muslim Brotherhood movement . We are all aware what is the agenda that they have . But I generally believe that what we have seen in the last 10 days have been initiated by the young people of Egypt , that we 're probably , as I said , were restricted despite the political reform that have been happening of having a voice and a share . The system were not allowing them enough - although that we have made so many political changes in opening up , everybody knows that the Facebook have been really one of many important factors that made this happen . But Facebook was an outcome of the political reform . Egypt have never restricted Internet . Egypt have opened up freedom of speech . I think we need to trust now in the young people of Egypt and we need to trust in that positive spirit that have been created . ZAKARIA : You said a few days ago that these events have taken Egypt 's economy back 10 years . That 's a pretty grim prognosis . Do you really think that it will take that long to get back to - to where you were ? RACHID : Well , Fareed , you know , I mean , business needs stability . Business needs clarity of direction and they need definitely a positive environment . Today , unfortunately , we do n't have any of those . I - I believe Egypt has a huge potential . We have worked very hard in the last six years to develop the economy . Many , many people around the world have seen the proof that Egypt can deliver , and today the challenge is first to - to resume law and order . We need to bring law and order back into the country . We need to bring back security into the country . We need to give the right messages to the business in terms of business environment , and that is probably one of the challenges now , especially when many - many business people are under attack . But also , more important than that , we need also to prove that the transition will be smooth , and that 's why I believe President Mubarak is key to that . And we - we need to ensure the business community that at the end of this transition , Egypt will be a stable , democratic and economically business friendly society . ZAKARIA : Rachid Mohamed Rachid , pleasure to have you on . RACHID : Thank you very much . ZAKARIA : Next up , we 'll take you to Tahrir Square in Cairo , where demonstrators have vowed to stay until Mubarak leaves . ZAKARIA : Demonstrators in Cairo are still out in force today . Ivan Watson is in Cairo this morning . Ivan , the mood appears to be more upbeat . But you were telling me there were reports of growing concerns about the role of the military ? IVAN WATSON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : That 's right . The mood here is absolutely festive , Fareed , it 's - it 's really remarkable . We had a show of solidarity between Christians and Muslims earlier of one of the main stages here , where men held up crosses and copies of the Koran at the same time in clasped hands . And that 's remarkable in a country where tensions exploded between Muslims and the Coptic Christian minority within the last month . We have people who have been putting out calligraphy using the same stones that have been used for battle to protect this opposition , anti-Mubarak , pro-democracy -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- in recent days , using those stones to make street art instead . But there are serious concerns here too about the role exactly of the military , the pro-Mubarak demonstrators who have been clashing here have - WATSON : -- seem to have withdrawn . Instead the demonstrators have directed themselves against the army . They have built a human chain outside the barricades to prevent the Egyptian military , to prevent the tanks from being able to roll in and take down the barricades as generals have requested here in the past several days . And I asked them , you know , the army is supposed to be neutral here . You frequently tell me that the army and people are one hand . That 's a common catch phrase in Egypt . Well , the demonstrators say yes , but the army takes orders from President Mubarak and we do not trust him if he tries to open the way here , it will end our bubble or enclave here . And another sign of suspicion here , amid talk of dialogue and opening up the media and removing censorship here , I 've just heard word that Ayman Mohyeldin , a correspondent for Al-Jazeera English , has been detained by military intelligence , one of dozens who have been detained that way in recent days here - Fareed . ZAKARIA : Fascinating reporting . Thank you so much . Back in just a moment with the British Prime Minister David Cameron . ZAKARIA : When Winston Churchill was prime minister , he famously said I have not become the king 's prime minister to preside over the liquidation of the British Empire . Are you the prime minister who will preside over the liquidation of Britain 's world role ? DAVID CAMERON , BRITISH PRIME MINISTER : I 'd like to take this opportunity , on a U.S. television station to say very clearly , Britain is maintaining its world role and Britain is an absolutely front ranked - front ranked player and will remain so . ZAKARIA : Shortly after moving into 10 Downing Street less than a year ago , British Prime Minister David Cameron and his coalition government began a bold experiment . Cameron 's government set out to prove that the way to dig Britain out of its economic problems was to slash budgets , cut spending , raise taxes . That is , of course , in contrast to what is being done in the U.S. . So will it save Britain ? Recent economic growth numbers have been bad . I sat down with British Prime Minister David Cameron last week in Davos to ask him about his efforts . CAMERON : Good to be here . ZAKARIA : When Winston Churchill was prime minister , he famously said , I have not become the king 's first minister to preside over the liquidation of the British Empire . Are you the prime minister who will preside over the liquidation of Britain 's world role ? If I look at your defense budget , it 's get - getting hollowed out . Your foreign policy budget is being cut . Understandably you have all these cuts . But you would n't be able to do Afghanistan again . You would n't be able to do Iraq again . You would n't able to do the Falklands again if - CAMERON : I do n't - I do n't accept that for one single moment . And I 'd like to take this opportunity on a U.S. television station to say very clearly , Britain is maintaining its world role . We 're actually maintaining it in cash terms . Our defense budget , 35 billion a year is maintained throughout this parliament . That 's a small real terms cut . But we will remain one of the five biggest spenders on defense anywhere in the world . We have one of the best resource networks of embassies , ambassadors and the British Council anywhere in the world . We have huge reserves of hard power and soft power . We 're actually spending more in terms of combating cyber security problems , which I think is one of the growing threats in our world . We have one of the most powerful and respected aid budgets in the world . And do n't underestimate that as a force for good and a force for change in the world . So often the problems we 're confronting , whether it 's floods in Bangladesh or problems in Haiti , actually require aid as well as hard military power . So Britain is a front ranked power where a member of every single one of the key organizations whether it 's the EU , whether it 's NATO and the Commonwealth , our relationship with America I believe is as strong as ever . And seven - actually , sorry - nine months into this job , I believe that relationship is at heart incredibly strong , not just because of what our forces do fighting and sometimes dying together , but also the security relationship where our assets and your assets work absolutely in harmony . The information is shared . President Obama and I are on the telephone talking about the threats we face and how we 're going to combat them together . The Britain is absolutely a front ranked - front ranked player and will remain so . And I would argue our defense review - that , yes , it took some difficult decisions and said there are some legacy assets that we do n't need . We do n't need quite so many tanks when you 're not facing a Soviet Army that 's going to roll across Europe . It 's right to make change . Change makes you stronger , more relevant and more powerful in the world , and that 's what we 've done . ZAKARIA : Do you think the military tide is turning in Afghanistan ? CAMERON : I do think we 've made progress . I mean , one of the most important parts of that is in Helmand Province where we are , the hardest part . And remember , after America , we are the second largest contributor of troops in the toughest part of the country by a very , very long way . We are making progress and that is , again , U.S. Marines and British Forces working together , far better balance of forces and much more the right number of forces and I think demonstrating that security is improving . But the - the ticket for President Obama and for me to bring our troops home is the training of the Afghan Army and Police which is going well . We need to keep that progress growing and we need a strong government in Afghanistan to help deliver that change . I believe those things can be done . And we will be able to do to , as I say , to meet our deadline of not having combat troops or troops -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- by 2015 . ZAKARIA : George Soros says that the British economy is going to enter into a recession , that the contraction policies , the policies of taking money out of the economy by cutting spending , raising taxes that your government has done are going to have to be reversed . Soros has a pretty good track record of betting for and against governments . Does it worry you that he feels this way ? CAMERON : I think we have an important task to carry out , which is to get the U.K. economy from recession through recovery and into growth . We 're making good progress with that , but we ca n't ignore what is in front of us , which is , you know , the biggest budget deficit of any advanced country . And , you know , we 're borrowing more than 10 percent of our GDP this year . Like the rest of Europe , the ratio debt to GDP is growing very fast and you ca n't put that problem off . I want to say -LRB- ph -RRB- when you look at forecasts for the U.K. economy , including our own forecast , which is now totally independent of government , those forecasts are for continued growth . Now , obviously , we need to get behind that growth , help business cut regulation , make it easier to do business , all those things that we 're doing . But really , part one , line one of any growth strategy in our situation has got to be dealing with the deficit , not putting it off . ZAKARIA : But a number of economists say nobody questions that you needed to cut spending . The question is when . And that you were not having any trouble raising money from the bond markets . I know the Britain was finding it easy to borrow and yet you preemptively made this decision . Could it be that it was too fast ? CAMERON : Well , I 'll make two points of that . First of all , if we go back to May when my government - coalition government came in , at that point actually people were suggesting that our credit rating could be downgraded . There were potential problems of rises in market interest rates . And actually since we announced our deficit reduction plan , those market interest rates have actually come down and our credit rating has been reassured at AAA . So I do n't accept that . The second point I 'll make , is if you look at what our program actually is , it is about reducing the deficit , taking some steps as we did in 2010 , further steps in 2011 , more in 2012 . It is a multiyear program . You obviously ca n't get rid of a 10 percent budget deficit in one go . It is a multi-year program and it 's accompanied by a government that is really looking at everything it can do to encourage growth . I 'm - I 'm convinced that 's the right answer . It 's an answer we have to stick to and deliver . And it 's an answer that also has widespread support , and at least most recently from the OCD and the Bank of England , who say , look , this is a difficult task to engage in because you 've got to rebalance an economy that was , you know , the most indebted with the worse affected banks , the most indebted households , the biggest government deficit , you 've got to take that economy and rebalance it to be more dependent on exports and manufacturing and trade and a more balanced economy . So it 's not an easy task and it will take time , but we 're doing it , I think , in the right way . ZAKARIA : President Obama seems to be going in a different direction . In his State of the Union , he laid out a plan for America , which stressed the importance of growth and growth through innovation and investments to get that growth in science and research and technology and infrastructure . And then he got to deficit reduction . Do you think he 's - he 's handling it wrong ? CAMERON : Well , again , I 'll make two points . First of all , America is different . I mean , America has a reserve currency . Britain is not in that situation . The second point is that America is looking at reducing its deficit and obviously has to - to do that . I was just talking with Tim Geithner on the way to this interview and made exactly that point . So there are differences but similarities . The real similarities I would say is both countries recognize they have to clean up their banks and deal with that . They have to pursue innovation , growth , make sure we 're investing in science . Even as we 're making cuts in Britain , we 're protecting the science budget . We 're boosting the number or apprenticeships . We 're cutting welfare roles so actually we can put money into transport , infrastructure and improving their productive capacity of the economy . So even while we 're making cuts , we 're doing it in a way that supports growth . ZAKARIA : Bob Diamond , the head of Barclays , says that the British government is still too tough on bankers that you are adopting a kind of a punitive attitude towards bankers and you - you need to give - to cut this out . What do you - CAMERON : Well , I would say we 're taking a common sense attitude . And , first of all , everyone involved in the banking industry has to understand the very real anger that still is amongst the public , that the banks were partly responsible for the mess that we are in . And when they see money that 's gone from the taxpayer into the banks going into large bonuses , that naturally makes people very angry . But I 'll tell the common sense approach we 're taking is to say that I do not want to have an endless battle with banks and bankers when I 'm trying to get the economy to grow . Let us have a settlement where we actually see what we want to see in Britain . Let 's see the banks pay more in taxes and they will . Let 's see the banks do more in lending and they should and let 's see the bonus pools come down as I think they ought to . I think there is actually a settlement we can reach that says we 're going to stop this endless war of attrition , but it 's got to be done on the basis of banks being good , socially responsible citizens in our country , lending to the businesses that need the money , being responsible in terms of pay and making that contribution to the -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . I 'm much more interested in the amount of tax the banks pay to help support the government , the economy and growth than I am in having sort of phony arguments about endlessly building up new tax regimes . ZAKARIA : But it sounds like you do n't think the banks are yet doing what you want , which is curbing compensation and lending to businesses . CAMERON : Well , I think we 're making some progress . I mean , we 're having discussions with the banks in the U.K. . We 're actually sitting around a table with the main clearing banks and talking with them about our ambitions on bank lending , particularly to small businesses about what we think needs to happen in terms of bonus pools , and also this issue of the total amount of tax the banks are going to pay . And I 'd say to people on the left in British politics who think the only answer is just keep hammering a new tax - bankers with a new tax . Actually , if you look at the tax they 're paying this year , it will be more than last year and we 're looking at something like 120 billion of tax from the banks over this parliament . That 's what I want to see it contributes - it 's the contribution they make that actually is going to be how I think we should judge whether we have a successful approach . ZAKARIA : Back in a moment . More with British Prime Minister David Cameron . I ask him about the royal wedding . ZAKARIA : But you do n't have to approve the budget ? CAMERON : We 'll discuss these issues , but , I mean , they 're all family - CAMERON : I obviously have weekly meetings with the - with her Majesty , the Queen . They are absolutely secret , so I would have to kill you if I told you anything we discussed . ZAKARIA : We are back with more of my interview with British Prime Minister , David Cameron . ZAKARIA : Is Britain prepared to play its part in rescuing Europe if you end up in the next few months and there 's likely to be bond auctions in a situation where the vulnerable countries from Greece , Ireland , Portugal , perhaps Spain need some kind of package of support ? Germany , of course , would be the critical country , but many people think Britain needs to step up as well . CAMERON : Well , first of all , I do n't want to speculate about other countries in Europe that are doing their best to deal with their problems . I mean , obviously , Britain is not a member of the Euro . I think we were right not to join and while I 'm prime minister we will not join . I think having our own currency and a more flexible monetary policy that can respond to our needs is right . Clearly in the case of Ireland , they are an old friend and a very strong partner of the United Kingdom and it was right for us to make that bilateral loan to help them . We are involved in one of the funds in Europe , the so-called financial mechanism , that was set up before I became prime minister . So there 's a liability we have under that . If we put the new financial arrangements put in place in Europe for the future do n't involve Britain and the arrangements will be put in place through a treaty change also do n't involve Britain , and that 's right because we 're not in the Euro , so we do n't have a say over the policy that is pursued in Portugal or in Spain or another countries . And so , I think , it 's right . If you 're not in the Euro , you should n't have to make contributions to those funds in the future . And I think that 's a very clear , right way of going about things . ZAKARIA : So you 're ruling out the prospect of Britain making contributions to rescue some of the European countries that need help . CAMERON : As I say , we already have a liability under the existing mechanism that was set up under that last government . CAMERON : But beyond that , I do n't believe if you 're not in the Euro , you should not be compelled to go to the aid of other countries when , you know , that might be connected to their membership of the Euro . I think it 's a pretty simple rule in life , if you 're not a member of a particular club , you do n't have the same liabilities to other members of that club . We took a very clear decision . We want the Euro to succeed . I would n't stand in the way of Euro action to help Euro members to sort out the problems they have because Britain will benefit from that . But we chose not to go into the Euro for good reasons . I 'm glad we 're not in it . I think we have greater flexibility outside it to respond to the problems that we have right now in our economy . But I want the Euro to succeed . That 's why many of our exports go and I would n't stand in the way of the changes that they 'll need to make . ZAKARIA : Prime Minister , you 're - you 're pushing this austerity measures on everyone . You yourself , the Chancellor of the Exchequer , everyone is being very frugal . You face an upcoming royal wedding . Is it going to be a budget wedding ? CAMERON : Well , it 's - no. . It will be - it will be a royal wedding that the whole country can celebrate . Obviously , the government will make its own contribution in terms of policing and security and the rest of it , but the royal family will be in charge of the plans . I think it will be - ZAKARIA : So you 're not paying for it ? CAMERON : Well , we pay for certain parts of it and the royal family pay for other - other parts . And I think it 's going to be great moment for Britain . They are a wonderful couple . ZAKARIA : But you do n't have approve the budget ? CAMERON : We 'll discuss these issues , but , I mean , the royal family - I obviously have weekly meetings with the - with Her Majesty , the Queen . They are absolutely secret . So I would have to kill you if I told you anything we discussed . But I know it will be a huge success not just for the country and I think the world looking at Britain and how we have this wonderful royal family with this Prince William who I 've spent time with recently , is a remarkable young man , great balance , poise . I think he 'll make a - I 'm sure a fantastic husband and one day will make a wonderful king . I think the world will be looking at this royal wedding , but I think we 'll be very proud of it in the U.K. . But above all , it 's two young people who love each other very much who are getting married and we should be happy for them . ZAKARIA : Have you met the - have you seen the couple since they have announced their engagement ? CAMERON : Well , I spent some time with William in Zurich actually here in Switzerland when we were trying to bring the World Cup home for England . I 'm afraid we were as unsuccessful as the U.S. was in bringing the World Cup home for the U.S. . But we spent some time together and talked about his plans . And it was great to hear , you know , when - when someone is getting married , their enthusiasm , their excitement . I could - I could very much feel that . ZAKARIA : Did you give any words of advice as a - as a married man with some experience in this matter ? CAMERON : If I did , I certainly would n't tell you what it is . ZAKARIA : Prime Minister , a pleasure to have you on . If there 's one book you need to read to understand what 's going on in Egypt , it is `` Egypt After Mubarak : Liberalism , Islam , and Democracy in the Arab World '' by Bruce Rutherford . It 's a great look at the political forces now at work in Egypt , the Mubarak regime , the opposition , both secular and Islamic . It 's an academic book , but it 's very cleanly written . Now , a few of my final thoughts , the story in Egypt is moving into a fascinating phase . The regime clearly recognizes that things will have to change , but it now wants to manage that change as carefully as it can . The protesters see this but it 's not clear that they have the resources , organization or leadership to win . The United States is , of course , watching this closely as are we . Thanks to all of you for being part of my show this week . I will see you next week .

As part of the effort , which relies heavily on audience participation , CNN.com 's news blog This Just In will feature the stories of the missing . This is the 16th case , and it aired Monday night on HLN . Friends and relatives of Margaret Haddican-McEnroe thought she might have just been blowing off steam when she vanished from her Warren Township , New Jersey , home a day after an argument with her husband in October 2006 . She actually had left her home on the day of the argument - October 9 , 2006 - to cool off at her parents ' house before returning that night . Her husband says that his wife - then a 29-year-old volunteer firefighter , Army veteran and mother of three -- was at home when he left for an errand on October 10 , and she was gone when he returned . He said she left behind her cell phone , SUV and their 5-month-old daughter , who was alone in a crib . About $ 11,000 was missing from the home , he said . The husband did n't call police until two days later . When asked why , he said that they 'd had an argument and that she had a history of walking out , disappearing for a few days , and then returning when she 'd calmed down , CNN 's Rupa Mikkilineni reported in 2008 . By all accounts , the nation is still in the midst of a foreclosure crisis . In 2010 , foreclosure activity increased in 149 of the nation 's 206 metropolitan areas with a population of 200,000 or more , according the foreclosure tracking company RealtyTrac . Last year , more than 2.8 million homes in the U.S. had foreclosure filings . But one man 's loss is another 's gain . Foreclosed homes are often up for sale at bargain prices . Some businesses and property owners have used that to their advantage and are finding ways to turn a profit on properties that have depreciated in value and have been repossessed by banks . Auction.com held more than 600 auctions of foreclosed properties last year . `` It 's truly what we call the perfect storm of opportunity , '' said Trent Ferris , the company 's vice president of auctions . On the last Sunday in January , a few hundred people filled a ballroom at a hotel in Midtown Manhattan to bid on more than 140 foreclosed homes in New York , New Jersey , Connecticut and Pennsylvania . As an auctioneer called out for bids at a blistering pace , the homes sold for a fraction of their fair market value . Each auction took about one minute , and Auction.com received a fee of 5 percent of the sale price on each house . `` At this particular point in time , nothing good comes from the empty house that 's sitting there , '' Ferris said . `` So by giving people the opportunity to buy at auction price to turn that empty house back into a home is absolutely phenomenal .

That 's more than about 400 Super Bowl fans got . They were told they could not take the seats they 'd paid for because their section of Cowboys Stadium was still under construction . No doubt those fans upon hearing that news had to dig deep , a theme that resonated during the games faithier moments .

Zelizer , Special to CNN An anti-government protester chants and gestures in front of soldiers guarding the Egyptian Museum in Tahrir Square . Americans have long debated whether to try to achieve democratic ideals overseas Julian Zelizer says `` realists '' argued U.S. should not seek democracy in Mideast He says `` idealists '' say U.S. should promote democracy , human rights overseas Outcome of Egypt revolt likely to shape foreign policy for years , he says Editor 's note : Julian E. Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University . He is the author of `` Jimmy Carter , '' published by Times Books , and editor of a book assessing former President George W. Bush 's administration , published by Princeton University Press . Princeton , New Jersey -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When the Egyptian people took to the streets of Cairo to protest the oppressive government of President Hosni Mubarak , they instantly challenged one of the most powerful strains of U.S. foreign policy thinking . In American diplomatic circles , the `` realists '' have long argued that the U.S. must be primarily focused on national self-interest , rather than concentrating on trying to promote democracy and human rights in other countries . They object to the style of idealism promoted by President Woodrow Wilson , who envisioned that war and diplomacy could transform international relations by institutionalizing cooperation among nations , allowing for the self-determination of people and ending war for all time . In The New York Times , former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger -- one of the most famous proponents of realism -- wrote that his approach to foreign policy respected the importance of values but insisted `` on a careful , even unsentimental , weighing of the balance of material forces . '' By contrast , he wrote , trying to promote idealism in foreign policy `` translates it into a call for crusades on behalf of regime change . '' One of the classic formulations of these ideas was penned by Georgetown professor -- and future Reagan adviser and U.N. ambassador -- Jeane Kirkpatrick in 1979 . In her article , `` Dictatorships and Double Standards , '' Kirkpatrick argued that often the U.S. could not be on the side of democracy if it meant supporting governments that would be hostile to U.S. interests . She criticized President Jimmy Carter for being hostile to autocratic governments that were willing to work with the U.S. against communism . Kirkpatrick rejected the idea that it was possible to democratize countries in all circumstances . Nowhere has the power of realism been stronger than in U.S. Middle East policy . For many decades the U.S. has supported Arab governments whose behavior fundamentally contradicts democratic ideals . U.S. policymakers concluded that there were no other options . ElBaradei - Egyptian opposition demands It is impossible , they said , for democracy to take root in the Middle East given the history of the region . To protect strategic interests such as access to oil , they felt it essential to make peace with bad rulers . Realism has been challenged on the left and the right . During the 1970s , the human rights movement pushed the U.S. to embrace the political and civil rights of others as a legitimate claim in U.S. foreign policy . Some neoconservatives , such as Washington Sen. Henry `` Scoop '' Jackson , claimed that the U.S. needed to insist the Soviet Union provide basic human rights , such as allowing Soviet Jews to leave the country . Carter institutionalized these concerns with new policies in the State Department , and Ronald Reagan rejected the realism of Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford . He argued that there could be no accommodation with the Soviet Union and believed that ultimately communism would fall . Although Reagan ended up pursuing his goal through arms negotiation -- which went against many of his arguments -- the collapse of the Soviet Union that began during his presidency and culminated in 1991 seemed to give legitimacy to the arguments that promoting democracy is a valid goal for the U.S. . The loudest push for idealism was heard from President George W. Bush 's administration . The Bush Doctrine , announced in 2002 , included a commitment to promote `` freedom '' and the `` development of democratic institutions . '' Bush argued that the removal of Saddam Hussein in Iraq offered the opportunity to create a bastion of democracy in the Middle East that would spread the ideal to other countries . Last week , the neoconservative Elliot Abrams argued in The Washington Post that events in Egypt showed that Bush was correct . `` Arab nations too , '' Abrams wrote , `` yearn to throw off the secret police , to read the newspaper that the Ministry of Information has not censored and to vote in free elections . '' But Bush 's legacy created as many problems for idealists as it did sources of support . After all , Iraq remains unstable , and the future of civil society there is unclear . Bush tried to impose democracy from above and did not invest sufficient resources to remake the country . Many conservatives claimed that Bush had gone too far . President Obama , who had been idealistic in many ways on foreign policy , drew back from Bush 's rhetoric about democracy and fell more in line with the realists . The administration cut the funding for several programs aimed at promoting democracy and civil society in Egypt . The realists have been highly skeptical about Egypt . They warn that revolution in Egypt could open the door to Islamic fundamentalism , as in Iran in 1979 , and cost the U.S. and Israel one of their most loyal allies . Should the Egyptians be able to withstand the response of the Mubarak government and be able to establish a truly democratic and secular government , the results would be dramatic . These turbulent weeks could be remembered in the same way the nation remembers the late 1980s and early 1990s , when conditions that seemed inevitable in the Soviet empire suddenly were not . However , if Mubarak stifles the revolution , or fundamentalism takes hold , realists will , for a long time , point to Egypt as the prime example of why we can not hope for much better than the status quo when it comes to the Middle East .

Chanting `` never surrender '' and waving signs reading `` No more mosques '' and `` Islam is the devil , '' hundreds of protesters demonstrated Saturday just north of London . The protest in Luton was organized by the English Defense League , a far-right British organization that pushes an anti-Islamic message . It was formed in the summer of 2009 after a group of radical Muslims protested during a homecoming parade for British troops . The crowd at the Luton protest numbered into the thousands , according to some estimates , and the protesters included members from the Swedish , Norwegian , Dutch and Scottish defense leagues . They marched to St. George 's Square in central Luton , where speeches were given and protesters chanted . Luton has had a renewed focus in Britain after it emerged that Taimour Abdulwahab , an Iraqi-born terrorist who blew himself up on a Stockholm street in December , had lived there over the past few years and studied at a local university .

"}, {"uid": "212", "dct": "2011-02-07", "dates": [null, null], "text": "By Shelley DuBois , reporterFebruary 7 , 2011 : 5:46 AM ET FORTUNE -- As the political unrest in Egypt continues , corporate America is watching and holding its breath . Already , many companies with operations in Egypt have had to adjust . Procter & Gamble -LRB- PG , Fortune 500 -RRB- , for example , had to close its Cairo facilities and evacuate foreign national employees . The protest is affecting the worldwide commodities markets too -- oil prices spiked to $ 100 this week and have stayed high on the assumption that the conflict in Egypt could disrupt crucial oil transit routs . While most companies are concerned about the transit routes in and out of the country , several are producing energy in Egypt now . They 're exposed to risk right now , since the consequences of political upheaval are unpredictable , and could possibly reach energy assets far from the protest in Cairo . Yet , so far , they 're neither overly worried , nor should they be : Things for energy companies working in Egypt are n't bad . One independent , Apache Corp -LRB- APA , Fortune 500 -RRB- , has a large stake in Egypt -- about 21 % of the company 's total assets are there , according to an analyst report by HSBC Global Research . Apache 's stock took a hit on Thursday dropping by about 4.7 % based on news about the conflict , paired with the company 's decision to shut down its Australian oil fields because of hurricanes there . The conflict in Egypt could of course hurt Apache , but it probably wo n't . If it does , it 's unlikely to damage the company in any lasting way . Apache is still producing from its assets in Egypt , and therefore still raking in a profit from them . While that could change , there 's a good chance that the independent oil company will continue production during the upheaval and emerge relatively unscathed . In fact , as is typical in equities , one investor 's panic is another 's opportunity : Several analysts claim that the drop in Apache 's stock price due to concern over Apache 's large stake in Egypt created an opportunity to buy newly undervalued Apache stock . Apache has over 11 million acres in Egypt that produced over 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during 2009 . Most of the Apache 's oil fields are in Egypt 's Western Desert , many , over a hundred miles from the conflict in Cairo . While national conflict can spread anywhere , the biggest threat to Apache depends on the government . Apache has ties to the government that 's currently getting overthrown , since its partner in Egyptian projects is a company called the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation , is a national oil company . That does create some risk for the company . Experts say that Apache 's worst-case scenario would be that the current government gets overthrown and the new regime would nationlize all of Apache 's assets . But that probably wo n't happen . In times of conflict , `` generally speaking , one of the things most nations want to do is keep the energy flowing , in order to meet its demand , '' says John Kollar , an analyst with HSBC . Apache is crucial to Egypt , according to a UBS Investment Research report . The company drills half of the wells in the country , employs between 4,000 and 5,000 Egyptians and pays over $ 11 million per day to the national treasury . Whoever takes charge of the country probably would n't want to put the brakes on such a key source of energy and income . It 's a basic point , but oil , in general , is extremely profitable . Right now , Egyptian oil is still coming out of the ground , which means that Apache will profit . In fact , Apache would have to shut down all production in Egypt for a full three months before seeing any negative impact on its credit quality , says Kollar , which does n't appear likely . He takes a longer-term approach to evaluating a company 's stability . `` I 'm not all that worried about the next penny per share , I 'm looking at ten and twenty-year bonds and the company 's ability to pay interest and its level of credit-worthiness . '' In that respect , he says , `` Apache is one of the best independent exploration and production companies from credit-worthiness point of view . '' Most big oil companies , in fact , are more resilient than the market would reflect . Companies such as Apache and certainly the major energy companies have a plethora of assets all over the globe . If they need to , they can sell them and spend expend less capital and stay financially solvent . `` The market 's reaction is always to shoot first and ask questions later , '' Kollar says . But that 's not the best reflection of the health of energy companies with such long-term contracts that encounter may encounter obstacles but ultimately generate a big profit . Apache 's stock has started to creep back since it plummeted last week and has kept producing throughout the turmoil . Energy plays everywhere are becoming increasingly risky . Exploration and production companies are partnering with government-linked oil companies where volatile tax and export rules , if not political conflict , are real possibilities . If the market continues to overreact , then recover , it 'll keep providing investors an opportunity to buy shares of certain energy companies with short-term obstacles and long-term profit plans .

Hassan Nasrallah : Arab regimes have lost the respect of their people Hezbollah leader taunts Egyptian government over support the organization has there Hezbollah emerges as a power as process for forming new government unfolds Anxiety , political division deepen ahead of anniversary of Rafik Hariri 's assassination -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The leader of the Hezbollah movement in Lebanon says that Arab regimes have been confronted by popular protest because of their alliances with the United States and Israel . In a televised address carried by Hezbollah 's station al Manar , Hassan Nasrallah said those regimes had lost the support and respect of their own people . Hezbollah -- a Shi'ite movement -- has often criticized the largely Sunni-led governments in the Arab world . But Nasrallah 's language Monday came close to promoting their overthrow . The Hezbollah leader said he had not spoken before about the situation in Egypt because he did not want to be accused of meddling in Egypt 's affairs . In a taunting reference to the Mubarak government 's claim that Hezbollah has been active in Egypt , Nasrallah said the militia 's friends and supporters there had recommended it should not speak up about the situation . Nasrallah 's comments come as the people of Lebanon wait anxiously for the formation of a new government . The Cabinet led by Saad Hariri was brought down last month , and Hezbollah has emerged as the most powerful force in a possible new government . At the same time , tension is growing over the unveiling of indictments said to connect members of Hezbollah with the assassination of Rafik Hariri , Saad 's father , in 2005 . Hezbollah has turned on the U.N. Special Tribunal on Lebanon that is investigating the assassination , describing it as a tool of Israel and the United States . Saad Hariri says his party wo n't join the new government without guarantees it will respect indictments handed down by the tribunal . Positions are hardening ahead of commemorations of the sixth anniversary of Rafik Hariri 's death on February 14 . The daunting task of reconciliation has fallen to Najib Mikati -- a billionaire Sunni businessman involved in telecommunications , construction and other businesses . He has said he wants to form a national unity government -- and is seeking to accommodate Sunnis , Shi'ites and Christians in government as he negotiates the bewildering alliances between Lebanon 's many parties . Some Lebanese politicians , notably the veteran Nabih Berri , a Shiite , are talking optimistically about a new government being formed within a week . Others foresee a much longer period of wrangling just as Lebanon awaits the publication of the tribunal 's indictments , which for now are sealed . Lebanon 's old divisions -- Christian against Sunni against Shiite -- are now more complex . Some Christian families , notably the Gemayels and their Kataeb party , are allied with the Sunni Hariri 's party and want to see Hezbollah 's wings clipped . Besides its political strength , Hezbollah 's militia numbers thousands of well-trained fighters and tens of thousands of rockets prepared for war with Israel . But another prominent Christian , Michel Aoun , is allied with the Shiite Hezbollah . And Walid Jumblatt , the leader of the minority Druze community , has deserted Hariri for the pro-Syrian Hezbollah , even though Jumblat 's father was killed by the Syrians . Aoun was brutally honest about his choice : `` We have the choice of stability at the price of justice by going with Hezbollah . '' In other words , the publication of the indictments and any attempt to follow through with arrests would only destabilize Lebanon . Many view Lebanon as an emerging battleground between Iran and Syria on the one hand and pro-Western forces on the other .

Our love to him and his family , '' the company tweeted shortly after 8 p.m. in Cairo -LRB- 1 p.m. ET -RRB- . Ghonim 's Twitter account , which had not had a posting since he went missing January 28 , carried a tweet around the same time . `` Freedom is a bless -LRB- sic -RRB- that deserves fighting for it , '' the tweet said , ending with the hashtag '' #Jan 25 , '' a reference to the protests in Egypt . Minutes later , Ghonim added this tweet : `` Gave my 2 cents to Dr. Hosam Badrawy . who was reason why I am out today . Asked him resign cause that 's the only way I 'll respect him . '' Hossam Badrawi , often described as a relatively liberal politician , was recently elevated to become secretary general of the ruling National Democratic Party . Later Monday , Ghonim gave an interview to Egypt 's Dream TV , in which he described his ordeal and involvement in the protests . He said he was kidnapped at night as he was trying to get a taxi . `` All of a sudden , four people surrounded me . They were kidnapping me . I yelled , ` Help ! ' But of course I knew these were security forces , '' he said . Ghonim told Dream TV he was the administrator behind the influential `` We are all Khaled Said '' Facebook page that helped to organize and galvanize the protests . The page was dedicated to the memory of a young man allegedly beaten to death by police in Alexandria . `` We must bring down this political system that we have , '' he said . Toward the end of the interview , Ghonim began to cry as he looked at pictures of people reportedly killed during the demonstrations . `` I want to say to every mother and every father that lost his child , I am sorry , but this is not our fault . I swear to God , this is not our fault . It is the fault of everyone who was holding on to power greedily and would not let it go . I want to leave , '' he told Dream TV . Ghonim then got up and walked out of the interview . Earlier , his family said they were expecting Ghonim 's release Monday , 10 days after his disappearance . His brother Hazzem Ghonim told CNN that he received word from Egyptian telecommunications billionaire Naguib Sawiris that authorities would release Ghonim by 4 p.m. -LRB- 9 a.m. ET -RRB- . Wael Ghonim is a Dubai-based marketing executive for Google in the Middle East . `` Heading to Tahrir square now .

Most Egyptians have seen their standard of living deteriorate over the past decade because of rising unemployment , persistent inflation and stagnant wages . They have also suffered from a corrupt and brutal police force that subjected the population to arbitrary arrest , torture and myriad indignities large and small . These sources of anger have been simmering for some time . The events that caused them to boil over were the demonstrations in Tunisia that led to the overthrow of that country 's long-serving dictator , Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , a few weeks ago . These events fundamentally altered the way many Egyptians viewed demonstrations . Before Ben Ali 's departure , many Egyptians saw little point in going to the streets to express their anger . There was little chance things would change , and they would probably be beaten by the security police . After Ben Ali 's departure , many thousands of Egyptians decided that demonstrations could actually bring about meaningful change and were worth the risk , so they turned out in droves . The situation remains very fluid , and the result is still uncertain . As this process of change unfolds , there are three actors who will play particularly important roles : Can they form a leadership that articulates clear demands beyond the removal of Mubarak and that can negotiate with the regime ? So far the protesters -- who have been savvy in so many ways , from utilizing social media to creating a minicity in Tahrir Square -- have been remarkably unsavvy about the substance of politics . Maybe it 's a reflection of the internet generation 's resentment of hierarchy . They had better get over this hesitation quickly and appoint credible and effective leaders or their sacrifices may be for naught . Also , will large numbers of demonstrators continue to turn out ? It looks like President Hosni Mubarak is determined to hold on for another seven months . The only way this will change is if demonstrators continue to come to Tahrir Square en masse , even as life otherwise returns to normal . The most likely way for this to unfold is for the Friday of each week to become the `` day of demonstration '' in which average people , who work during the week , come down to Tahrir for a day of protest in ever-larger numbers . If these Friday demonstrations steadily grow in size , Mubarak may eventually take the hint and accept an early exit .

Wael Ghonim missing since January 28 Amnesty International protests holding of Dubai native -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Wael Ghonim , a Google executive who has been missing for more than a week following his purported arrest in Cairo , is to be released Monday , according to two Egyptian television news networks . Telecom executive Naguib Sawiris announced on OTV Sunday that Ghonim would be released at 4 p.m. Monday . Sawiris told CNN that Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman assured him during a Sunday meeting between government officials and opposition leaders that Ghonim would be released . State-run Nile TV reported that Prime Minister Ahmad Shafiq called the network to announce that a Google executive missing for more than a week will be released Monday . There was no explanation as to the executive 's whereabouts or condition . Sawiris is a member of the so-called Committee of the Wise , a group of independent elite leaders of Egyptian society taking part in talks over the future of the country . The announcements follow the release of a statement earlier Sunday by the human rights group Amnesty International . The statement warned that Ghonim was at risk of being tortured by Egytian authorities . Hala Gorani ventures into Cairo `` The Egyptian authorities must immediately disclose where Wael Ghuneim is and release him or charge him with a recognizable criminal offence , '' said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui , deputy director of Middle and North Africa at Amnesty International . `` He must be given access to a doctor and a lawyer of his choice and not be subjected to torture or other ill-treatment . His case is just one of many that highlight the continued crackdown by the Egyptian authorities on those exercising their right to protest peacefully . '' Ghonim , according to Amnesty International , was declared missing after he failed to meet with his brother January 28 , as planned , to take part in street demonstrations . Ghonim , who heads Google 's marketing operations in north Africa and the Middle East , had been in Cairo on a business trip since January 23 . Ghonim is from Dubai , according to the human rights group . Family members became concerned when they discovered that Ghonim 's telephones had been disconnected , according to the human rights group . Eyewitnesses later told family members they had seen Egyptian authorities arrest Ghonim during demonstrations near Mustafa Mohamed Street .

WOLF BLITZER , CNN ANCHOR : Deb Feyerick , thanks very much . And to our viewers , you 're in THE SITUATION ROOM . Happening now : a death in Egypt and the video that went viral around the world . We have tracked down the woman who taped it , and they share -- they share their chilling story with us , the woman -- women , I should say , who found it . Also , the billionaire president . If Hosni Mubarak leaves his poverty-stricken country , will his fortune go with him ? And journalists recounting their nightmare in an Egyptian jail and the screams of beating victims that still haunt them . We have breaking news , political headlines and Jeanne Moos all straight ahead . I 'm Wolf Blitzer . You 're in THE SITUATION ROOM . We 're following all the latest developments this hour in Egypt , where the standoff continues , with protesters insisting they wo n't leave Cairo 's Liberation Square until Hosni Mubarak goes . But President Mubarak is n't budging either . Our senior international correspondent - , Nic Robertson , is joining us now from Cairo . He 's joining us live . First of all , Nic , a leading Google executive picked up by Egyptian police almost two weeks ago has now been released . We just got the tweet from Google , a huge relief . Wael Ghonim has been released . Our love to him and his family . Tell us what we know about this . NIC ROBERTSON , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , when he was released as well everybody became aware of it when he treated , `` Freedom is blessed . '' And that was really the indication that he was out of jail after 12 days in detention . He was last tweeting on his way to Tahrir Square the 26th of January , one day after the big protests began . And now he 's been freed . He 's been freed with the help of the new head of the National Democratic Party here , who is seen as a reformer . But such is the feeling of Mr. Wael -- of Wael Ghonim is that he said , I wo n't be happy until this man has left that office . He believes that the National Democratic Party , the party of Hosni Mubarak , should be finished and should be ended . So clearly 12 days in government lockup has done nothing to take the edge off of what he feels . But he gave a very emotional interview on local television here . He was in tears at one point . He has revealed that he was the site administrator behind the Facebook page that helped drive and generate this 100,000 signatures of people who would come out and join the protests on January the 25th , when everything began . And he was crying because he said , I did n't want word to come out of this while I was in jail . He said , I did n't want to be -- I did n't want to appear as a hero . This is the work of the youth , the youth on the Internet in Egypt , so a very emotional moment , but the realization of a lot of people that this senior Google executive who has been locked up here by the government for the past 12 days has played a major , major role in helping organize this -- the demonstrations on the 25th of January that have led to everything else we have seen since -- Wolf . BLITZER : Yes , it 's encouraging , although I suspect there are still others being detained by Egypt 's secret police . You are now in Cairo . Nic , you were in Alexandria . We were watching and listening to your riveting reports from Alexandria last week . You have got some fresh eyes now Cairo . Give us your impression of what 's going on in Cairo right now on this day , lots of uncertainty still . ROBERTSON : You have sort of tighter checkpoints around the city than ever than were two or three weeks ago . But the other thing that you notice now is this country is sort of picking up a more normal rhythm . There are lines at the banks . People have been going to the gas stations . The roads are busy . One of the things about Cairo that I have heard from -- from my CNN colleagues is that while all the trouble has been going on , the roads have been relatively empty . Well , we drove back in to the city today down busy highways from Alexandria and the roads are jammed in the middle of Cairo . So , Cairo away from Tahrir Square is -- really feels as if it 's picking up and you do get the sense that this is getting into a long-term dialogue stalemate , standoff between the government and the protesters at the moment . And , meanwhile , a large percentage of the rest of the population here is really going back to work , as we have seen , and getting on with their daily lives , Wolf . BLITZER : Nic , thanks very much . We will check back with you . Hosni Mubarak is n't just Egypt 's president . He 's also one of the world 's wealthiest men , amassing a fortune while he has ruled a country racked by poverty . And that raises this serious question . When and if he goes , what happens to all that money ? Lisa Sylvester is here . She 's looking into this . I got a lot of tweets on Twitter , at my Twitter account , WolfBlitzerCNN , over the past week : Check into the money . Follow the money , Mubarak 's money . A lot of outrage , Egyptians especially . So , we asked to you take a closer look and tell us what you discovered . LISA SYLVESTER , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Yes , this is an issue that certainly has resonated with a lot of people . They have a lot of questions . And we got to say we do n't know exactly how much Mubarak has in bank accounts , real estate and other investments , but we do know that President Hosni Mubarak and his two sons are all billionaires . And now , as you mentioned , Wolf , the question is if , and it 's a big if , but if he steps down , what happens to his personal fortune ? SYLVESTER -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Protesters gathering outside a home in London owned by son Gamal Mubarak not only want to see the family guy . They want billions they allege the Mubarak family stole from the country . Academic experts who have studied the Mubarak regime for decades say along with money tucked away in Swiss and British bank accounts , Mubarak and his two sons reportedly own sprawling mansions , penthouses and vacation homes . AMANEY JAMAL , PRINCETON UNIVERSITY : The portfolios themselves are not probably all in Hosni Mubarak 's name . They 're scattered across several countries . You -- I think if you are not his personal accountant at this time , it 's really hard to really know where things stand . SYLVESTER -LRB- on camera -RRB- : According to Princeton University Professor Jamal and other prominent Middle Eastern experts , Mubarak 's net worth is estimated to be between $ 25 billion to $ 40 billion , and it could be as high as $ 75 billion . To put that into context , the average Egyptian 's income is only about $ 6,200 . And one-fifth of the country , according to the United Nations , makes only about $ 1 a day . -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : That 's part of what 's fueling all of the rage you see on the streets . MICHAEL RUBIN , RESIDENT SCHOLAR , AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE : Well , the question of Hosni Mubarak 's assets is a real time bomb . Right now , the Egyptians just want Hosni Mubarak out . What worries me is that any of these political factions are going to try to play the nationalist card . They 're going to try to do that by determining a wedge issue . And a safe wedge issue is repatriating Hosni Mubarak 's money . SYLVESTER : Now , we reached out to the Egyptian Embassy asking for a response , but they have yet to get back with us . And one of the reasons why they -- the Mubarak family was able to amass such a fortune is because Egyptian laws are actually written in a way to financially favor the current regime , Wolf . Even if it 's only -- only -- $ 25 billion , this is an individual who was an air force commander . Then he became vice president under Anwar Sadat . And then he took over , became president after Sadat was assassinated . So he amassed billions and billions of dollars in a personal fortune while he served as president of Egypt ; is that what I 'm hearing ? SYLVESTER : That 's right . And now people want to know where that money is , but tracking it down may be difficult . And there 's this whole question , is this actually illegal ? And I asked the Professor Jamal with Princeton University that question . She said that 's a little bit tricky because , keep in mind , they did have Egyptian laws on the books which actually allowed the regime to amass this current fortune , which , as you said , on the low end , $ 25 billion , on the high end , possibly $ 40 billion , even -- possibly even $ 70 billion , one report said . Lisa , thanks very , very much . All right , let 's go to Jack . Presidential approval ratings , Jack , I take it that is on your mind right now . JACK CAFFERTY , CNN ANCHOR : Among other things , correct . President Obama has the most polarized approval ratings for a second-year president since Dwight Eisenhower . A new Gallup Poll shows 81 percent of Democrats , 13 percent of Republicans approved of the job Mr. Obama was doing as president during his second year in office . This 68-point gap is up from a 65-point gap during President Obama 's first year . That also was a record . Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton are the only other presidents who had gaps of at least 50 points between party approvals by their second year in office . Now , this is n't to say that Mr. Obama is the most polarizing president ever . That award goes to President George W. Bush . He had three years in office with a gap in party ratings that topped 70 points . But Bush 's earlier years in office were less polarizing mostly due to the widespread support he got right after the 9\\/11 attacks . As for President Obama , he arrived in Washington full of talk about unity and bipartisanship . And his initial approval ratings were among the highest for any post-World War II president . But he quickly lost most of the Republican support , while maintaining high marks from Democrats . It 's worth pointing out , too , that this just is n't about President Obama . Our country seems to get more polarized every year on just about everything . On average , nearly all of the presidents since Reagan have more polarized ratings than those that came before Reagan . And we can probably thank hyper-partisan news on cable , the Internet , and talk radio for some of the growing divide . Anyhoo , here 's the question : Why is President Obama such a polarizing figure ? Give us your thoughts . BLITZER : Jack , thank you . A living nightmare in an Egyptian jail . We 're going to hear from journalists from around the world who were detained and are now haunted by what they saw and heard while in an Egyptian jail . Also , lots of questions about the evolving U.S. policy on Egypt and the unrest . We 're going to put some of those questions to the State Department spokesman , P.J. Crowley . He 's live here in THE SITUATION ROOM . And Sarah Palin is speaking out about Egypt as well -- details of what she 's saying and who she is criticizing . BLITZER : When Egyptian authorities started detaining journalists from around the world , the government inadvertently shined a spotlight on the country 's notorious jails and the chilling abuses that happen inside . CNN 's Brian Todd is working this part of the story for us . And it 's chilling , indeed , Brian . What are you learning ? BRIAN TODD , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Wolf , many of the journalists who have been treated the worst are those from Egyptian news services or other Arab outlets . As for the others , some are just now getting the chance to describe their detention after spending days trying to get to safety . TODD -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : They have been beaten , harassed , threatened and now some journalists are giving the first real detail of their experiences in Egyptian custody . Two print reporters have written an account of their detention after they were stopped at a checkpoint in Cairo . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : I 'm on the phone Souad Mekhennet from `` The New York Times . '' She and her colleague Nicholas Kulish were detained during the height of the unrest by the Egyptian secret police . We are asked not to reveal her location out of concern for her security . Souad , can you tell us , when you were taken to the secret police facility , were you blindfolded , were you mistreated ? SOUAD MEKHENNET , `` THE NEW YORK TIMES '' : No , at the beginning we were not blindfolded . We were -- actually it was the army who handed us over to the intelligence service . And what happened then was that someone from the intelligence service asked the army officer to leave , and they started to search our luggage and our stuff . And then my colleague , Nicholas Kulish , and I were taken for interrogation separately . We were in two separate rooms . TODD -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Mekhennet and Kulish write about hearing dull whacks and screams for much of the night . At one point , Mekhennet says she could hear the jailers speaking to a man who she believes had been in Tahrir Square . MEKHENNET : The people told him , well , you 're a traitor . You were -- you talked to journalists and you spoke badly about your country . And the man answered , no , I love my country and I just wanted to tell the truth . And we could hear how they were beating him up and how he was screaming . TODD : Mekhennet says she and her colleagues were not physically abused , but during her interrogation , she had a question for an official . MEKHENNET : After half-an-hour , I asked him , I said , well , I would like to know , where are we ? And he said , you are nowhere , and was smiling . TODD : They were released the next morning . Separately , officials from Radio Free Europe tell us two of their journalists had a very similar experience , and one of them was beaten . FRANK SMYTH , COMMITTEE TO PROTECT JOURNALISTS : Clearly the government is attempting to eliminate witnesses to the unrest that is occurring on the streets of Cairo , Alexandria and elsewhere . It is clearly a government policy to try and silence the press . TODD : We tried several times to reach officials at the Egyptian Embassy in Washington to respond to these specific accounts . Despite our repeated calls and e-mails , we have heard nothing back . Now , in recent days , the Egyptian ambassador to the U.S. has called the overall treatment of journalists deplorable -- Wolf . BLITZER : It was -- certainly was deplorable . Let 's talk a little bit about what 's happening right now , Brian . Are you seeing any evidence that Egypt 's security forces are changing their policies right now ? Are they easing up ? TODD : Not really easing up , Wolf , but they 're kind of changing the way they are approaching journalists on the streets . Now , this is according to the Committee to Protect Journalists , which says that in recent days , Egyptian forces in some cases have tried to prevent journalists from even getting to the streets , detaining them , forcing them to stay in their hotel rooms , taking away their credentials . And they have also told us that right now , it 's the Egyptian military , rather than the plainclothes police , that are most responsible for detaining journalists , confiscating their equipment . So that tactic has shifted from the secret police in plainclothes to the military now doing it . That 's according to the Committee to Protect Journalists . BLITZER : We applaud , of course , all the journalists who are risking their lives right now under dangerous circumstances to bring us the news . Brian , thanks very , very much . They 're among the most disturbing images to come out of the uprising until now . We 're about to hear from the woman who recorded a death in Egypt . And a former U.S. president suddenly cancels an overseas trip . Was it because of possible legal action ? BLITZER : A death in Egypt caught on tape and a video that went viral around the world . We are going to get the story behind it from the women who recorded it . Also , Sarah Palin slamming the Obama administration and the president himself over the crisis in Egypt -- details of what she is saying . And when does the U.S. think President Hosni Mubarak should go ? Should it be in September ? Should it be earlier ? I will ask that and more questions to the State Department spokesman , P.J. Crowley . He 's standing by live right here in THE SITUATION ROOM . BLITZER : We want to warn our viewers that the next story contains some disturbing images of a death in Egypt and the equally disturbing story behind it . Once again , here is CNN senior international correspondent Nic Robertson . ROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : It is 2:28 in the afternoon January 28 . This man is walking to his death . The video went viral , but we wanted to know more . Who was he and who recorded his last moments ? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : We were like , what the hell is he doing ? He should n't be doing this , because the situation does n't look that good . ROBERTSON : Speaking out for the first time , two young women who videoed the killing . They 're afraid to be identified . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : He did nothing . He was -- he had nothing . He was like , I have nothing in my hands . ROBERTSON -LRB- on camera -RRB- : He had nothing in his hands ? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Yes . And he was doing that in the video . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Even he did n't have stones or something like the other protesters . So , it was not a -- he was not a threat . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : This is when they started shooting the tear ... ROBERTSON : Ah , the tear gas . -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : They show me photographs they took from the same balcony . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : You can see here an injured man . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : They were like putting him on a lowering -- or on a truck to take him to hospital . ROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : In the hour before the man is shot , the streets around their building become a battleground , rock-throwing protesters facing off with police . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : These were the police . ROBERTSON -LRB- on camera -RRB- : And here you can -- we have got riot shields , batons here . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I think he 's here throwing the rocks that the protesters are throwing at ... ROBERTSON : Yes , as he is bending -- the policeman here is bending down to pick up a rock . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : No , that 's a proper gun . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Yes . I think it 's a proper gun . ROBERTSON : It is a proper gun , yes , a rifle . And he 's pointing it at the protesters . ROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Not long after , the man begins his walk up the street . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : What it appears on the videotape is that he 's standing on one corner , and the gunmen are literally just across the road . Is that what -- that 's what ... ROBERTSON : So they were just , what , a few yards away from him ? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Yes , not that far , a few yards . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : They -- the man shot him first , but it did n't get through -- through him . But the second one , I think he -- he zoomed in his face because he was like standing like that . And ... ROBERTSON : So the man who shot him took very careful aim ? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Yes . ROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : When we go to the same street corner today , it 's still tense , so we use a tiny camera . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : This is where the man was standing when he was shot . The gunman was just across ... -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Our hidden camera breaks up as I count the paces across the road . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : Seven , eight , nine , 10 , 11 , oh , about 12 paces away , about 12 yards away . He had a clear line of sight , an unobstructed view of his target just over there . -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : What the women 's cell phone camera does n't show so well is the crowd cheering him on . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : The protesters got encouraged , because he was standing right there , and they did n't do anything , the -- the police . So , they were encouraged . So , they were about to go there to him and protest . And that 's why they shot him . ROBERTSON : They tell me they hold President Mubarak and the police responsible . They want justice for the man whose name they still do n't know . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I feel sympathy to him , his family . I do n't know . I just feel like I need to get back his rights . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I would like for his rights to get back . For him and his family , you know ? He did nothing for it . It 's so unfair . ROBERTSON : The neighbor videoed the body being carried away by other protesters . In the chaos , no record of where he went . Nic Robertson , CNN , Alexandria , Egypt . BLITZER : Let 's bring in State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley . That 's a disturbing , disturbing story . Is the U.S. government familiar with this particular case ? P.J. CROWLEY , STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN : I ca n't say that we are . It 's entirely possible our embassy is . It 's a dramatic and powerful and disturbing video . That 's why the president said last night that Egypt can not go back to its old ways . The suppression of the people is the thing of the past . They now have to move forward and construct a different relationship . BLITZER : Have you seen any evidence that they -- you 've been saying that for years , the State Department has for decades , and we have n't seen any change . CROWLEY : But there is a different dynamic in the Middle East , and there 's a clear opportunity here for both the government and the people to move in a different direction . There are meetings going on . There 's some contacts between the government and official figures . That has to broaden . Most importantly this process has to yield concrete actions that convince the Egyptian people that change is on the way . BLITZER : Well , have you seen any evidence over the past few days that change is on the way ? CROWLEY : It 's early in the process and there 's much more that the government needs to do . BLITZER : So the answer is no ? CROWLEY : Well , but look at what the military did last week , in standing between various reporting factions . So the government is beginning ... BLITZER : Forget about the military . What about the police ? CROWLEY : The police have been responsible for some very significant violence . The military stepped in to help stabilize the situation . But clearly the government has to do more . Clearly , the government has to take concrete actions that lead to ... BLITZER : Are you confident that they -- are you confident that they will let journalists , not just American journalists , but journalists around the world , including from the Arab world , do their job ? CROWLEY : We 've made that clear to the Egyptian government at the highest levels from the president to the secretary on down that this kind of attacks on journalists and other citizens ... CROWLEY : It has to stop . BLITZER : But I guess let me just repeat the question . BLITZER : That 's a fair answer . Do you want President Mubarak to stay in office until the next scheduled elections in September ? CROWLEY : You know , it 's not important what we think . It 's important what the Egyptian ... BLITZER : It 's very important what the United States government thinks . CROWLEY : Wolf , these are decisions to be made in Egypt . There is a process under way , and it will be -- and we 're not going to dictate what roles particular peer -LRB- ph -RRB- persons ... CROWLEY : ... including President Mubarak . BLITZER : I 'm confused what the president wants right now as far as President Mubarak , because I heard the special envoy , Frank Wisner , a retired U.S. diplomat , say he wants President Mubarak to stay until September . CROWLEY : Well , you 're personalizing this like a political campaign . What we want free , fair , competitive and credible elections . Now there 's a process that needs to take place to get there . The role that Mubarak or others within the government , that 's a decision to be made inside Egypt and not for us to dictate . BLITZER : You want stability leading up to the elections . And I guess the question is , will it be a more stable environment with President Mubarak as president or someone else ? CROWLEY : Well , the answer to that is in Tahrir Square . The answer to that is not in Washington , D.C. . The people will decide whether the process that goes forward is credible enough and delivers real change for them . BLITZER : If Mubarak were , tomorrow or next week or a month from now , to say , `` You know what ? I 'm going to go to Sharm El Sheikh . I 've got a summer home or a winter home over there in the southern tip of Sinai . '' Or `` I 'm going to go to Germany and get my annual medical examination there , '' do you want the vice president , Omar Suleiman , to be in charge ? CROWLEY : Again , those are Egyptian decisions not ours . What we want is a process , and whoever is participating in this process has to yield concrete results for the Egyptian people . BLITZER : So you 're not going to say about Omar Suleiman ? You want it to be vague ? CROWLEY : This is not -- these are not our decisions . We do n't have a favorite horse in this race . We want to see a process ; we want to be inclusive . Now there are some people who have been invited into the dialogue that has already started . Those invitations need to broaden . That participation needs to broaden . Ultimately , what figures emerge from this process to both run the transition or lead up and run for the elections , not our decision . BLITZER : Is the U.S. government speaking to representatives as the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt ? CROWLEY : We have concerns about the Brotherhood , but we 're going to wait and see what -- what they do in this process . We have questions about whether they are committed to a peaceful democratic process , but we 'll have the opportunity to see what they do . BLITZER : Because you regard Hamas and Hezbollah terrorist organizations , right ? CROWLEY : You 're talking about our contact ... BLITZER : The State Department . But is it the same as far as the Muslim Brotherhood is concerned ? CROWLEY : Well , the Muslim Brotherhood is a fact of life in Egypt . They have signed on to this process . We 'll see what they do . BLITZER : Well , I guess the question is why not speak to them if they 're not considered a terrorist organization ? They do -- they do have sizable support . CROWLEY : But , again , what 's important now is there is a dialogue between the Muslim Brotherhood and the government and other opposition figures . That 's the conversation that does need to take place for Egypt going forward . BLITZER : If Egypt has fair elections , should the Muslim Brotherhood be allowed to run or should it be banned ? CROWLEY : Again , these are -- these are ... BLITZER : What does the U.S. think ? CROWLEY : These are decisions to be made inside Egypt . It 's not for us to dictate who runs , who wins . That 's not our role . We will advise the Egyptians on how to move forward . We 'll offer technical assistance on how to develop real political parties in the process at least for a competitive election . You know , we want to see ... BLITZER : But just to be precise on the Muslim Brotherhood , Washington , the State Department has instructed U.S. diplomats in Cairo . You can not speak to the Muslim Brotherhood ... CROWLEY : That is our standing position . We have not changed our position . BLITZER : And it does n't look like it 's going to change any time soon ? CROWLEY : Well , that would be a mistake . We think this has been a cornerstone of stability in the Middle East , and we think that the Egyptian government will recognize -- the future government will recognize this is important to Egypt ; it 's important to the region . It 's fundamental to our relationship with Egypt . BLITZER : Would the U.S. sever military aid to Egypt ? CROWLEY : Again , you 're asking a hypothetical question . We think at the end of the day that Egypt will recognize how important this is . BLITZER : You believe that they will maintain the peace treaty with Israel ? CROWLEY : We do . BLITZER : Right now , the U.S. gives Egypt , what , about a billion or a billion and a half dollars a year in military assistance ? But you 've known , I 've read the State Department human rights reports for years , and every year it 's the same . Violations of basic human rights , arrests , torture . All of that kind of stuff is documented , but it does n't seem to have ever had an impact in terms of reducing U.S. military aid to Egypt . CROWLEY : Well , again , we have assistance . We have relationships that serve our interests . We have ... BLITZER : And those trump the human rights interests ? CROWLEY : Well , but Wolf , you saw last week the constructive role that the military played in separating the pro-government and protesters in Tahrir Square . This is a professional military . Now we do have concerns about certain activities in Egypt . We 've never hesitated to raise those concerns . But the aid , we believe , serves our national interest . As we 've said , as things go forward , if we have concerns about how our assistance is being used , we wo n't hesitate to review that . But right now there 's no reviewing . BLITZER : And one final question : was it a mistake to use Frank Wisner as the special envoy in delivering a message from the president to President Mubarak ? CROWLEY : We thought that Frank Wisner was uniquely qualified to deliver a very candid , very sharp message to President Mubarak and then make sure that message was ... BLITZER : And the suggestion that his business contacts as a senior executive or adviser of Patton Boggs -LRB- ph -RRB- , which has a lot of business relations in Egypt , is that a conflict as far as the State Department is concerned ? CROWLEY : We gave him a very specific mission . We 're grateful that he did it . He brought back his perspective on the current situation , and now he 's back to being a private citizen . BLITZER : No regrets using it ? BLITZER : Tough story . But it 's mostly tough for the people of Egypt , as we all know right now . Sarah Palin is criticizing the White House response to the unrest in Egypt . She 's not alone . BLITZER : The former Alaska governor , possible presidential candidate Sarah Palin , is speaking out about Egypt right now . Our national political correspondent , Jessica Yellin , is here . She 's working the story for us . What is she saying ? JESSICA YELLIN , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Well , she is very critical of the White House , Wolf . You might not be surprised in their handling of Egypt . She did n't weigh in until speaking to David Brody on his show , `` The Brody File , '' which airs on the Christian Broadcasting Network , and she rifted on the 3 a.m. phone call ad that we all remember from the 2008 campaign . SARAH PALIN , FORMER ALASKA GOVERNOR : This is the 3 a.m. White House phone call , and it seems for many of us trying to get that information from our leader in the White House , it seems that that call went right to the answering machine . And nobody yet has -- nobody yet has explained to the American public what they know -- and surely they know more than the rest of us know -- who it is who will be taking the place of Mubarak . And , no , not -- not real enthused about what it is that is being done on a national level from D.C. in regards to understanding all of the situation there in Egypt . YELLIN : Well , at the White House Robert Gibbs , the press secretary , was asked about Sarah Palin 's comments , and he said this . GIBBS : I 've got to tell you : I read that answer several times , and I -- I still do n't really know what -- I still do n't really know what she said . BLITZER : Some other potential Republican presidential candidates , what are they saying about the president 's strategy in Egypt ? YELLIN : A number of them have weighed in . Former speaker Newt Gingrich was scathing in his criticism , saying that the president has n't prosecuted the war on terror enough . Tim Pawlenty and Mitt Romney , they say the administration got off on the right foot to begin with , although Romney says the president did correct himself . Maybe the most interesting was from Mike Huckabee , who expressed some sympathy for Mubarak and then openly worried that the U.S. backing away from Mubarak could send other allies the message that the U.S. could back away from them . In Huckabee 's words , quote , `` when it comes to difficulties and troubles a nation might face . '' So plenty of criticism from the other side . BLITZER : Why should we not be surprised ? Senator Lindsey Graham , by the way , will be among the guests on `` JOHN KING USA '' later tonight . He 'll weigh in on Sarah Palin 's comments . `` JOHN KING USA '' starts right at the top of the hour after THE SITUATION ROOM . Egypt certainly has taken the focus off another world hot spot . We 're talking about North Korea . But you 're about to get a firsthand glimpse at my recent journey there . BLITZER : In less than two hours , representatives from North and South Korea will meet for what 's being called working-level military talks , colonels from both sides starting the discussions . These are the first talks since the showdown in December when I traveled to North Korea with Governor Bill Richardson . It was a tense time , and many were calling the Korean Peninsula the most dangerous place on earth . I 've just completed a one-hour documentary on the trip . Here 's a little piece of it . BLITZER -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : We land in North Korea late in the afternoon on Thursday , December 16 . I have no idea this is going to be the strangest journey of my life . The North Koreans take us into a room and confiscate our passports and cell phones . GOV. BILL RICHARDSON -LRB- D -RRB- , NEW MEXICO : It 's an eerie feeling . It 's like you 're stepping into the '50s , into a city with old cars , very cold . It 's like Dr. Strangelove . BLITZER : One of the first things you ca n't help but notice : the propaganda murals everywhere . Huge pictures of North Korea 's founder , Kim Il-Sung , and his son , the current leader , Kim Jong-Il , all over the place , almost at every corner . But we do n't see any pictures of the new heir apparent , Kim Jong-Il 's youngest son , Kim Jong-Un . We head to the foreign ministry . . RICHARDSON : This will be our first meeting where we try to ease tensions . BLITZER -LRB- on camera -RRB- : Ease tensions ? Easier said than done . -LRB- voice-over -RRB- That morning Richardson has his first meeting with North Korean officials . This one would with Ri Yong Ho , the new vice minister who 's their expert on the United States . CNN is allowed in at the start of the meeting but then asked to leave . -LRB- on camera -RRB- Governor , how did it go ? RICHARDSON : Well , it was a decent start . Both sides are feeling each other out . BLITZER -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : This journey is nothing if not surreal . In the morning , meetings that could make the difference between war and peace . In the afternoon , our North Korean handlers , all of whom are very polite and speak English well , take us sightseeing . -LRB- on camera -RRB- We 're on top of the world 's tallest stone tower here overlooking Pyongyang . It really is majestic . You see what 's going on . You see the river and you see the bitter cold , the freezing snow . -LRB- voice-over -RRB- Our first full day in Pyongyang . But the next day will be critical . Richardson will be meeting with North Korea 's chief nuclear negotiator , the man who invited him to visit this country , just as tensions on the Korean Peninsula are mounting . -LRB- on camera -RRB- The whole world is watching right now . One miscalculation could cause a full-scale war . BLITZER : All this week we 're going to be showing you parts of this amazing journey . Please be sure to tune in this Saturday , 6 p.m. Eastern , for my full one-hour documentary , `` Six Days in North Korea . '' I think you 're going to want to see it . Jack Cafferty is coming up next . Then the star-spangled blunder seen and heard around the world . BLITZER : Let 's get right back to Jack for `` The Cafferty File '' -- Jack . JACK CAFFERTY , CNN ANCHOR : The question this hour is : `` Why is President Obama such a polarizing figure ? '' From the second year in office , the most polarizing president since Dwight Eisenhower . Michelle writes , `` I blame the right-wing media for throwing chaos into the mix by pumping the public with lies and manipulated information . I believe fear is their motive , fear of this new guy who threatens to work for the middle and lower classes , and best of all is the fear of the color of his skin . I really do n't know how these people sleep at night . '' Paula writes from Oregon , `` President Obama 's polarizing effects easily explained by the 80\\/20 rule . Eighty percent of Republicans and right-wing media blowhards expected Obama to clean up Bush 's mess within 20 months . The remainder , like Limbaugh and Beck , expected it in 20 minutes . '' Seth writes , `` Egocentric attitude on display . His answer to Bill O'Reilly 's question yesterday , asking what was the worst thing about his job as president . Instead of the obvious : visiting wounded soldiers , meeting the parents of soldiers killed in action , et cetera , he said it was being in a bubble where he could n't do things like have a regular conversation because everything he says is analyzed , critiqued , reviewed , et cetera . Self-absorption is a polarizing characteristic . '' Paul writes , `` I think the majority of Americans are center right . I believe most people do n't agree with President Obama 's policies . The direction he would like to take the country is not in step with what most Americans think is the right direction . '' David in Phoenix , Arizona : `` I do n't think he is polarizing . I think FOX News makes him out to be . '' Richard in Kansas : `` Because he 's an intelligent black man who also represents the changing demographics and cultural identity of the country . And that scares he hell out of a lot of white people . '' And Marge in Vancouver writes , `` It 's not that President Obama 's polarizing . It 's that the country is bipolar . Republicans , Democrats , Christian right , everyone else . People who like Sarah Palin , people with brains , kids who are naughty , kids who are nice . If Santa Claus was in the Oval Office , his poll numbers would be evenly split . '' BLITZER : Will do , Jack . See you tomorrow Super Bowl viewers saw more than a fiercely fought game . They saw companies spending millions of dollars on commercials . We 'll have a sample of that coming up . BLITZER : Super Sunday not so super for some . Here 's CNN 's Jeanne Moos . JEANNE MOOS , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : She cares more about her bowl than the Super Bowl , but the pug is a million-dollar winner . Biggest loser besides the Steelers was Christina Aguilera . Her national anthem bombed . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I was offended that she could n't get the words right . MOOS : The pug luckily had no speaking lines . Doritos invited folks to make their own commercials . MOOS : This one featured a guy teasing a pug through a glass door . -LRB- on camera -RRB- The budget for the pug commercial , $ 500 . The prize , a million bucks . -LRB- voice-over -RRB- The pug ad tied with a Budweiser ad for the most popular Super Bowl commercial , according to the `` USA Today '' ad meter . The creators just got engaged the other day , and the dog belongs to a friend . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Her name is Oko Nono . MOOS -LRB- on camera -RRB- : Oko Nono because she misbehaves and has to be told no , no so often that she thinks it 's her name . -LRB- voice-over -RRB- Now these two film-school grads have made their names . They 'll use the million-dollar prize for their wedding and film projects . And for the pug . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Some bling . We 've got to pimp out the pooch . MOO : But Christina Aguilera is the one in the doghouse for not singing the correct words , the ones on your screen . CHRISTINA AGUILERA , SINGER -LRB- singing -RRB- : What so proudly we watched at the twilight 's last gleaming . MOOS -LRB- on camera -RRB- : She may have forgotten the words this time , but she used to know them . And here 's the proof . -LRB- voice-over -RRB- Eleven-year-old Christina at a hockey game got through the line that all these years later tripped her up . But hey , lots of folks get stuck on the ramparts . Michael Bolton got over a million views on YouTube after he resorted to notes on his hand to get through the very same line . MICHAEL BOLTON , SINGER -LRB- singing -RRB- : ... was so gallantly streaming . MOOS : This boy at a basketball game was another casualty of the ramparts . At least Aguilera kept going and later apologized for getting caught up in the moment and losing her place . Some may criticize her ... UNIDENTIFIED MALE : That 's pretty disrespectful for this country . MOOS -LRB- on camera -RRB- : So you know the words ? MOOS -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : But even with a little prodding ... UNIDENTIFIED MALE -LRB- SINGING -RRB- : What so proudly we hailed and the ... -LRB- SPEAKING -RRB- Oh , no , I just messed up on TV ! MOOS : At least in this country , we 're free . Free to blow it .

An ad uploaded in a make-your-own-Super-Bowl-ad competition featured a priest swapping out communion bread for Doritos and wine for Pepsi - which owns Doritos and sponsored the contest -- in hopes of boosting church attendance . Next came JesusHatesObama.com , a political novelty t-shirt company that had dueling bobble heads of Jesus and Obama . The company said Fox rejected its ad . Fox did n't comment . The Fixed Point Foundation , a group that promotes Christianity in the public square , told CNN that Fox rejected its proposed Super Bowl ad last June . In the ad , people watching a football game spy the phrase John 3:16 - a New Testament verse popular among evangelical Christians -- on a player 's eye black . A man in the ad says he 's going to look it up , with the ad directing viewers to lookup316 . Fixed Point Executive Director Larry Taunton said Fox told him his commercial was rejected because it contained `` religious doctrine , '' though he said the ad avoided featuring the actual words of the verse . Everyone we dealt with at Fox couldn t have been more gracious or professional . I talked to them the day after last year s Super Bowl , Taunton said . Increasingly religion and Christianity is treated like smoking - you can do it but only in designated areas , he said . They were saying there s no place for -LRB- faith -RRB- in the public square . There s a place for the soft core porn of Go-Daddy , violent movie trailers , and irresponsible drinking , but not for faith . As a workaround , the Fixed Point Foundation ran its ad on Fox stations in Birmingham , Alabama and Washington , DC . Taunton said his group will try again or a Super Bowl ad next year . At the Eatocracy DC Super Bowl party I attended on Sunday night , there was consternation that during the halftime show , Usher appeared to be changing the lyrics to his song OMG from `` Oh my God '' to `` Oh my gosh . '' The move was resoundingly denounced by party guests as an overly politically correct move . Turns out the song has always been `` Oh My Gosh . '' The game itself saw plenty of touchdown end zone kneeling celebrations , including Green Bay wide receiver Greg Jennings kneeling and bowing his head after catching one of his two touchdown catches . And there were plenty God shout-outs in post-game coverage . A jubilant Jennings repeatedly told Fox 's Pam Oliver , `` To God be the glory . '' What 's God got to do with the Super Bowl ? Well , the Bible prohibits working on the Sabbath , so the game was subject to divine retribution from the start . Also , the Bible prohibits wearing fabric cut from different cloth , as well as shaving , things which many of the fans and players were guilty of . Coveting thy neighbor 's wife is also forbidden -LRB- are you listening , Rothlesberger ? -RRB- . We can only hope that no shrimp or BBQ pork were being consumed , since they are Biblically verbotten as well . In fact , it 's amazing the Lord did n't smite the whole heathen spectacle . But He was probably watching the Puppy Bowl anyway . John 3:16 ... there seems to be another `` controversial '' commercial that is getting passed around as well . it actually comments on the very verse of John 3:16 . it does n't look like the christians are liking it too much . maybe just a little too much TRUTH for them ?? They are going to have a PRAY OFF game soon apparently . . the teams will stand around a ball and pray . . when god kicks the ball over the line , that team wins . . So my gay and lesbian friends can shout '' we 're gay and proud ... Get used to it '' ... No issue . My African American relatives can see to the roof tops `` say it loud , I 'm black and I am proud '' ... No issue . Both statement can be proclaimed in the public arena , ... Shamed , as they should be , to those who attempt to say that either groups should not proclaim such . But , y ' all athiest think that we people of faith should do so in private and shame . Are you guys and girls actually that narrowminded and believing that you can force any group `` into the closet '' , be they Christians or any group . The moment you pressure one group back into the closet or the privacy of their own homes you are talking of oppression . Once you go down that road goodbye LGBT , any ethinic multiculturalism . Do not think it would stop there . Possibly because one 's skin color or se-xual orientation are natural , yet have been historically discriminated against . Your religion is personal choice . @W247 -- If you were offended with the way I said something then I apologize . Whether the true age of the earth is known to an exact year is debatable but it can not be said that just because we do not know the exact age that anything is possible . With radiometric age dating it clearly can be shown that the age of the earth as referred to in the Bible is incorrect . I guess every Christian I have talked to believes in the earth being relatively young but I should not paint you with this broad brush since you may have a different take on this matter . Also I have only recently begun studying the bible as I stated above but where does it talk about dinosaurs and what exactly does it say ? I have never heard of this before and it interests me a great deal , thank you for pointing it out , cheers . @W247 -- maybe you should come talk to those who ring my bell then . We have asked repeatedly for them to stop and have a no soliciting sign but that does n't stop them because they say it is their goal to spread the good word . Also not all Christians or Christian faith groups have the same beliefs or religious culture . I would not ever speak on behalf of all Sikhs of the world because even within the faith there are many different types of people , with different views and beleifs and how they interept what is written , told or passed on to them so how you would possibly know whether someone should be in church or not and at what time is beyond me . You tell me that you have been studying the the age of the earth yet you have no response or conclusion except to ask me what I have come up with . The Guru Granth Sahib is the Sikhs holy book and speaks of this , pick it up and take a read and broaden your mind , I am in the process of reading the Bible , have read passages of the Koran as well . The Sikhs holy book is the only one I know of that speaks about dinosaurs , space and time travel , multipile universes along with being good to others , peaceful living , hardwork , respect and faith that good will prevail . @well read -- you are absolutley right , you should just believe what is written in the bible and run with it . Maybe i 'm just naive or a product of the teachings my parents passed on to me but I was taught to question everything and constantly learn and grow , this again is also written in the Guru Granth Sahib and to never get stagnant and always expand your mind , body and soul . Also notice I did not say how old the earth was I just stated that the Bible is wrong and this obvious mistake or lie has not been acknowledged by those who follow blindly . You just assumed that I went with what certain scientists have stated . @GSA : since you did not state , and seemed to be reasonably minded , I did ask you what your base was for the age of the Earth . And that is a little bit belittling to tell me to go `` broaden my mind '' . I did not tell what , where , how , who I have been studying with . However I do not expect an apology from you . Yes , the bible does talk about dinosaurs and I am glad that are also a student and willing to read it for yourself . I hope you do so with an open mind . February 8 , 2011 at 4:27 pm | Report abuse | Roger Goldleader writes : `` Americans worship regularly at the TV altar , and the lust of the eyes , the lust of the flesh , and the pride of life are all `` nourished '' by what oozes out of our TV god . That is the religion being shoved down our throats actually , we just eat it all up because it feeds our notions of self sufficiency . We love everything that enables us to believe that we ourselves are god . So to have a player say , `` to God be the glory '' is the EXCEPTION TO THE RULE . '' This was an extremely valiant effort to spin it as such , but let 's talk about reality for a moment . According to the CIA 's website regarding the demographics of the United States , just under 80 % of the population are Christians while only 4 % have no religion . Now with that in mind , it is hilarious to listen to faith-driven people say how our country is in decline because we have left God out of our lives . It is PRECISELY that overwhelming Christian majority who are responsible for electing our politicians into office . So if you really believe that our country is upside down , guess who is to blame . Yep , that 's right . So with regard to the `` lustful '' items that are being brought to the `` TV altar , '' guess who is responsible for running those companies , for running those marketing departments , for running those ad agencies and for actually buying those products , etc , etc , etc. . . Or do you really think they are spending all of that money to market to only 4 % of the population ? @The -LRB- real -RRB- Truth -- so you care about me and my soul and show this to me by shoving a bunch of beliefs down my throat that come from a book that ca n't even get the age of the earth correct ? I am spiritual and have my own beliefs , I am not Christian though and there are reasons for that , all personal . I am sure that as a Sikh if I was constantly telling you my beliefs , why they are correct and why what you are doing is wrong via tv , magazines , flyers and ringing your doorbell at 8:00 am on a Sunday morning you would definitely be out of your comfort zone and thoroughly annoyed . Instead I know the truth and have 100 % confidence in my beliefs so I do not need to push them on anyone , why do you feel the need to push yours onto others ? Actually GSA , they would n't be ringing your doorbell at 8am , they would be getting ready to go to service . We have a little sign on our door that says `` No Soliciting '' . It has helped immensely with people coming to our door that we do n't know . However , I can hardly fault anyone for living out their faith regardless if I agree with them or not . There are a few things that I do take exception too , groups that willingly desecrate symbols of our freedom -LRB- IE : Burning a flag on the streets of NYC -RRB- , people that use violence or hate speech to get their point across . Age of the Earth : I have been studying on that one and looking at both sides of the argument for young earth versus an old earth theory . What information have you come up with ? February 8 , 2011 at 2:22 pm | Report abuse | Christians and Muslims are required by their respective texts to spread their beliefs . If they fail to do so , then can they claim to be true adherants to the faith ? No , they would be labeled as hypocrites for not living out those beliefs . February 8 , 2011 at 3:55 pm | Report abuse | All reliable scientific evidence supports an Earth that is approximately 4.5 billion years old . As far as I am aware there are not `` both sides '' of this data , there is the evidence and there are ideas made up by biblical literalists . So you 're okay with inaccuracy as long as it 's consistent . Banks must love you . I 'm not sure if the scriptures are consistent , to which translation are you referring ? And which interpretation of that translation ? February 8 , 2011 at 4:43 pm | Report abuse | Alive in Jesus in Atlanta How do you know they werent just taking a breath and enjoying the moment ? If people wanted to hear about religion on football Sunday , then they can go to Church . This constant need for proselytizing in sports and other areas has gotten worse than the Mormons showing up knocking on someone 's front door . What would all of you think if an atheist QB won the SuperBowl and then came out in the post game ceremony and said , `` I 'd like to thank the fact that there is no God and congratulate myself and my hard work for winning this game and being able to perform on the field . '' The reality is that the Christian world would have a conniption fit . Yet when a Christian does the EXACT same thing -LRB- except including God -RRB- , then it is perfectly fine . None of that even begins to address the fact that these men are playing a violent game -LRB- Jesus was n't running around playing violent games -RRB- , living in multi-million dollar mansions -LRB- while Jesus was poor -RRB- , working on Sunday -LRB- when the Bible says to keep the Sabbath holy -RRB- , intentionally abusing and destroying the body and brain that God gave them -LRB- due to the abuse that is the NFL game -RRB- , etc , etc , etc. . Good thing there is no hypocrisy there . I support people having their own religious preferences , but they do n't need to shove it down everyone 's throat every single time that the opportunity arises . May I note that the entire spectacle of professional sports , of which the Super Bowl seems to be the preeminent event , along with the attendant advertisements , glitz , self-worship , and idolotry all loudly proclaim `` there is no God and I congratulate myself and my hard work for winning ! '' Americans worship regularly at the TV altar , and the lust of the eyes , the lust of the flesh , and the pride of life are all `` nourished '' by what oozes out of our TV god . That is the religion being shoved down our throats -- actually , we just eat it all up because it feeds our notions of self sufficiency . We love everything that enables us to believe that we ourselves are god . So to have a player say , `` to God be the glory '' is the EXCEPTION TO THE RULE .

So thanking `` the fact that there is no God '' would actually have to be them going out of their way to make a dig at those who believe in God .

We love everything that enables us to believe that we ourselves are god . So to have a player say , `` to God be the glory '' is the EXCEPTION TO THE RULE . '' This was an extremely valiant effort to spin it as such , but let 's talk about reality for a moment . According to the CIA 's website regarding the demographics of the United States , just under 80 % of the population are Christians while only 4 % have no religion . Now with that in mind , it is hilarious to listen to faith driven people say how our country is in decline because we have left God out of our lives . It is PRECISELY that overwhelming Christian majority who are responsible for electing our politicians into office . So if you really believe that our country is upside down , guess who is to blame . Yep , that 's right . So with regard to the `` lustful '' items that are being brought to the `` TV altar , '' guess who is responsible for running those companies , for running those marketing departments , for running those ad agencies and for actually buying those products , etc , etc , etc. . . Or do you really think they are spending all of that money to market to only 4 % of the population ? \\*\\*\\* Lydia writes : `` how is someone saying `` Thank God '' bothersome if you do n't believe in God ? '' \\*\\*\\* People were in an uproar when Cassius Clay became Muhammad Ali and a Muslim . Why was that bothersome to people ? \\*\\*\\* `` And there are plenty of people -LRB- TO for example -RRB- who mostly just laud themselves , and that 's their right . '' \\*\\*\\* TO claims to be a Christian . Back when he was with the Eagles -LRB- one of his most disruptive stints -RRB- , he was even quoted as saying , It doesn t matter what the doctor said . I have the best doctor in God . '' \\*\\*\\* `` The example of someone thanking the fact that there is no God is obtuse , and not actually the opposite of someone thanking God . '' \\*\\*\\* Fine , I can play along ... so what if someone after the game thanks Satan for helping them win the game ? After all , according to the Bible itself , God killed FAR more people than Satan . Most people are shocked to learn about how many people the devil actually killed . In the Bible , the number of SPECIFIC references to the number of people that God killed is in excess of 2.3 Million . None of that even accounts for abstract events such as `` the flood , '' then that number is likely in excess of 30 Million people . And how many people has the devil killed ? The answer is 10 . Not 10 Million , not 10 Thousand , but rather 10 . That 's 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 . Even more ironic is that the 10 people that he killed were in a `` bet '' of sorts with God with regard to Job and his family , so God was directly implicated in those as well . So looking at the final specific tally that is most favorable to God , it is : Do n't shoot the messenger ... I 'm only reporting what the Bible says . \\*\\*\\* `` Thanking God is like thanking anyone else for a gift you received . '' \\*\\*\\* If they want to thank God , by all means let them do so as much as they 'd like ... in PRIVATE . If they are on the Christian News Network , then let them thank God all they want there as people can then tune it to see it where the format is appropriate . In fact , Jesus even speaks about not drawing attention to yourself : From Matthew : `` And when you pray , do not be like the hypocrites , for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men . I tell you the truth , they have received their reward in full . But when you pray , go into your room , close the door and pray to your Father , who is unseen . Then your Father , who sees what is done in secret , will reward you . '' Why are n't Christians\\/Catholics spending that hour out helping the needy instead of wasting that hour trying to look and feel good about themselves in Church ? People go to Church for their own reasons , not because of what Jesus tells them to do as evidenced above . As an aside , Jackson Browne has a great song called `` The Rebel Jesus . '' Check out the lyrics . \\*\\*\\* `` If a person believes there is no God , then it 's like they bought it themselves ... no need to thank anything . So thanking `` the fact that there is no God '' would actually have to be them going out of their way to make a dig at those who believe in God . '' \\*\\*\\* So let 's be blatantly honest here ... the reason why these people are thanking God in droves is to draw attention to themselves and to draw attention to the general population that they believe there is a God . Thus , someone saying that to the general population that they believe that there is n't a God really is n't much different . \\*\\*\\* `` Yes , there are those evangelicals who would have you believe you are a terrible person if you are not Christian , who will hate you and claim you are the scourge of the earth those are the people that protest gay soldiers ' funerals and things like that ... and those people are wrong . '' \\*\\*\\* I can not begin to tell you how refreshing it is to hear a person of faith make a statement like that . There need to be a lot more people like yourself speaking out about items such as that . Sincere kudos to you ! \\*\\*\\* `` But by and large , those ads are done by Christians who believe they have found a good thing and want to share it ... much the same as I tell every high school student I meet how great the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was for me . It 's up to them to decide if it would be good for them , too , but I feel obligated to share . '' Take Tim Tebow for a second here . I am actually a big Tebow fan . His religious stance is obviously well known and it is rather annoying to constantly hear about it when I 'm trying to watch football and not feel like I am in church . With that said , I GREATLY admire Tim for standing up for his beliefs . And I admire him for that because he is n't a hypocrite about it and actually practices first hand what he preaches . Tim 's SuperBowl ad was APPROVED by the NFL last year which was a pro-life ad . And he did the ad tastefully without throwing around words like abortion , the Bible and Christianity left and right . Well , I can support you 100 % there !!! Your post was a very `` Christian '' type of response on your part , so I commend you for that . In an odd way , you remind me of myself at one point in time in my life when I too used to believe . Since then I have expanded my horizons and looked at the situation from a logical perspective . I am not ruling out the possibility of a Supreme Being , just ruling out that a Supreme Being had anything to do with writing the Bible -LRB- as I 'd then have to believe that the Supreme Being is a simpleton if he had a hand in writing the Bible due to the countless errors contained within -RRB- . The Bible is littered with errors , contradictions and prophecies that never came to pass . In fact it contradicts itself starting in THE VERY FIRST TWO CHAPTERS of Genesis when the order of creation is mixed up to having only 2 of the 4 Gospel writers bothering to talk about the birth of Jesus -LRB- and those two accounts conflict with each other while also providing timelines which make it impossible for Jesus to have been born based on their accounts -RRB- to 3 of the 4 Gospel writers not agreeing on what the final words of Jesus were . If I saw the Son of God die right in front me , I think I 'd remember his last words verbatim ... would n't you ? The facts are that a 5th grader today knows more about the world that we live in than did the uneducated people who wrote the Bible . It is ironic that everyone here would NEVER let a 5th grader dictate the course of your life , but when it comes to the Bible , then it all of the sudden `` magically '' becomes OK to do so . In any event , I 'd encourage you to keep an open mind because I am exponentially MUCH happier being freed from the guilt and constraints of organized religion than I was before . Just because I do n't have a `` Christian '' label attached to me does n't mean that I ca n't still do good works on my own . In the end , I can simply follow the Golden Rule ... `` Do unto others as you would want them to do unto you . '' Interestingly enough , that exists in almost every religion and since God 's people encompass the planet , that makes far more sense than relying on a 2,000 year old book written by uneducated men and a corrupt machine that is organized religion to rule my life : Bah ' Faith : `` And if thine eyes be turned towards justice , choose thou for thy neighbor that which thou choosest for thyself . '' Brahmanism : Do naught unto others which would cause you pain if done to you . '' Buddhism : `` Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful . '' Confucianism : `` Do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you . '' Egyptian : `` Do for one who may do for you , that you may cause him thus to do . '' Hinduism : `` This is the sum of duty : do not do to others what would cause pain if done to you . '' Humanism : `` Do n't do things you would n't want to have done to you . '' Islam : `` None of you truly believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself . '' Jainism : `` In happiness and suffering , in joy and grief , we should regard all creatures as we regard our own self . '' Judaism : `` What is hateful to you , do not to your fellow man . This is the law : all the rest is commentary . '' Native American : `` Do not wrong or hate your neighbor . For it is not he who you wrong , but yourself . '' Shinto : `` The heart of the person before you is a mirror . See there your own form . '' Sikhism : `` No one is my enemy , none a stranger and everyone is my friend . '' Taoism : `` Regard your neighbor 's gain as your own gain , and your neighbor 's loss as your own loss . '' Yoruba : `` One going to take a pointed stick to pinch a baby bird should first try it on himself to feel how it hurts . '' Zoroastrianism : `` Whatever is disagreeable to yourself do not do unto others . '' In the end , it is obvious that all religions share this theme . That is the rule to follow , not because it is in some book , but because it is shared across religions and humanity . If you were born in Tibet or Iran , you 'd still be following that rule . Logic dictates this is FAR more sensible . In any event , best wishes to you . Excellent response by you to @Lydia . p.s.

There are dozens of other companies wanting to get their commercials on during the Super Bowl and I think it was actually nice on the part of Fox to explain why the ad was rejected when they had no obligation to do so . Was there a Football Game after the Eminem Chrysler\\/Detriot commercial ? After that ... I thought all that could be said was said . isnt it AMERICAN to have the freedom of your choice of religion just as it is to have the choice to criticize other peoples choice of religion ???? GOD , isnt it great to be AMERICAN ???? and have that freedom ? or would you rather it be dictated to you as to what religion you WILL believe or you will be stoned to death ALLAH AKBAR Ok , the lyrics to Usher 's song actually are oh my gosh , so that 's someone being oversensitive and not knowing what they 're talking about -LRB- especially since many Christians would actually consider it oh my God to be taking God 's name in vain -- violating one of the 10 commandments -- and just as bad as saying God damn -RRB- . And while I 'm sure god cares very little about who wins or loses the Super Bowl , however , the people who make up those teams and say `` to God be the glory '' are not wrong . Christians are supposed to aim for excellence in everything that they do , representing and bringing glory to God . So while God may not have forced Troy Polamalu out of coverage , he certainly gave Greg Jennings the strength to train for and play the game at such a high level . I do n't think anyone can blame someone for being grateful to God for making good things possible for them . I really do not understand why people would get offended by advertisements for churches or with Bible verses , religion is no more being forced on a person by them seeing a commercial than Coors is going to get them drunk through the tv . It 's an ad like any other , buy it or do n't .

Second of all what 's God got to do with the SuperBowl . Sure did n't list anything about that in the commandments . Here 's what God has to do with the superbowl .

He made the stadium and the fans in it that make the game possible . He made the cameras so all the people around the world could see the game . Finally , He made you and me to give Him glory and honor and praise and without Him , nothing that you see would exist , including our children . So I say THANK YOU GOD , YOU ARE AWESOME . Thank God for people who are willing to stand on what they believe . The best part of it all is that HE died in our place for the sins we have committed against Him . We are undeserving of His grace but He gives it to us anyway . Thank God for Jesus Christ .

Look at these bad designs . When we study the retina at the back of the eye , we can see that the cell layers are backwards . Light has to travel thru seven layers of cells before reaching the light sensing cells . Then the signals go back thru these layers to the nerves on the inside surface . In addition , the blood vessels are on the inside surface and further block the light . A truly intelligent designer could have done better than the human eye . Actually , evolution did a better job with the eyes of birds -LRB- which have no blood vessels in the retina -RRB- and the octopus and squid -LRB- which have the light sensing cells on the surface -RRB- . In fact , vision is so useful for survival that eyes have evolved independently at least twenty separate times , with at least a dozen different designs . Humans and other animals have many more examples of sub-optimal or bad design . Here are a few : One of the worst designs in mammals is the nerve for the larynx , called the recurrent laryngeal nerve . It is much longer than it needs to be going from the brain into the chest , around the aorta , and back up to the larynx . In humans it 's about three feet too long , but in giraffes it 's about fifteen feet longer than needed . The human pelvis slopes forward , which was useful for our knuckle-walking ancestors . The only reason that we can walk upright is because we have an incredible sharp bend at the base of our spines -LRB- which is the source for so much low back pain -RRB- . The human baby 's skull is too big , such that many women painfully die in childbirth if they do n't get modern medicine Evidence of evolutionThe extreme detour of this nerve in giraffes -LRB- fifteen feet farther than the direct route of a designer -RRB- is cited as evidence of evolution as opposed to intelligent design . -LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- edit -RRB- References1 . ^ Dawkins , Richard -LRB- 2009 -RRB- .

Only by an extremely sharp bend of our spine can we stand erect : an evolutionary artifact or a design weakness obvious to any first-year engineering student ? -LRB- 2 -RRB- Our mouths have too many teeth : either the result of an evolutionarily flattened mammalian muzzle or a design plan that could n't count accurately above twenty ? -LRB- 3 -RRB- Our facial bones are squashed by an expanded brain case to produce a sinus drainage system that would embarrass the local plumber : evolution or just plain stupid design ? So I say THANK YOU GOD , YOU ARE AWESOME . ? A note about the children god `` gives '' us : Psalm 127:3 Children are a gift of the LORD Notice how god does n't check to see if a woman is capable of raising a child , before he gives a baby to them ? Women in poor countries bear children , only to have them die , because Mom has no food . Women addicted to drugs are given babies , when they are totally incapable of taking care of themselves , much less a child . Girls are blessed with a baby they do n't want . Why are babies given to women who do n't want them ? If god would be more careful with giving out gifts\\/children , abortion would n't be needed . Your god is not awesome . You just use selective observation . The reason there are all these bad things in the world is because we disobeyed God . God is n't the underacheiver , we are . Evil people enjoying long lives ?

Anyone who has spent any time there in the past few years could see this coming . Egyptian youth have been in a state of paralysis . They ca n't find jobs , ca n't afford to get married , and have little hope for real change . Anyone under 30 has lived under emergency law their entire life . In plain English , it means more powers for the police , fewer constitutional rights , and a whole lot of censorship . Thousands of people have been detained , and there are an untold number of political prisoners . I have been working with youth , civil society and political organizations in Egypt over the past year . The frustration they felt was palpable . But this past fall the dynamic changed . For the first time , many of them were going to vote . They had braved going to the police stations for voter cards , many bringing their parents with them in case they were harassed or detained . They had organized Facebook campaigns to rally Egyptian youth to get involved in the political process . A quota had been passed to seat more women in parliament . There was talk of a better future . It seems the Egyptian government sensed it , too . A friend of mine who was also working with youth groups was detained in October as he arrived in Cairo . A consultant for Emerson Human Capital , Mark Webster has worked in Egypt for years without incident . Webster had been doing communication work with youth groups using tools such as Facebook and YouTube . But with the November election approaching , he was detained for 15 hours at the Cairo airport . His request to call the U.S. embassy was denied . He was asked if he knew Hillary Clinton and if Human Capital had anything to do with human rights . As Webster put it , `` this surely was odd behavior for an American ally in the region , but not odd behavior for a dictatorship . '' The Egyptian government did not allow outside monitors to observe the elections . There were reports of rampant fraud and abuse . Some young people I had worked with sent me messages complaining that polling places had been closed early . Some were not even let in to vote . Many female candidates were not given party support or funding . It was a devastating blow to those young Egyptians who had worked so hard to try to initiate change . It was hard to be encouraging . That is , until we saw what happened in Tunisia . I got a message the night before the protests from a young woman I had trained in Cairo . She wanted me to know that thousands of youth were going to demonstrate to fight corruption . She warned that police violence was expected and wanted me to spread the news to support her in her fight for freedom . The news spread like wildfire over the huge social networks those groups had built over the years . But their only plan was to unseat President Hosni Mubarak . It did n't take long for other voices to co-opt their message . Mubarak took his time responding , letting protest fatigue set in . Lines of communication were shut down . Mubarak did not step down . My heart broke when I saw the violence erupt in the streets . The young people who are in touch with me say many of those `` pro-Mubarak '' supporters were paid thugs , some flashing department of the interior badges . Others report that Egyptian state television is broadcasting that Israeli agents and the media are behind the demonstrations in Tahrir Square . Journalists were hunted as they continued to shine a light on what is going on there . It is not an exaggeration to suggest that the future of a whole generation is riding on the outcome of this showdown . Stunned by the news out of Egypt ?

He names Omar Suleiman , his longtime intelligence chief , as vice president -- the first time he has filled that position since taking office in 1981 . Protesters are not satisfied : Clashes continue around Cairo 's Tahrir -LRB- Liberation -RRB- Square , and hospital officials in Alexandria tell CNN that at least 31 people have been killed there . In Washington , U.S. President Barack Obama says he has told Mubarak that he must take `` concrete steps '' to deliver on his pledge of reform . Britain , France and Germany issue a joint statement calling on Mubarak to begin a `` process of transformation , '' including free elections .

Dotson , then a single 33-year-old mother , was an intensive-care nurse at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio , Texas . She was on a pre-Thanksgiving holiday when she disappeared . She was supposed to meet friends at a smoothie shop about a half-mile from her brother 's home . She left the home on the afternoon of November 19 , but she did n't appear at the smoothie shop . When her 16-month-old daughter woke up crying the next morning , her family realized that Dotson had n't returned . Police said there was no activity on her bank accounts , credit cards or cell phone . No suspects have been named . Actress Lindsay Lohan will be charged Wednesday with felony grand theft relating to a necklace allegedly taken from a Venice , California , jewelry store last month , a prosecutor said Tuesday . Lohan , 24 , will be arraigned on the charge at 1:30 p.m. Wednesday at the Los Angeles Airport Superior Court , Deputy District Attorney John Lynch said . The actress `` allegedly walked out of the store with the necklace on January 22 , '' a statement from the district attorney 's office said . `` The owner reported the theft to the Los Angeles Police Department , which investigated the allegation and presented evidence to the D.A. 's office last week . '' The necklace , which is valued at $ 2,500 , was handed over to police just before they were to execute a search warrant to look for the jewelry in Lohan 's Venice , California , apartment last week . Lohan was already on supervised probation stemming from probation violations related to a 2007 drunk driving conviction . A transitional government is overseeing sweeping changes in Tunisia after massive demonstrations forced out the country 's longtime president and sparked similar protests across the Middle East . Under president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , the news media was tightly controlled . Internet activity was monitored and access to some sites was restricted . Police routinely stopped people without cause to check their identity and question them - it was a policy that the government said was needed to prevent terrorists from gaining a foothold in Tunisia . Tunisians limited what they spoke about with friends and neighbors for fear that someone might be a police informer . Today , internet filters have disappeared and there is unfettered access to all websites . Journalists are learning how to create a free press as they transform their newspapers , radio broadcasts and television stations . People express their opinions openly in the streets . Reforms are taking place in every region of the country , which is home to about 12 million people . The question is , will these changes last ? Snow began falling over Colorado and Kansas Tuesday as yet another round of winter weather began marching across the United States barely a week after a record-setting winter storm roared across the Midwest . A powerful weather system poised over the Rockies is forecast to dump several feet of snow in the Mountain West and up to 10 inches in some parts of Oklahoma , forecasters said . Much of Oklahoma is under a winter storm warning , but snow and sleet are predicted as far south as central Texas , with 2 to 4 inches expected to coat the Dallas-Fort Worth area , the National Weather Service said . Later in the week , the system is expected to bring rain and snow to many areas of the Deep South before delivering a wintry mix along portions of the East Coast by Thursday . With protesters still in the streets of Cairo and newly appointed government officials meeting with some opposition leaders , Egypt faces an uncertain future . The outcome will depend largely on the course charted by a transitional government . Many other countries have been down the path Egypt finds itself on . A popular uprising undermines the authority of a long-standing regime and a period of chaos ensues . Transitional governments often take control and their success at ushering in change varies depending on a multitude of factors . `` In many of these cases , if the military splits or goes against the ruler and helps to bring in some transition with popular support , it still may take a cycle or more to get to an actual democratic regime or to accomplish real change , '' said Georgia State University political science professor Jennifer McCoy , citing past transitions in Latin American , Eastern Europe and the Philippines . There is no guaranteed route to success , McCoy said , and often , while there may be some wholesale changes , the people in positions of authority remain at the top in transitional governments . In a case where there is no clear leader or leading group such as in Egypt today that spurred the change , it s very difficult to predict where it s going to go . '' Click here for the entire interview : You can also listen to the CNN Radio Reports podcast on Coach Tom Walter donated a kidney to Wake Forest baseball player Kevin Jordan . Wake Forest University outfielder Kevin Jordan and coach Tom Walter are recovering after surgery at Emory University in Atlanta , team spokesman Steven Wright said . `` Coach Walter told the team about a week ago what he wanted to do and , well , there were just a bunch of stunned faces in the room , '' Wright said . `` But the coach did n't really seemed fazed by the surgery .

Walter reportedly stepped up after learning that none of the athlete 's relatives were a match .

I had the support of my family , Wake Forest and my team . To me it was a no-brainer . '' Donating a kidney is an incredible act of generosity , but there 's something uniquely remarkable about this case . The freshman from Columbus , Georgia , has n't even played a game with Wake Forest yet . Jordan , who was the New York Yankees pick in the 19th round of 2010 's amateur draft , had only practiced with his teammates last fall at Wake Forest . He started school at Wake Forest last August , and endured hours of dialysis a day while keeping up with the demands of college ball and his school work . In recent months , his health began to deteriorate , Wright said . Next semester , Jordan will take time off at home to recover from the surgery . But the coach has said he plans to be at Wake Forest 's first game against LSU in less than two weeks . `` He might not be catching fly balls , '' said Wright . `` But Coach Walter will be with his team .

We see this now in the wave of protests spreading across Tunisia and Egypt . We saw it in Ivory Coast where stolen elections threaten a return to civil war . We saw it in Haiti where years of corruption have taken their toll . And the list can go on around the world . But to be free of corruption , people need leaders who act with integrity and transparency ; leaders who are responsive to the needs of all citizens so that the management of public goods benefits everyone not just the elites . Independent oversight institutions and a vibrant civil society play a key role in holding governments to account . In many parts of the world , both are lacking . The protests we are witnessing now are in countries where democracy is weak or nonexistent and civil society has a muted voice . People fear repression if they speak out . Anti-corruption and other activists are limited by legal restrictions and , as we have seen , often subjected to government harassment and intimidation . Not surprisingly , on January 27 , when 2,200 Arab academics , politicians and activists from more than 20 Arab countries issued the Casablanca Call to protect human rights and democracy , they demanded civil society organizations be allowed `` to perform their advocacy roles freely and effectively . '' So far , 148 countries have ratified the U.N. Convention Against Corruption , which outlines a comprehensive anti-corruption framework . Journalists in Egypt reveal plight White House shifting tone on Egypt Egyptian opposition leader slams regime This includes a commitment to implement access to information and whistleblower-protection legislation . It also requires laws to prevent money laundering and mechanisms to identify and return stolen assets . Unfortunately , in many countries it is largely disregarded . In November , the Group of 20 said it would lead by example and called on all its members to implement the U.N. Convention Against Corruption as part of its Anti-Corruption Action Plan . At Transparency International , we welcomed this strong statement and are following its implementation across the globe . That is a role that civil society can and should play . Independent assessment of government provides an important check on power . It is a foundation stone of a strong democracy . Clearly , it would be nave to assume that just giving people a greater say in government will end official corruption overnight , but it is an important , necessary starting point . Our latest research shows that given the chance , ordinary people will stand up to corruption . Two-thirds of the 91,000 people questioned in 86 countries for our 2010 Global Corruption Barometer said they would support their friends or colleagues if they fought against corruption . Today , people see freedom from corruption as a basic human right . They are right to do so . No one should have to live under a regime where corruption is endemic . For Tunisian fruit vendor Mohamed Bouazizi , corruption defeated hope , and he set himself alight , becoming the catalyst to the protests that are holding the world 's attention . The image of his family throwing coins at the local government office gate , money he was allegedly asked to pay as a bribe , is a poignant reminder that corruption kills . What followed took the world by surprise . It should not have . Nor should the scenes of people filling the streets to protest against their governments , demanding greater accountability and an end to corruption .

Numerous Arab governments have used violence to quash demonstrations in the wake of mass protests in Egypt , a leading human rights group says in a new report . Human Rights Watch , which says it conducts `` rigorous , objective investigations , '' issued the report Tuesday alleging clampdowns by Palestinian leadership , Saudi Arabia , Sudan , Syria , the United Arab Emirates , and Yemen . `` Images of the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt have mesmerized the Arab public but have terrified their rulers , '' Sarah Leah Whitson , the group 's Middle East and North Africa director , said in a statement . `` They have responded with their usual mix of repression and intimidation to nip the buds of any wider democratic blossoming . '' Human Rights Watch said the Palestinian Authority , which controls the West Bank , `` used violence against peaceful demonstrators '' during a rally last week in which people were supporting the Egyptian protesters . `` Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that regular police and ` special forces , ' identifiable by their uniforms , punched , kicked , and detained participants , as well as at least two journalists and a Human Rights Watch research assistant , '' the report said . The report added that on January 30 , the Palestinian Authority shut down a solidarity demonstration . Hamas , which controls Gaza , `` quashed a solidarity demonstration on January 31 , '' Human Rights Watch said . `` The police arbitrarily arrested six women and threatened to arrest another 20 people , who had responded to a call on Facebook for a demonstration , as soon as they arrived at the Park of the Unknown Soldier in Gaza City . '' CNN reported on the January 31 demonstration , in which Hamas security broke up the event and detained some female protesters . CNN has also reported on the Palestinian Authority breaking up two attempts to stage small rallies . The Palestinian Authority said participants did not have government permission for the rallies . Witnesses said participants were pushed and shoved , and some were detained . Later , both the Palestinian Authority and Hamas allowed some events supporting solidarity with Egypt to take place . On Saturday , Palestinians demonstrating in support of Egyptian anti-government protesters , at an approved event in Ramallah , were forcibly dispersed when a few dozen men in civilian clothes disrupted the protest .

Cairo , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- - Wael Ghonim , the Egyptian activist being hailed by many fellow protesters as a hero , had a message Wednesday for his country 's leaders : `` If you are true Egyptians , if you are heroic Egyptians , it 's time to step down . '' In an exclusive interview with CNN , Ghonim , who was freed by Egyptian authorities on Monday after 10 days , said it is `` no longer the time to negotiate '' with the regime of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak . `` There 's a lot of blood now '' that has been spilled , he said . It 's time for people at the highest levels of the government `` to apologize to the families '' of those killed , he said . Human Rights Watch said Tuesday the number of people killed in the Egyptian protests has reached 302 - 232 in Cairo , 52 in Alexandria and 18 in Suez .

He was the administrator of a Facebook page that is widely credited with calling the first protest January 25 . A Google executive who lives in Dubai with his wife and two children , he had returned to Egypt for the protests . His disappearance January 28 quickly captured international attention . All youth in Egypt like Wael Ghonim , From my point of view he is the most appropriate person to be the leader of the protesters and to talk to the vice president to convince him with the deterioration in Egypt 's economic if president Mubarak stay in his position . We see every day labors strikes in Egypt , this will increasing and will not stop until Mubarak steps down . February 10 , 2011 at 7:36 am | Any attempt at seeing both sides of this conflict , went out the window for me the day he unleashed his modern day version of the `` Brown Shirts '' upon the crowd of peaceful protestors . I watched in disbelief as those goons spent the better part of 24 hours trying to physically smash the movement . I went to bed that evening believing they had succeeded in crushing the revolt . Then I woke up , turned on the news , and found that the protestors had beaten back the Goons , and pushed them out of the square . But there is the rub . This story has now become a `` standoff '' . Mubarek can hang on , his state run TV can spew their lies , and they can wait for the fire to leave the heart of this movement . Those people in the square dare not leave , the waters are very dangerous beyond the confines they have fought for . In effect , they have done what they can do with just a powerful thought , but no one thought that guns may be needed . Force may be needed . Hosni Mubarek obviously thought about that ... so the standoff continues . I guess the best we can hope for is the world 's media continues to shine the light on this story , and the Egyptians figure out how to get Mubarek to leave , without much more bloodshed . If the media moves on eventually ... that die hard group in Tahrir Square will be in very serious trouble . They want the man out ... but what is their plan for governence ?

February 10 , 2011 at 12:06 am | The people involved in the revolution should be commended for their goals towards equality and freedom and also for their resolve . However , they should recognize that what is critical to their ultimate success is the election of representatives that can negociate in their behalf . They should consider electing representatives ready to take over the key goverment function to keep the country functional until elections take place . This way foreign goverment will have no choice but to take sides and hopefully they will support the freedom supporters .

The crowd swelled as the 15th day of protests progressed . A second front sprouted as several hundred protesters filled the city block where Egypt 's parliament building stands . Wael Ghonim , the Google executive who was seized January 28 and released Monday , may be emerging as a face for Egypt 's uprising . After a television interview that inspired protesters , Ghonim spoke from a makeshift stage Tuesday in Tahrir Square . `` This country , I have said for a long time , this country is our country , and everyone has a right to this country , '' he said . `` You have a voice in this country . This is not the time for conflicting ideas , or factions , or ideologies . This is the time for us to say one thing only , ` Egypt is above all else . ' '' His words prompted the protesters to begin chanting `` Egypt above all else . '' Freed Prisoners Tell Their Stories Getting to the truth in Egypt Journalists in Egypt reveal plight `` I apologize to you , I am so tired , '' Ghonim said . `` Today we are emphasizing our voice . '' As he walked off the stage , Ghonim told a reporter in English , `` We do n't care . We are going to do what we 've got to do . '' Ghonim , a Dubai-based marketing executive , is the administrator of a Facebook page called `` We are all Khaled Said , '' named after an Alexandria activist who was allegedly beaten to death by police . The page is widely credited with calling the first protest January 25 . Another Facebook page created to authorize Ghonim to speak on behalf of the protesters has 150,000 fans . `` I came today for the first time -LRB- Tuesday -RRB- , '' said Dalia , a protester in Tahrir Square . She did not give her last name . `` Nothing will make this regime go unless we keep on coming and keep on coming . '' Earlier , Vice President Omar Suleiman announced on state television that a committee has been authorized to amend Egypt 's constitution to allow for free , fair and competitive elections . The amendments , Suleiman said , would be drafted by an independent judicial commission . He said he had discussed a number of reforms in recent talks with opposition representatives . Among them were greater freedom for the media , the release of detainees and the lifting of the continuous state of emergency . He also assured Egyptians that they should not fear arrest for speaking their minds . But with the credibility of the regime in serious question , the statements from President Hosni Mubarak 's deputy fell short . Real change , say Mubarak 's foes , can only come with Mubarak 's immediate departure and an overhaul of the constitution , not amendments here and there . `` That 's not good enough , '' said Mohammed Habib , a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood , a key opposition party in Egypt that is outlawed by the constitution on grounds that it is based on religion . `` The first thing that the regime should do is for the president to leave , '' he said . `` The government is dividing the opposition through these announcements . '' Asem Abedine , head of the pan-Arab Nassiri party , said Mubarak is merely angling for time . `` The government is only making these announcements to avoid making real changes demanded by the people , '' he said . `` The emergency laws should be lifted . '' Mubarak has ruled Egypt with an iron hand since 1981 , aided by an emergency decree that gave him sweeping powers . How wealthy is Egypt 's Mubarak ? Since the protests began January 25 , he has appointed a vice president for the first time , reshuffled his Cabinet and announced that he wo n't seek a new term in September . However , the constitution remains , reshaped in 2005 and again in 2007 to help retain power for the ruling National Democratic Party . It has been at the heart of the dialogue between the government and some opposition representatives , who want several articles amended to make way for greater political participation . The demonstrations , powered by the stamina of those who have put everything at risk for change , got an extra shot of energy Tuesday from Ghonim 's emotional interview on Egypt 's Dream TV . He said four people surrounded him at 1 a.m. on January 28 . `` I yelled , ` Help me , ' but of course I knew these were security forces . `` The thing that tortured me the most when I was in detention was that people would find out that I was the admin -LRB- of the Facebook page -RRB- , '' he said . `` Because I am not the hero -- I was writing with the keyboard on the internet and my life was not exposed to any danger . '' He walked out of the Dream TV interview in tears after being shown photos of those killed in the uprising . `` I want to say to every mother and every father that lost his child , I am sorry , but this is not our fault , '' he said before leaving . `` I swear to God this is not our fault . It is the fault of everyone who was holding onto power greedily and would not let it go . '' But while the crowds remained large and boisterous , opposition voices have started to splinter . Some , including members of the self-declared Council of the Wise , have said they do n't agree that Mubarak 's immediate departure would be the best thing for Egypt . Arab League Secretary-General Amre Moussa , who was among protesters last week , told CNN that Mubarak should be allowed a `` dignified exit '' in September . `` I believe that the president should stay until the end of his mandate . The consensus is growing on this point because of certain constitutional considerations , '' Moussa said . State television in Egypt is suggesting that the United States is helping fund the protests , which -- it says -- have been infiltrated by Hamas , Hezbollah , Iran and others . The divisions within the opposition raised fears that they could work to the regime 's advantage . `` The danger at the moment is that this opposition , which a few days ago seemed to unite , is now being divided , '' said Cairo-based analyst Issandr El Amrani . `` The regime is using its tried and true tactic of divide and conquer .

Now we see that Eid is just one of hundreds of thousands of Egyptians who are finding their voices for the first time in their lives . Yesterday 's demonstrations in Tahrir Square were the largest yet and were relatively peaceful , thanks in part to the Egyptian Army . While it is n't the army 's intention to help the youth-driven uprising gain ground , Kissinger Associates ' Jami Miscik explains , some of its actions are helping them continue the protests in a mostly violence-free setting . That leads to the swelling of their numbers . Eid , who participated in the Fortune-U.S. State Department Global Women Leaders Mentoring program last year , was back with the masses at Tahrir Square yesterday . Here is her report . - Patricia Sellers The numbers have increased to the extent that we can not walk without bumping into people . We had to walk sideways . Previously , Army checkpoints were to make sure that the protesters do not have weapons or explosions going into Tahrir . Their role now is also to prevent the pro-Mubarak protesters from entering into Tahrir to avoid clashes with the anti- Mubarak protesters . Yesterday I went into Tahrir from another direction and went through the `` citizens checkpoint , '' where citizens check IDs and look for weapons . There is a physical search as well . A friend of a friend is a police officer , completely anti-regime . He wanted to come and protest as well as donate medicine . At the checkpoint , he showed them his ID ; it has your occupation on it . It said `` police officer . '' They asked him to leave Tahrir -LRB- as big as it is -RRB- or he would be escorted by the Army ! -LRB- No police patrols or officers are there in Tahrir . -RRB- He left , to avoid being thrown out or beaten !

That would include oversight of the police , the Interior Ministry and other key agencies , control of economic policy and running any negotiations with the opposition .

It is fair to talk now about a second stage in the protests against Mubarak 's government as thousands of ordinary Egyptians cast aside their doubts and joined to make the street protests the next day the biggest yet . Why did this one interview , this one person , so galvanize the protest movement ? Because it was the first time ordinary Egyptians heard a protest leader passionately defend the revolt , free from the vicious anti-protester propaganda of the state-dominated media . Journalists from the state controlled-media themselves joined the revolt and started reporting the truth . For two weeks , Egypt 's state-dominated media had engaged in a campaign of lies and slander against the democracy protesters , accusing them of being funded by outside conspirators as diverse as the American CIA , Iranian spies , Israel 's Mossad , Qatar 's Al-Jazeera television station and Hamas . One television interview featured a fake `` protest organizer '' who claimed there were 23,000 guns inside the demonstrators ' camp on Tahrir Square , and that the protest had been taken over by bearded fundamentalists\\/Islamists . The tactics , crude as they were , made many ordinary Egyptians doubt the sincerity of the protest movement and helped unleash a wave of xenophobic violence that gripped Cairo on February 2 and 3 . And then there was Ghonim on TV on Tuesday , disheveled , unshaven and blinking into the camera after so many days of being blindfolded in incommunicado detention , suddenly facing a national audience on one of Egypt 's few semi-independent television channels . He had been the driving force behind the Facebook page `` We are all Khalid Said '' -- dedicated to the memory of the 28-year-old Egyptian man beaten to death in Alexandria last year by two undercover policemen -- which soon became a central organizing vehicle for the mass protest movement that has shaken Egypt 's ruling elite . On January 27 , the eve of the first of several massive Friday protests in which the police left the streets after daylong clashes , Ghonim literally disappeared into the dark hole of Egypt 's security services .

As fighting erupted across Egyptian society , Save the Children , an international aid group devoted to helping poor boys and girls , and other agencies watched their world and work start unraveling . The group said in a February 3 statement that eyewitnesses reported that many in the protests are children , and that the clashes in Egypt `` put thousands at risk of death , injury and psychological trauma . '' `` The combination of a highly charged atmosphere , rival political protesters , and weapons on the streets puts children in grave danger , '' said Jane Gibreel , Save the Children 's country director in Egypt . `` We want to send a clear message to all Egyptians that they have a responsibility to protect their children . '' Other international non-governmental organizations operating in Egypt share this concern and fear about the unrest . They realize that `` it 's no longer business as usual , '' said Kevin Fitzcharles , CARE director in Egypt . The heads of several missions are gathering on Monday , and plan to discuss preparing contingency plans to respond to emergencies and the implications of the changes rippling through society . Most international non-governmental organizations -- which forge partnerships with local NGOs to carry out projects -- had to suspend their work after the anti-government protests erupted . One is Plan Egypt , an organization that provides a range of programs for poor children and their families . `` All of this activity is on hold at the moment , '' said Edward Abbey , country director of Plan Egypt . There have been two main reasons for the delay , which affected 200 employees , Abbey said . It was too dangerous to go to work . And , the group works closely with the Ministry of Social Solidarity . So when the government shut down , Plan Egypt could n't coordinate with that ministry . Only a handful of employees are back to work for Plan Egypt and Abbey said they are replanning projects . The group hopes it can get back to normal soon . Ayman Ramsis is country director of Diakonia , which addresses human rights , gender equality , and other matters . He also heard unsettling reports and rumors that children were engulfed by the anarchy , with some moving to Tahrir Square for security and food and even some who were paid by police to attack demonstrators . While the country and the NGO operations are slowly getting back to normal , these problems show that Egypt ca n't return to the state it was in before the protests broke out in late January .

'' Ghonim , who was freed Monday after being held by Egyptian authorities for 10 days , said it is `` no longer the time to negotiate '' with the regime of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak . `` There 's a lot of blood now '' that has been spilled , he said . It 's time for people at the highest levels of the government `` to apologize to the families '' of those killed , he said . Human Rights Watch said Tuesday 302 people had been killed in the Egyptian protests -- 232 in Cairo , 52 in Alexandria and 18 in Suez . `` A lot of times , the policeman would stand on the bridge and shoot people down , '' Ghonim said . `` This is a crime . The president need to step down because this is a crime . '' Ghonim played a key role in organizing the protests that have convulsed Egypt for more than two weeks . He was the administrator of a Facebook page that is widely credited with calling the first protest January 25 . `` The plan was to get everyone onto the street , '' he said . `` Number one was that we are going to start from poor areas . '' Gallery : Protesters on streets in Egypt As the plan succeeded , the organizers ' tactics shifted , he said . `` We went on the street on the 25th and we wanted to negotiate , '' he said . `` They decided to negotiate with us at night with rubber bullets , with police sticks , with water hoses , with tear gas and with arresting about 500 people . We got the message . Now , when we escalated this and it became really big , they started listening to us . '' The 30-year-old was on leave from his job at Google in Dubai , where he lives with his wife and two children , when he went to Egypt to participate in the demonstrations . Ghonim , who refers to himself as an Egyptian activist , describes himself as `` Head of Marketing -- Middle East & North Africa at Google '' on his LinkedIn.com profile . His disappearance on January 28 captured international attention . `` I work for the best company to work for in the world , '' he said . `` I have the best wife and I love my kids , but I 'm willing to lose all of that for my dream to happen , and no one is going to go against our desire . Then , with a tear track running down his cheek , he challenged Vice President Omar Suleiman to try to undo his efforts and those of his supporters . `` Kidnap me , kidnap all my colleagues ! '' `` Put us in jail ! Do whatever you want to do . We are getting back our country . You guys have been ruining this country for 30 years . He showed CNN on Wednesday a notarized power of attorney granting control of all his assets to his wife . Holding it up , he said , `` I 'm ready to die '' to bring change to Egypt . Ghonim cited as his greatest heroes Mohandas K. Gandhi , the father of India 's independence movement , and Mark Zuckerberg , the 26-year-old founder of Facebook . A crowd of thousands cheered Ghonim on Tuesday when he spoke at Tahrir Square , where hundreds of thousands of protesters have demanded change for more than two weeks . As he walked through the streets of his upscale neighborhood Wednesday , unaccompanied by security and clutching a laptop , passersby recognized him and ran up to kiss him on the cheek and embrace him . A taxi driver stopped his car in traffic , got out and hugged the 30-year-old executive . Another driver handed a cell phone to Ghonim and asked him to say a few words to his daughter . Yet Ghonim said he is uncomfortable about being the face of the popular uprising in Egypt . `` This is not about me , '' he said several times during an hour-long interview in a relative 's Cairo apartment . Ghonim added that he is proud of the protests , which he described as a `` youth revolution '' and `` Revolution 2.0 . '' The Muslim Brotherhood , he said , played no role in organizing the initial protests , and in fact `` would not participate . '' Ghonim conceded that Mubarak has `` sacrificed a lot '' for Egypt but said the 82-year-old leader represents a system that needs to be replaced . He demanded that Mubarak 's ruling National Democratic Party be dissolved immediately . He also said , though , that Mubarak should be treated with dignity . He said the initial goal of the protests was to call for the resignation of Egypt 's unpopular interior minister and demand improved conditions for the poor . The calls for Mubarak 's resignation came after Egyptian security forces responded to peaceful protests with force , he said . Police clashed with protesters in the early days of the protests , before being replaced by the military , which created a generally more peaceful atmosphere . Ghonim , who comes from an affluent Egyptian family , said the activists who organized the protests intentionally designed their movement to be anonymous and faceless , without a clear leader . He cited the movie `` V for Vendetta '' as a source of inspiration . When asked whether he was referring to a famous scene of the film 's protagonist blowing up Parliament in London , Ghonim laughed . No , he said , he drew inspiration from a character who anonymously advocated for change .

Brewer and Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne , who is taking the lead on the countersuit , announced the state 's plans Thursday outside a federal court in Phoenix . Arizona 's move is an attempt to strike back at the Obama administration for a lawsuit blocking parts of a controversial law Brewer signed in April . It authorized police to identify and help deport those suspected of being in the country illegally . The measure sparked protests in Arizona and around the country . '' -LRB- Arizona -RRB- did not want this fight , '' Brewer said . `` But now that we are in it , Arizona will not rest until our border is secured . '' Department of Homeland Security spokesman Matt Chandler called Arizona 's court claim a `` meritless '' one that `` does nothing to secure the border . '' `` Smart strategies , dedicated law enforcement personnel and strategic partnerships with state , local and tribal governments and agencies do , '' Chandler said . `` Not only do actions like this ignore all of the statistical evidence , they also belittle the significant progress that our men and women in uniform have made to protect this border and the people who live alongside it . '' While vocal opponents of the immigration law continued to chant and wave banners , Horne detailed the five-count suit that included claims the federal government failed to protect Arizona 's borders from the `` invasion of illegal aliens '' and costs associated with `` jailing criminal immigrants .

Watch more about what this might mean and read an edited transcript from Zakaria : A Tobacco Road rumble ended in some very happy Cameron Crazies as the Duke Blue Devils beat the UNC Tar Heels , 79-73 . Down 14 points , the Blue Devils charged back in the second half , led by 34 points from senior Nolan Smith and a career-high 22 points courtesy of sophomore Seth Curry . As SI.com 's Stew Mandel writes , Duke completely transitioned their sloppy first half into proof of why they hold the top spot in the ACC . `` After a halftime speech in which coach Mike Krzyzewski urged them to `` settle down , '' Duke came out in the second half like an entirely different team , '' Mandel writes . `` Twice in the first 2:40 , Kyle Singler grabbed offensive rebounds off missed second free throws and kicked them out to the perimeter . Three-pointers by Smith and Curry made for a pair of four-point possessions . Duke just kept pounding the glass and grabbed nine offensive rebounds in the second half . The Blue Devils scored 10 points off turnovers after notching none in the first . '' That is not to say , of course , that the Tar Heels stood idly by as the Blue Devils made their move . UNC 's freshmen standouts Kendall Marshall and Harrison Barnes lit up the court with not only their defensive know-how and skillful offensive . Just one week after point guard Larry Drew abruptly left the team , the Heels held their own and forced their archrivals to step up their own game . Mandel explains : `` The Blue Devils did n't look so tough in the first half . With the help of North Carolina 's upstart freshman point guard , Kendall Marshall , putting the ball in all the right places , Tar Heel big men Tyler Zeller and John Henson made mincemeat of Duke defenders Mason and Miles Plumlee and Ryan Kelly . In building a 43-29 halftime lead , UNC outrebounded Duke 27-18 and outscored the Devils 28-12 in the paint . ` We had to really face the facts and get real and know that we had to turn it around in the second half or we were going to get embarrassed out there , ' said Curry .

CNN 's Fareed Zakaria says this move by Mubarak may be just trying to bait the protestors into more violence . Watch more about what this might mean and read an edited transcript from Zakaria : `` One hopes that history does not mark this as the moment that this revolution turned . For two weeks the demonstrators have been peaceful , they have been entirely democratic and incredibly honorable . But they 've been broken up , they have been beaten ; the regime has tried to divide the opposition , it has tried to make phony concessions . The one thing the regime did not do is concede to the principal demand . The danger here is that things will get radicalized . ... The opposition , the protesters , the crowds are going to get angrier and angrier . They 're going to draw perhaps more violent people . That is , in a sense , what the regime is hoping for . In a strange sense , I think the Mubarak regime is trying to bait the crowd in Tahrir Square and is hoping for violence and is hoping for some kind of march on the presidential palace that seems to get violent . Then they can step in and in the guise of restoring order , return to the military rule , return to the martial law that they want to consolidate . That 's the danger here . This might be a turn that history will record as the moment things went awry . '' After Vice President Omar Suleiman 's speech , Zakaria said the move discredited Suleiman as any kind of transitional figure : `` Egypt is a very nationalist country with a very proud people . It has a 7,000-year-old history , as President Mubarak pointed out -LRB- in his speech -RRB- . But I do n't think it 's going to work . What you just witnessed is Omar Suleiman discrediting himself as any kind of transitional figure . Omar Suleiman , the vice president , could have been the man who ushered in a new Egypt . He would n't have lasted but he would have been the man who brokered it all . But he has decided to stick with his boss . ... Suleiman is a former general , former head of military intelligence and President Mubarak 's consigliere . ... The regime is hoping that it can wait out these protestors . But I think the big mistake for the last two weeks that the regime has made is that it has kept assuming that these people are going to go home . And they do n't go home - the crowds just keep getting bigger and bigger and stronger and stronger . Friday will be a very crucial day because my guess is that you 'll see the largest protest you 've ever seen in Egypt . '' Have to agree with Zakaria . The minute Mubarek came out with `` as a father to his children '' I cringed and knew he had no intention whatsover of stepping down . Did n't even have to listen to the rest of the speech . Highly inflammatory at the least if not outright insulting to the protesters , imo . I 'd like to see any US President address fellow citizens as `` children . '' President Obama , CNN , and Anderson Cooper have this Egypt uprising dead wrong - 100 % wrong . Obama and CNN would have you believe that a President should just step down when 100,000 or even 1 milllion protestors take to the streets and demand he resign . That is not Democracy -- that is Anarchy and Obama and CNN are fueling the flames by going public and telling folks that Mubarack must begin to `` transition '' out now . DUMB Try this on for size Mr President - will you step down and begin to `` transition '' out if 1 million angry protestors stand outside the White House and demand you resign ? I mean 80 % of the Americans living here did not vote for you sir . More than half of the voters do not support you and think this country -- the good ole USA -- is heading in the wrong direction under your stewarship . Wky not Go Away - Game Over - I mean , what is good for Egypt must be good for the US - when the people revolt and protest outside the White House -- you should resign Mr Obama . Such is the absurdity of thei White House and CNN -- both get caught up in the frenzy and can not see the forest from the trees . If Obama wishes to support what is happening in Egypt , he needs to prepare for anarchy in the streets of every Mid East nation - and to expect nothing more here at home . Give it a rest CNN . Stop talking about it Mr President . it is not our place to dictate how other countries conduct their affairs -- and it is inflamatory and dangerous for US Presidents to be giving unwanted advice to foreign leaders , As for CNN , take Anderson Cooper off the story and give him a 2 month vacation with pay . He has lost all sense of objectivity and is just personally hurt he got beat up - something he and others deserved for going over their to falem the emotions of protestors . We have enough trouble at home Anderson - if you want to attack something big and ugly and out of control and hurting millions - report on the US economy , the deficit , the foreclosures , and the unemployed , and turn your anger and your cameras to Washington and the reaon source of the problems we face . Where are you people when the repugs are destroying , not figuratively , literally destroying the country ? Oh that 's right , the right can never take responsibility for their actions . That 's the hallmark of the whole childish , undereducated bunch . I doubt it , but have you read enough to know that this is a dictator who has held sham elections for decades ? February 11 , 2011 at 9:30 am | Report abuse | It 's not like I 'm loyal to Obama . I leave the personal stuff to the drama queens on the right . It 's just that you watch the country being destroyed and then complain about the recovery not happening fast enough . The slow upswing is bad enough . I 'm literally worried the rabble on the right are going to put the country back on the same downswing they did before they were booted out . February 11 , 2011 at 9:34 am | Report abuse | 80 % of Americans in US did n't vote for Obama ? Mubarak has been a dictator for 40 years and become the richest man in the world while his country stumbles through abject poverty . . Obama an elected official for 2 years in a democratic country of 400 million , as opposed to 75 million in Egypt . Every President of the US pushes for democracy in dictatorships -LRB- partially because we generally put the dictatorship in power and hold some responsibility and it 's decades later and embarrassing . -RRB- You should try reading and thinking and not let radical media hand you your opinions . February 11 , 2011 at 10:33 am | Report abuse | this is where the cia needs to step up and field work the area and sift for Al Queida . . im sure Al Queida is heading there right now . to try and seed the population . In a democratic system people cast their vote at the poles . In a corrupted system people cast their votes in a huge protest . Power to the Egyptian people ! With over $ 70 Billion in Swiss Banks , Mubarak will soon leave Egypt . Currently , he is having trouble landing in another country . So far , his only hope is Iran or North Korea , both too cold in winter months . His second problem , keeping the courts from freezing his money . He would have left last night , however he needs a place to land . I just pray this does n't turn out to be another Tienmen Suare . Anyone see how closely this resembles the Romanian revolution of 1989 ? Mubarak might want to consider how that turned out for Ceaucescu ... With no Leader of the revolt , no plan , it will be tough to replace America 's Man . The govt is rich , hotels , banks , airline . Best option for the crowd -- stay on strike , bleed out the rich , day by day . The mob have nothing , but they also nothing to loose . Nothing makes rich people more unhappy , than becoming poor people . Foreign pressure is also easy . Pull the workers from the Suez Canal locks . The Army will take weeks to get it working again . 10 % of world trade slowed down . That will get the rich countries attention . Going to stand outside the Palace in Heliopolis if fine . Better , just walk up and down the streets of Heliopolis past the luxury mansions and condos of the General 's families . Nothing violent , just a little reminder that while the palace is defendable , Heliopolis is ` nt . Like they say , the Government had it coming ... After decades of robbing his own country out of billions of dollars , I think the day he does leave Egypt should demand all that money back god knows thats the least Mubarak should do if he really wants to leave power as he said with some dignity ! Mubarak is considered one of the wealthiest man in the world that should tell you something . Obama is the president of the United States he does not have the power to tell another country 's President to step down idiot Egypt is not an accident , it is a nation that has gone through changes from prehistoric to today . What needs to be remembered is that , as much as we enjoy reading history about Egypt in religious or secular materials , we need to understand that the people of Egypt of today are as intelligent as any people in any part of the World today , if not more . The only difference is that there has never been political and economic climate that gave them a chance to be what they could be . Now , the Egyptians have emerged from behind the heavy curtains of history , to the modern times . As standard - bearer for both the Arab World and Black Africa , they have responsibility to establish transparent and democratic society where the law of the land is supreme above any leader . If they achieve that and practice it , they could make their future even more brighter and enviable than their past . I am certain they are well aware of the fact that the two wings that can make Democracy fly high are , rule of law and entrepreneurship . I am willing to give the benefit of the doubt to Egyptian army to put Egypt first by suppressing the lust for power at the barrel of a gun . Good Job and Good Luck . Moni , try to call the president of your country `` idiot '' and please tell us his reaction , if can . But , if Obama is your president or you live in democratic society , you sure lucked out . -LRB- required , but will not be displayed -RRB- CNN welcomes a lively and courteous discussion as long as you follow the Rules of Conduct set forth in our Terms of Service .

The recent trends of labor unions and professionals such as doctors joining the mass street protests signaled to the Egyptian military that Mubarak 's hold on power seemed untenable and endangered the good standing of the armed forces itself in Egyptian society , analysts said . `` The military had to ask itself , ` Are we going to go down with Mubarak ? ' '' said William Quandt , a professor of politics at the University of Virginia and a National Security Council staff member in the 1970s who was involved in the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty . `` The military said we are the backbone of the regimes , and we are pretty popular with the people . '' The army also saw how demonstrators became re-energized after Wael Ghonim , a cyberactivist who is a Google executive on leave , was freed from official Egyptian captivity and gave an impassioned speech to protesters in Tahrir -LRB- Liberation -RRB- Square , Quandt said . With yet another massive street protest predicted again Friday in Egypt after weekly worship services , the military that 's been the backbone to Egypt 's secular strongmen since 1952 seemed to have had enough , Quandt and other analysts said . In its strongest maneuver yet , the military 's senior officers Thursday issued `` Communiqu No. 1 , '' as if more were forthcoming , stating that their discussions were ongoing on `` what can be achieved to preserve the homeland and the gains of the Egyptian people . '' That communiqu set up an expectation among street protesters in Cairo that Mubarak would resign . Instead , Mubarak announced that he would be turning over his day-to-day powers to his hand-picked vice president , Omar Suleiman , an action that makes Suleiman the de facto president of Egypt and head of the military , said Egyptian ambassador Sameh Shoukry to the United States . Mubarak remains the de jure , or matter of law , president , Shoukry said , attributing the information to the Egyptian government . `` The hardliners in the regime were hoping that an attrition strategy would work , and people would leave the square , and in fact , yesterday was one of the biggest turnouts ever because of the release of this Google guy and the unions declared their solidarity and so did the doctors , '' Quandt said . Then the state-run newspaper Al-Ahram broached the subject of the `` revolution '' and said the people 's demands were legitimate , Quandt said Thursday .

If America is truly interested in the spread of democracy , they will allow the Egyptian people to choose who to govern their country . . unless the US wants Egypt choosing Palin 2012 ? For CNN , i was whatching aljazeeras less than an hour ago for a good while and they talked to a white house advisor , who seemed to have just come out of the white house , who said among a lot of other interesting things that the Obama administration are now nearly decided that the change cant take place with Sullieman and Mubarak in power . It has seemed to me that the white house thought the change could go on with mubarak keeping things calm while they sorted out something new , mind you i have not been following the news in th elast twenty four hours much , it is a big change if the White House think the effort to move on to a democratic government can not happen with Mubarak in power . THey also were saying that america does nt have much influence but i never know how seriously to take claims that they dont have much influence . rose macaskie Yes both Thugs Mubarak and Suleiman must be arrested and put on trial for murder and massacre , as well as the whole dectatorship regime of Mubarak . Watching this unfold in Egypt is both inspirational and reminiscent of the `` change '' young Americans came together for in our last election . I hope Mubarak funds the decency and backbone to accept his defeat and steps down peacefully . I am so happy with the change we 've had so far -- more of my family and friends have left -LRB- lost -RRB- their jobs , and owe more to the banks than ever . Meanwhile , the same staff have the same positions as before we had our ` change ' . Sooooooo happy for the Change ! I am concerned that Mubarak has not taken a firm stance with his countrymen that `` Time is needed to form firm candidates for an election '' with the possibility of an election come June or July '' . I , personally have no evidence of any real candidates on any of the new programs . The Egyptians have a real grievance but due process must take place for change . The White House is taking a neutral approach as always to play the winning card . Unfortunately , the U.S government stands for liberty and democracy when it suits them ????? Toooo bad . Great to see Wolfowitz , my hero on Piers tonight . The architect of the Gulf War is exactly what we need to figure out how to make this situation into America 's . Is there Oil in Egypt ? What can we get if we take over Egypt ? We are much more mature to run other countries , I wish the World would all go American and I could use my money anywhere instead of changing my greenbacks for funny money if I travel -- still have to get a passport though . . My hat is off to Mr. Piers Morgan for being able to take on the change in his shows ' formate to cover the Egypt situation . Mr Morgan is articulate , caring -- poised under pressure while displaying conversational elegance and keen insight . How refreshing and how important the information he hand caries into the wasteland of network `` reporting '' . Mr Morgan delivers over and over again . Thank you for your professionalism and your skill . Keep up your seemingly prescient reporting . Thanks CNN for Mr. Morgan Why are we having this discussion with the neocon war criminal Wolfowitz ? In my opinion , he is on the same low moral plane as Mubarak and his torturer ilk ! Wolfowitz is not a credible commentator . Please do not include him in the future . you 're not funny nor amusing , you just do n't appreciaate a good reporting . . Even if u try alll your life , you will not reach the intelligence or the knowledge of Anderson Cooper . As an average citizen , I am distressed that you have given Paul Wolfowitz a forum this evening . He has been totally discredited several years ago and should not be commenting on Egypt . We also need to be more careful as a people about pontificating on events in Egypt , that frankly , most Americans can not understand . Mubarak is no saint . I just spent two weeks in Egypt . The government does not provide basic services that we all take for granted . Please , CNN , be more careful with your choice of so-called `` expert '' commentary . Guess you know nothing of Anderson Cooper . He 's quite familiar with the Middle East , try reading his book . And he sure as heck has more courage than you do . not only reading his books , Cooper is well educated and traveled the world . He has more knowledge than all of us here , , , , surprisingly non of you guys take the effort bing and search before making any oppinion ????? Poorly run program with even poorer testimonies from burned and unreliable invitees . you guys focus on how poorly run the program and forget the essence and main topic that people getting killed for raising their voices and demanding freedom and democracy ... Was unsure of Piers Morgan at first , but find that I enjoy his interviews very much , indeed Yes , he interrupts at times -- but he 's sure to get feedback on that and address it . I 'm impressed by his coverage of the situation in Egypt ; he 's certainly holding his own . Let us all listen and concentrate on the pain topic , , which is Egypt and how the current regime have been committing crimes against humanity ... ?? We are all concerned about people getting killed for raising their voices , not only in Egipt , but in other countries as well . All tiranies have to step down , but that does n't justify a poorly run program , and even less the unreliable invitees that have been responsible of some of oiur dark history why do n't you at least spell Egypt correctly first , and stick with essence ... and pay attention , , , today the topic is Egypt , so when the topic is Armenia , we will discuss it then ???? What I can `` t understand is why the knee jerk reaction everytime something is `` supposed '' to happen !! You cancel advertised programs and run to Egypt to get what ? none news !!! You get these experts on to tell us what they think will happen when they don `` t have a clue either . To me they just make themselves look stupid . You have Blitzer and Spitzer on for two hours before your shoe giving us `` news '' which is obviously incorrect and then you change your schedule to give us more of the same !! If you want to cover Egypt . Why not take a few days to get some facts together and then give us a show with some genuine information instead of making space for a bunch of so called experts to fall over themselves with obvious missinformation and conjecture !! Good lord most of our opinions are probably just as accurate as the specialists you have on . Cuz the evens in Egypt changing constantly , so here you have it ... CNN have stationed reporters for many years in Egypt and they live the truth ??? Agree . While the happenings in Egypt are newsworthy they 1 -RRB- forget there is other news happening in the world and 2 -RRB- nobody cares about what is going on at 4AM over there , which is nothing . They have pre-empted the Firth interview 3 times to have us listen to a bunch of blowhards have a Q&A with Piers that amount to nothing but drivel . iers has driven me from CNN . He replaced L. King ok , lets give change a chance , he 's awful . I 've been with CNN for a long time , I resonate with AC 360 , and his panel of analysts ; however , Piers always interrupts , ALWAYS , his questions are delivered with arrogance , not engaging the viewer or the person he interviews . Howard Stern , the Hollywood scene , return AC 360 . I 'm switching to another station during Piers ' time slot . Amanpour is one of many who are salient , Piers does not fit this learned group . The Egyptian consituiton has a line of succession ! When Nixon resigned he was not forced to leave the country so why is Murbarak required to leave Egypt ? Nixon flew home to California . Let Mubarak go back to his home and become just another Egyptian citizen . You are right , it is Egypt , and it was a typo error , but in all honesty , spelling does n't have anything to do with essence . At least you know my last name , beause I do n't hide like others do . Today it is about Egypt . When it comes to Armenia or any other country , we can further discuss , but being unpolite will not help you support your position I do n't mind the error , but i was making a point for you and everyone in here to stick with topic and to stop talking about cosmatic things regarding the show and programming . We should all to help anyone in need of freedom and democracy ... Avedik ... Could n't agree with you more ... as for Marc `` s comment ... he can `` t seem to help it !!! just read his previous statements on this page and notice his wonderful way with words !!! I refrain from pointing out his spelling in every blog !! I am too polite for that !!! As for you Marc ... making insulting remarks certainly doesn `` t help you cause . . making a small spelling eror is only a cosmetic fault no ? Along with a constant call for violence as a result of protester 's anger , exacerbated by a firebrand Republican and , of all people , a prime reason for the Iraqi invasion Paul Wolfowitz , Morgan ca n't get beyond his opinion . Piers Morgan and Glenn Beck ! Sorry Piers , but I still have n't gotten over your bestowal of respectability upon the uber-imperialist Wolfowitz . What other conquistadors can we expect as guest commentators ? Will we get to hear Henry Kissinger pontificate on peace and freedom ? It 's a shame Dr. Strangelove is a fictional character -- he would be perfect for your show ! I apologize for the delayed reaction . I 've been glued to the set for the last hour watching the talking heads commenting as they watch nothing happening in Tahir Square . February 10 , 2011 at 11:31 pm | Report abuse | Gonernments are the same all over the world-they all lie manipulate their own people-they all should step down I wonder-how many billions the Wall st. is going to make , thanks to this crisis in Egypt ? watching crissis in egypt it seems to me that some cnn reporters does ' t understand what happen and theirs comment are not objective expecialy mr. anderson cooper \\ s , his comments are onesided in supporting protestors . But it is complicated problem , which is simmilar which was 30 years ego in poland , and still polish people learn how is democracy . Democracy and transition is not going happen day by day , it needs time and preparation . In poland there was protestors and frustration , on the end governent make state of emergency , today over 50 % polish people are saying it was right , and prevent national disaster , which happen in hungary in 56 and czekoslovakia 68 . , Today in egypt situation is complicated and kind of simmilar but mentality of arabs world is different , who is going to take control over egypt , crowd from the squere , army , which can rule egypt for next 20 or 30 years or egypt may be religion state like in iran . It is nessesary to understand that all governent agenda including army right now is mubarak 's , i do n't think that opposition is prepare to take over , right away , it is for sure , people of egypt want changes and they have right for it , but step down of mubarak nothing change now in rules of egyptian governent it may just calm down demonstrators , they probably accept army rules and others but they want to step down mubarak right away , what happen next nobody know . Peace and stabilization in the middle east is very important for rest of us . Today reporters and media have huge impact on opinion of the world and they can pervent increasing conflict if they understand many situations and sides in conflict , they are obective and they have imagination what could happen in many situations which could happen , i understand that they have their own opinions but reporters should be objective I have been so looking forward to the Colin Firth interview -- I can watch the Egyptian issue on the news all day long , I thought Piers Morgan was hosting an interview program ! I am deeply disappointed ! Hey Piers Morgan , who gave you in charge the war criminals menagerie ? Please do not bring them next time . Yeah Piers you 're doing fine . Did I miss some coverage of Egypt though ... Is there no leader emerging from or leading this dusty democratic uprising ? I have n't heard him or her speak ... otherwise are n't they just a mob that should be dispersed with tear gas , rubber bullets or water canons ? Mubarak said he would step down later this year after passing the reigns onto another government , what 's six more months for a peacful transition when it 's taken you this long to protest his rule . If this uprising could produce a suitable person maybe it would be sooner . Step up to the plate . Had to laugh at AC crying about getting harrassed ... it 's not your country little man and no they do n't have to let you report . i find it amazing that the media prima donnas , like Christiana Amanpour , who attacked the Bush administration for not finding `` weapons of mass destruction '' in Iraq , because the intelligence was incorrect all over the world ... stand before us and blame the bad intelligence they received for them getting the EGYPT scenaria wrong night after night after night ! If you think politicians wo n't admit when they are wrong -- just watch the media `` darlings . '' They put politicians to shame . I LIKE THE SHOW , PIERS ! Relief !! Someone must have talked to Piers about his annoying and rude interruptions . I watched the entire show tonight for the first time without the urge to switch him off ... and without the urge to murmur `` boor ! '' under my breath ... specifically because he refrained from constantly interrupting his guests . I 've been looking forward to the Firth interview as well , but since it was pre-recorded I hope it 's not another episode of `` Piers Morgan Interrupts ... '' Have you totally taken leave of your senses ? How could you possibly have invited Paul Wolfowitz onto your show . He was one of the ones who talked Bush into invading Iraq . He 's a war criminal and should be in jail or at least be put on trail at the Hague . Pay attention to whom you invite ... I 'm tired of hearing the same old BS again and again . I loved watching Mr Arslan on your show . He knows what he is talking about . His views represent the views of most muslims worldwide , who believe that we can have pluralism and democracy in the muslim coulntries with religion playing a role in these societies . . At first , I was excited to see the interviews that Piers Morgan would bring to CNN after being a long time Larry King fan . But I am very disappointed in his rude style AND because you can never tell when an interview will be shown . I have waited to see Colin Firth four times , only to see him bumped so they can show you another hour of the stuff from Egypt . CNN shows Egypt ALL DAY ... people need a break ! I was very happy to see Colin Firth on the Bravo channel on `` Inside The Actor 's Studio '' a couple of days ago and I am sure that interview is much better than Piers Morgan can do . I am finished with him ! The only the that will get me to watch this show is when they finally do show the Colin Firth interview . As you have pointed out , nothing is going on in Egypt at 4 a.m. , and anything that has happened has been rehashed ad infinitum by so-called experts who like to hear themselves talk . Watching the various journalists actually in Egypt , you can actually be amazed at how many different ways they can say the same thing which is essentially that they do n't know anything . I think it is insulting to Colin Firth -LRB- and Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter -RRB- to keep pre-empting them and then to see what interviews do get through . Gracious as they are , they will be understanding , but COME ON , FOLKS ! Piers is only marginally less annoying than Wolf or John King . Talking about the Middle East ? You 've got to be kidding . You 're either nuts , cynical or clueless . I think most people on her do n't have a clue . Rember politicians do n't tell you everything and the press does not ether . We need to stop believing everything we here on the news . Thank God Mubarak stepped down . I am so happy for the Egyptian people and their freedom ! Just saw the Paul Wolfowitz interview . How can you leave that sort of interview with Wolfowitz having the final word . I can tell that you have so much more to say . Take the risk and people will follow . Just take the risk . It will pay off . Paul Wolfowitz is a war criminal who should be on trial right now , not allowed to be giving `` expert '' opinion . -LRB- Right now he 's on Fareed Zakaria 's show , sharing his Middle East wisdom with us yet again . -RRB- Remember , this is the man who claimed that the war in Iraq would cost us essentially nothing , being paid for by oil revenues . The world has already suffered incalculably because this man 's advice was listened to . We all should consider boycotting all CNN shows that feature him as an expert witness . -LRB- required , but will not be displayed -RRB- CNN welcomes a lively and courteous discussion as long as you follow the Rules of Conduct set forth in our Terms of Service .

Ed Husain : Egyptian , young , passionate , educated : Wael Ghonim a symbol of revolution Morale among activists was declining under accusations of betraying Egypt , Husain says Husain : Ghonim came out of jail to give interview that reignited passion of protesters Husain : His Facebook page for Khalid Said , killed by police , inspired the young Editor 's note : Ed Husain is a senior fellow at The Council on Foreign Relations and author of `` The Islamist . '' -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Wael Ghonim is a symbol of the revolution in Egypt . During his highly emotive interview on a popular Egyptian show Monday night , he went out of his way to rebut the accusations made by the older generation of Mubarak 's supporters that the protesters were `` traitors to Egypt '' and `` foreign agents . '' These accusations were not only repeated on state media , but when Ghonim was arrested on January 28 and spent 12 nights in a Cairo prison , his fellow inmates accused him of the worst possible cultural and political trait for an Arab : khiyanah , or betrayal . With foreign media presence and international support for the protesters , that accusation of treachery to Egypt and foreign involvement was gaining credence in many quarters in Egypt last week . Morale was slowly dropping . Then came Ghonim 's explosive interview Monday night . With one stroke , he galvanized an entire generation of Egyptians . His story is sincere and selfless : The regime 's treatment of him was why millions opposed the Mubarak government . If Egyptians had forgotten , Ghonim 's plight reminded them . With passion and intellectual clarity , he asked why he was arrested . Why were his frail parents not informed ? His parents had wandered from hospital to hospital crying -- why had n't police simply told them that he was in prison , and not dead ? The face of Egypt 's revolution Ghonim : ` I 'm ready to die ' Ghonim : Welcome to Egypt revolution 2.0 Ghonim : ` No longer ' time to negotiate The widespread culture of democracy activists disappearing -- or worse , being tortured and killed -- had inspired Ghonim to create a Facebook page in memory of Khalid Said , who was beaten to death by police . That page was instrumental in mobilizing a younger generation of Arabs to the January 25 protest meetings . Ghonim 's interview was cataclysmic because he was candid : He has a job abroad in the Emirates , he lives comfortably in a villa , and he has nothing personal to gain from the dangers he and his wealthy friends put themselves in . Their sacrifice was for the country and people they loved : Egypt and Egyptians . This was not treachery , but sacrifice . Ghonim 's clarity provided an emotional uplift to the protesters and their supporters . He spoke about the dreams of ordinary Egyptians to live in freedom , and he struck a popular chord when he divulged that for 12 nights in prison , he sang '' Dream with Me , '' a popular Egyptian song by Hamza Namireh , another young Arab of the revolution who , eyewitnesses tell me , has been singing in Tahrir Square this week . Where others would have relished the media attention , Ghonim 's piety and modesty shone as he paid tribute to the martyrs and heroes who were on the cold streets night after night . He had slept in prison , he said , and so he was not a hero . It is these sentiments and experiences -- the ability to dream and sing in adversity -- that resonate today in Egypt . Ghonim exemplifies an entire generation of patriotic , educated young Egyptians . But for all his strengths , he is not likely to become Egypt 's next president , a demand made by his many followers on a 200,000-strong Facebook page . Revolutions do not produce certainty . The short term in Egypt will be unpredictable , and the successor to Mubarak is unknown . It would be wrong for us in the West to express preferences , or groom leaders . The last two weeks of protests in Egypt have been organic , and led by a coalition of people from tattooed freedom lovers to government-trained clerics . This broad alliance will produce its own leaders when the country goes to the polls in September . In a true democracy , the result of the ballot is unknown until the papers are counted . Ghonim and his supporters want that free and democratic Egypt . Ghonim may wish to be a candidate , or he may not . But it is too soon to want to centralize a mass movement by imposing a figurehead on what is a broad coalition . This is an Egyptian uprising , so let Egypt decide its fate through free and fair elections . The opinions expressed in the commentary are solely those of Ed Husain .

Sitting in a Lebanese restaurant in the heart of the Arab community on London 's Edgware Road , all eyes were fixed on a television screen in the corner of the room ; the change in mood palpable with groans and shouts as President Hosni Mubarak made his intentions clear . After the speech , 22-year-old student Mohamed Ezeldin Ahmed told CNN he was bitterly disappointed by the news . `` I am angry and frustrated : we thought he was going but Mubarak just does n't get the message . `` He 's playing a game with the Egyptian people who are kind and forgiving . Mubarak is trying to create conflict between the people so they fight within themselves : he wants civil war . '' London-based make-up artist Sally Ibrahim , 23 , has been protesting outside the Egyptian Embassy every day . She thought Friday would be her last day on the streets ; not protesting but celebrating . `` We 're really disappointed , '' she said . `` But we 're not going to stop . We 're now going to go back to the embassy every day and carry on fighting until he leaves . '' It was a day of mixed emotions for the group , who left jubilant scenes of dancing and singing outside London 's Egyptian Embassy , only to have their hopes crushed while watching the much-anticipated speech . Businesswoman Azza Zaki , 45 , left Egypt two years ago and has been protesting outside the embassy ever since protesters flocked to Cairo 's Tahrir Square 17 days ago . She told CNN she felt it was her moral obligation to protest : `` I 've been living all these years rejecting what 's been going on and what 's happening to my people . Although I was n't affected , what I saw back home was very inhuman , yet I was a coward and did n't speak out . '' She continued : `` These heroes in Tahrir Square , they gave us back our humanity and gave us back our pride to go out and say no more . '' Sara Ibrahim , a 28-year-old mother of two , took her three-year-old and one-month old sons to Thursday 's protests in London , hoping they would witness history . `` It means a lot to us , '' Ibrahim said . `` Even if I take a picture -LRB- of my son -RRB- and show him when he 's older , he can see he was part of history , creating history . He will probably be taught about the Egyptian revolution , like people talk about the French Revolution , at school or college . '' Although these ex-patriot Egyptians are adamant Mubarak must go , most admit this is just the beginning of a difficult transition period for their country . `` It 's time for the young , the educated people to step up , '' said 34-year-old college lecturer Khairy Eteiwy . `` The west should not worry about Egypt or about the Muslim Brotherhood . They have a place there , but they are not the majority by any means . The majority of the protesters and the Egyptian people ... they like a moderate kind of life and they like to follow democracy . '' But as these Egyptians sipped their mint teas and began to digest the news that the protests back home had failed to dislodge their president , talk turned to Friday 's gathering that many of them had hoped just minutes earlier would be a celebration .

The vice president is former intelligence head Omar Suleiman , tapped for the spot early in Mubarak 's response to the protests . The Egyptian constitution allows the president to delegate powers to the vice president , a provision originally put into the document in case the president is temporarily incapacitated . The constitution reserves three particular powers for the president alone -- they can not be delegated to the vice president . Those are the right to dismiss parliament , to request constitutional amendments and to alter the structure of the government . Egypt 's ambassador to the United States , Sameh Shoukry , said that while Mubarak was by law still the president , Suleiman was now `` the de facto president . '' Suleiman has already begun negotiations with some of Egypt 's opposition , and Mubarak said he 's already asked for the modification of five constitutional articles -- 76 , 77 , 88 , 93 and 198 -- and the repeal of a sixth -- 179 . Articles 76 and 77 deal with how presidential elections are conducted . Article 76 sets standards for qualifying parties , which currently all but guarantee the ruling NDP a spot on the ballot , while 77 sets presidential terms at 6 years with no limits on re-election . Articles 88 and 93 deal with how members of parliament will be elected . Article 88 in particular requires judges to oversee the elections . Those changes , if implemented , would answer demands to open Egyptian elections to more opposition candidates and loosen the grip of Mubarak 's party on power . Article 198 allows the president to issue decrees with the force of law `` in exceptional cases '' as OK 'd by two-thirds of parliament -- essentially a codification of emergency power , but it sets a limited period of time for that power . And article 179 , which Mubarak proposed repealing altogether , allows the president to send anyone suspected of involvement in terrorism to a military court . Mubarak and Suleiman both pledged to continue this work -- but perhaps the real question about what comes next in Egypt can only be answered by the `` youth movement '' that launched the protests more than two weeks ago -- and the military 's response .

Watching Mubarak 's address on what appeared to be a sheet hoisted over the square , the crowd became angry as they heard Mubarak say he would `` delegate powers '' to Vice President Omar Suleiman but did not mention leaving office . They broke into cries of , `` Illegitimate ! '' and `` Mubarak the coward must stand down . '' After the statement , parliamentary speaker Ahmed Fathi Srour told Nile TV that Mubarak 's move had put the authority for the day-to-day running of the government in Suleiman 's hands . That would include oversight of the police , the interior ministry and other key agencies , as well as control of economic policy and running any negotiations with opposition figures . Srour added that the constitution specifically prohibits the president from delegating certain key powers to the vice president , including the power to dismiss parliament or dismiss the government and the power to ask for amendments to the constitution .

Emboldened by an uprising in Tunisia , which saw the nation 's president of almost a quarter century flee to Saudi Arabia , protesters have staged similar demonstrations from Lebanon to Yemen to Algeria . Here are the latest developments across the region : Protesting lawyers toppled barricades at Cairo 's Abdeen Palace , and petroleum , railway and telecommunications employees called strikes to stand in solidarity with the protesters . Thursday marked Day 17 of the protests . Despite promises of reforms and constitutional amendments to allow for free elections , demonstrators were angered by President Hosni Mubarak 's refusal to immediately step down . Protests were further fanned when Egypt 's Vice President Omar Suleiman said Egypt is not ready for democracy . Last week : Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq apologized for the violent attacks on protesters as the military took position between pro- and anti-President Hosni Mubarak supporters . It did not stop the two sides from clashing . Shafiq and Vice President Omar Suleiman were meeting with opposition groups , including protesters in Cairo 's Tahrir Square , state media reported , but some administration opponents have rejected the invitation . King Abdullah II swore in a new government Wednesday , which included several opposition figures , members of several political parties , an independent Islamist and the editor of a newspaper that is sometimes critical of the government . Officials close to Abdullah say the king is hoping to turn the regional upheaval into a genuine opportunity for reform , but the nation 's Muslim Brotherhood has refused to join the government , saying the prime minister should be chosen by parliament , not the king . On Wednesday , Jordanians gathered in front of of the Egyptian Embassy to demand that their loved ones jailed abroad be returned home . An iReporter captured some of the protesters on camera as they accused countries such as Saudi Arabia , Iraq , Syria and the United States of holding their loved ones without due process . Last week : Abdullah responded to protests by dismissing his entire government . The face of Egypt 's revolution Democratic change in the Muslim world ? Yemen residents on possible uprising The government recently restored subsidies and improved pay for civil servants , and the king directed new Prime Minister Marouf al-Bakhit , an ex-intelligence chief , to tackle corruption , enact political reform , spur development and strengthen democracy . Though some groups have backed out of planned protests , the Islamic Action Front said it plans to continue street demonstrations Friday in protest of al-Bakhit 's appointment . Many Yemenis say they do not believe the situation there will get to the point it has reached in Egypt or Tunisia , but they also expressed concerns about unemployment and their future . On Monday , Prime Minister Ali Mujawar said his country is democratic and accused opposition parties of `` trying to duplicate what happened in Tunisia and Egypt , and act as if it should be imposed on the people here in Yemen . '' Last week : President Ali Abdullah Saleh had said he would not seek re-election and would not pass power to his son , but it was n't enough for thousands of anti-government protesters who gathered near Sanaa University in the nation 's capital . They spoke out against poverty and demanded that Saleh , whose term ends in 2013 , step down . Saleh said he has requested his party to freeze debate on a constitutional amendment to end term limits until a consensus is reached . A Facebook page dubbed `` Syrian Revolution 2011 '' attracted 15,000 friends in a week , Time magazine reported . Like other regimes in the region , Syria faces political alienation , economic dislocation and corruption , but because it has been the subject of international sanctions , it is beholden to no Western powers . This separates Syria from places such as Egypt and Tunisia , analysts told the magazine . According to Human Rights Watch , security services have beaten and detained protesters . A candlelight vigil in old Damascus for the Egyptian protesters was broken up by people in civilian clothing , and police nearby failed to intervene . When one of the vigil 's organizers went to police , she was slapped and called a `` germ , '' the watchdog group said . Last week : After seeing unrest in the region , President Bashar al-Assad said he would push for political reforms in his own country because waiting for protests like those in Egypt and Tunisia might make it `` too late to do any reform . '' Reform activists used Facebook to call for demonstrations in Damascus , Aleppo and other cities , but it was unclear how many people would turn out . By all accounts a police state , Syria has been ruled by President Bashar al-Assad for more than 10 years . Before him , his father , Hafez al-Assad ruled the country for almost three decades . A transitional government is overseeing sweeping changes after massive demonstrations forced out the country 's longtime president . Internet filters have disappeared and there is unfettered access to websites . Journalists are learning how to create a free press and are transforming their newspapers , radio broadcasts and television stations . Reforms are taking place in every region of the country , and people are expressing their opinions openly in the streets , something that did n't happen under President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali . Still , small incidents disrupt daily activity . The incidents are widely believed to be perpetrated by people who once worked for Ben Ali 's secret police and are aiming to destabilize the transitional government . Last week : The north African nation charged Ben Ali , as well as his wife and several relatives , with maintaining and exporting foreign currency illegally , carrying weapons and ammunition without licenses and inciting armed violence among Tunisians . When will the violence end ? Exclusive with Yemeni Prime Minister Children of the Egyptian revolution Self-made billionaire as new Lebanese PM The ex-leader fled to Saudi Arabia last month after mass protests that left more than 100 people dead . Protests there began when demonstrators -- credited with starting the ripple effect of protests across North Africa and the Middle East -- lashed out at poor living conditions , high unemployment , government corruption and repression . Final results of last month 's referendum show that the southern Sudanese voted almost 99 to 1 to split from the north , leading to what will be the world 's newest nation in July . An election official said the vote was peaceful and transparent and `` not a single person showed up to appeal the results . '' Despite the vote 's smoothness , violence erupted on the north-south border when Sudanese soldiers loyal to Gabriel Tang , a southern Sudanese militia leader who fought in a 22-year-old civil war alongside the Khartoum government , refused to turn in their weapons . Fifty people were killed in fighting . Last week : Already faced with the expected secession of its oil-rich south and charges of genocide against President Omar al-Bashir , Sudan 's government began seeing signs of unrest . Police clashed with students in the capital Khartoum on Sunday as the protesters chanted , `` Tunisia , Egypt , Sudan together as one . '' About 100 students hurled rocks at police officers , who pushed them back . The human rights group Amnesty International said more than 20 people still being held by police `` are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment . '' Observers say that if the country does n't find a suitable end to its political turmoil , it could become a battleground between Iran and Syria on one side and pro-Western forces on the other . Attempts to form a new government have been complicated by a U.N. tribunal probing the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri . The tribunal is expected to implicate members of Hezbollah in the killing , which led the group to drop out of the government last month . Last week : Protests erupted in January as President Michel Suleiman appointed Najib Mikati , a Hezbollah-backed politician , as prime minister . Hariri initially urged supporters to stage a `` day of rage '' and show restraint in protesting the appointment , but the demonstrations quickly grew ugly as gunshots were fired and his supporters burned tires and garbage containers in various cities . In addition to a promise to lift a state of emergency , the government also cut taxes on sugar and cooking oil and increased the supply of wheat , Time magazine reports . The moves come after weeks of protests . The Algerian Press Service has reported that the government is also taking measures to bolster youth employment . Saad Djebbar , a London-based Algerian lawyer and political analyst , said he is skeptical . `` They want to produce some sort of trick that would show that reform is under way , like what Mubarak is doing in Egypt , who appears to be using all of the tricks in the book to avoid being removed , '' he said . Last week : Responding to unrest in the region , President Abdelaziz Bouteflika said he would lift the state of emergency in effect for nearly 20 years , according to the Algerian Press Service . Last month , the country 's largest opposition party called for demonstrations demanding the release of detainees and the restoration of individual and collective freedoms . Opponents blame the government for a spike in food prices and say the regime has failed to use Algeria 's vast energy wealth to better the lives of ordinary people . CNN 's Eliott C.

Share your story with CNN iReport . Cairo , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Thousands of Egyptian workers went on strike Thursday to demand better compensation and transparency in executive salaries , authorities said . The walkout included employees in the petroleum , railway and telecommunication industries , as protests demanding the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak dragged into their 17th day . On Wednesday , tens of thousands of protesters jammed Cairo 's Tahrir Square , with so many spilling into a nearby compound of government buildings that government officials moved parliament to another site . The government again sought to portray the imminent threat of chaos if the octogenarian president , Hosni Mubarak , were to end his 30 years of autocratic rule by stepping down right away . Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit told PBS ' `` NewsHour '' Wednesday that the military might have to intervene if that were to occur . `` Do we want the armed forces to assume the responsibility of stabilizing the nation through imposing martial law , and the army in the streets ? '' Aboul Gheit asked rhetorically . `` For the army to rule , to step in , to put its friends on the scene , that would be a very dangerous possibility . '' Could Hosni Mubarak step down Thursday ? Protesters ' mood ` festive ' in Egypt Ghonim : Welcome to Egypt revolution 2.0 He urged the protesters to adopt `` some rationality '' and said the self-proclaimed Council of the Wise , a group of prominent Egyptians from various walks of life , should determine a course of action . Aboul Gheit told PBS that Mubarak 's interest was to protect the stability of the most populous nation in the Arab world . That 's why he will not accede to the protesters ' demands that he relinquish power immediately , he said . `` He thinks that it would entail chaos and it would entail violence and it would entail also opportunities for those who would wish to act in a manner to threaten the state , the stability of the country and society , '' Aboul Gheit said . Human Rights Watch has put the death toll at more than 300 since the January 25 rally that ignited the movement . `` Instead of running scared , the regime is fighting back with both words and violence to quash its opponents , portraying the opposition as a foreign-backed , un-Egyptian group of conspirators , '' Human Rights Watch said Wednesday on its website . `` Sadly , its propaganda campaign appears to be as crude as its actual physical crackdown has been . '' The protests were largely peaceful Wednesday , with demonstrators in one rally composed solely of children who chanted anti-Mubarak slogans . `` We want the whole regime to end because they are not making our lives any easier , '' said 11-year-old Yousef Saeed . Some of their older relatives said they had brought the children to the square to witness history unfolding . `` It is the birth of freedom , '' said Saeed 's uncle , Mohammed Mostafa . `` Witnessing this event will engrave in them love of this nation , loyalty , freedom and respecting change . I want them to be free . '' But the prospect of freedom was competing with the cost of living as a motivator for some Egyptians , 20 % of whom live in poverty . `` Whether Hosni stays or Hosni goes , what 's important is that the youth get jobs , '' said Amgad , a mother of three living an hour outside Cairo , in the rural town of Fayoum on the Nile Delta . Her work at a doctor 's office earns her $ 30 per month -- not enough to pay the electricity bill . The embattled president , meanwhile , went about business as usual Wednesday , meeting with his foreign minister and Russia 's deputy foreign minister , state-run television showed . The unrest extended beyond Cairo . Two people were killed and others were wounded in clashes with police in southern Egypt , state TV reported . A journalist said the hostilities stemmed from complaints about a member of the police force in Kharga . In the northern town of Port Said , protesters attacked the governor 's building over a land and housing dispute , state TV said . The protesters were galvanized by the tears and words of an activist who was seized by security forces and held for 10 days before he was released Monday . `` If you are true Egyptians , if you are heroic Egyptians , it 's time to step down , '' Wael Ghonim told CNN Wednesday in a message directed to the ruling elite . The 30-year-old Egyptian father of two administered the Facebook page that is widely credited with calling the first protest . Ghonim , on leave from his job at Google in Dubai , said he was prepared to die for the cause . `` Kidnap me , kidnap all my colleagues ! '' Wael Ghonim said in comments that challenged Vice President Omar Suleiman to try to undo his efforts and those of his supporters . `` Put us in jail ! Do whatever you want to do . We are getting back our country . You guys have been ruining this country for 30 years . Mubarak 's regime said Tuesday that it had discussed a number of reforms with leaders of various opposition groups and appointed a panel to look into amending the constitution . But its insistence that Mubarak 's immediate exit was a recipe for chaos elicited impatience from the Obama administration . Washington is calling on its African ally to expand negotiations with opposition groups , lift the 30-year state of emergency and make constitutional changes to bring about democratic elections . But White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs expressed impatience Wednesday with the pace of progress on those matters . `` I think it is clear that what the government has thus far put forward has yet to meet a minimum threshold for the people of Egypt , '' he told reporters . A short White House statement on U.S. Vice President Joe Biden 's telephone conversation with Vice President Omar Suleiman used the word `` immediate '' or `` immediately '' four times . Biden `` urged that the transition produce immediate , irreversible progress that responds to the aspirations of the Egyptian people . '' The statement also hinted the White House harbors doubts as to whether the Egyptian government is seriously committed to reforms , referring to the regime 's statements as `` what the government is saying it is prepared to accept . '' Meanwhile , an Arab diplomat said that Saudi Arabia would consider matching the more than $ 1.5 billion in military aid that the United States provides each year to Egypt if Washington were to cut it .

Credit rating agencies have downgraded the debt of Tunisia , Jordan and Egypt A potentially toxic economic cycle could hurt Arab economies , analysts say Jordan objects to downgrade , may look for more U.S. aid -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The turmoil that 's roiled Arab states from Tunisia to Yemen is also creating a headache for those entrusted with reviving economies hard hit by rising energy and food prices , growing public debt and the prospect of more expensive borrowing on the international markets . Since mid-January , credit rating agencies such as Moody 's have downgraded the sovereign debt of Tunisia , Jordan and Egypt . On Tuesday Moody 's changed the outlook on Jordan 's foreign currency bonds to negative from stable , citing `` fiscal and economic downside risks related to ongoing turmoil in the region following events in Tunisia and Egypt . '' Moody 's said that Jordanian protesters `` could use the regional uprisings as an opportunity to express their discontent about high unemployment and the lack of development for low-income groups . '' Standard & Poor 's , another major credit rating agency , made a similar move . Jordanian officials are not happy with the downgrade , arguing that their public finances are sound -- Jordan 's foreign currency reserves actually rose last year and stand at about $ 12 billion -- and that the economy may grow as much as 6 % in 2011 . Protests there have been largely peaceful and far smaller than in Egypt and Tunisia . But after pledging to cut the budget deficit , the government reversed course in January with a package of subsidies and salary increases amounting to some $ 600 million , to compensate for higher prices . International bond markets are wary that governments may try to `` buy their way '' out of trouble , in the words of one analyst . It is a potentially toxic cycle , according to regional economists . Egypt and Tunisia have already suffered a loss of tourism revenue in peak season , while record-high grain prices and a surge in the price of crude oil have fueled inflation . Jordan imports 90 per cent of its oil , and faces disruption to its gas supplies after an explosion at a pipeline in Egypt last week . Like Jordan , Egypt has opted to spend more on subsidies for the poor . The recent street protests , now in their third week , have led stores , businesses , the stock market and banks to close -- a further cost . Until the protests erupted , Egypt had a positive reputation in the international debt markets -- with attractive interest rates for investors , banks that had avoided high-risk investments , a manageable budget deficit and low overall sovereign debt . Like Jordan , it was working to cut its budget deficit . But markets abhor uncertainty and the government 's cost of borrowing has risen sharply since the protest movement erupted -- although it has fallen back slightly in recent days . Earlier this week , the Egyptian Central Bank intervened to support the pound against the dollar , spending precious foreign currency in the process . And before the Egyptian stock market closed , some $ 5 billion was wiped off the value of Egyptian stocks in just two days . In addition , government wages and pensions in Egypt have been increased 15 per cent . Credit strategists say any labor unrest -- especially at the Suez Canal where a strike began among service workers Wednesday -- would put Egypt 's finances under further pressure . Shipping has so far been unaffected by the labor action . Market commentators say that international investors are already avoiding Egyptian Treasury auctions -- another is due next week -- meaning local banks are expected to pick up the slack . One former Jordanian official told CNN that he hoped the country 's vulnerable economic state and its value to the United States as a reliable pro-Western ally would prompt greater financial support from Washington . Last year , foreign grants -- mainly from the United States and Saudi Arabia -- totaled more than $ 400 million . But there is pressure on the U.S. federal budget too .

This interview aired in the 5 p.m. ET hour of The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer . A full transcript is after the jump . FULL TRANSCRIPT : Please credit all usage of the interview to CNN s The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer THIS IS A RUSH FDCH TRANSCRIPT . WOLF BLITZER , HOST : Stand by , because joining us now is the Egyptian Ambassador to the United States . Ambassador Shoukry , thanks very much for joining us . You can see the frustration . You can see the anger on the streets of - around Tahrir Square right now . These protesters are furious that they did n't hear what they were led to believe they would hear , that the Egyptian president , Hosni Mubarak , would step down . Give us your reaction . SAMEH SHOUKRY , EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR TO U.S. : Mr. Blitzer , I 'm calling in just as a matter of objectivity , to convey to you my sense of maybe some confusion on your part in terms of what exactly the president did say . The president did say , indicate very clearly , that he was transferring all his presidential authority to the vice president . He had done so after he had referred to the parliament the constitutional amendments upon which the political reform would proceed . So that was a point while I was following your program that I felt needed clarification . BLITZER : Well , are you saying , Ambassador - and excuse me for interrupting - that President Mubarak is no longer the president of Egypt ? SHOUKRY : President Mubarak has transferred the powers of the presidency to his vice president , who now undertakes all authorities as president . So we can say that the president is a de jure president , and no longer -- the vice president is the de facto president . BLITZER : So Omar Suleiman , you 're saying , is now the president of Egypt and Hosni Mubarak is no longer the president of Egypt ? Is that what I hear you saying , Ambassador ? SHOUKRY : This is a constitutional issue , Mr. Blitzer , which needs to be addressed from a very specific legal , constitutional perspective , not from a perspective of any form of spin . The president has transferred his authority under Article 82 of the constitution to the vice president to undertake all presidential authority that is incorporated in the constitution . So , currently , the presidential powers are all bestowed in the person of the vice president . BLITZER : All right . So I just want to be precise . And this is the information you 're getting from the Foreign Ministry , from your government in Cairo right now ? SHOUKRY : Mr. Blitzer , I am getting this from the vice president . BLITZER : From Omar Suleiman , that he is now the de facto president , if not the de jure president . He 's the acting president of Egypt . Is that fair to say that ? SHOUKRY : He is now undertaking all authority of the presidency under the constitution . BLITZER : Does President Mubarak have any authority left ? SHOUKRY : President Mubarak has transferred all authority to the vice president . BLITZER : All authority . So he has no authority left ? SHOUKRY : The only three issues that the vice president can not make any determination on are making amendments to the constitution or dissolving parliament or firing the cabinet . BLITZER : Who can make those decisions ? SHOUKRY : Those are decisions that would be made only by the president . In this case , those decisions are not effective , because the president has transferred all power to the vice president . BLITZER : All right . So , just to be precise , President Mubarak still retains those powers , those three powers . The constitution retains those powers , and they are not any longer bestowed with anyone . BLITZER : Well , so who dismisses parliament if necessary ? BLITZER : So is it fair to say that President Mubarak now has no power ? SHOUKRY : That is certainly an interpretation you can make . BLITZER : So President Mubarak now has no longer any powers . He 's no longer head of state ? SHOUKRY : He remains the de jure head of state . BLITZER : Does he also remain commander of the military ? SHOUKRY : He has transferred all powers under the constitution to the vice president , so he has transferred all effective powers to the vice president under the constitution . BLITZER : And can he get those powers back ? Or is that irrevocable ? SHOUKRY : That 's a very technical constitutional issue that I 'm unable to speak to without referring again very specifically to the legal terms of the constitution . BLITZER : So we do n't know if he can demand those powers back from Vice President Suleiman ? SHOUKRY : I do n't think that is the issue currently , Mr. Blitzer . I think the -- BLITZER : Well , no. . I want to be precise , and you 're helping us better appreciate the nuances here . Remember , we were working off a translation , an English translation . But you heard , and you see the reaction of the crowd over there in Tahrir . SHOUKRY : I 've heard the speech , and I have in my hand the copy of the speech . BLITZER : So the hundreds of thousands of people who were in Tahrir Square , they all left angry , furious . They did n't appreciate , I guess , the nuances of what you 're telling us . SHOUKRY : I 'm not in Tahrir Square , so I ca n't really judge , Mr. Blitzer . BLITZER : Will President Mubarak stay in Egypt , or is he getting ready to leave ? SHOUKRY : I have no information regarding that issue . BLITZER : And as far as you know , he 's in Egypt right now though . As far as I know , he is in Egypt . BLITZER : Why could n't he just say in simple terms what Leon Panetta , the CIA director , seemed to suggest he would say earlier in the day , or what - at least the impression we got from the president of the United States , President Obama , this was an historic moment and that he was stepping down ? Why could n't he simply say it bluntly so that we do n't have to read in between the lines ? SHOUKRY : I really ca n't answer that question . That 's a question only the president can answer . I think all I can comment on is that , apparently , this process has been undertaken with a desire to maintain the legitimacy of the constitutional process . BLITZER : And so is the vice president , Omar Suleiman , who you now say is the de facto president , is he in charge of the military ? SHOUKRY : He would be in charge of the military , because all have - all authority has been transmitted to him . BLITZER : All authority , even though in our official translation - in our translation - he said he was delegating power ? That was from the Arabic into the English , delegating power to the vice president . He did n't include -- SHOUKRY : What he said is that he was delegating the powers of the presidency to the vice president . BLITZER : Yes , we did n't have - our Arabic speakers say that their translation did n't mean he was delegating the power , all the power , or some of the power , it was a more ambiguous delegating power to the vice president . Do you remember in Arabic precisely how he phrased it ? SHOUKRY : As I recall , he said that he has delegated the authority of the presidency to the vice president . BLITZER : And is this just your interpretation , Mr. Ambassador ? Because I know you , and I know you 're an honorable man , and you 're a good civil servant of Egypt , an excellent representative here in Washington . Is this your interpretation , or is the instructions , the guidance you have been given by your government ? SHOUKRY : I felt that I needed to clarify this issue . This issue has been clarified to me that this is the intention . I am transmitting it to you for the sake of objectivity . BLITZER : And you 've transmitted the same information to the U.S. government ? SHOUKRY : I certainly intend to . BLITZER : You plan on speaking to somebody from the Obama administration , from the State Department ? SHOUKRY : There is a constant dialogue between us . BLITZER : So let 's just recap right now , because I 'm grateful to you for being precise . Who is the head of state of Egypt right now ? SHOUKRY : The head of state of Egypt is the president , who has transmitted all his powers to the vice president . BLITZER : All right . So just to be precise , the head of state is still Hosni Mubarak ? SHOUKRY : The de jure head of state is Hosni Mubarak . The de facto head of state is Omar Suleiman . BLITZER : And de jure means the legal head of state , the official head of state . But the de fact meaning , for all practical purposes , you 're saying Suleiman is the president . SHOUKRY : For undertaking all decisions , responsibilities under the Constitution , it 's Vice President Omar Suleiman . BLITZER : He 's in charge , for all practical purposes , right now ? SHOUKRY : For all presidential authority that is stipulated in the constitution . BLITZER : And put on your hat as an observer , as an Egyptian , a proud Egyptian , someone who has watched this . And you and I have spoken several times . Put on your hat as someone who understands the mood of Egypt right now . Will this be acceptable to the protesters , that Suleiman , the vice president , in effect , becomes president ? SHOUKRY : I would n't speak on anyone 's behalf . I think that remains to be seen . And whatever the demonstrators indicate will certainly be a matter of great concern to everyone . I think the demonstrators , the right to demonstrate , their right to participate in the political life of Egypt and to follow the reform process that is under way , and to form the roadmap to the future has been recognized by everyone . BLITZER : And this roadmap , to be precise , this transitional process , your understanding is it continues until September , when the next scheduled elections are supposed to take place ? SHOUKRY : It continues in the areas that have been defined , the constitutional reforms , and the consensus that emanated from the dialogue in terms of freedom of expression , of following up on issues of corruption , and the possibility of suspending the emergency law when security conditions are more conducive so there is a number of reforms that are under way so as to guarantee a meaningful and peaceful transition of power and authority in Egypt . BLITZER : Do you understand why Leon Panetta earlier in the day told Congress that he had been told that the Egyptian president , Hosni Mubarak , was going to step down as early as tonight ? SHOUKRY : I have no idea . I was not in communications with Mr. Panetta . BLITZER : I think in part because a top Egyptian military commander , an army commander , went into Tahrir Square earlier in the day and told the protesters , `` All of your demands will be fully met . '' They interpreted that as meaning - and they were screaming with joy , they were dancing , they were singing - that Mubarak would go away , would step down as president . And so what I hear you saying , Mr. Ambassador , is that he has stepped down as president , even though he technically , legally still may be the head of state . SHOUKRY : I can only reiterate what I said , Mr. Blitzer . He has transferred all powers to the vice president . BLITZER : All powers to the vice president , except the ability to dissolve parliament . SHOUKRY : Which now is in the hands of no one . BLITZER : Which is in the hands of no one . What about the ability to end the state of emergency , which has been around since 1981 ? Who can end that ? SHOUKRY : That of course is the authority of the de facto president . BLITZER : So , in other words , if Omar Suleiman wanted to end the state of emergency tomorrow , he could just sign a piece of paper and that would end it ? SHOUKRY : He has all the authorities under the constitution to act on any matter . BLITZER : Do you have any indication he will end the state of emergency ? SHOUKRY : There were references in both the president 's and vice president 's speeches tonight that the reform process is under way . BLITZER : That they were thinking about doing it , but he made no commitment , no pledge to do so . SHOUKRY : They made a reference to the political dialogue on the way , and among it , the issue of lifting the emergency law under the appropriate security conditions . And just to be precise - because I know you 've been very helpful to us , and I 'm grateful to you , Mr. Ambassador , for doing this - if Mubarak decides tomorrow , or a month from now , or six months from now to take back the power from Suleiman , the vice president , can he ? SHOUKRY : I really do not have the information . Again , these are legalistic issues . I do n't have the article of the constitution that relates to these issues . BLITZER : What are you bracing for tomorrow , Friday ? It 's already Friday in Egypt . It 's approaching 1:00 a.m. now in Egypt . It 's a day of prayer , but all the anticipation is that after the midday prayers , hundreds of thousands , if not millions , of people will go out and protest . How worried are you , Mr. Ambassador , that this could get ugly ? SHOUKRY : There is a - I think it 's been declared on several occasions at the highest level that the Egyptian people have the right to demonstrate and express their opinions under the protection of the government and the protection of the military , and I 'm sure the Egyptian people will undertake their responsibilities to express their opinions in a peaceful manner , and the voice of the people has been heard and the voice of the people will continue to guide the reform process . BLITZER : Do you feel that the U.S. administration , the Obama administration , as the foreign minister of Egypt said in an interview with PBS this week , your foreign minister , that the U.S. administration is improperly interfering in domestic Egyptian affairs ? SHOUKRY : I 'm sorry . My position here as ambassador necessitates that I maintain the channels of cooperation and consultation , and this is our interest , to maintain our special and strong relationship to the United States . The U.S.-Egyptian partnership is an enduring one , one that is important to both sides . BLITZER : Have you been asked to convey any disappointment , any displeasure or anger to the U.S. government on behalf of your government on some statements that may have been made by American officials ? SHOUKRY : No , not at all . BLITZER : So , in your contacts with U.S. officials , you 've been basically saying the U.S. and Egypt have a good relationship , have always had a good relationship , let 's continue that good relationship ? SHOUKRY : It is right . We are constantly in contact , and the dialogue is one of partnership , cooperation , and mutual understanding . BLITZER : And what 's the message they have given you , the State Department ? SHOUKRY : It is a reiteration of the same message that the president has conveyed on several occasions , that this is an Egyptian process , and the United States is supportive of a reform process , and is supportive of a peaceful and meaningful transition of power in Egypt . BLITZER : All right . Mr. Ambassador , if you can have a few more moments , Hala Gorani is with us as well . SHOUKRY : I am very sorry , but I do have other obligations , Mr. Blitzer . BLITZER : Oh , you do ? Ambassador Shoukry , we appreciate your clarifications for us . They were very useful . Thank you very much . Ambassador Shoukry is the Egyptian ambassador to the United States . He helped us better appreciate the nuances here . -LRB- required , but will not be displayed -RRB- CNN welcomes a lively and courteous discussion as long as you follow the Rules of Conduct set forth in our Terms of Service .

We already tried that with the criminal administration of cheney and his boy bush . We ended up in two wars in which thousands have been killed in the name of democracy .

February 10 , 2011 09:04 pm at 9:04 pm | This is such a delicate balancing act not only for the President but for the U.S. as a whole . It is easy to give verbal support to the Egyptian protesters now that the U.S. has slipped in their support for Suleiman as next in charge . He 's even worse so you still have dracula in charge of the blood bank . It therefore keeps America 's political interests in place . Keep in mind we have spent over a trilion dollars to invade Iraq and Afghanistan , thousands of lives of US\\/Coalition soldiers and hundreds of thosands of Iraqi and Afghani citizens . All of it to protect the US and Israeli interests in the region . So how can we think that our government will so easily lose Egypt to a bunch of common Egyptians . The US and Israel will always control Egypt by proxy . The Egyptian army is owned by us . The best Egypt can expect is a moderate dictatorship in full support of US and Israeli interests . The idea that our intelligence service misinformed President Obama should be scrutinized carefully . This is an agency funded by a million or billion dollar black budget with technology so refined they can pull information out of thin air . They can track every word and movement of Mubarak without even being there . Add our best remote viewers and it makes it even more accurate . I 'd like to believe that President Obama was misinformed today because I do believe he is an individual of character and integrity but careful assessments may be in order on all sides . February 10 , 2011 09:04 pm at 9:04 pm | I guess that makes Bush and Obama even . Bush was given wrong information on weapons of mass destruction , who knew there was no such thing . Obama was lead to believe Mubarak was stepping down and he did n't step down . The lesson we should learn is that we should n't trust information from these countries , Mubarak today was perfect proof of it . Bush did the best he could and so did Obama . February 10 , 2011 09:05 pm at 9:05 pm | February 10 , 2011 09:09 pm at 9:09 pm | Many are saying President Obama acted too slow And at the same time picking apart his speech in Cairo If he jumped out too quickly on the Protesters side The crazy far right would say `` he 's Muslim '' that 's why President Obama is DAMNED if he DO and DAMNED if he DO N'T And he 's constantly being analyzed under a microSCOPE It does not matter what he says -- people will take it WRONG !! So President continue your stride and above all remain STRONG !!! Even though we do not SHOUT the LOUDEST we re with you President Obama !!! February 10 , 2011 09:11 pm at 9:11 pm | If we would get several hundreds of thousand unemployed to protest Obama yiou think he would he leave office ? February 10 , 2011 10:08 pm at 10:08 pm | I am sorry mentioning this ; Americans , we are being pushed to the edge of the frightening Hill . This is the time carefully to review C.I.A agents backgrounds , their daily activities and FOR WHOM THEY WORK FOR . Including the past tragedies , 9\\/11 . As Today , the C.I.A made a dangerous mistakes by MIS-LEADING the American President , by saying , `` Egyptian President , Mubarak is going to step down from his Presidency '' . This leads the American President to side with the demonstrates . He also , with trust of the C.I.A messages , openly passed the messages to Worldwide Audiences and Viewers . Since this is a severe mistake\\/hurting the President , the C.I.A must be punished . I guess , this Agent is Arab\\/Egyptian background . Other than the constant call for Mubarak to go I do not hear a coherent set of demands from the protesters be they the Muslim brotherhood or other interested politically individuals\\/parties ? El Baradei could put something together , but is not doing so ... why not ? Frankly unless Mubarak and Suleiman go and the military agrees to subservient to the government duly elected from all parties a.s.a.p this uprising will in the end change nothing really . Who believes such bold . . COURAGEOUS and timely claims of support ? Support is the true problem obviously ... maybe there is some southern swamp land to be sold cheaply to the next `` supported '' diplomacy contractors . February 10 , 2011 11:45 pm at 11:45 pm | America always \\* supports democracy and will of the people . \\* Except if the will of the people is to throw out puppet tyrants we kept supporting for decades . See the entire 20th century histories of : Iran , Saud Arabia , Yemen , Pakistan , Chile , Haiti , Cuba , Belorussia , Egypt , Uzbekistan , South Africa , Lybia . All countries where at one time or another we have supported\\/are still supporting a dictator despite the will of the people , and we have opposed popular uprisings . February 11 , 2011 01:03 am at 1:03 am | Now you understand why the rest of the world does n't trust America 's so-called democracy ? Because all we do is give it lipservice , but at no time do we actually give it support . Even after our invasion of Iraq the Bush administration deliberately delayed democratic elections until we could repress half the Iraqi population , to make sure their elections will install a government that can be our puppet . And yet we criticize other countries for selecting who can run ? Oh , it 's okay for us to select so-called legitimate candidates for other countries , but not for another country to select its OWN legitimate candidates ?

People are concerned about the stability of Egypt . We call upon you to unite and to think rationally and to look toward future . The youth movement of January 25 has succeeded in implementing a very important change in process of democracy , and the change has already started . The constitutional decisions have been taken and the committees have been meeting regarding the decisions taken by the president in his first speech on Februrary 1 . `` What the president declared today affirms one more time his national sense and the response to the demands of the people and his commitment to pledges he made upon himself . It also proves for his awareness of the danger and the gravity of the very critical moment that Egypt is going through right now . `` Mr. President has also made a priority of the interests of Egypt over any other consideration , and he is also responsible for the national action in order to restore the safety and security of Egypt and the stability of Egypt and the preservation of its gains and achievements and to repel all the dangers against the people and to restore tranquility to the hands of the people and to restore life to normalcy . I ask -- I call upon all the people to continue to achieve this objective , and I have no doubt that the people will also be able to protect its own interests . `` We have opened the door of dialogue and we have reached some understanding , and we have a road map to achieve most of the demands in accordance with the given time door . The door is still open for more dialogue . In this context I want to confirm the following : I am committed to do whatever it takes in order to have an orderly transition of powers in accordance with the constitution , and I 'm also committed to implementing all that I have taken , all the pledges that I have taken for the national dialogue , and what we have agreed to do later .

'' Iranian leaders praised the Egyptian and Tunisian uprisings and said they were reminiscent of the 1979 Iranian revolution that toppled the shah of Iran and ushered in a hard-line and theocratic Islamic republic . But Iranian authorities have blocked reformist websites and detained several opposition supporters and activists , opposition website Saham News reported Thursday . This comes just days after two leading opposition figures called for a rally on February 14 in support of the uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East . Iranian authorities on Wednesday warned against any attempt by the opposition movement to hold the rally , according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency . Opposition leaders and former presidential candidates Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi requested permission to hold the rally earlier this week , according to Saham News , Karrubi 's website . It was unclear whether the government has denied the request . Moussavi and Karrubi asked that the rally take place in Tehran 's Azadi Square , the site of mass protests by Iran 's opposition movement after the disputed 2009 presidential elections . For nearly eight months , supporters of Iran 's so-called Green Movement chose major calendar days to protest in cities throughout the country . Many of the movement 's grievances were identical to those now being expressed in the streets of Cairo . Protesters condemned what they called an oppressive regime , demanded political and social freedom and called for a more representative government . Iran eventually quelled the demonstrations with a brutal crackdown against the peaceful street protests and the arrests of hundreds of activists , reformists and opposition figures , some of whom remain behind bars . Since the unrest , Iranian authorities have rejected all requests by Iran 's opposition movement for peaceful demonstrations .

Inspired by a revolt in Tunisia and a page on Facebook , they demanded presidential term limits , a higher minimum wage , government reform and an end to police brutality . They also called for the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak . The nation 's young people have known only one leader in their lives . By late Thursday , they had hoped to hear an end to Mubarak 's 30-year autocratic rule . Instead , they heard Mubarak stubbornly hold on to the presidency . The crowd transformed from jubilant to angry . Protesters remained in Cairo 's Tahrir Square overnight . The crowds swelled by the thousands throughout the day Friday . Then , a one-sentence announcement by Egypt 's vice president -- Mubarak had resigned -- sent the streets into joyous celebration . `` We did it ! '' The drama that unfolded in recent weeks had been simmering for some time . A Facebook page called `` We Are All Khaled Said '' -- named after a 28-year-old Egyptian businessman from Alexandria who was beaten to death by police last June -- sprung up , calling for protests on January 25 . Word spread on the streets of Cairo that there would be demonstrations . No one knew exactly what to expect . As many as 20,000 protesters spilled into the streets in an unprecedented display of anti-government rage that first day . At one point , cheering protesters in the world 's largest Arab nation broke through riot police who had lined Tahrir , or Liberation , Square . Police lobbed tear gas and used water cannons . In fact , they became more galvanized . Even as the internet , text messages and phone services were shut down by the government in the days ahead , the people refused to be silenced -- although many were : Human Rights Watch estimated that more than 300 people have been killed since the protests began . And the man behind the Facebook page -- Wael Ghonim -- would emerge as a national inspiration after he was detained by authorities three days after the protests began . `` I want to say to every mother and every father that lost his child , I am sorry but this is not our fault , '' Ghonim said in a tearful message after his release this week . `` I swear to God , this is not our fault . It is the fault of everyone who is holding on to power .

WOLF BLITZER , CNN ANCHOR : Let 's reset . It 's the top of the hour right now . We 're standing by , 30 minutes from now we 'll be hearing from the president of the United States . He 'll be addressing the nation , indeed the world . Most specifically , he 'll be addressing the people of Egypt in a half an hour from the White House . We 'll , of course , have live coverage of that . We 're down in the square , Tahrir Square . We 're all over Cairo . Outside of Cairo in Egypt there is massive celebration under way , right now . The celebration , because within the past few hours , it 's become official . The Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is no longer the president of Egypt . His vice president made the announcement on Egyptian television saying that the military , the Egyptian military , now , specifically , the high council of the Egyptian military , will supervise implementation on this road to democracy to free and fair elections , probably easier said than done . But there 's celebration throughout Egypt right now because there 's high confidence and support for the Egyptian military . The thought is if anyone can implement this transition away from dictatorship towards democracy , the military , which is highly respected , can do it . We 'll see if that is doable . In fact , we 're not only getting reaction from inside Egypt , you can see the flag waving , the celebratory events going on , but getting reaction from all of our correspondents from around the world . Anderson Cooper is joining us in our coverage today , so is Hala Gorani . Guys , a lot of us who watched Egypt over the years , have watched the Middle East over the years , ca n't really believe what 's going on . Within 18 days , a dictator is removed . There was some violence , but it could have been so much worse . Thousands of people could have been killed . Human rights watch says more than 300 were killed . There still are plenty of people in prison , right now , but , at least , this is a step forward and both of you were there , Anderson . Let me go to you , right now , as we await to hear from the president of the United States . I want our viewers , here in the United States and around the world , on CNN International to get a flavor of this historic moment . ANDERSON COOPER , CNN ANCHOR : I just got word that President Obama will no longer be speaking at 1:30 . We do still expect him to speak , though it 's not clear at what time he will be speaking but that 1:30 time we 're told is no longer the time that he will be speaking . But it is a remarkable turn of events . In 18 days , one of the most powerful dictators , in the region , certainly , has left office . We 're told he 's gone to Sharm el-Sheikh , although we have n't been able to confirm that . Our Ben Wedeman is standing by . Ben , extraordinary is just the word I keep coming back to . Seeing the crowds , knowing -- seeing what we have seen over these last 18 days . Did you think this would come , when it began , when tear gas was flying and riot police were attacking these protesters , did you think that they had a chance to actually do this ? BEN WEDEMAN , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Anderson , I thought they had a chance , because , from the very beginning , the government overreacted to everything and what they got was equal and opposite reaction from the -- to prove that they were ready to carry this battle to the very end . We saw them define a ban on the protests , we saw them incredibly organized , every time the police would crack down in one area , a crowd would show up in another . So , from the very beginning , on the 25th of January , my sense was that this was not an ordinary day , that this -- these were not just the usual small protests easily suppressed by the police . That this was a groundswell that really was not going to be stopped , and when -- on the 25th , when I was in Tahrir Square , and I saw the demonstrators pushing the police back near the parliament building , I realized that this was , potentially , the end of the Mubarak regime , simply because they were not ready to deal with this level of public defiance of a regime that has been in place for 30 years -- Anderson . ANDERSON : I want to bring in , now , Hala Gorani who is watching this , as well -- Hala . HALA GORANI , CNN CORRESPONDENT : And , Arwa Damon is in the thick of it all , in the middle of it all , there , with those protesters celebrating . We saw those tent cities a little bit earlier , Arwa , because there was a small core of activists determined to spend the night there , day in , day out digging in their heels until Hosni Mubarak stepped down . And there you have it , this sort of little village within a city within a state , and it 's the protesters in this square that ended up , through their actions and determination , forcing the resignation of Hosni Mubarak . Arwa , you 're in the middle of it all . What are people telling you ? ARWA DAMON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : I 'm sorry . Could you repeat that , please ? GORANI : What are people telling you , Arwa ? DAMON : Oh , you see this entire sea of people in front of me ? People from all walks of life , people happy , celebrating . There was a live band on the stage , very , very happy I 'm being told , the Egyptian people are happy . They have achieved -- they have achieved the unimaginable , and they can not believe -- I 'm just hearing from this young man that this dream has actually become a reality that they have freedom , and , now , I 'm going to put another young man on the phone to tell us exactly how are you feeling at this moment ? We feel now we have -- Mubarak -- we will judge him now and - INAUDIBLE . DAMON : And there we have it , quite brief -LRB- ph -RRB- . It 's quite chaotic here . Many people want to talk . Everybody reiterating the fact that they do love Egypt , and , yes , this is completely a victory . People having a lot of messages . This young man also telling us that they removed INAUDIBLE Mubarak in three weeks and want the entire world to know this . Egyptians are the best . They want that to get out to the rest of the world . You have a message ? Tell us what your message is . DAMON : And what happens next ? Everybody will go home and start working . There will be a hope . Before there was no hope , but from now on , they will see another hope , you will see another enthusiasment -LRB- ph -RRB- . You will see that we want really new productivity in just a few years . DAMON : And just to add on to that idea , another man that I had met , a few nights ago , telling us that he learned a very valuable lesson from the youth that came together to start this demonstration . He was saying that they INAUDIBLE finally be positive , that Mubarak 's regime had nothing but create ways negativity in this society . With that , now , finally , they felt they can be positive . There 's a doctor with me , right now , who , also , that wants to speak . I 'm assuming that you probably seen the worst of what happened after these devastations with the violence . You had to treat many patients . What are your feelings right now ? Congratulations to all Egyptians but also Egyptians , we are -- our Egypt , our country , to get INAUDIBLE love , love freedom . Do a lot of sort of things to our country , we hope that the region will be good to this life . DAMON : A lot of hopes . A lot of opinions . A lot of enthusiasm , as you can , obviously , tell . People absolutely thrilled and very relieved , too . One of the great concerns we had been hearing before was that all of the blood that had been shed here would going to be in vain if President Mubarak did not step down , but now the crowds , here , knowing and believing that everything that they 've had to sacrifice has been worth it . GORANI : All right , Arwa Damon , thanks very much , in Tahrir Square . As much as we want to talk about the future , it seems people in Tahrir and around Cairo and the rest of Egypt , just want to , kind of , enjoy the moment -- Anderson ? ANDERSON : Understandably so . Ivan Watson is by the presidential palace . Ivan , what are people , there , saying ? Ivan Watson , if you can hear me at the presidential palace , what is -- what are people saying there ? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : What do you want to do with Arwa ? ANDERSON : Clearly we 're having trouble getting in touch with Ivan . We have correspondents really -- the presidential palace is quite a distance away from Liberation Square , and , for many days , the protesters had talked about marching on the presidential palace , but there were about , at least , six checkpoints , according to our Ben Wedeman , military checkpoints between Liberation Square and the palace . So , the idea of a large crowd actually marching and being able to get there , seemed unlikely . And every day , though there was talk about doing it , it never actually happened until a crowd actually did go there yesterday after Mubarak 's speech , when he was expected to step down , and really stunned people by not following through on that . Interesting to know , at some point , what happened between that speech and the Vice President Suleiman coming on television last night , saying -- explaining what the president had done , between then and now , what was it that made Mubarak , finally , and Vice President Suleiman , finally , face reality ? Was it the military coming to them ? Was it some sort of new assessment of what was happening on the ground ? Again , at this point , we do n't know . We have just gotten a report that Swiss authorities -- this has , actually , just crossed the wires . The Swiss government has asked banks in that country to freeze any assets that might belong to Egypt 's President Hosni Mubarak or his family . This according to a spokesman for the Swiss Embassy in Washington . The Swiss government saying they do n't know of what funds Mubarak , or his family members , may have in banks in Switzerland , but they are authorizing and they are asking banks in the country to check and to freeze any assets that they think might belong to Mubarak and the family to stop any kind of money transfers , to stop any kind of money being withdrawn from any of those accounts . On Tuesday , apparently , the finance minister in Switzerland asked the banks to look into Mubarak 's assets that might be held in that country . But , apparently , according to him , the banks , yet -- do not , yet , have a clear picture of what kind of money is being held . And here we see a group of people , the Egyptian flag walking down the street . Pity anyone stuck in traffic , tonight , in Cairo . They are not going anywhere for quite a while . Ivan Watson is standing by . Ivan , we 've just heard that Swiss authorities are trying -- have -- or are asking banks in Switzerland to freeze any accounts . We hear that a lot from people , now . They want -- whether or not they want Mubarak put on trial , they want the money that he is alleged to have taken over the years . IVAN WATSON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : That 's right . I mean , that was something we started hearing , Anderson , in recent days , amid some news reports that he had untold wealth , and we started seeing that appear in some of the protest signs , you know , that there should be investigations into corruption , into Mubarak 's alleged wealth , the wealth of his family . By the way , Anderson , the sound of honking horns , here , typically , in Cairo , that 's because of gridlock traffic and frustrated drivers . The sound in Cairo , tonight , they 're not honking their horns out of frustration . It 's a celebration . And what 's amazing about it is four or five hours ago , the streets of the city were eerily , almost frighteningly , empty , completely empty . We were able to drive through the city , not even pedestrians on the street , and now the people have poured out into the streets and we 're many neighborhoods away from Tahrir Square . The flag waving INAUDIBLE , here . Street parties at almost every intersection . I 've seen fireworks and confetti . One woman , I asked her , are you scared about what 's going to come next ? And she said , no , because the military is taking over and I feel safe with them , and with their help , one day soon , we 'll be able to vote in presidential elections -- Anderson . ANDERSON : And we hear those horns -- let 's just listen to some of the sounds in Cairo tonight . WATSON : It 's going to be a party out here all night , Anderson . ANDERSON : There have been some estimates , Ivan , estimates of the Mubarak fortune range wildly from -- people say $ 20 billion to $ 70 billion . Often , those estimates turn out to be completely or wildly inaccurate . Seventy billion dollars would make him the richest man in the world . That seems highly unlikely . Even $ 20 billion , which is a low estimate , would be an extraordinary sum . Even a billion dollars , frankly , or hundreds of millions of dollars would be extraordinary sums . At this point we , frankly , do not know , nor does anyone , I think , how much money the Mubarak family may have been able to amass over the some 30 years of his reign . And , I think , you know , one of the things that another woman I was talking to , just now , and she was out with her daughters out celebrating , an American-Egyptian woman , dual national , she said that she had tried to start a business after moving from the U.S. back to Egypt , tried to start up a commercial business , but was stopped almost every -- at every juncture in a way by a system of corruption and graft , she said , that made it impossible to try to build something here and made it such that her daughters who were 18 years old , 20 years old , were all planning to leave the country to study outside of Egypt and pursue a life outside . They did n't see a future here . So if that 's starting at the level of a small business , a system of graft and corruption , you can just imagine how the money would flow upwards to the pharaoh who sat at the top of that financial economic pyramid . And it 's said the Mubarak family , the sons of Mubarak , have a number of companies that basically kind of get money through links with other foreign companies that do business in Egypt , perhaps through the military as well . But , again , a lot of this will no doubt be investigated down the road as already this regime , in the last few days and weeks , we have seen this regime turning on itself , already starting to investigate itself , kind of throwing former ministers under the bus , essentially freezing their accounts in Egypt , taking their passports so they ca n't get away from the country , already investigating some of the ministers from past regimes under Mubarak . COOPER : And now we 're seeing some fireworks , Wolf , over the square . This , again , extraordinary images . And we have correspondents all throughout Cairo and we are trying to kind of give you as much of a sense in different parts of the city and just the scope of the celebrations tonight , Wolf . BLITZER : It certainly is a celebration in Cairo . The fireworks , the chanting , the singing , the happy people . They -- a lot of them , no doubt , ca n't believe this has happened . Let 's listen a little bit , watch the sights and listen to the sounds . This has been a revolution , largely peaceful . There was some brutal violence , yes , for days and , unfortunately , tragically more than 300 people , according to Human Rights Watch , were killed . Thousands of others injured . But today they 're celebrating . They 're all smiles as Egypt is free . That 's what they 're saying , Egypt is now free . Let 's go to Cairo right now . CNN 's Fionnouala Sweeney is watching what 's going on as well . First of all , Fionnouala , tell us where you are . Can you see these fireworks going off from your location ? FIONNOUALA SWEENEY , CNN CORRESPONDENT : We certainly can . I mean , I can tell you as I look here down to my left across the Nile , there is just a sea , a line of car lights and they 're all heading in one direction , which is Tahrir Square just behind me . I mean the excitement here is palpable , obviously , but I think some thoughts are beginning to turn now , Wolf , to what 's happened in the rest of the region . And on that note , we 've had some reaction , for example , from the United Arab Emirates . And they 're saying they have confidence in the higher military council that 's taking power . Of course , the UAE was rather against the protests and against particularly what it called foreign interference . We also heard today from Iran 's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad celebrating the 32nd anniversary of the Islamic Revolution there , saying that these protests below me here and throughout the rest of this country would result in the end of what he calls U.S. and Israel 's interference in the region . A big question now , what happens in countries like Jordan ? Several hundred people demonstrating today in Jordan . One on one side of the Egyptian protesters . They said the Arab world is on fire . And on the other side of those protests , a rival group , calling for the ouster of the recently appointment Jordanian prime minister . And , Wolf , let 's not forget Israel , watching this very closely . CNN spoke to Avi Dichter a short time ago . He is the former head of Shin-Bet in Israel . He said , more or less that Omar Suleiman was a man that Israel could work with . But Israel , where I was last week , very concerned , particularly along the border with Sinai , that any instability now could affect its security . BLITZER : But , Fionnouala , the Israelis , like the United States , have a pretty good relationship with the Egyptian military , which at least during this transition to elections is going to be in charge . Is n't that right ? SWEENEY : Well , indeed they do and that 's why Avi Dichter , the former head of Shin-Bet said in some comments to CNN in an interview a couple of hours ago , essentially that Omar Suleiman was a man who they said once he gave his word , he stuck by his word . He was a man essentially that Israel can work with . But , you know , everybody is really excited here , as you can imagine , but the dust has to settle . And when the dust settles , eventually there are going to be questions back as to how this country is going to be run . Will the state of emergency be lifted ? Will political prisoner , some ten thousand of them , be released ? We also heard this is a fundamental question of human rights coming from the U.K. prime minister , David Cameron . DAVID CAMERON , BRITISH PRIME MINISTER : Good evening . Today has been a remarkable day , particularly for those people in Tahrir Square and elsewhere who have spoken out so bravely and so peacefully for change in their country . Egypt now has a really precious moment of opportunity to have a government that can bring the country together . And as a friend of Egypt and the Egyptian people , we stand ready to help in any way that we can . We believe it must be a government that starts to put in place the building blocks of a truly open , free and democratic society . And , of course , what has happened today should only be the first step . Those who now run Egypt have a duty to reflect the wishes of the Egyptian people . And in particular , there really must be a move to civilian and democratic rule as part of this important transition to an open , democratic and free Egypt . SWEENEY : And those views of David Cameron being echoed by the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , and the European Union . But just let 's go back to what we were talking about a moment ago , Wolf , yes , people are excited here . Hosni Mubarak has gone . But the question will remain once the dust settles , and it will be some time yet , has this regime changed and will it be enough to keep the country stable and the region beyond it ? BLITZER : Yes , David Cameron welcoming , obviously , what 's going on in Egypt right now . The revolution has succeeded in Egypt . It 's now approaching 8:30 -- it 's 8:22 p.m. in Tahrir Square right now . The celebration , I think it 's fair to say , at least on this night in Cairo , elsewhere in Egypt , only just beginning . Hala , it 's a momentous occasion and I guess it 's a cliche but history certainly is unfolding . The celebration is just beginning and the process toward a true transition to democracy in Egypt , if indeed that transition unfolds as protesters hope that it will is just beginning . Frederik Pleitgen is not too far from where the demonstrators are cheering . They 're waving their flags . We saw small fireworks earlier over Tahrir Square . Eighteen days is the time that it took for the people in that square , the demonstrators throughout Egypt , to force the resignation of what people thought was one of the most stable autocracies in the Middle East . Nineteen days ago it was almost impossible to imagine this scenario . But today we 're seeing the people of Egypt celebrating . Many when we asked them what comes next , sort of wanting to bask kind of in the joy of the moment . They just want to celebrate today and perhaps think more about the detail tomorrow . But there are challenges ahead . Frederik Pleitgen joins us now live . What 's your vantage point there , Frederik ? What have people been telling you about what comes next ? FREDERIK PLEITGEN , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : What comes next is really one of the big questions . But let me show you our vantage point . We 're obviously overlooking what 's been going on here on the square . And I can tell you , it is absolutely amazing . There 's people dancing in the street . Down there , look , you see a whole crowd of people who are just absolutely excited . I think one of the questions that many people ask is , when these democratic elections are going to be taking place . Obviously a lot of people that I 've been speaking to , Hala , say that they 're quite happy with the military taking over control of this country , at least for an interim period , and then they want to see democratic elections . One of the things that I find the people who were down in Tahrir Square all this time had very little thought about was who their future president is going to be . Every time you ask people who they think should rule this country after Hosni Mubarak , they always say , the people will decide . And that 's simply because there is really no clear leader . Clearly a lot of people here are not happy with Omar Suleiman , but they have no idea who they want to come after this , Hala . GORANI : And state television is announcing that a statement from the military will come soon . Egypt is now ruled by the higher military council . President Hosni Mubarak a couple of hours ago transferring powers to the military , not to his vice president , seeing as too close to the old guard , the old leadership here or over there , I should say . I just got back . I 'm still saying here , Frederik . So , looking forward then , we heard from Mohamed ElBaradei that a year sounded to him like a good kind of length of time before elections could take place in the country . Do protesters want elections earlier than that , though ? PLEITGEN : I think a lot of people would like to have elections earlier than that . I think right now we can see the mood that 's going on , on Tahrir Square from people that I 've been talking to really . They 're really in this sort of -- just -- I would say democratic mood . They want power by the people . They want grassroots movement . GORANI : All right , we 've got to go to state television for an announcement by the military . UNIDENTIFIED MALE -LRB- through translator -RRB- : Oh , people , on this historic and decisive moment in the history of Egypt and with issuing of the decision of President Mohamed Hosni Mubarak to step down from the post of president and assigning the higher council of military to run the affairs of the nation . And as we all know the gravity and -- unfolding -LRB- ph -RRB- of this issue in face of the demands of our great nation everywhere to bring about decisive changes . The higher military council is studying this issue with the help of God , the greatest , to reach the dreams of our great people . And a higher military council will later issue more statements to outline the measures and decisions that will be taken and followed , stressing at the same time that this is not a replacement of the logistical -LRB- ph -RRB- nation that we have . The higher military council is expressing all its appreciation to President Mohamed Hosni Mubarak for what he has offered in the path of national service , this in time of war or peace and on his national decision and stance in putting interests of the nation at the forefront . And in this context , the higher military council is expressing all its appreciation for the life of the martyrs . Those who have sacrificed their lives for the freedom and security of their nations and for all the people of our nation . And God be in our help . Peace be upon you . GORANI : Go ahead , Wolf . It 's a very brief statement . It wo n't take long to sum it up . WOLF : Yes , no , it 's a very interesting statement that that military officer made to the people of Egypt , reaffirming what we had been told was happening , that the Egyptian military , specifically the higher council of the Egyptian military , would now run the affairs of the nation . Obviously this is a new development for the Egyptian military . Something they 're not necessarily used to . They 're going to have some serious meetings now on what that means . I was intrigued and , Hala and Anderson , if you want to weigh in on this , on the appreciation that officer expressed to President Hosni Mubarak , now former President Hosni Mubarak , who made all these sacrifices , he said , for the Egyptian people , but now he 's gone . We think he 's in Sharm el-Sheikh . We 're not exactly 100 percent sure where he and his family are . We do know , and , Anderson , you reported a little while ago , that the Swiss government says they are freezing any financial assets that Mubarak or his family might have in Swiss banks right now and there 's -- anyone can guess how much money they might have . Various estimates from the low billion to as much as 70 billions of dollars that they 've amassed over the years . But it 's clear that the military is now in charge of what 's happening . I 'm not exactly sure , maybe one of you can help me , what is going to be the role , if any , of the vice president , Omar Suleiman ? Is he running the situation right now or is he out of the situation as well ? COOPER : I believe he 's out of the situation . I asked that question to Mohamed ElBaradei , and that was his understanding , as well , that he is gone from the situation , as well . Whether or not that 's true , I mean , this is a man , you know , who has long links with the military , who ran the intelligence services , so the whole Interior Ministry which has some million and a half employees by some estimates , secret police , informers , they have far more employees than the military has , the military , I think , has about a half million or so . So it 's not clear to me exactly where Suleiman is , what role , if any , he plans to play . I think it 's also to point out , Hala and Wolf , not only did the military officer there want to specifically praise Mubarak , which I think is more of not wanting to humiliate the man -- and we started to hear that from a number of protesters and people like Mohamed ElBaradei , saying it 's important , you know , he does n't need to be humiliated , he does n't need to leave Egypt , but he just needs to go . You also heard from that officer , which we have not heard from Mubarak and we have not heard from the vice president in the last two weeks , him saluting literally saluting what he called the martyrs . And for those in the audience , our viewers who may be wondering who the martyrs are , I believe he 's referring directly to the people whose lives , the protesters whose lives have been lost in the last two-plus weeks often in these demonstrations . In the last couple of weeks , we would see people carrying posters , excuse me , people carrying posters with pictures of their loved ones who had been killed in the protest movement , and they were called the martyrs . So I think that 's who at the end he was saluting in addition to Mubarak , Wolf . BLITZER : Yes , he may have been saluting those martyrs then , at the same time , as a military officer , he may have been referring to the martyrs over the years over the generations in Egypt , specifically the soldiers who died in battle on behalf of Egypt . GORANI : Yes , I think listening to that , yes , I think listen to that he was referring to those individuals who lost their lives over the last 18 days . That 's what it sounded like to me . The martyrs , it 's a way of describing in Arabic a very commonly used term for people who 've died sort of in the pursuit of a goal , in this case revolutionary overthrow of the regime . But what I found interesting is that the military is positioning itself very neutrally there as a facilitator , sort of a political transitional entity and institution by on the one hand sort of praising Mubarak and expressing appreciation to Hosni Mubarak , but on the other hand also expressing appreciation to those martyrs as they 're commonly called in Arabic , those people who died in that struggle . So it 's very interesting how in terms of public relations what the military is doing on this important day . BLITZER : You know , it 's also fascinating , especially to those of us who watched Egyptian state media over the years , earlier today even before the official announcement from the vice president that Mubarak was stepping down , we saw those anchors , those journalists apologizing to the people of Egypt for the lies in effect that they had been forced to tell over the years on Egyptian state media . I do n't know , Anderson , if you caught that or , Hala , if you saw that , but that was a dramatic development when you see these Egyptian journalists on state media apologizing to the people saying we did n't really mean to report all these awful things , but we had no choice . COOPER : Well , you know , Shahira Amin , who was an anchor , resigned two weeks ago or maybe a week and a half ago because she did n't want to tell lies any longer . So some people did make a stand earlier on , but obviously we 're now seeing a number of those anchors saying , you know , that they 're apologizing . It was always interesting to hear from Shahira Amin . Once she had resigned her position , she would describe how the lies were spread . That basically they would get a press release from the Ministry of Interior dictating how they were supposed to discuss the protesters . To talk about foreign influence , that foreigners were behind this , that the protesters were being paid , that there were , you know , foreign powers behind them , that they were eating Kentucky fried chicken and , you know , being fed while in the square , all of which were just lies spread by the state , which State TV very quickly was putting out . BLITZER : Yes , it was a major development . Hala , you followed the Egyptian media for a long time . Just to see that unfold and if you had watched , if you had watched the Egyptian media over these past 18 days , Anderson is right , and Ben Wedeman had reported extensively for us about some of the outrageous allegations they were making against these demonstrators at Tahrir Square , allegations saying the U.S. or other foreign powers were funding them , were responsible for them and it was , you know , just wild , wild accusations . Let 's go back to Tahrir Square right now . Arwa Damon is on the scene for us . DAMON : Well , celebrations are most definitely continuing . There 's still a live band here . People still very happy and despite their exhaustion , very willing to continue expressing that . I 'm joined now by Ahmed -LRB- ph -RRB- . Sir , what are your feelings right now ? DAMON : And what does this mean for you , for Egypt ? What sort of changes will you see to your day-to-day life ? We 've had our chains broken . It 's very hard to understand what freedom means until you lose it and you try to find it . DAMON : And you 're a businessman with a number of clothing shops around this very square , so you 've obviously taken a very severe economic blow . DAMON : How are you going to begin recovering from that ? What 's the next step for people like you ? I 'm looking at how much I can make after this revolution happened . It 's beautiful because it 's just the kids next door who did it , who were unarmed , they had no political agenda , they are not , you know , political parties . They are beautiful kids next door who did it only with determination and Facebook . DAMON : You know , this is obviously come at a great cost for all Egypt . DAMON : How is this country going to recover moving forward ? How are the various social systems going to be brought back together again ? We were being thefted -LRB- ph -RRB- for more than the amount of upon that it cost Egypt throughout this whole revolution there . So I believe if we just weed out the corruption , we 'll pick up in no time . DAMON : And so the future most definitely a bright one , you would say . DAMON : The future is a very bright one . As long as the military stands to their word and to give the power to the people , so that 's a very important issue . I 'm sorry if I interrupt you here because some people ask me to -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- to ask to free all of the political prisoners who are in prison knowing from them that this is CNN and the whole wide world can be watching . DAMON : Not a problem at all . Thank you very much . DAMON : That just gives you an idea of how the revolution -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . It gives you an idea of the sentiment right now , some of the concerns that people do have for the future . They have one for the moment and they most certainly are riding that wave of happiness right now , but it is going to take quite a lot of time to put the country back together again . BLITZER : The work is only just beginning I think it 's fair to say . By the way , we 're just getting word from the White House , the president of the United States , Barack Obama , will address the nation , indeed , the world at 3:00 p.m. Eastern . That 's a little bit less than an hour and a half from now . At 3:00 p.m. Eastern , the president will be in the Grand Foyer over at the White House . He 'll speak out on his reaction to the historic moment in Egypt right now , the revolution , which has succeeded . At 3:30 p.m. Eastern , a half hour later , there will be a briefing at the White House , as well . We 'll , of course , have coverage here on CNN . Anderson , all of this unfolding very , very rapidly . COOPER : Very rapidly and a lot of unanswered questions and , again , I mean the story obviously of today and tonight is this extraordinary celebration . And the pictures tell that story extraordinarily well . Thirty years of pent-up fear and anger and frustration and degradation exploding in just hours of joy . But again , so many unanswered questions . Exactly what does this mean to have this military government now ruling ? What happens , as that man mentioned in the square , to all the political prisoners , to all those who have been detained , an unknown number have been detained . Wael Ghonim that we spoke to , that Google executive whose on leave who helped start these protests on his Facebook , he brought it up , as well . You know , we do n't know how many -- he said there were as many as maybe a thousand people detained . We , frankly , do n't know . I interviewed one reporter last night for radio for Europe who was arrested -- he was a Westerner arrested , held in detention for 28 hours and heard Egyptians around him being electrocuted by authorities and being beaten by people . Again , we do n't know their names . We do n't know how many people are still in detention . So the question is what is going to happen to them . Will they continue to rule under emergency rule ? Remember , Mubarak has ruled for 30 years , his entire reign under emergency rule which allows secret police to arrest anyone at any time . Their families are n't notified what 's happened to them . There 's no way for their families to track down . They 're in the custody of the secret police . So there 's a lot of unanswered questions about what will happen in the hours and the days ahead . But , again , for the people right now who have suffered for so long , perhaps those questions can wait just a few more hours to be answered while they celebrate freedom , something they are tasting really for the first time in their lives . Frederik Pleitgen is in Liberation Square , as well . Frederik , from your vantage point , what are you seeing ? FREDRIK PLEITGEN , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , what I 'm seeing , Anderson , is how people are turning this main road , this main bridge that goes over the Nile , more and more into a party ground , if you will . Holding up traffic , people singing and chanting there in the streets . A lot of them , of course , just making their way over here right now . It seems like almost all of Egypt is trying to make its way here . And , you know , again people as you said , they say right now this is their moment to celebrate . They want to celebrate the fact that Hosni Mubarak has stood down . They 're not really thinking very much , they say , about who the next president is going to be , about how their country will unfold . I think one of the things that was important in the military statement that we saw before was that the military was trying to ensure the people here that things would go in a non-chaotic way , in an orderly way , it would go on , their lives would not be unraveled because that 's obviously one of the things that the Mubarak government was talking so much about in the past couple of day . Remember when he was talking about how the foreign media was inciting people , how without Hosni Mubarak there would be chaos . I think right now the specter of that has sort of gone but the military saying that it would keep things this order . And so right now this is just a really massive celebration that is going down there on the 6th of October bridge across the Nile which , of course , also was a battleground only a couple of days ago . And you know , when I was down there , I was seeing people who were just bursting into tears , letting their emotions just go freely because so many of these people , you know , for the past 30 years , they just have n't been able to do that . And I 've spoken to people who said , they were sort of it their early 30s , and they were saying , you know , I 've never had anybody else except this ruler , anybody except Hosni Mubarak . And so for them this is obviously al a very new feeling . Freedom of speech , freedom of expression , being able to come out here and wave these flags and chant these slogans . So it is an absolutely amazing experience , Anderson . COOPER : And , Frederik , this is going to go on -- I mean , does anyone know how long it will go on for and are there any plans for people ultimately to leave the square ? I mean , once the celebrations die down , do we know , will protesters continue to stay in the square or is that -- is there a plan yet ? PLEITGEN : I do n't think there 's any plans whatsoever . At least there 's none that I 've heard . I mean , this is probably , from the looks of it , is going to go on for the whole night , from what I can see , and probably for the better part of tomorrow as well . Of course , almost nobody works here tomorrow , so this is certainly a day that families will go out anyway . As far as the square is concerned , I believe that the things in the square will go on for a couple of days to come simply because the square itself has become so much more , you know , sophisticated . The whole infrastructure there , people were building houses , people were building toilets , they were building wash areas for the people . So I think that will go on for a little bit and then it will probably die down at some point . And remember that this square has just become such a focal point of this nation that not everybody who is coming there was even a demonstrator . There were people who were bringing their kids there just to show them what all of this is about , and that 's probably going to continue for the next couple of days . People are going to visit this place as such a historic place , as the place where the revolution that swept Egypt started and where it ultimately ended . And as the people who started it in that square , eventually brought down this strong man president who had ruled over this country for 30 years . People who at the beginning were laughed off , people -- you know , young people on Twitter and Facebook posting things on the internet who ultimately then started this thing that snowballed . So I believe this is going to go on for another couple of days and certainly the celebrations down there in the street are going to go on , as well . It might be a little slower in the mornings , but certainly this is going to go on for quite awhile . And if I may say one thing . I was obviously , being a German citizen , was in 1989 , and the celebrations there when the wall came down , took a very long time , Anderson . COOPER : How does this compare in terms of crowds , in terms of atmosphere ? PLEITGEN : This -- it 's very , very similar . I mean , it really is . If I remember the night the Berlin wall came down when the people were going from East to West Berlin and everybody was cheering on everybody , just a very positive atmosphere , a very chaotic one , but a very positive one . This is definitely something that compares . And the time frame is almost the same . I mean the Berlin Wall was up for 28 years . Hosni Mubarak was in power for 30 years , so I can certainly relate to what the people down there are feeling at this point in time . And just the sense of relief they have , the sense of exploring something new , exploring , as I said , these new freedoms . You know , freedom of expression , being able to say whatever you want . Being able to talk to our cameras . I mean , you witnessed it , as well , when you were in Tahrir Square , how everybody on that square wanted to come to you and tell you a story , tell you what was wrong with Egypt and tell it to the world . That 's something these people have n't experienced in such a long time . You could feel just how badly they craved to do that now that they can , Anderson . COOPER : Extraordinary , Frederik , thanks . Let 's go back to Wolf . BLITZER : Anderson , thank you . It 's amazing stories that we 're getting and these stories also , I think , are just beginning . William Cohen , the former defense secretary during the Clinton administration , is joining us . Also , the Egyptian journalist Mona Eltahawy , as well . Let me get to Secretary Cohen first . The commander in chief of the Egyptian military , field marshal Mohammed Hussein Tantawi , I assume he 's the man in charge right now . You know him , do n't you ? WILLIAM COHEN , FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE : I do . I worked with him while I was in the Pentagon , and he had served side-by-side with President Mubarak . Now , the question is , whether he will continue to remain the head of the military as such , or whether that will pass on to a younger generation remains to be seen . But we had dealings with him , and he was very helpful in terms of communicating our ideals , as well , to that military . That 's one of the many benefits , if you look at how this unfolded . The professionalism of the Egyptian military , I think , also is a credit to our own military that had deep , deep ties with him and really inculcating those kind of values . Respecting people , not just using your force to hold them down , but rather responding to it in a very professional way . BLITZER : So , you 're encouraged that the military over this transition period towards elections and democracy is in charge . COHEN : I 'm very confident on a temporary basis . We 'll see as evolutionary process whereby the Egyptian people will now expect this military to maintain control and stabilize situations until such time as the building blocks for a true democracy can be established . They 're very confident with that military now . But they do n't want to see a permanent hold by the military over the society . BLITZER : Mona , before we talk politics , the future of Egypt , go ahead and just express your thrilling feelings right now , all of us who know you , just want to hear what you have to say . MONA ELTAHAWY , EGYPTIAN JOURNALIST\\/ARAB AFFAIRS ANALYST : I 'm ecstatic , Wolf . I mean I was on a radio show when the news came through and one of my friends called me from Boston , and he was just crying . He was just saying , Mona , he 's gone . Mona , he 's gone . I 'm going to start crying now just remembering it . And I went back on the radio show and I was just bawling my eyes out , telling them I can not express to you how ecstatic we all are . There is a long road ahead , no doubt . But this is the happiest day of my life , and we have to stop and celebrate and salute those courageous Egyptians who in 18 days , in a beautiful and peaceful way , brought down a dictator of 30 years . It 's a wonderful moment . I can not be happier . I 'm so proud to be Egyptian . BLITZER : And so what do you say about president -- now former President Mubarak . Was he courageous in his final act , agreeing to step down , or basically had no choice and good riddance ? What do you say to Mubarak ? ELTAHAWY : Well , first of all I 've got to say as an Egyptian , it 's wonderful to say former president because we have not been able to do that in a long time . I think when push came to shove , the armed forces -- and I got to say the Egyptian armed forces , I 'm sure they have great relationship with their American equivalent , but this is the Egyptian armed forces coming through for the Egyptian people with no help whatsoever , basically realizing it was a case of Egypt on one side and Hosni Mubarak on the other side . And they chose the right side . They did the right thing . And Hosni Mubarak was trying to dig in his heels . It showed how out of touch he was with what was happening in the country because the more stubborn he became , the more people poured out into the streets in the hundreds of thousands . I do n't think he was courageous . I think that he would have been courageous if at the very beginning when he realized the people 's will was for freedom , he would have said , I also choose Egypt rather than myself . Up until yesterday , he kept talking about himself and not Egypt . So , I think the armed forces -- you know , all Egyptians recognize the armed forces today chose Egypt . BLITZER : They certainly did . Secretary Cohen , if you 're a dictator in Tunisia , you 're out . If you 're a dictator in Egypt , you 're out . Which dictators in the region should be pretty nervous right now ? COHEN : Well , anyone who 's in power by way of dictatorial authority has to question this . Each country is different . There are different economic situations , which might lend themselves to this kind of a revolution . But I was thinking this morning as I was watching this unfold of Robert Kennedy 's words almost 50 years ago , maybe more than 50 years ago . He said that each time a man stands for an ideal or acts to improve the lot of others or strikes out against injustice , he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope . And crossing each other from a million different centers and daring , these ripples can build a wave or stream that can sweep down the mightiest wall of oppression and resistance . Those words , I think , will be quoted by many people throughout the world today . The Egyptian people , in terms of how they brought this revolution about , peacefully and vigorously , I think is going to be an example for many others . And hopefully it will end with a democratic process that will be put in place in a reasonably foreseeable time so that the Egyptian people can enjoy the fruits and benefits of a prosperous and democratic society . BLITZER : I think we have some reaction from Ban ki-Moon , who 's the United Nations secretary-general . If we have that clip ready , let 's roll that now and then we 'll continue this conversation . We 'll get that cued up and we 'll play it for our viewers later . Let me ask you what I asked Mohammed ElBaradei , Mona . What do you want to hear from the president of the United States say ? He 'll be speaking to the American people in about an hour from the White House ? ELTAHAWY : I want to hear President Obama to say , I salute the Egyptian people for showing the world they have led a peaceful revolution that is an example to everyone . And I also salute the armed forces for choosing Egypt . But I tell the Egyptian armed forces that it 's very quickly time to move aside and make room for a civilian government in Egypt . Because one of the demands of everyone in Egypt who joined this pro-democracy march and revolution was to get rid of Mubarak and his regime , but also to keep Egypt - or to make Egypt , rather -- a civilian state because we 've been ruled by army men since 1952 . So , I think it 's important to get the moral support from the outside . I also want everyone in the United States and across the world to recognize what a turning point this is . How peaceful it was . Think of every young Arab now watching what happened in Egypt today and what happened in Tunisia . They 're understanding that through this empowerment , they can bring about change in their countries peacefully . That is an incredibly intoxicating and empowering message because all we hear from the Middle East is violence and passive or violent Arabs . We have now seen active , proactive , empowered Arabs showing the world , we can bring about peaceful change . It 's a wonderful message . BLITZER : This is a moment for the United States , Secretary Cohen , right now to not only bask in the moment but to take advantage of this moment and continue to promote democratic reform throughout the region . It started with promoting it in Iraq . It hopefully will spread to Iran , and I would hope that the rulers in Iran are worried about what has taken place here because they can see the power of the people . And perhaps the United States can continue to raise that lamp of liberty very high , and they can sweep down that wall of oppression that exists in Iran . BLITZER : A lot of us remember that speech President Obama gave in Cairo in 2009 . I 'm not sure he expected that this would develop . I do n't know if that was a result of this or what the impact was , but it was a dramatic speech at the time . And now we 're seeing what 's happening on the streets of Cairo . And I suspect it will spread elsewhere . Mona will be standing by . She 's going to be helping us later when we continue our coverage . Secretary Cohen , thanks to you as well . We 're not going anywhere . Hala , about an hour or so from now we expect to hear from the president of the United States at the grand foyer at the White House . We 'll get his reaction to all of this history . But let me throw it back to you for the time being . GORANI : All right . We 've talked a lot about the power of social media in all of this and the massive protest movement that forced the Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak to step down . Well , this Facebook page in memory of a young Egyptian businessman killed by police - we can put that up - helped sparked thousands of demonstrators to take to the streets on January 25th . I 'm talking about a Facebook page , if we can get it up , that 's fine . If not , just a quick description . We are all Khamid Saeed . This is a young man who was beaten to death . Witnesses said two policeman attacked him and killed him . And this was really the virtual meeting point for pro-democracy , anti- regime protestors in Egypt . Twitter and Facebook was also used in Tunisia . And Wael Ghonim , the Google executive who was detained for 12 days said , look to Facebook for where the next revolution will take place . Lawrence Pintak is in Seattle -- I believe you are ? He 's the author of `` The New Arab Journalist : Mission and Identity in a Time of Turmoil . '' Lawrence , really , Facebook is one of the characters in all of this in the way this drama , this revolution , has played out . LAWRENCE PINTAK , AUTHOR : Absolutely . And Hala , you said earlier , an 18-day revolution and you 're absolutely right . But the reality is that these digital activists have been at work for years . There was a strike a couple of years ago that was literally organized off a Facebook page . The Egyptian bloggers had been using YouTube and Twitter to uncover torture and various other governmental malfeasance . So , this has been a revolution , a digital revolution , in the making for quite a while . GORANI : What 's interesting is you mentioned quite a while . Over the years , I 've covered in the Middle East some of these bloggers that have been harassed and intimidated by secret police for posting videos online of alleged police torture , and that kind of thing , especially in Egypt . Really , taking huge personal risks in doing so . And I found it interesting that we should all look to social media to see where the next revolution will take place . What did you make of what Wael Ghonim said ? PINTAK : Well , I think he 's absolutely right . I think social media is a critical tool , organizing tool , for the activists . But we also have to remember a place like Egypt only has about 20 percent Internet penetration . So , this is an important tool for the activists to network . But when the Internet was cut , when SNS was cut , phones were cut , people still turned out in the street because that 's the power of television . The two of these things combined really is a perfect storm . Well , jokes are being exchanged now , the mood is a little lighter . One of those tweeters has 30,000 , 40,000 followers , not exactly sure . But so many people follow him . A joke he 's sharing , `` After victory Friday in Tunisia and liberation Friday in Egypt , Gaddafi has decided to abolish all Fridays .

In the West , little is known about him , or how he intends to lead the Egyptian military , now that it 's in charge of the government . Former U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen knows Tantawi and worked with him at the Pentagon . He told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer that `` the question is whether he will continue to be the head of the military , as such , or whether that will pass on to a younger generation . '' Tantawi , who holds the title `` field marshal , '' received his first military commission in 1956 , He was born on October 31 , 1935 , and fought in Egypt 's 1956 war against Britain , France and Israel . He also served during Egypt 's conflicts with Israel in 1967 and 1973 . Tantawi was only recently made deputy prime minister . Former President Hosni Mubarak appointed him to the position during the early days of the protest movement that eventually forced Mubarak from power . Since 1991 , Tantawi has held the position of defense minister , wielding near-exclusive decision-making power within the ministry . However , during that time , `` the tactical and operational readiness of the Egyptian Armed Forces has degraded , '' according to globalsecurity.org , a military analysis group . Protester ` not that worried ' about army U.S. Embassy cables released by WikiLeaks contain multiple references to Tantawi , his relationship with Mubarak and they way he is viewed by other Egyptian military officials . Another quoted an unnamed Egyptian officer , who joked that Tantawi `` looks like a bureaucrat . '' That cable went on to say he is openly mocked at clubs in Cairo where midlevel officers gather . The cable claimed these officers mock him openly as `` incompetent '' and as `` Mubarak 's poodle . '' The officers also say that Tantawi 's unwavering loyalty to Mubarak is `` running the military into the ground , '' according to the cable . Most significant for the hopes of democratic-reform advocates in Egypt , the cables say that Tantawi has always supported the centralization of power in Egypt . One cable says he has become `` increasingly intolerant of intellectual freedom . '' Another goes into greater detail on his position . `` Tantawi has opposed both economic and political reforms that he perceives as eroding central government power , '' according to the cable . `` He is supremely concerned with national unity , and has opposed policy initiatives he views as encouraging political or religious cleavages with Egyptian society . '' He has revealed a willingness to use the military to control political groups like the Muslim Brotherhood , the cables say , and opposes economic reform because it reduces the Egyptian government 's control over prices and production . That cable 's final assessment of Tantawi warned diplomats to `` be prepared to meet an aged and change-resistant Tantawi . ... He and Mubarak are focused on regime stability and maintaining the status quo through the end of their time . They simply do not have the energy , inclination or world view to do anything differently .

Ron Paul says of Mubarak Obama says the `` transition must bring all of Egypt 's voices to the table '' Cairo , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stepped down Friday and handed over power to the military , his nearly three decades of iron rule ended by a groundswell of popular protests that began January 25 . In a somber , one-minute announcement on state television , Vice President Omar Suleiman announced Mubarak 's resignation and said the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces will `` run the affairs of the country . '' As Suleiman spoke , deafening cheers erupted among tens of thousands of Egyptians who thronged the streets of Cairo . It was a moment they had sought throughout long , often tense days of demonstrations -- some of them violent -- that demanded Mubarak 's departure . It was a moment that many in the Arab world 's powerhouse nation had not dared contemplate . Chants of `` Egypt is free ! '' and `` God is great ! '' rose from the crowds , dizzy in the honeymoon of their success . Some waved Egyptian flags ; others honked horns ; still others set off fireworks as they savored the scene . Two major bridges over the Nile River resembled congested parking lots , and partiers packed streets throughout Cairo . The state-run Middle East News Agency said some people had passed out from joy and others had suffered heart attacks . `` It was a sense of liberation for me , for every Egyptian , '' said opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei . `` For the first time , Egypt has a chance to be democratic , to be free , to have a sense of dignity , of freedom . So it 's amazing . It 's just like something we never experienced in our lifetime . '' A source with close connections to Persian Gulf government leaders said Mubarak , 82 , had fled to the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh , his presidency finished as abruptly as it had started in 1981 , when he ascended to power after the assassination of Anwar Sadat . The repercussions echoed far beyond Tahrir Square as the Swiss government moved Friday to freeze assets belonging to Mubarak and his family , said Norbert Baerlocher , a spokesman for the Swiss Embassy in Washington . Obama : ` Egypt will never be the same ' Woolsey : Next step marks Egypt 's fate Ghonim : Facebook to thank for freedom In a speech to the nation Thursday night , Mubarak had indicated that he was delegating authority to Suleiman but made no mention of resigning . Disappointed crowds calling for his ouster grew in number Friday in Cairo and in other major cities . By Friday night , the protesters got what they were seeking . But amid the euphoria , ElBaradei sounded a note of caution . `` We have challenges ahead of us , '' said the Nobel laureate , who some believe could emerge as Egypt 's next leader . `` I think we need to not worry about retribution . Mubarak needs to go , and we need to look forward . '' Amre Moussa , the Egyptian secretary-general of the Arab League , told CNN that the country should focus on instituting reforms and establishing democracy . Asked how long it would take for the government to lift the 30-year-old state-of-emergency laws , he said , `` The sooner the better ... six , seven months . '' Asked whether he will run for office , Moussa demurred . `` That is not an issue to discuss today , '' he said . `` The time for such a question will come . '' Gallery : Protesters celebrate Mubarak 's resignation Wael Ghonim , the Egyptian activist who became a reluctant hero of the revolution but has made clear that he has no interest in becoming a political leader , predicted that history books would describe Mubarak as a dictator . Ghonim -- a Google executive on leave from his job whose Facebook page is credited with triggering the uprising -- was seized by security forces and held for 10 days . His powerful television interview after his release Monday galvanized the protesters in Tahrir Square . He said he had felt certain that Mubarak would be forced out after a revolt in Tunisia forced that country 's leader to step down in January , and he said he believed the Egyptian military could be trusted to respect the demands of the protesters . Many protesters had been calling for Egypt 's army , which is respected within the country , to take over as interim caretaker . Friday night , they voiced optimism that the military would pave the way for free and fair elections . Throughout the uprising , the military both responded to the protesters and defended Mubarak 's regime . It showed signs Thursday that it was assuming a greater role when the supreme council met without Mubarak , who was then still the supreme commander of the armed forces . Friday , it issued a communique stating that Egypt 's emergency laws , used by Mubarak throughout his tenure as president to rule with an iron hand , would be lifted , but only when conditions allowed . After Mubarak stepped down , a military spokesman appeared on state television , expressing appreciation to the former president and saluting the `` martyrs , '' an apparent reference to those who died in the protests . Human Rights Watch has documented more than 300 deaths since the uprising began January 25 . Many of the pitched battles between security forces and Mubarak 's foes unfolded in the same places that were scenes of jubilation Friday night . But Friday 's revelry could not push aside the looming uncertainty over what will come next in the Arab world 's most populous nation and how Egypt 's revolution , which succeeded on the 32nd anniversary of Iran 's , might affect the region . Events in Egypt may extendfar beyond the country 's borders , Moussa said . `` Winds of change are sweeping the Arab world and the Middle East , '' he said . In Washington , U.S. President Barack Obama said the people of this key U.S. ally have made it clear that `` nothing less than genuine democracy will carry the day . '' He praised the Egyptian military for acting responsibly and said it now needs to help ensure a credible transition . Among other things , Egyptian authorities need to set about `` protecting the rights of Egypt 's citizens , lifting the emergency law , revising the constitution and other laws to make this change irreversible , and laying out a clear path to elections that are fair and free , '' Obama said . But two miles from the White House , at a meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference , Rep. Ron Paul , R-Texas , said that the United States had invested billions of dollars over the years `` propping up that dictator '' and has little to show for it . `` Where do you think the money went ? To a Swiss bank account , '' he said . `` It contributed to our debt , billions and billions of dollars , and all we get is chaos from it and instability . '' A spokesman for Obama 's predecessor said Friday that former President George W. Bush `` congratulates the people of Egypt for taking an important and impressive first step toward freedom . '' But the U.S. government 's applause for Egypt 's step toward freedom and away from Mubarak differed markedly from its previous stance . At a joint news conference with Mubarak in April 2004 at Bush 's ranch in Crawford , Texas , he offered support for his Egyptian counterpart . `` Egypt is a strategic partner of the United States , and we value President Mubarak 's years of effort on behalf of the peace and stability of the Middle East , '' Bush said . `` President Mubarak can be confident in my friendship and America 's partnership as he moves forward to realize the hopes of his people . '' Just where those hopes would lead was not clear in the heady hours after Mubarak 's resignation . What was clear was that Mubarak 's imposition of military rule broke with Egypt 's 1971 constitution . The constitution allows for only two scenarios for a president to relinquish power . The first stipulates that if the president has to step aside temporarily , the vice president steps into the top role . That is what the regime briefly orchestrated Thursday . The constitution states further that , if the office of the president is vacated or the president becomes permanently disabled , the parliamentary speaker is to assume the role until new elections can be held . Those elections , in turn , must occur within 60 days . In opting for a third way , which put all power in the hands of the military , the regime in effect rendered the constitution inoperable . A high-ranking Egyptian military official said the army 's command was discussing whether to dismiss Mubarak 's government and parliament and when the next election would be held . But some analysts were sounding the alarm over the takeover by the military , which has suddenly become accountable for the nation . `` Suleiman 's statement is the clearest indication thus far that the military has carried out a coup led by Defense Minister Field Marshal Mohammed Hussein Tantawi , '' analysts with Stratfor , a global intelligence company , said in a statement . `` Egypt is returning to the 1952 model of ruling the state via a council of army officers , '' the statement said . `` The question now is to what extent the military elite will share power with its civilian counterparts . '' Amnesty International warned that Mubarak 's departure did not mean an end to the police state . `` The repressive system that Egyptians have suffered under for three decades has not gone away and the state of emergency remains in place , '' said Salil Shetty , Amnesty International 's secretary general . `` Those in power must grasp this opportunity to consign the systematic abuses of the past to history . Human rights reform must begin now . '' CNN 's Amir Ahmed , Nic Robertson , Kurt Muller and Caroline Faraj contributed to this report .

Mubarak `` is gambling with his country '' in order to stay at the helm , ElBaradei told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer . He reiterated the message of his Twitter account , which read , `` Egypt will explode . Army must save the country now . '' Major clashes between the people and the army , which Egyptians traditionally believe has been on their side , would be devastating , said ElBaradei , a Nobel Peace Prize winner and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency . Hosni Mubarak : I am not leaving Egypt Official : Mubarak to yield power to VP ElBaradei 's outlook had changed since hours before , when Egyptians , including thousands packed in Cairo 's Tahrir Square , expected Mubarak to step down rather than delegate powers to Vice President Omar Suleiman . The arrangement failed to mollify opposition leaders or those who have rallied in Tahrir Square for more than two weeks . Another mass protest is planned again Friday after prayer services . `` Mubarak is only one part of this regime , '' human rights activist Gigi Ibrahim , one of the Tahrir Square protesters , told CNN . `` People have been here for 17 days , and they are not for Suleiman , either , '' Ibrahim said . `` Mubarak has lost all legitimacy , and now him handing over the power to the vice president is as illegitimate as Mubarak being in power . '' ElBaradei told CNN that Egyptians will not accept the new arrangement . `` Suleiman is considered to be an extension of Mubarak . Neither of them is acceptable to the people , '' he said . `` For the sake of their country , they should go . '' ElBaradei said a leadership council and a caretaker government should rule the North African nation for one year during a transition to a more democratic process . Mubarak 's defiant remarks about foreign intervention , and his determination to see the transition through , was not what most in the Tahrir Square crowd wanted to hear . many chanted as he spoke . After the speech , parliamentary speaker Ahmed Fathi Srour told state-run Nile TV that Mubarak 's move had put the authority for the day-to-day running of the government in Suleiman 's hands . The vice president referred to the past two weeks as the `` revolution of the young people . '' Suleiman told the protesters to go home and back to work . That had not happened by early Friday .

They asked the armed forces to intervene and shouted that `` the military must step in to get Mubarak out , '' Fathi said . Khalid Abdalla , a demonstrator in Tahrir Square and star of the motion picture `` The Kite Runner , '' said early Friday that it 's `` an incredibly sad moment right now . '' `` Everyone 's lost , '' the actor said . `` People are trying to work out what more they can do . '' Egyptian journalist , writer and blogger Ethar El-Katatney , appearing on CNN 's `` Parker Spitzer '' Thursday night , likened Mubarak 's speech to American television 's `` Father Knows Best . '' His earlier speech announcing he would step down in September had gained him some empathy , she said . El-Katatney said she was worried that Friday could be `` bloody '' because of the people 's frustration . Nobel laureate Ahmed Zewail , a potential Egyptian presidential candidate , said he sees `` several different scenarios '' through which a transition could take place . `` The important thing is that the army will protect this transition until a new Constitution is in place , '' Zewail told CNN before the Mubarak speech . `` I am very much appreciative of the fact that armed forces are controlling what 's going on . '' Freed cyberactivist Wael Ghonim , who emerged as a reluctant hero of Egypt 's uprising , had seemed pleased with just the prospect of Mubarak leaving office . He is on leave from his marketing job with the search engine Google in Dubai and was held for 10 days during the protests . `` Revolution 2.0 : Mission Accomplished , '' Ghonim wrote on his Twitter account earlier Thursday , before Mubarak 's speech .

Co-authors : Washington paid little heed to rising level of anger in Egypt They say American support for President Hosni Mubarak regime was a mistake Now U.S. has to choose between regime and protesters , they say Authors : Standing on side of the protesters would affirm U.S. ideal of freedom Editor 's note : Cynthia P. Schneider , a former U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands , is a distinguished professor at Georgetown University , a senior non-resident fellow at the Brookings Institution , and co-director of the MOST Resource Center , which provides information about Muslims to the American film and television industry . Nadia Oweidat is a Ph. . D student at Oxford University and a former research associate at the RAND Corp. -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The only surprise about the Egyptian revolution is that it took so long . Demonstrations have been increasing in the past few years , despite the brutality of the regime , and with them deep distrust and hatred for President Hosni Mubarak and his government . The Egyptian regime , as well as Washington , underestimated the impact of events such as the murder of the young businessman Khaled Sa'id , who was pulled out of a caf in Alexandria in June 2010 , beaten by the police , and then left dead on the street . If they had visited the Arabic Facebook page started by Wael Ghonim , `` We Are All Kaled Sa'id , '' they might have realized that it was only a matter of when , and not if , the uprising would begin . The profound discontent , frustration and humiliation of the Egyptian people also resonates in recent literature and films , such as `` The Yacoubian Building '' by Alaa al Aswany . Chronicling the corruption , unemployment and poverty that plagues Egyptian society , the film was a candidate for an Academy Award in 2008 . For years blogs -- in English and in Arabic -- have decried the abuses of the government , and the hopelessness of life in Egypt for even well educated youth . On a trip to Egypt last summer , we were shocked by the potency of hatred for the Egyptian president . On a trip to Egypt last summer , we were shocked by the potency of hatred for the Egyptian president . After cussing Mubarak throughout the ride , a taxi driver broke into tears saying that his children had not eaten any meat for months . That he was willing to run the risks inherent in openly criticizing the president shows how desperately he felt . Now , thanks to the youth who incited the protests , `` the jewel of the Middle East , '' has been unleashed after years of suppression under Mubarak . `` We 'd rather die with pride than live without it '' proclaims a poster in Tahrir Square . But through the prism of government and politics , Egypt looked stable -- if repressive . Internationally , it has continued for the past thirty years as a force for peace in the Middle East and a buffer for Israel . These priorities , and the misguided belief that supporting Mubarak 's harsh regime represented America 's security interests , appear to be guiding the U.S. response to the protests . Will the United States end up on the right side of history ? Blindsided by the onset of the revolution , Washington continues to underestimate the intelligence of the Egyptian people , their resolve to end tyranny , and their determination to accept nothing less than democracy . To that end , the protesters have endured more than two weeks of regime brutality , hundreds of deaths at the hands of pro-Mubarak snipers and police -LRB- our sources in Egypt estimate at least 500 deaths , but the precise number can not be determined because hospitals are forbidden to give out names of the wounded and dead -RRB- , as well as severely limited food and medical supplies . President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have attempted to walk a tightrope of supporting the democratic aspirations of the protesters and criticizing the regime 's violent tactics , while also calling for `` stability '' and a `` gradual transition . '' Their mixed messages , calling for Mubarak to `` leave now '' and then backing his close confidant and former head of Intelligence Omar Suleiman to lead the transition , reflect the challenging complexity of the situation , but also they have caused confusion and disappointment for those on the ground in Egypt and their supporters around the world . American authorities further impair their credibility when they refer to the `` negotiations '' with Suleiman . These `` talks with the opposition '' have no legitimacy with the millions of protesters who are following the young leaders . Neither Mohammed El Baradei nor the youth leaders have participated . Indeed , the leaders of the revolution have declared repeatedly that they will not negotiate until Mubarak leaves , and , even then , not with members of his regime . The Muslim Brotherhood , who did participate in the talks initially encouraged by the U.S. , has been widely discredited among the protesters for speaking to Suleiman . In between fielding calls from American officials , Suleiman and Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq have been appearing on Egyptian State TV to discredit the protesters , insisting they represent `` foreign interests '' identified variously as American intelligence , Israel , and Hamas -LRB- an odd combination made even odder because Hamas has not permitted demonstrations against Mubarak , at least until recent days -RRB- . This tactic has backfired . The proud and nationalistic Egyptians have been incensed by this accusation from a regime that has increased its own riches while dragging the country into poverty . In his moving interview after having been released from prison , the emerging leader Wael Ghonim stated tearfully that what hurt him the most was being accused in prison of being paid by foreigners to protest . As a Google executive living in comfort in Dubai , Ghonim did not need money ; but rather , he freely chose to travel to Egypt to participate in the demonstrations . `` How dare anyone doubt my love for Egypt ? '' An Arabic Facebook page entitled , `` I delegate Wael to lead on my behalf '' has already accumulated almost 300,000 `` likes , '' and the number is increasing by the minute . Will the United States end up on the right side of history ? No one can deny that history is being made in Egypt , nor can anyone predict how this uprising of rich and poor , Muslim and Christian , will end . While many maintain that the United States must choose between its security interests -- stability in Egypt and the region and its ideals of freedom , democracy , and self-determination called for by the protesters -- we think this is a false dichotomy . It is in the United States ' long-term security interest to align itself firmly and unequivocally with the protesters . It is time to `` walk the walk '' of Obama 's Cairo speech of June 2009 : `` All people yearn for certain things : the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed ; confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice ; government that is transparent and does n't steal from the people ; the freedom to live as you choose . Those are not just American ideas , they are human rights , and that is why we will support them everywhere . '' The cost of not redeeming the promise of Obama 's stirring words will be every bit as high as the risk of uncertainty of the future of the people 's revolution in Egypt . The United States surely will not determine the outcome of the January 25 uprising . But if America is standing on the sidelines , anxious about upsetting other dictator allies , and not firmly backing the voices of freedom and self-determination , it will have lost its credibility , and its `` soft power '' to persuade and influence . There will be no more Cairo speeches ; no one will listen . No one is better equipped than the United States to assist the new Egypt in building democratic institutions , but will the protest leaders turn to the government that backed Omar Suleiman as the transition leader ? It is time to change the script , and to act on behalf of the United States ' true security interests by supporting human rights in Egypt , and the brave Egyptians fighting for them .

Celebrations in Egypt coincided with the 32nd anniversary of the Islamic revolution in Iran . But experts ask whether it will allow democratic change White House says Iranian government afraid of any challenges -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In a few breathtaking weeks , the winds of change whipped from Tunisia east to Egypt and Jordan , bringing down two regimes and putting the third on notice that it must make democratic changes . Now analysts , and a world suddenly focused on the region , are wondering whether those winds will continue blowing east into Iran and bring real democratic change or , instead , amount to only a whisper . A year and a half after the Iranian regime brutally suppressed the so-called Green Movement , a new test of its openness to reform and patience may come Monday . The government -- which Friday said the toppling of President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt `` joyfully '' coincided with the anniversary of Iran 's 1979 Islamic Revolution -- has rounded up activists after Iran 's two leading opposition figures called for a rally Monday in support of the uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East . From all appearances , the regime is not about to loosen its grip . And , unlike Mubarak , it wo n't be caught off-guard by the zeal of protesters . Danger of chaos in Egypt ? Zakaria : Egypt events have ` huge impact ' Obama : ` Egypt will never be the same ' The Obama White House and some observers say Iran may not be as confident as it appears about demonstrations . `` They are scared , '' press secretary Robert Gibbs said Friday hours after Mubarak stepped down . `` That 's why they threatened to kill anybody that tries to do this . That 's why they have shut off all measure of communication . '' Iranian authorities on Wednesday warned against any attempt by the opposition movement to hold the rally , according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency . It was unclear whether people will take to the streets , anyway . `` We definitely see them as enemies of the revolution and spies , and we will confront them with force , '' Revolutionary Guard Cmdr. Hossein Hamedani told IRNA . The Iranian regime on Friday celebrated the 1979 revolution that dethroned the shah . Opposition leaders Mehdi Karroubi and Mir Hossein Moussavi asked that the rally take place in Tehran 's Azadi Square , the site of mass protests by Iran 's opposition movement after the disputed 2009 presidential elections . The International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran , based in the United States , called Friday for an end to restrictions on the movements of Karroubi and Moussavi . `` The -LRB- Iranian -RRB- government is doing all it can to intimidate Iranians and deny their right to peaceful assembly , '' the U.S.-based group said in a statement . `` With recent events in Egypt , we see another round of repression in Iran aimed at silencing a people frustrated and dissatisfied by the denial of their human rights . '' Observers point to an interesting synergy between protests in Iran and Egypt . They are waiting to see if what 's transpired in Egypt will ignite a substantial renewal of protests in Iran . `` I think that 's a very substantial possibility , '' Joshua Muravchik , a fellow at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies , told CNN Friday . `` I think that the Green Movement in part inspired what has happened in Egypt . Obviously , Tunisia is the most recent inspiration . '' `` In June 2009 , when the Green Movement emerged , the internet was full of chatter by Egyptians sort of beating their breast saying , ` Why are we so lame ? Look at that : a million Iranians out on the street standing up to their government . Why ca n't we do that ? ' '' `` And that sort of stuck with them -LRB- Egyptians -RRB- , I believe , '' said Muravchik . `` They kept having these small demonstrations and somehow it finally started to gather momentum and the snowball turned quickly into an avalanche . '' `` There 's no guarantee though that it will work in the reverse direction , '' he said , referring to Iran . The disputed 2009 presidential election sparked widespread outrage within the Islamic republic , thrusting the depths of Iranian society into the global spotlight and inciting violence that had n't been seen in decades . Iran quelled the demonstrations with a brutal crackdown against the peaceful street protests and the arrests of hundreds of activists , reformists and opposition figures . A diverse opposition movement -- headed by reform candidates Moussavi and Karroubi -- grew into today 's Green Movement , protesting for social justice , freedom and democracy . Experts interviewed by CNN said they believe Jordan , Bahrain and Yemen will likely see significant democratic changes before Iran , and each face different circumstances . The United States on Friday slammed Iran 's `` hypocrisy '' for arresting opposition figures and the blocking of world media outlets and websites . `` For all of its empty talk about Egypt , the government of Iran should allow the Iranian people the same universal right to peacefully assemble , demonstrate and communicate in Tehran that the people are exercising in Cairo , '' National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said . Iranian leaders praised the Egyptian and Tunisian uprisings and said they were reminiscent of the 1979 Iranian revolution that toppled the shah and ushered in a hard-line and theocratic Islamic republic . Abbas Milani , director of Iranian Studies at Stanford University , said the Middle East is at a `` crucial tipping point . '' If democratic voices and a government prevail in Egypt , he told CNN , Iran will feel an uptick in internal pressure to reform . But , he and others said , there is a singular difference between Egypt and Iran . The Egyptian military , while key to power in the country , did not clash with its citizens . Iran 's Revolutionary Guard Corps -LRB- IRGC -RRB- was established after the Islamic Revolution to defend the regime against all threats . The IRGC and its `` thugs '' have repressed Iranians , Milani said . The Iranian military is not as well equipped and as politically oriented as the IRGC and played little , if any , part in the 2009 crackdown . `` I think they knew the military could not be depended upon '' because they might side with protesters , Milani said of the Iranian government . The IRGC has `` expanded far beyond its original mandate , '' according to the Council on Foreign Relations , a U.S. foreign policy research center . `` Today the guard has evolved into a socio-military-political-economic force with influence reaching deep into Iran 's power structure , '' the CFR says , noting that several current and former IRGC members have been appointed to positions as ambassadors , mayors , undersecretaries , provincial governors and cabinet ministers . Mohamad Bazzi , adjunct senior fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations , said the IRGC will stand behind President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who helped consolidate their influence . And Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has shown no signs of abandoning Ahmadinejad , Bazzi said . Milani does n't expect the Iranian regime to allow large protests , but he believes `` major changes '' and an `` unstoppable democratic wind '' eventually will come to the republic . Iran also must address significant economic problems , he added . `` The Iranian society has profoundly changed , `` he said . `` The regime has not . '' Ali Alfoneh , a resident fellow at the conservative but non-partisan American Enterprise Institute , said he does n't expect to see major reforms in Iran , at least in the short term , but he believes dissidents were heartened by the Egyptian revolution . `` The Green Movement was almost dead and it has become energized , '' he told CNN Friday . Gallery : Protesters celebrate Mubarak 's resignation Woolsey : Next step marks Egypt 's fate Ghonim : Facebook to thank for freedom `` Revolutions take defections , '' Alfoneh said . Rapid changes in Egypt and the region make it difficult to predict what might happen in Iran , Bazzi said . `` Surviving the last round -LRB- of protests -RRB- strengthened the regime 's hand , '' he said . The suppression `` put fear in the protesters , '' he said . To succeed , the Green Movement will have to reach out to opponents and `` to the millions who are silent , '' said Bazzi , a member of the faculty at New York University . Real change may not occur until the next presidential election , he said . Still , the Iranian regime is probably somewhat concerned after what happened in Egypt . `` They are crushing anything that moves , '' Bazzi said . Isobel Coleman , a senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the Council for Foreign Relations , said one big difference between Iran and Egypt are their economies . Iran has a lot of oil , and it can afford to be `` more reactionary and revolutionary . '' Meanwhile , the Obama administration will continue to pressure Iran over its nuclear program , human rights and influence with militant organizations that threaten Israel , among other governments . Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin on Friday questioned the White House 's handling of Iran . `` Media : ask `` Will Obama Admin exert as much ` constructive ' pressure on Iranian govt to change & allow freedom -- as they just did for Egypt ? , '' she wrote on her Twitter account . As the world turns its attention to Iran , especially in the coming days , questions remain on whether governments can change and still hold on to power . `` The experience of the last days shows it is almost impossible to ask for democracy and not ask for a regime change , '' he said . CNN 's Joe Sterling , Samira Simone , Sarah Aarthun and Reza Sayah contributed to this report .

Analysts offer their views on the fallout of Hosni Mubarak 's speech to Egyptians Ellis Goldberg : Mubarak 's words wo n't work ; protests will only grow Lawrence Pintak : Mubarak , Suleiman are tone-deaf to the roar of the crowd Bruce Rutherford : Military 's assent in reform , particularly economic reform , is key -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The high expectations of protesters in Tahrir Square turned to fury Thursday after Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak delivered a speech in which he made no mention of leaving office before his term ends in September . Crowds had swarmed the square for hours as speculation grew that Mubarak was stepping aside after 30 years in power . They heard instead from the president that he was `` delegating power '' to Vice President Omar Suleiman . Now the focus shifts to Friday , one of two regular protest days -LRB- the other is Tuesday -RRB- on the demonstrators ' weekly schedule . Analysts offer their views on what comes next for Mubarak , the movement and the world . Shadi Hamid , director of research at the Brookings Doha Center and a fellow at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution : The standoff in Egypt is now likely to heighten , with risk of significant escalation . The Egyptian regime had its chance to heed protesters ' demands and initiate a real `` transition . '' But President Mubarak is not one to go off scurrying into the night . It was a speech both defiant and patronizing . Remarkably , Mubarak managed to say all the wrong things at precisely the wrong time . The feelings of jubilation , much in evidence yesterday , have turned once again to anger . Egypt is consumed by uncertainty and confusion . There is a sense in the streets here that today could prove decisive . But that 's what protesters said about previous `` days of rage , '' each of which re-confirmed the strength of this protest movement but failed to deliver a decisive blow to a stubborn president . The military will come under growing pressure to choose between the regime it has long supported and the hundreds of thousands of Egyptians who are demanding genuine change . It is a difficult choice , but one it may very soon be forced to make . Otherwise , Egypt is likely to settle into a dangerous pattern : continuous civil conflict with no resolution in sight . Ellis Goldberg , professor of political science at the University of Washington and visiting professor of political science at the American University in Cairo : As with most of Mubarak 's speeches since the political crisis began , this one was a mix of pathos , defiance and threat . He asserted that the committee he appointed to propose constitutional reform will have only limited scope and will be able to make it possible to end the state of emergency . He did not offer to end it himself . He rejected any far-reaching reform , such as his own departure , as foreign-inspired . Ten days ago , Mubarak 's proposals might have worked . No longer : None of the protesters trusts the president or any of his associates . Besides his remaining in power , he also made it clear that there would be no change in the overall system over which he has presided -- no change in government regulation of political parties , no changes to enhance the independence of the judiciary and no changes in the power of the office of president . Anger at Mubarak is deepening and widening . Workers , including 24,000 at a large factory in the industrial belt of the Delta , are going on strike . Leading professional figures openly oppose the government . One prominent judge has argued that the constitution need not be amended but can be rewritten in Tahrir Square . Protesters react to Mubarak speech What Mubarak is telling Egyptians Ambassador : Mubarak no longer has power ElBaradei : Army must save Egypt Mubarak did clearly say one true thing in his speech : The people of Egypt are in a ditch . They agree , but they see him as the person who put them there and has prevented them from getting out . On Friday , even larger protests will happen , and at some point , then or soon after , the army will have to decide how this all ends . Either it will let the protesters overwhelm key locations of authority , or it will use force to prevent it . Friday promises to be yet another big day in Cairo . This was the voice of old-school authoritarianism . It is the classic response of Arab leaders when faced with an internal threat . They raise the specter of foreign interference , they label attacks on the regime as attacks on the people , they identify with the pain of the `` masses , '' and they position themselves as the ultimate defenders of the nation 's glory . These are two men tone-deaf to the roar of the crowd . Both of these speeches were thick with the language and cadence of the paternalistic past . As one Egyptian tweeted moments after Mubarak 's speech , `` Father knows best . '' The Egyptian president cloaked himself in the robes of the pharaohs , to which he is so often likened by his critics , invoking Egypt 's 7,000-year history and insisting that he `` will not accept or listen to any foreign interventions or dictations . '' Picking up on the same theme , Suleiman lectured `` the young people , heroes of Egypt , '' telling them to return home . `` Do not listen to the satellite stations that have no objective but to weaken Egypt and mar its image , '' he said . `` It is not about me , '' Mubarak said . And chants of `` leave , leave , leave ! '' that erupted from the protesters in Tahrir the moment they realized he was not stepping down made that clear . The idea that he is ceding some unspecified powers to Suleiman will simply not cut it with the masses on the streets . The future of Egypt now lies with the Army . The generals must now be weighing where their own long-term interests lie . With more mass protests planned for tomorrow , the choice is clear : Turn on the people or tell the old man it is time to go . Marina Ottaway , director of the Middle East program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace : Mubarak 's defiant Thursday speech has done nothing to prolong his tenure in power . On the contrary , it has made protesters even more determined to oust him , greatly decreased the already slim probability that Suleiman will be an acceptable interlocutor to members of the opposition and increased the probability of a military takeover . A tumultuous day in Egypt Cairo protesters on the move Obama reacts to Mubarak 's speech Suleiman 's brief speech after Mubarak 's address , in which he encouraged the protesters to go home and go back to work , was equally out of touch with the mood in the country . Delivered while growing crowds of demonstrators in Cairo and Alexandria kept up the chant of `` go , go '' that had started as soon as it became clear Mubarak was not going to resign , the exhortation for calm was futile at best . Demonstrations on Friday will be huge as a result and will not abate in the following days . Suleiman is unlikely to find participants for continuing dialogue among members of the opposition . At this point , the army appears to be the only organization that can break the impasse . Thursday morning , the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces , meeting without Mubarak , issued Communiqu Number One , pledging to continue searching for `` possible actions and measures to safeguard the aspirations of the Egyptian people . '' Stay tuned for Communiqu Number Two . As the maneuvering in Cairo continues , it is increasingly clear that the military will play a broad role in any process of transition -- much more than just maintaining security . It is also expected to oversee the opening of the political system and the restructuring of the economy . However , there is no evidence that the military supports democracy or even considers it a good idea . Indeed , much of the political elite , of which the officer corps is a part , is skeptical of the desirability of open political competition . They fear that it might be exploited by charismatic populist leaders -- particularly Islamists . A key question going forward is whether the military will allow free and fair elections that include peaceful Islamic groups . If it does not , the legitimacy of a democratic transition will be seriously undermined . The military may also be an ambivalent supporter of economic reform . It has huge economic interests that include vast swaths of land and factories that produce everything from bread to refrigerators . Any serious effort at economic reform must reduce the military 's role in the civilian economy . Will the generals allow this restructuring to go forward , even when it challenges their economic interests ? Isobel Coleman , author of '' Paradise Beneath Her Feet '' and a senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York : Thursday began as a day of great anticipation for Egyptians . The army heightened expectations by announcing that the protestors ' demands would be met . Egyptian activist Wael Ghonim galvanized the crowds by tweeting `` mission accomplished '' to his followers . A mood of euphoria spread among the growing crowd in Tahrir Square over the notion that Mubarak would step down . That mood quickly turned ugly as his televised comments made clear he was digging in his heels , reiterating that he would die on Egypt 's soil . Again , Mubarak defied those who call for his departure . Even had Mubarak stepped down on Thursday , it would have met only the first of the protesters ' demands . They seek the removal of the entire regime and wholesale constitutional change . Meanwhile , the regime continues to try to spin the story . In his address , Mubarak appealed to the people , saying that the blood of martyrs would not be wasted and that he would not bow to foreign intervention . Suleiman echoed him , calling for unity and an end to chaos and rejecting the messages on satellite television -- in other words , go home and be quiet . Thursday proved yet again that we should expect the unexpected . But it is also clear that the protesters are not going to heed Suleiman 's words any time soon . Kenneth Roth , executive director of Human Rights Watch : Pro-democracy protesters have every reason to distrust Mubarak , whose strategy has been to stall long enough to orchestrate a controlled transition in which the dictator may change but the dictatorship remains intact . His aloof , out-of-touch speech did nothing to suggest a change of heart . Whoever remains atop the Egyptian government , concrete steps are needed immediately to lay the groundwork for free , competitive elections . The stalling tactics must end . Rather than claim that Egyptians are `` not ready '' for democracy -- Suleiman 's line -- the government should urgently lift the decades-old state of emergency and repeal laws that give the Interior Ministry broad powers to arrest and detain persons and limit the rights to freedom of speech , association and peaceful assembly . By the same token , the attacks on demonstrators that have been sponsored and tolerated by the government must end , as should the ongoing detentions , mistreatment and torture , with serious abuses investigated and prosecuted . To make elections meaningful , a committee that is genuinely independent of the government -- not Mubarak 's hand-picked cronies -- should be given authority to make the necessary legal and constitutional changes , to register political parties and to ensure that the basic freedoms of all competitors are respected . Only these broad changes , enacted now , will ensure a genuine democratic transition , not just a new dictatorship . After decades of backing Mubarak , the United States and European Union governments should finally put the wishes of the Egyptian people first and use the considerable leverage provided by their massive aid to insist on these changes immediately . Mubarak 's delusional efforts to reduce the democracy movement to foreign pressure show that he is feeling the heat . Now is the time to turn up the temperature . After Mubarak 's disappointingly tone-deaf speech to the people of Egypt on Thursday evening , events there could swell in a more outraged direction . Still , we must not lose sight of the longer-term dynamic for which we need to be prepared . America needs to radically rethink its Egypt strategy . Remember that no matter who the civilian leader of Egypt is , its military -- America 's putative ally and client -- is still the most powerful institution behind the scenes . Even so , this is the time for the U.S. to reach out and establish working relationships across the spectrum of Egyptian politics . Only by playing all sides -- even working with the Muslim Brotherhood -- can the U.S. be assured that it is not caught off-guard without any connections or leverage with whomever prevails in future Egyptian elections . People power is a lot more complicated than having one `` son of a bitch '' who answers the West 's calls , but that 's the price of democracy . It 's not enough that the next president of Egypt not be Mubarak or Suleiman . It 's far more important that the next president -- and every president thereafter -- not be a military strongman or authoritarian despot . This can happen only through genuine constitutional reform . What so often holds back political progress -- for example , in countries like Ukraine -- is that the constitution is a chessboard on which the same few players constantly shift the rules to make sure that their portfolio reigns . Indeed , Mubarak has at most partially transferred some authority to the vice president , but power still resides with him and the military . Instead , Egypt 's constitutional system must be converted from a president republic to a parliamentary democracy . This means the power must rest with a prime minister and with several independent political parties below . For all the gridlock of parliamentary systems , we should still prefer that Egypt look like more like Italy than Algeria .

Those are the right to dismiss parliament , to request constitutional amendments and to alter the structure of the government . Egypt 's ambassador to the United States , Sameh Shoukry , told CNN that while Mubarak was by law still the president , Suleiman was now `` the de facto president .

'' Sentencing in Chandra Levy case -- Prosecutors say the man who killed intern Chandra Levy should spend the rest of his life in prison . Ingmar Guandique , an illegal immigrant from El Salvador , is scheduled to be sentenced in D.C. Superior Court . He faces a minimum of 30 years in prison and a maximum sentence of life . Levy , a 24-year-old California native , was in Washington working as an intern for the Bureau of Prisons when she was last seen on May 1 , 2001 . Her skull was found in May 2002 in Washington 's Rock Creek Park . But police did n't arrest Guandique until February 2009 . He had been serving a 10-year sentence for attacking two other women in the park and had reportedly spoken about killing Levy . Levy and then-U.S. Rep.

Washington intern Chandra Levy was killed in 2001 . -LRB- Updated at 12:41 p. m -RRB- A jury on Monday found Ingmar Guandique guilty of murdering Washington intern Chandra Levy in 2001 . He was found guilty of two counts of first degree murder . He now faces a maximum penalty of life in prison without the possibility of parole . Guandique is already serving time for attacks on two other women in the park . Ingmar Guandique now faces a maximum sentence of life without parole . -LRB- Posted at 11:56 a. m -RRB- The jury has reached a verdict in the case against the man charged with the 2001 killing of Washington intern Chandra Levy . It is expected to be announced shortly . If convicted of first-degree murder , Ingmar Guandique faces a sentence of life without parole . The jury could instead find him guilty of second-degree murder , which could mean 20 years to life . Earlier , attorneys made their closing arguments in the case against Guandique , who denies he killed Levy , then an intern for the Federal Bureau of Prisons . `` She 's been waiting nine years for justice , '' said prosecutor Amanda Haines , holding up for the jury a poster-sized photograph of the smiling young woman . `` It 's been nine years , but you need to say the words ` Ingmar Guandique is guilty . ' '' Levy 's mother was in the spectators ' gallery , and at times looked close to tears as prosecutors brought out her daughter 's clothing , found at the crime scene in 2002 . Haines told the jury , `` You have a roomful of corroboration '' for the circumstantial case against Guandique . That includes the fact Guandique is serving time for two other attacks on women that prosecutors say closely resemble the one that led to Levy 's death , she said . Both of those attack victims testified during the trial . `` She 's been waiting nine years for justice , '' said prosecutor Amanda Haines , holding up for the jury a poster-sized photograph of the smiling young woman . `` It 's been nine years , but you need to say the words ` Ingman Guandique is guilty . ' '' The dead woman 's mother was in the spectators ' gallery , and at times looked close to tears as prosecutors brought out her daughter 's clothing , found at the crime scene in 2002 . Robert Levy , the father of slain Washington intern Chandra Levy , testified that he told police all he could about a relationship he discovered she was having in 2001 with sitting Congresman Gary Condit . `` We were mad at Condit , trying to point him as the villian , '' he testified on cross-examination Tuesday in the murder trial of Ingmar Guandique , who is charged in her death . Levy 's disappearance nine years ago received widespread publicity because of her alleged relationship with the sitting California congressman . The revelation contributed to the political downfall of Condit , who will be called to testify during the trial . Police said Condit was never a suspect in the case , although he was questioned intensively as investigators tried to find Levy . Opening statements began Monday in the trial of a man charged in the 2001 killing of Washington intern Chandra Levy . Authorities believe Ingmar Guandique attacked Levy , 24 , as she jogged in a park and then killed her . In her opening statement , Assistant U.S. Attorney Amanda Haines told the jury that the prosecution will rely in part on the testimony of two other women who were attacked in the same park just weeks after Levy . Those two managed to escape , but Levy was `` running into a dream , into a nightmare , '' Haines said , `` because she 's never coming out of the park . '' Editor 's note : For more on this story , watch `` Murder in the Capital : The death of Chandra Levy '' Saturday at 10 p.m. ET on CNN . It was creepy to think I was retracing what may have been the last steps taken by a beautiful , ambitious young woman , who became a murder victim on this very trail . The leaves were crunching under my feet as they hit the dirt jogging path , I tried to hold the small POV cam steady in my hand - I wanted to show viewers what Chandra Levy saw on her last day alive . On May 1 , 2001 , investigators say , Chandra went for a run in this same section of the 1,700-plus-acre Rock Creek Park - it s like the Central Park of Washington . I couldn t help but notice , the trail is one of the most beautiful , yet most isolated , parts of Rock Creek . As I jogged , I tried to imagine what Chandra looked like that day , her last . Confident , energetic , her unruly black hair bobbing in the wind , a Walkman strapped to her arm as she moved deeper and deeper into the woods . Chandra s thoughts probably were absorbed in the end of her relationship with the man friends say she loved - the powerful congressman she believed would eventually leave his wife and career to be with her . She may have also been thinking about her move back to California , or maybe about that surprise she told her aunt she needed to tell her about in an answering machine message - a surprise that would never be revealed . I bet the last thing on Chandra s mind was some killer hiding on the side of the trail , waiting for her . I stopped jogging and stood still , examining the woods around me - Did the killer hide behind that tree trunk ? Ugh , I was creeping myself out ! Then , I realized how quiet it was ... Strangely quiet , considering how close the park is to such a major city . All I could hear was the leaves and branches rustling as they hit each other while swaying in the wind . It was so beautiful , so peaceful , so eerily quiet . That got me thinking ... When I finished grabbing the shot I met back up with my crew to conduct an experiment to see how easy it was for Chandra to disappear on that trail . We placed a photographer near the start of the path , by the main road - the most likely place anyone would have been , had they been around the day Chandra was killed . I followed the trail 200 yards into the woods . Then , the photographer at the entrance started rolling his camera . From my position , I screamed `` Help ! at the top of my lungs several times , then jogged back to the photographer . `` Did you hear me , Did you hear me ? He looked at me , surprised . `` It didn t sound anything like screaming . You sounded like a bird off in the distance . He put his headphones over my ears and replayed the tape . I heard two faint cries , my desperate screams had blended in with the sounds of nature . Immediately , I got chills on my arms . If no one could hear me , how would anyone have heard Chandra ... ?

'' World leaders have been pushing for an orderly transition since the protest movement first gained momentum late last month . The calls grew only louder Friday after Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman made a somber one-minute announcement on state television announcing Mubarak 's resignation and the appointment of the Supreme Council of Armed Forces to `` run the affairs of the country . '' Among other things , Egyptian authorities need to set about `` protecting the rights of Egypt 's citizens , lifting the emergency law , revising the constitution and other laws to make this change irreversible , and laying out a clear path to elections that are fair and free , '' U.S. President Barack Obama said Friday . In the immediate future , the military -- largely respected by Egyptians -- will have to grapple with guiding the country of more than 80 million people through the transition amid massive problems of unemployment and considerable economic underdevelopment , said CNN correspondent Ben Wedeman , who is based in Cairo . Old Egypt dies , a new Egypt born `` All of that is going to pose quite a challenge , '' Wedeman said . `` They 're going to be learning along with the people of Egypt how to make a delicate transformation from a dictatorship to what everyone hopes is a democracy . '' One fear is that the military will be loath to give up power in favor of a democratic system . `` Egypt has a long history of military rule , '' said Daniel Byman , a senior fellow on foreign policy for Brookings ' Saban Center . `` No one will be shocked if this military is not eager to pass things on to the Egyptian people . '' But Byman also pointed out the solid reputation the military has among Egyptians . Throughout the uprising , the military both responded to the protesters and defended Mubarak 's regime , and many demonstrators had been calling for the army to take over as interim caretaker . `` The hope is that the military feels that its corporate image and pride will be destroyed if it created another dictatorship , '' Byman said . One of the first things the military can do to show it has the interests of Egyptians in mind is lift the state of emergency -- used by Mubarak throughout his tenure as president to rule with an iron hand -- immediately , said Marco Vicenzino of the Global Strategy Project . The military said Friday that it would be lifted , but only when conditions allowed . Byman noted that while tanks are in the street and the emergency law is still in place , Egypt is still essentially operating as a police state -- one of the biggest objections of the nearly 3-week-old protest . `` The police are not there in the same repressive way , but that said , you have tanks in the street and right now there 's no organized alternative , '' he said . `` The question is , are there credible signs they -LRB- the military -RRB- are on a path that there 's no withdrawing from . '' To help set that path , free and fair elections will be held in the next six to seven months , said Amre Moussa , Arab League secretary-general , who joined demonstrators in calling for Mubarak 's ouster , but said he has n't decided if he 'll run to succeed him . Before those elections can be held , however , dramatic changes are needed as to who gets on the ballot , how political parties are formed and how Egyptians register to vote , said Joshua Muravchik , a fellow at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies , noting significant restrictions placed on the political process under Mubarak 's regime . `` This is all totally new for Egypt , '' he said . Analysts agree that the future of Egypt could go in many different directions . `` When all the institutions are corrupt , who do you hand things off to ? '' Byman asked , later adding that `` one very tricky point is that the Egyptian people have been unified on one thing : Mubarak must go . But are they unified as to what Egypt will look like in the coming years ? You need some unity and some vision . '' There are a wealth of problems in Egypt and democracy is not a silver bullet that will cure them all . -- Joshua Muravchik , Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies Other question marks that remain are the future of Suleiman , a senior State Department official said Friday , and the role the Muslim Brotherhood may play in the new Egyptian government . The Brotherhood is the largest and most organized opposition group in Egypt and has a religious and political agenda . Some fear that the organization could hijack the pro-democracy movement . A spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood told CNN 's John King that his group trusts Egypt 's new military leadership to transition to a free and open democracy . Essam El-Erian said his organization , which has vowed not to field a presidential candidate , expects to be represented in a new parliament , but does not expect to win a majority of seats . Another big obstacle will be reforming the country 's constitution in Mubarak 's wake . Mubarak 's imposition of military rule Friday broke with the country 's 1971 constitution . The constitution allows for only two scenarios for a president to relinquish power . The first stipulates that if the president has to step aside temporarily , the vice president steps into the top role . That is what the regime briefly orchestrated Thursday . The constitution states further that , if the office of the president is vacated or the president becomes permanently disabled , the parliamentary speaker is to assume the role until new elections can be held . Those elections , in turn , must occur within 60 days . In opting for a third way , which put all power in the hands of the military , the regime in effect rendered the constitution inoperable . Moussa said Friday that Egypt needs to have a `` modern constitution '' -- one that promises tolerance in light of what he called a `` renewed , positive relationship -LRB- across -RRB- all sections of Egyptian society . '' However , Pollack and others noted Friday , pillars of the Mubarak regime still remain in place , including the military forces serving as interim caretakers and the legislative parliament . However , a high-ranking Egyptian military official said that discussions were under way in the military Supreme Council about dismissing Mubarak 's government and parliament and the timing for elections . Vicenzino said the military commission needs to begin a process of inclusiveness by reaching out to members of civil society to participate in the new political process . The private sector , big industry , labor unions who represent millions of workers , must all be included in discussions going forward , Vicenzino said . Still , Johns Hopkins ' Muravchik cautioned that `` one election does not make a democracy . '' `` There are a wealth of problems in Egypt and democracy is not a silver bullet that will cure them all . '' And though the bubble of three weeks of tension burst Friday , the pressure could begin anew Saturday as some protesters said they would keep up the demonstration with more demands , including putting Mubarak on trial .

In a somber , one-minute announcement on state television , Vice President Omar Suleiman announced Mubarak 's resignation and said the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces will `` run the affairs of the country . '' As Suleiman spoke , deafening cheers erupted among tens of thousands of Egyptians who thronged the streets of Cairo . It was a moment they had sought throughout long , often tense days of demonstrations -- some of them violent -- that demanded Mubarak 's departure . It was a moment that many in the Arab world 's powerhouse nation had not dared contemplate . Chants of `` Egypt is free ! '' and `` God is great ! '' rose from the crowds , dizzy in the honeymoon of their success . Some waved Egyptian flags ; others honked horns ; still others set off fireworks as they savored the scene . Two major bridges over the Nile River resembled congested parking lots , and partiers packed streets throughout Cairo . The state-run Middle East News Agency said some people had passed out from joy and others had suffered heart attacks . `` It was a sense of liberation for me , for every Egyptian , '' said opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei . `` For the first time , Egypt has a chance to be democratic , to be free , to have a sense of dignity , of freedom . So it 's amazing . It 's just like something we never experienced in our lifetime . '' A source with close connections to Persian Gulf government leaders said Mubarak , 82 , had fled to the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh , his presidency finished as abruptly as it had started in 1981 , when he ascended to power after the assassination of Anwar Sadat . The repercussions echoed far beyond Tahrir Square as the Swiss government moved Friday to freeze assets belonging to Mubarak and his family , said Norbert Baerlocher , a spokesman for the Swiss Embassy in Washington .

Carrying flags and playing drums , around 150 anti-Mubarak protesters danced , sang and prayed in front of the embassy , in London 's well-heeled Mayfair area . After the bitter disappointment of Thursday 's speech when Mubarak vowed to stay in office , many thought today 's announcement would be a long time coming . Trader Ahmed Khalifa , 23 , has been demonstrating in front of the embassy for more than two weeks . `` This is what you call a sweet victory , '' he told CNN . `` Yesterday he -LRB- Mubarak -RRB- brought us all down , we thought he was never going to go . I came here today ready to protest and now it 's a celebration .

'' When asked if he was concerned about the future leadership of his country Elsddek replied , `` Yes , I 'm worried , but I 'm sure the Egyptian people will not stop now . `` We will try and get the best man for our country . The future is bright , the tyrant is gone . '' As protesters celebrated in the street below , Egyptian officials looked tentatively out of the embassy windows . Protesters waved back , making peace signs with their hands and calling on them to join the celebrations . Mohamed Ezeldin Ahmed , 22 , who spent last night watching Mubarak 's speech in a London restaurant with a small group of ardent anti-Mubarak protestors , explained the situation . `` We are asking them to come down and celebrate , '' he said . `` But they wo n't , they are the people who support Mubarak .

But now , from this moment , from this day , things will be different . '' But for most , this was not a day to speculate on the future . This was a day of celebration .

Sifry , Special to CNN An Egyptian man holds up a sign praising Facebook , joining other protesters in Cairo 's Tahrir Square on February 1 . The role of social media in the Egypt revolution is under debate Micah Sifry says the internet alone did n't end Mubarak 's regime He says tools such as Facebook and Twitter were key for the organizers of protests Combination of social media and repressive conditions puts harsh regimes at risk , he says -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` People protested and brought down governments before Facebook was invented . They did it before the internet came along . '' `` This is the revolution of the youth of the internet , and now the revolution of all Egyptians . '' As we watch , transfixed by the sights and sounds of jubilation in the streets of Egypt , the question on many people 's minds is : How did this happen ? But a far better way to ask that question is : Who organized this , and how ? Movements for social change do n't just `` happen . '' Too often , the media reports on them the way we talk about the weather or chemistry : Protest is said to `` flare up , '' `` gather steam '' and `` boil . '' Other times movements are said to take a country `` by storm '' or `` peter out . '' Having grown up on such empty descriptions , it 's not surprising that we 're hearing so much today about Egypt 's `` Facebook revolution '' or its `` Twitter revolution . '' Lacking any real knowledge of the forces on the ground , too many media outlets have offered us a view from afar , where some shiny new tools of communication are made out to be more important than the people doing the communicating and the messages and tactics they have chosen to use . The role of the internet in Egypt 's revolution has definitely been overstated . If you look at the available data on the degree of internet penetration in the country as well as the number of mobile cellular subscriptions per 100 people , the percentage of population under age 15 and the degree of urbanization , some intriguing facts jump out . Without the relatively free arena of online social networking sites ... young Egyptians like Ghonim could not have built the resilient and creative force that finally toppled Hosni Mubarak . Internet access in Egypt is barely 20 % , much less than Tunisia or Iran , according to InternetWorldStats.com . Mobile phone usage is much higher , at about 40 % . Egypt is also a very young and urban society . About a third of the population is under 15 -LRB- compared to 25 % in Tunisia and 28 % in Iran -RRB- , says the Population Reference Bureau . And close to half live in cities , where the gap between rich and poor is more extreme and gratingly visible than in the rural parts of the country . These elements -- a rising level of connectivity combined with an exploding population of young people facing declining economic prospects since the global recession began a few years ago -- are probably the most critical underlying factors explaining Egypt 's explosion . That said , Google marketing executive Wael Ghonim has a point -- and Malcolm Gladwell 's dismissive comment about the role of social media in social change was a case of over-correcting for the media 's failings . The internet has made a big difference in Egypt . For years , the country 's secret police and state-controlled media have very effectively suppressed most dissident activities . Without the relatively free arena of online social networking sites and tools like Facebook , Twitter and YouTube , young Egyptians like Ghonim could not have built the resilient and creative force that finally toppled Hosni Mubarak . As he told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer on Friday , `` We would post a video on Facebook and it would be shared by 50,000 people on their walls in hours . '' Alternative media channels are absolutely vital for freedom movements . But the `` youth of the internet '' were more than that . A nucleus of human rights activists , lawyers , bloggers and labor organizers have been hard at work for several years in Egypt , risking prison , holding small rallies and vigils , raising consciousness online by distributing pictures and video of torture victims , writing protest manuals , mobilizing lawyers to petition arrested comrades out of prison and studying the lessons of other failed uprisings -- like the protests after Iran 's 2009 election -- in order to develop more nimble and less controllable strategies to build their movement . Along the way , they devised some ingenious hacks around the police state , like using mobile phones and Twitter to share information about imprisoned activists and using international phone lines for sending text messages . They learned how to make more effective online videos with the help of Peter Gabriel 's human rights group Witness , and how to use open source mapping tools with the help of the Kenyan nongovernmental group Ushahidi . As Maryam Ishani writes in Foreign Policy magazine , `` By the time the November 2010 elections -LRB- in Egypt -RRB- rolled around , a new mechanism was in place . '' The theory was that widespread election fraud would set off an Iran-like wave of protests , but apparently Egyptians were inured to stolen elections . It would take the events in Tunisia in December , where a peddler named Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire to protest corruption , stirring mass protests there -LRB- which were also organized by online social network activists -RRB- to finally push Egyptians into the streets . `` If you want to liberate a society , just give them the internet , '' Ghonim said Friday . Well , if you add a free and open internet to a society with a large number of young people , give a majority of them mobile phones , and fail to offer them any chance of economic and social advancement , you will have ripened the conditions for changing the world . But small groups of dedicated and organized people still have to make it happen . Like Margaret Mead once said , nothing else ever has . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Micah L. Sifry .

He is the author of numerous books on the Middle East , including A Path Out of the Desert : A Grand Strategy for America in the Middle East -LRB- Random House , 2008 -RRB- . -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Egyptians deserve their time to celebrate . Hosni Mubarak 's resignation is a dramatic victory for the protest movement born so suddenly on January 25 . As recently as a few weeks ago , few Egyptians -- if any -- could conceive of such a thing . As Americans , we should only bask in their reflected joy and allow them this moment to revel in what they have accomplished . But the celebration can not go on for too long because there is still much to be done if they are to realize their dreams of a prosperous , modern , democratic Egypt . Mubarak 's exit can not be seen as the ultimate triumph of Egypt 's pro-democracy protest movement , although it is an important victory on the way . Egypt 's problems began before Mubarak , and they will not end with his ouster . Instead , they are the product of a corrupt , stagnant and oppressive system which Mubarak helped to build but now extends beyond his own person . And large elements of that system remain in place . The Egyptian military , particularly its senior officers and intelligence leadership , have been critical pillars of that system , and neither we nor the Egyptian people know whether they are ready to accept the far more important and expansive demands for democratization , rule of law and economic reform that the protesters -LRB- and so many Egyptians -RRB- desire . Ghonim : ` I 'm proud to be Egyptian today ' This is particularly critical since it is the military itself which must continue to play the vital role of holding the nation together , preventing a descent into chaos , fending off more radical elements that seek to hijack the revolution and overseeing a peaceful transition to democracy . What 's more it is a process that will take years to get right , no matter how soon it starts , and the Army will have to remain patient with the trials of a new democracy throughout . While many -LRB- myself included -RRB- point to Turkey as a rough model , we should all remember that the Turkish military lost patience with democracy too many times in the past during its long transition . There is another danger lurking , namely that conservative elements within the regime may believe that sacrificing Mubarak will allow them to avoid the wider reforms that the protesters seek . They may well assume that they can make Mubarak their scapegoat , and that the ferocity he has stirred in so many Egyptian souls will be expiated by his departure . They may believe that his resignation will sate the anger of most Egyptians , who will then lose their interest in the protests and go back to their jobs and their lives , effectively taking the wind out of the sails of the protest movement , and marginalizing the hard core that remain . After all , those who oppose the protesters have been playing for time ever since their half-baked effort to crush the protests failed . They doubtlessly believe that the protesters and opposition leaders , such as they are , can more easily be dealt with if they have lost the leverage of labor strikes , million-strong marches and the international media attention they bring . Certainly the strategy of this regime in years past has been to promise modest reforms in times of stress and then to simply fail to deliver when passions cooled and external pressure moved on . No one should assume that Mubarak 's resignation will mean the end of opposition from the vestiges of Mubarak 's regime . The regime can endure , and those who benefited most from it may well plan to fight on without him . Thus , the real challenge for the protest movement still lies ahead . Can they maintain popular backing to force the regime to make key concessions on the nature of governance in Egypt , like ending the national emergency laws , establishing a committee to revise the constitution manned by respected opposition leaders , limiting the regime 's authority over civil liberties and enacting far-reaching legislation until a new president and parliament can be elected under a new constitution ? If they can not maintain popular support in the form of continuing demonstrations until they can secure those or other similarly meaningful curbs on the regime 's powers , they run a very significant risk of failure . Mubarak 's fall is a great triumph for the Egyptian people , and they have earned their right to celebrate . But it does not signal `` mission accomplished . '' It can not be the end of their struggles , for if it is , it will also be the end of their dreams . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kenneth Pollack .

To those watching in Egypt at this hour , sabah al khair . Peace be with you . Last week , as thugs descended on peaceful protesters in Liberation Square , we heard those protesters tell us that they were no longer afraid . Tired of the indignities they had suffered at the hands of Mubarak for some 30 years , at the hands of his police and his thugs , they had defeated fear , they told us , the fear of Mubarak , the fear of those police , the fear of the repression and the torture and the torments . They had defeated fear and there was no turning back . It was just a hope 18 days ago , a hope that fear could be defeated . But as the protests grew and the regime began to buckle , it became a belief and then a conviction . And , tonight , this night , this glorious morning in Cairo and throughout Egypt , it is fact . Fear has been defeated in Egypt . And whatever happens next , good or bad , there is no turning back . This is what liberation looks like . This is what joy , long suppressed , long imprisoned , long tortured and tormented , this is what joy looks like and sounds like . Tonight , Saturday morning in Egypt , the revolution has won . The dictator , Mubarak , is gone . But the new day dawning is not yet a democracy . These people may have liberated Egypt , but the military now runs it . They have always had a tight grip on the economy and a long history of wielding power . This is the man believed to be in charge , Mohamed Hussein Tantawi , defense minister under Mubarak , now head of the military council running Egypt . The council now ruling by decree , but promising to carry out constitutional reforms and respond to demonstrators ' demands . We will talk in depth tonight about what happens next . But , before we do , I just want to show you some of those remarkable moments today , as 80 million people in the world 's largest Arab country made history . Last night , at the s time , the dictator Mubarak and his henchman , Vice President Suleiman and dug in , patronizing protesters , unleashing their anger . We can only assume the military finally had enough . Just after 6:00 local time , after a day of protests , right in the middle of evening prayers , the bulletin came on from state television . The same network the day before had carried Mubarak defiantly refusing to step down . OMAR SULEIMAN , EGYPTIAN VICE PRESIDENT -LRB- through translator -RRB- : I have an important message from the presidency . In the name of God , the most gracious , the most merciful , dear citizens , these are difficult times which our country has sustained . President Hosni Mubarak has decided to give up and commission the High Council of the Armed Forces to take over . COOPER : The statement from Vice President Suleiman sudden and brief , but that is how the world changes . It cost blood and it cost lives and it cost countless sacrifices . But in the end , the regime fell with the blink of an eye . Here 's what it looked like just seconds later , people hugging , chanting : Egypt is free . You 're an Egyptian . Lift up your head . And they did , rich and poor , young and old . To the young Google executive who took a leave of absence to help organize the revolution , this was an especially sweet moment . Wael Ghonim , that 's him in his home when the news struck . He now says Egypt will be a fully democratic state . That is his hope . The world , he says , will be impressed . That is his belief . He says he will not take part in any government , but that his work is done and in any case he 's no hero . WAEL GHONIM , GOOGLE EXECUTIVE : The real heroes are the ones in the streets . The real heroes today are every single Egyptian . There is no one leading this . Anyone who is telling you he is one of the leaders is not saying the truth . The leaders , you know , on Tahrir Square was every single person there . The leader in Alexandria is every single person there . COOPER : Wael Ghonim today about an hour into Egypt 's new era . We have a full interview with him in the hour ahead . A short time later , President Obama poured praise on the Egyptian people . BARACK OBAMA , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : This is the power of human dignity , and it could never be denied . Egyptians have inspired us , and they have done so by putting the lie to the idea that justice is best gained through violence . For an Egypt , it was the moral force of non-violence -- not terrorism , not mindless killing -- but non-violence , moral force that bent the arc of history toward justice once more . COOPER : The arc of history bent toward history once more . Vice President Biden today calling on Iran 's government to follow Egypt 's example -- 32 years ago today , on this day , the shah 's regime collapsed , also in a popular uprising . Theocracy , though , followed though , not freedom . Some have similar concerns about Egyptian and the Muslim Brotherhood . Others worry about the military breaking its promises . Wael Ghonim says he understands those fears , but he puts his faith in 80 million Egyptians . And that sentiment is on the lips of many of those Egyptians tonight . Fear has been defeated , they 're crying , and there is no turning back . Joining us once again , Ben Wedeman in Cairo and Ivan Watson in Cairo . And here with me , Professor Dr. Fouad Ajami of the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies and the Hoover Institution . FOUAD AJAMI , PROFESSOR OF MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES , JOHNS HOPKINS SCHOOL OF ADVANCED INTERNATIONAL STUDIES : Well , what can I tell you ? I come from a generation whose heart was broken by Egypt . We witnessed the defeat of Egypt , those of us Arabs born in the -- who came to politics in the '50s and the '60s . We witnessed the defeat of Egyptian state in the Six Day War of 1967 , the collapse of the dream of Nasserism and the weakness of Egypt as a country . And here we are , we now have the glory of Egypt , that Egypt has given the Arabs the way forward , civilian politics , but resistance to the ruler and belief in democracy . COOPER : And that 's why we hear Egyptians and especially children chanting , hold your head up high . This was the chant of Gamal Abdel Nasser , by the way , in the '50s and the '60s , when they still loved him , which is asking Egyptians , who have been much trampled upon by the world , badly treated by the world , badly treated by colonial powers from the world over , and the Egyptians finally reached their dignity . The tragedy of Hosni Mubarak was that here is a man who in fact took the dreams of Egypt and crushed them completely . He crushed all independent people in the country , and he insisted on his own primacy over the country . And they were done with him . COOPER : Ben , at this point , do we know exactly what happened ? Because this hour last night Mubarak had go on state television and dug in , treating the protesters almost like children . Suleiman had also gone on state television . And then all of a sudden , hours later , he 's -- they 're announcing that he 's gone . Did the -- was this a coup ? Did the military just say to him , you have to go ? BEN WEDEMAN , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , we do n't really have the exact details , Anderson . But I think it was a combination of factors . For one , I think President Mubarak and the people around him miscalculated the reaction of Egyptians to his speech last night . They did not realize that this simply was not enough for the people here in Tahrir Square and across the country . They wanted him to go . It was an equivocal demand , and they simply perhaps did not understand it . Another important factor to keep in mind is that the labor movement over the last three days was becoming increasingly involved in the revolution , and that -- if you look at other revolutions , the overthrow of Nimeiri in the Sudan , and Ben Ali in Tunisia , it was the involvement of the trade unions later in the game that really brought down the regime . Now , I want to share one bit of sort of a symbol of how things have changed . This is `` Al-Ahram , '' the state newspaper , and until recently , it was very much the mouthpiece of the regime . Its headline today , `` The People Have Toppled the Regime . '' This is incredibly significant when you think that just a few days ago , it was President Mubarak on the cover almost every day . This was the newspaper of the regime , and now the regime is gone . And this newspaper is selling like hotcakes -- Anderson . COOPER : Save me a copy , if you can . Ben , the -- I also understand on state television that President Obama ... COOPER : ... that President Obama 's speech was carried live on state television and that people have been calling into state television . They have actually had kind of call-ins where people have been critical sort of everything , of corruption of the regime , of the state television , and that the anchors have been apologizing . WEDEMAN : Well , this was an interesting day , because we had this huge demonstration outside of state TV . And state TV was running a banner that only five of their anchors were there , because no one could leave or enter the building because of the demonstration . And , later -- by the afternoon , what happened was they started to take calls from demonstrators who were criticizing the state TV and its anchors , saying , look , you have been lying all these years . Stop slandering the protest movement . And what you had was the anchors saying , we were caught in a trap , that we were under pressure , but now we 're going to tell the truth . And they started holding live interviews in front of the state TV building with the demonstrators . And when I saw that , I thought , there 's no way that this regime , the previous regime , I should stress , could go on when its mouthpiece started to talk basically the language of the protest movement , so a very dramatic change in the tone . And this was before , of course , the announcement that President Mubarak was stepping down -- Anderson . COOPER : Ivan Watson , I hate to be the sober guy at the party who pulls you out of the fun to ask you serious questions . That 's always the boring person at the party . But I got to ask you , we now know that Swiss banks have frozen or asked -- the Swiss government has asked banks to freeze the accounts , any Mubarak-related accounts in Switzerland . They say they do n't know how many there may be , but they have asked banks to look at it . At this point , we believe Mubarak is in Sharm el-Sheikh . Is there any sense of what happens to him next , because some people have said they want to see him on trial . There 's others who said they want to see the money returned that he 's taken . IVAN WATSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : That 's been one of the demands that 's been growing over the course of the past two-and-a-half weeks , Anderson . And a big question is going to be , well , what are the demonstrators in Tahrir Square , for instance , going to ask for next ? Are they going to step down now ? Are they going to start tearing down the barricades and going home and tearing down the tents ? I was just walking around . None of the barricades have really come down . The tents are still there . The security lines are still there , the young men patting you down . And I asked one of them , how much longer are you going to stay here ? Hosni Mubarak has left . And this guy said one or two days . My colleague Arwa Damon has been down there throughout the evening . And she said that there were two opposing viewpoints cropping up between different demonstrators , a larger group saying , OK , we did it , we won , it 's time to getting life back to normal , Wael Ghonim saying that as well on his Twitter account . Another group saying , no , we have got to stay here . We do n't trust what is coming next . We have got to make sure that all the demands are met . And some of these people definitely want to see Hosni Mubarak and members of his inner circle tried for what they say are crimes . Many people accuse him of stealing from the nation here . COOPER : Fouad , how dangerous is what comes next ? You have this military rule . We saw a member of the military on television today saluting , not just Mubarak , but the martyrs , the young people who have died in this revolution over the last 18 days . There 's a lot of obviously popular support for the military right now . Over months , though , that can change . AJAMI : Well , look , all revolutions in the end have these -- all kinds of unforeseen consequences . The Egyptians have now entered a new world . They have shed the old world . They will try to create this new country . They will want some accounting of what happened . And for -- when you think of the legacy of Mubarak and what he did to this country , he can think about it in Sharm el-Sheikh or Germany or wherever he ends up . The great Gamal Abdel Nasser , millions of people wept for him when he died in 1970 . I remember that funeral . It was one of the great events in the modern Middle East . People committed suicide grieving for him , because they loved him so . And Sadat , he left behind the legacy of Camp David . He was controversial in his country , but people loved him . Here is this man who looted his country , and he leaves this power vacuum . So we return back to the military . It turns out that the military is the only viable institution , because , in fact , Mubarak , he devoured the political life of the country . He destroyed democratic institutions . COOPER : He destroyed any real opposition . Like , we have a good friend , Saad Eddin Ibrahim , a great academic . He just said a few words on television and he ended up being in prison for three , four years . They have destroyed him physically and they wrecked his life professionally . You have Ayman Nour , a great politician , a liberal politician . He dares do -- he does something amazingly simple . He runs against Mubarak . He loses , and he still ends up in prison . COOPER : He ran for president and was then imprisoned . COOPER : And only got 7 percent of the vote , and yet still ended up in prison . AJAMI : Exactly , just for the temerity of having run against pharaoh . So , you enter this world now in a power vacuum , because you have a man like Mohamed ElBaradei . He lived in Europe for a good deal of his life . COOPER : Right , 30 years he spent mostly overseas . AJAMI : So , you have this vacuum . And the Egyptian will have to figure out what kind of political future they want . COOPER : Do you worry about a push too fast to elections ? I think -- I 'm not worried , to be honest with you , about anything . AJAMI : Because I think here 's where we were . We were under an incredibly cruel man who had really pulverized the life of Egypt . So I look forward to what Egypt itself will spawn by way of politics , by way of culture . And I think everything looks better than what this man had in store for them . COOPER : See -- and I can of agree with you , because it feels like people have underestimated Egypt now for 18 days and underestimated these protesters all along the way , each step , wringing their hands , saying , wait a minute , this is bad , this is bad , this is bad , slow down , slow down , slow down . And yet Egyptians have something else in mind . AJAMI : And then there are these people who are second-guessing the Egyptians , and I think many in our own country , and this is a real moral embarrassment in this country , that many are second-guessing the Egyptians , or will they create decent politics , will they fall into a theocracy ? Will they break peace with Israel ? Will they do this ? Will they squander the kind of freedom and the kind of new order that they have gained ? We must trust people with their own history . This is really the lesson of Midan Tahrir , of Liberation Square . We must leave it to them . Every time we wrote them off , they surprised us . Every time Mubarak thought that he scared them , they came out in larger numbers , as you saw with your own eyes . So we must trust the willingness of the Egyptians and the ability of the Egyptians to keep their own world intact and to spawn a new and decent country for themselves and their children . COOPER : We 're going to more with Fouad throughout this hour and Ben and Ivan and all our correspondents . A quick reminder , the live chat is up and running at AC360 . Up next , how the Obama administration handled the revolution and the serious challenges it faces ahead . Also , Fouad mentioned a power vacuum . So we will talk more about those concerns , mainly in America , that it 's going to be filled by radical Islam or by the military or involvement of Iran . We will talk about that all ahead . It 's very hard to understand what freedom means until you lose it and you try to find it . COOPER : That 's one of the protesters or one of the people that we heard from in the square today . I think I misspoke today . I said that the military spokesman went on television and saluted Mubarak , as well as the martyrs , the young people who died in the revolution . I do n't think that 's accurate . I think he praised Mubarak verbally and I think he actually just paused to actually salute the martyrs . I just want to make sure we 're accurate in everything that we 're saying . Take a look at pictures , a scene that looks familiar , a scene of revolution , but this is not Egypt . This is a video from 32 years ago today , the day of Iran 's revolution , an odd coincidence that Mubarak steps down on the same day that the Iranian government was overthrown in 1979 . We can take at least one lesson from the pictures of celebration from 32 years ago , the lesson being the end of a dynasty is only the beginning of the story and there 's no way to know exactly how it 's going to play out , what forces and motivations will possibly replace a toppled regime . A lot of folks will say , well , look , Egypt is not Iran , very different . And we will talk about that in a moment . Today , President Obama acknowledged the significance of this day and the fact that the story is just starting to be written . OBAMA : There are very few moments in our lives where we have the privilege to witness history taking place . This is one of those moments . This is one of those times . The people of Egypt have spoken , their voices have been heard , and Egypt will never be the same . By stepping down , President Mubarak responded to the Egyptian people 's hunger for change . But this is not the end of Egypt 's transition . It 's a beginning . I 'm sure there will be difficult days ahead , and many questions remain unanswered . COOPER : Let 's talk about the days ahead . Joining me now live from Washington , former CIA Director James Woolsey , at the State Department , foreign affairs correspondent Jill Dougherty , and in Washington John King , and of course back with us Professor Fouad Ajami of Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies , also a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution . Mr. Woolsey , how -- what is your biggest concern in terms of the months ahead ? I 'm guessing it 's an Islamist takeover or something to do with the military . What 's your biggest concern and how does -- how do the Egyptian people avoid it ? JAMES WOOLSEY , FORMER CIA DIRECTOR : Well , one very much hopes that the excellent and disciplined behavior and peaceful approach that the Egyptians have shown in these two-and-a-half weeks continues . But there 's a whole history of revolutions , the French , the Russian , the Iranian of ' 78 - ' 79 , in which it looks like the good guys are going to win , and they do at first , and then months later , in the tumult of the revolution , Bolsheviks kill the Mensheviks , the Khomeini supporters kill the liberals in Iran and so on . This has happened a number of times . And I think what we have to do is do everything we can , while staying very much in the background , to perhaps help bring about some economic investment in Egypt , to help any way that we or other countries can , so that they can build an infrastructure for democracy at the same time they 're probably relatively rapidly going to hold elections . It 's -- but this story is n't over yet . I hope it all continues this way . But the history of revolutions sometimes goes much worse than that . COOPER : Fouad , is an Iran-style theocracy possible ? AJAMI : Well , look , revolutions can -- can be hijacked . They can be betrayed . And , as Jim rightly said , the -- the zealots can take them over . The Iranian Revolution had two revolutions within it . It had a liberal revolution which was defeated and a theocratic revolution , which won out . So , there is -- all kinds of possibilities lie in store for the Egyptians . Again , we have to look at Egypt . And , in 2011 , it 's not Iran in 1979 . And the conditions are very different . And , however , we can not just say , well , all right , that the liberal course for Egypt will hold . This is a very poor country , which is not really -- kind of that 's not the fertile soil for democratic , liberal politics , when 40 percent of your population lives below the poverty line , another one of the gifts of Hosni Mubarak to his people . So , you were right . We have to be vigilant . And the Egyptians themselves , they have to guard these gains that they have secured in Liberation Square . COOPER : Jill , what are communications like , do we know , between the U.S. and the Egyptian government ? It 's been a real problem obviously for the past few days . My understanding from the reporting of you and John and others in Washington is that the White House frankly did n't even have any advanced warning that Mubarak was going to be stepping down . Do we know now what the communications are like between the military that 's ruling and the White House and the State Department ? JILL DOUGHERTY , CNN FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT : Well , that 's one thing they 're looking at , Anderson , because right now they are telling us that they 're trying to figure out exactly how this military council will work , who exactly is in charge of it . You know , sometimes , the leader of a group like that may not emerge for a while . How do they talk to them , at what level ? The bureaucracy here has to talk to the bureaucracy there . They have to get a bead on what their policy is . There are many , many questions . And they 're looking at that right now . It 's not very clear at all . COOPER : John , what are you hearing , what have you learned about what has transpired in terms of the White House and the government in the last 24 hours vis-a-vis Egypt ? JOHN KING , HOST , `` JOHN KING , USA '' : Well , we know of course there have been mixed signals . We know yesterday morning , when the president said we are witnessing history , they thought and they had been told by senior Egyptian officials that Mubarak was going to leave yesterday . They are quite happy he left today . To Jill 's point , this is a fascinating moment , because , normally , it is the president and then his secretary of state who are the faces , the voices of American foreign policy . During this crisis , the most important voices were the secretary of defense , Robert Gates , and the Admiral Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , who have personal relationships going back some 20 years with Field Marshal Tantawi and other senior Egyptian military officials . And Secretary Gates alone spoke to the Field Marshal Tantawi at least five times that we know of . They wo n't tell us much about those conversations . But , Anderson , going forward , those relationships are critical . Some of them date back to the first Persian Gulf War . I actually spent some time with then General Tantawi 's troops in the Saudi desert back in that war 20 years ago , before the ground war started into Kuwait to push Saddam Hussein out . And those relationships are critical . And yet Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen are both due to leave the administration in the months ahead . So , it 's interesting to watch diplomacy being run out of the Pentagon . COOPER : Well , a lot of the officer corps in the Egyptian military , it 's my understanding , has actually been educated in the United States in military colleges and military schools . Ben , how much is known about this guy Tantawi ? WEDEMAN : Well , we know that he 's really from the same generation of former President Hosni Mubarak . He 's in his mid-70s . He was trained -- he 's received training in the Soviet Union . He seemed to be very much an establishment man , a cautious man , in dealing with the military . Under Mubarak , the military was very pampered . They were well-equipped , well-paid . But the price was that they tried -- they stay away from politics . Now , the chief of staff , Sami Anan , is a different sort of man . He was trained in the United States . He 's a generation younger than Mubarak . He 's somebody who has had much more easy and constant contact with the United States military . So , it 's a mixed bag . Now , we do n't know an awful lot about the other members of this higher military council . Of course , nobody was really aware that such a council even existed until this crisis came . Well , sorry about that , a little unruliness here in Tahrir -- not surprising . COOPER : Not surprising and probably welcome , after some of the unruliness we have seen . Jim , at this point , it 's important to remember the Interior Ministry is a massive organization in Egypt . Professor Ajami has said there are estimates of it having more than 1.5 million employees , intelligence agents , secret agents , informers and the like . They -- that apparatus is still all there . What happens to it ? Do we know much about how it will work with the military ? WOOLSEY : I do n't think we do . At least I do n't . I think that it 's obviously got to be scaled way down and back and controlled . I think that the only thing we have really got going for us and the Egyptian people do here really is the coherence between the Egyptian military and the population . You saw those wonderful films of the Egyptian soldiers hugging some of the children and the demonstrator groups and giving people tea and so forth . A lot rides here on the military keeping things stable and working with whoever helps manage things anew in Egypt to scale back and down and control some of those outfits like the Interior Ministry people . COOPER : Jill Dougherty , James Woolsey , John King , thank you . Ben Wedeman , Fouad Ajami , please stick with us . Coming up , two of the most compelling voices in Egypt 's revolution talked to us on this remarkable day , one a Google executive on leave , one of the stars of -- also , one of the others , a star of a critically acclaimed movie , both Egyptian . First , Wael Ghonim , a hero of the revolution . Here he is celebrating today in his family 's home when he heard the news . His job , his family , his very life on the line , he emerged as a leader , a reluctant leader . He was detained for more than 10 days , said he was ready to die for the cause . I talked to him just after the news came in that Mubarak had resigned -- that interview in a moment . Also , we will talk to actor-turned-activist Khalid Abdalla , star of `` The Kite Runner . '' We have been checking in with him all week . He 's been setting the scene for us . Tonight , you will hear from him how much that scene has changed . COOPER : Welcome back . Those are the words today from a central figure in the Egyptian uprising . Wael Ghonim is a Google executive on leave from his job , turned activist . Some people say the roots of the uprising can be traced back to what he was posting on Facebook . He said , `` Welcome back Egypt '' today . A Facebook spokesman today called Ghonim a hero . Today , we can also call him a revolutionary . He had a lot to lose : a family , a great job . He was detained by security forces for ten days , remained blindfolded . No one told him what was going on , whether he would live or die . Just a few days ago , he said he was ready to die for the cause . I spoke to Ghonim earlier today shortly after we all learned the Mubarak stepped down . COOPER : Wael , your thoughts on this extraordinary moment ? WAEL GHONIM , GOOGLE EXECUTIVE\\/EGYPTIAN ACTIVIST -LRB- via phone -RRB- : I 'm proud to be Egyptian . I just want to say , you know , from the bottom of my heart congratulations to all Egyptians . And you know , I want to say welcome back , Egypt . I just want to say to Hosni Mubarak and to Omar Suleiman and to all those people who thought that -- that being in power means you can oppress people , you are responsible of the killing of 300 innocent Egyptians . You guys are still going to pay the price . It 's enough -- it 's enough for you guys that in the history books they 're going to -- they 're going to say one word to describe you , a dictator . Today , I am telling you Egypt is going to be a democratic state . Egypt is going to start all over , and you will be impressed how fast we will be developing . COOPER : Did you believe this day would come when you set up that first Web site , when you were in detention , being blindfolded and held ? GHONIM : Personally I believed . Because at the end of the day , you know -- at the moment you break the psychological barrier of fear , the moment you break the fear , the moment you convince people that , if they die , it 's better to die for a good cause than to live without dignity , which is something that we all worked on in our message at the very beginning . Then -- then you should be sure that you are going to win . COOPER : And your thoughts at this moment almost must turn to all those who have lost their lives just in the last two weeks . COOPER : So much blood has been spilled . GHONIM : Those people are the real heroes . Those people are the real heroes . You know , like , there are lots of people that we know that have died . And also I would n't forget those who were arrested . There are about a thousand people that , you know , no one knows where are they right now . We are looking for them . We want them back . I was not the leader , by the way . I was -- it just happened that I got all the attention that I do n't deserve . I 'm not downplaying my role ; this is the truth . The real people you should be hosting on your show , it 's not me ; it 's actually the people in Tahrir Square , who slept in -LRB- UNINTELLIGIBLE -RRB- , who saw their friends and family dying beside them . Those are the real heroes . BLITZER : Wael , this is Wolf Blitzer in Washington . So first Tunisia , now Egypt . You 're giving Facebook a lot of credit for this ? GHONIM : Yes , for sure . I want to meet Mark Zuckerberg one day and thank him , actually . This revolution started online . This revolution started on Facebook . You know , I always said that if you want to liberate a society , just give them the Internet . If you want to have a free society , give them the Internet . I want to say a final word . Thanks to you and you folks on Tahrir Square . You guys have played a great role in saving the lives of hundreds , if not thousands of people . This regime did not care about the people , and they would have killed a lot of people if there was no international media . CNN did a great job . You guys deserve a great -- a great -- a commission from the Egyptian people . We 're not going to forget your role . COOPER : Wael , we just got a thing crossing the latest wire , saying that Egypt 's supreme military council will sack the cabinet , suspend both houses of parliament and govern with the head of the supreme court . Your reaction to that ? They 're just -- here 's what I thought of in the military . These guys do n't want to be in power . These guys want Egypt to come back . As we told you , even if I do n't trust anyone , I trust the Egyptians . This is the time where history is being rewritten now . We are dreamers , and we made it happen . And it 's time now to celebrate for a couple of days . And then -- and then go back and start thinking about how can we develop this country and what 's the best way ? COOPER : It 's incredible when you think eight days ago , government thugs and mobs were hunting for reporters , looking at live shot locations , hunting literally for cameras to pull them off of balconies so that no one would see , so the world would not witness the attacks that were taking place in Liberation Square . I remember getting lit up with lasers -- with laser sights while doing live shots . Another enduring voice of this revolution has been that of Khalid Abdullah . He 's an actor turned activists . He starred in `` The Kite Runner , '' traded the movie star life for a place in Liberation Square . Throughout the uprising , he 's given us his perspective every night on this program . Just last night he spoke in a tired voice about the Arab disappointment among the protestors . He was sleeping in the square last night . Today , a new day in every sense of the word . I spoke to Khalid a few moments ago . COOPER : Khalid , where were you the moment you heard the news ? KHALID ABDULLAH , ACTOR : I stepped out to a friend 's flat , because I had to record a message for a demonstration that was supposed to take place tomorrow in -LRB- UNINTELLIGIBLE -RRB- Square . We were just downloading the footage . And in the middle of doing so , the footage turned out to be entirely irrelevant , because Omar Suleiman came on TV and gave all 12 seconds of his speech . And then suddenly , we ran out to the balcony , and then I just grabbed my stuff , ran down into the street . And then I just ran into the middle of the square . People were shouting and screaming and crying , saying that they were going to take their country into their own hands , that they were going to build it . People feel enabled ; people feel empowered . People feel like the -- you know , the country 's future is in their hands . It 's a feeling that they 've never had before . And I think one of the most beautiful things I saw , because I -- you know , I took a long walk around , and I walked up to Asanir -LRB- ph -RRB- Bridge , which is where I came originally into Tahrir Square , which was a very cleansing feeling . But the most beautiful -- the most beautiful sight was the sight of children chanting that they should -- you know , hold your head high , you 're an Egyptian . COOPER : So many people around the world have watched this and , I think , underestimated you and the other protestors from the beginning , said , `` Oh , they 're too young . They do n't know what they 're doing . They 're too idealistic . '' And then they said , `` Well , they can never stand up to the government , '' and the protestors did that . And then they said the full demands will never be met , and the full demands were met . And now they 're saying , well , what happens now ? You know , will this revolution be overtaken by a group like the Muslim Brotherhood or by the military ? Do you have faith that the Egyptian people have somehow found a voice and will not lose that voice ? ABDULLAH : I know for sure . And also -- I mean , something to say about the Muslim Brotherhood is I think they have fundamentally changed over the , you know , over the last few weeks . There they were , you know -- they 've been living in a -- they 've been living in the square , you know , in and amongst people from all walks of life . The tent I was in , you know , directly -- directly next door to me were a whole group of Muslim Brotherhood , and I had a long conversation with them yesterday . And you know , I think the way that they think has changed . But I mean , regardless of all that , I do n't think there 's any possibility of them coming to power . And as regards the military , I think the military knows that it 's in the service of the people . COOPER : What do you see in the months ahead ? Do you see -- I talked to Mohammed ElBaradei earlier today . He said , `` Look , we need a year . Egypt needs a year in order to develop democratic institutions , in order to develop parties , in order for people to grow and support different parties , and for free and fair elections to actually take place . '' Do you see a birth now of parties ? Do you see the birth of democratic institutions happening ? ABDULLAH : In terms of political parties , I think now there 's going to be a flourishing of voices . People want to participate . And that 's an extraordinary thing . I mean -- and not just people who were here . I mean , not just Egyptians who were here . Egyptians who were abroad . What has happened here , you have to understand this , that under Hosni Mubarak there was no space for political participation . There was no space for feeling like you were part of this country 's future . COOPER : Khalid Abdullah , appreciate your time . Thank you , Khalid . ABDULLAH : Thank you so much . And I just need -- I just need to say to you again -- I just need to say it to you again : it has really meant so much , your coverage , to all of us here . So thank you very much for everything you 've done . COOPER : Thank you . It 's an honor to be reporting on your efforts . Egyptians still celebrating , nearly 12 hours after the announcement Mubarak is stepping down . Some insights , some of the best sights and sounds , the most remarkable moments from all over the country that we 've heard in the last 12 hours . And we 'll some final thoughts from Dr. Fouad Ajami and Ben Wedeman and Ivan Watson and others on the ground . COOPER : Well , today , revolution is what we witnessed : a long - ruling dictator driven from power and a long-oppressed people celebrating still in the streets , in that square , waving their country 's flags , honking horns , tasting freedom for the first time . The Egyptian people are demanding democracy . Whether they get it , they are demanding it . Right now , today , old Egypt is dead . A new Egypt is born . OMAR SULEIMAN , VICE PRESIDENT OF EGYPT -LRB- through translator -RRB- : President Mohamed Hosni Mubarak has decided to step down as president of Egypt and has assigned the higher council of the armed forces to run the affairs of the country . Hosni Mubarak is stepping down . GHONIM -LRB- via phone -RRB- : I 'm proud to be Egyptian . I just want to say from the bottom of my heart congratulations to all Egyptians , and I want to say welcome back , Egypt . MOHAMED ELBARADEI , OPPOSITION LEADER -LRB- via phone -RRB- : It 's a sense of liberation for me , for every Egyptian . A sense of emancipation of the whole Egyptian people . And for the first time , Egypt has a chance to be democratic , to be free . Egyptians have a sense of dignity , of freedom . So it 's amazing . It 's like 180 degrees . It 's something we never experienced in our lifetime . BARACK OBAMA , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATS : One Egyptian put it simply : most people have discovered in the last few days that they are worth something . And this can not be taken away from them any more . NIC ROBERTSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : There 's a feeling of euphoria down here . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I 'm so excited . I can actually hardly hear what you 're saying , so I 'm just going to give them a chance to talk . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I am very happy now . Always the people of Egypt are very happy because Mubarak is going . And we will rebuild Egypt . I repeat , we will rebuild Egypt . And I think we deserve this , as we make this . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I think it 's the best day ever . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Today is an overwhelming day for Egypt . Everyone is finally free . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : We had a chance to taste freedom . COOPER : Egyptians riding the wave of history today , harnessing that wave , and the wave washed us all today . Incredible day in history . Let 's get some final thoughts . Ivan Watson is in Cairo , Ben Wedeman , as well . Here in New York , Professor Fouad Ajami . Ben , your thoughts ? It 's hard to process , probably but do you have a final thought for us tonight ? WEDEMAN : My thought is 18 days -- 18 days from the first what seemed like a modest demonstration , which grew very big to what we saw today . Huge demonstrations in Tahrir Square . Huge demonstrations outside the president 's palace . Huge demonstrations outside of state TV . We really saw the ability of the Egyptian people . And the power of people to bring down a regime that so many people thought was permanent , could n't be shaken . It 's been a life changing experience to see this happen in so short a period of time . 18 days -- Anderson . COOPER : Ben and your photographer Mary Rogers have covered it unlike anyone else . Will continue , no doubt . Ivan Watson , a thought from you ? WATSON : I 've been covering this region in the Middle East . It 's sadly all too often a blood-soaked region of conflict and extremism . And I just feel honored to have been able to witness up close a bright and shining very pure moment of history here where Arabs , Egyptians got up and taught me that they could do something just really , really beautiful and peaceful and make change and believe in it . And -- and it brings out an idealist in you in a world of cynicism . It was really incredible . And this revolution was growing until the moment that we heard President Mubarak was -- ex-President Mubarak was stepping down . We were watching the crowds coming up by foot from Tahrir Square six miles away to the presidential palace and the people who were already there embracing them . When that news hit , it was an explosion of joy and I saw two men drop to their knees and start praying right away . It 's an amazing couple of weeks . COOPER : Ivan , you and your photographer , Joe Durand -LRB- ph -RRB- and Tommy Evans and all the team from CNN on the ground and all the reporters , you 've risked your lives in the last two weeks , and we thank you for your reporting . FOUAD AJAMI , JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY : I echo these gifts -LRB- ph -RRB- that reporters have done the story heroically , I think . You know , the Caireans , the people of Cairo , love their city , and they have this great label for it . They call it `` Umya dinya '' -LRB- ph -RRB- , the mother of the world . This is a city that was established a millennium ago , and it has fallen on hard times and they wish to rebuild it . They wish to reclaim it . And the Egyptians have a memory . It helps them that they have a memory . A good period in their history . The inter-war years in Egypt were years of a vibrant democracy : women 's emancipation . Great filmmakers , great artists , great novelists , genuine parliamentary competition . So it 's not like they have to do something that they 've never done before . They just have to find their bearing and they have to erase the legacy of this despotism , and they will find their way . COOPER : Fouad , I appreciate you being with us in many of these 18 days . Some important news after the break . We 'll be right back . COOPER : Before we end , a quick check of the other day 's stories . Joe Johns has a `` 360 Bulletin '' -- Joe . JOE JOHNS , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Anderson , today was the last day in the briefing room for White House press secretary Robert Gibbs . President Obama bid him farewell by returning a tie to Gibbs , now framed , that Mr. Obama borrowed from him to give the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in 2004 . Gibbs will become an outside advisor to the president . An unusual light show in eastern Ohio . A gas pipeline exploded last night , shooting flames 200 feet into the air , which could be seen for miles . The explosion happened in a rural area . No one was injured . And the condition of this humpback whale is likely due to scoliosis or curvature of the spine and not the result of a collision with a ship . That 's what a marine expert told a newspaper . A pilot spotted the whale off Hawaii 's coast this week and assumed the whale was injured by a ship . Joe , thank you very much . We 're going to continue to follow the story of Egypt in the days and the weeks and the months ahead . Want to thank you for sticking with us throughout this coverage . Our story of Egypt continues and so will our coverage . Back to Cairo at the top of the hour . More history being made .

Hosni Mubarak ruled Egypt for nearly 30 years , surviving would-be assassins , ill health He was a major player in Mideast politics , helping enforce the Camp David accords with Israel Mubarak did n't allow political dissent , and had a questionable economic track record Mubarak 's fall signals the start of a new era in Arab politics Cairo , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For nearly 30 years , one man dominated Egypt . Hosni Mubarak , 82 , survived would-be assassins and ill health , crushed a rising Islamist radical movement , and maintained the peace with neighboring Israel that got his predecessor killed . His government 's continued observance of the Camp David accords was the cornerstone of what peace has been achieved in the decades-long Arab-Israeli conflict . But following the revolt that toppled Tunisia 's longtime strongman , demonstrators in the streets of Cairo stood up to riot police , chanting , `` Mubarak , Saudi Arabia is waiting for you . '' Ultimately , the demonstrations helped bring down the man critics called Egypt 's last pharaoh . Mubarak decided Friday to step down , Vice President Omar Suleiman said on state television . Now that Mubarak is finally exiting the political stage , the debate over his legacy is growing louder . Longtime observers of the region say the stability Mubarak purchased for nearly three decades came at the cost of entrenched poverty and repression in the Arab world 's most populous nation . `` Egypt is a broken country , '' Fawaz Gerges , a professor of Middle Eastern relations at the London School of Economics , told CNN . `` It used to be the jewel of the Middle East . It 's the capital of its cultural production . '' But now , Gerges said , `` Egyptians have no outlets . They do n't feel that they have a sense of hope for the future . '' Mubarak was a Soviet-trained pilot who was chief of staff of Egypt 's air force during the 1973 Mideast war . The early success of Egyptian pilots against Israel made him a national hero , and then-President Anwar Sadat made him vice president in 1975 . Six years later , Sadat died in a hail of gunfire at a military parade , killed by Islamic militants from within the army 's own ranks after he took the dramatic step of making peace with Israel . Upon assuming office , one of Mubarak 's first acts was to declare a state of emergency that barred unauthorized assembly , restricted freedom of speech and allowed police to jail people indefinitely . He made extensive use of those powers in the ensuing decades . The Egyptian army put down riots by disgruntled police officers in 1986 , and he threw an estimated 30,000 people in jail when jihadists carried out a string of attacks on tourists . `` He pretty much wiped them out , '' University of Michigan Professor of History Juan Cole said . `` It 's not an accident that they were in Afghanistan instead of Egypt . '' The government penetrated opposition movements so thoroughly that `` if five people -LRB- sat -RRB- down to plot something , the fifth person -LRB- wrote -RRB- a report to Hosni Mubarak about it , '' he said . The result was `` a regime that has very little legitimacy , but presents itself as something there 's no point in trying to change , '' said Nathan Brown , a professor of Middle Eastern politics at George Washington University in Washington . But Brown said the January 14 overthrow of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , who fled to Saudi Arabia after 23 years in power , changed the thinking of many in the region . `` I think what the events in Tunisia did was take that sense that nothing could ever change and lead a few people to question it , '' he said . Mubarak headed off a similar movement in 2005 , when Egyptians mounted large-scale protests to demand fundamental and widespread reform . He intimidated the leaders of the officially banned but tolerated Muslim Brotherhood , harassed middle-class demonstrators and managed to pick off the leadership of those protests , Brown said . But the most recent protest movement had `` no real leadership , so it -LRB- could n't -RRB- be decapitated the same way , '' Brown noted . Mubarak won four terms as president in elections that were considered formalities . His fifth , in 2005 , was Egypt 's first multi-party presidential vote , but it was widely criticized as a `` sham , '' Cole said . Meanwhile , the country 's economy stagnated for the first 20 years of Mubarak 's rule . Development picked up in the last decade , fueled by a move away from state control and by billions in tourist dollars , but gains were `` very unevenly distributed , '' Gerges said . About 40 % of Egyptians currently live in poverty , he noted . The aging autocrat escaped at least two assassination attempts , including a close call in 1995 when Islamic militants opened fire on his motorcade at a pan-African conference in Ethiopia . In recent years , Mubarak had several bouts of illness but never picked a vice president . He was widely believed to have anointed his son Gamal as his successor , but later insisted he never intended for his son to take power . In 2003 , Mubarak collapsed while delivering a televised speech to the Egyptian parliament -- returning later to blame his illness on the flu . He had back surgery in Germany in 2004 , returning in 2010 to have his gall bladder removed . He largely withdrew from public view in recent years . His domestic political situation was closely watched overseas , particularly in the United States . In the past decade , Egypt has been a major player in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks , and it contributed troops to the U.S.-led coalition that drove Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991 . It receives about $ 1.3 billion in military aid from Washington every year -- second only to Israel -- and has received nearly $ 30 billion in economic aid since 1975 , according to State Department figures . But it opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 , and while sticking with Camp David , Egypt 's ties with Israel amount to a `` cold peace , '' Cole said . President Barack Obama said recently that Mubarak was `` very helpful on a range of tough issues , '' but prodded the Egyptian leader to take steps toward reform . `` You can see these pent-up frustrations that are being displayed on the streets , '' Obama said . He urged the Egyptian government to avoid resorting to violence to put down the recent demonstrations , adding , `` I think it 's very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances . '' Gerges said the Middle East has seen `` the barrier of fear '' removed since the events in Tunisia . `` Arabs really no longer feel terrified of the security apparatus '' in Egypt and elsewhere , he said . `` We 're going to have a new era of politics .

'' Iranian leaders praised the Egyptian and Tunisian uprisings and said they were reminiscent of the 1979 Iranian revolution that toppled the shah of Iran and ushered in a hard-line and theocratic Islamic republic . But Iranian authorities have blocked reformist websites and detained several opposition supporters and activists , opposition website Saham News reported Thursday . This comes just days after two leading opposition figures called for a rally on February 14 in support of the uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East . Iranian authorities on Wednesday warned against any attempt by the opposition movement to hold the rally , according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency . Opposition leaders and former presidential candidates Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi requested permission to hold the rally earlier this week , according to Saham News , Karrubi 's website . It was unclear whether the government has denied the request . Moussavi and Karrubi asked that the rally take place in Tehran 's Azadi Square , the site of mass protests by Iran 's opposition movement after the disputed 2009 presidential elections . For nearly eight months , supporters of Iran 's so-called Green Movement chose major calendar days to protest in cities throughout the country . Many of the movement 's grievances were identical to those now being expressed in the streets of Cairo . Protesters condemned what they called an oppressive regime , demanded political and social freedom and called for a more representative government . Iran eventually quelled the demonstrations with a brutal crackdown against the peaceful street protests and the arrests of hundreds of activists , reformists and opposition figures , some of whom remain behind bars . Since the unrest , Iranian authorities have rejected all requests by Iran 's opposition movement for peaceful demonstrations .

It s not difficult to feel invested in these scenes when you ve spent 18 days writing Egypt s story without ever really knowing what the conclusion would be . We don t know it now but the unique images we have broadcast on CNN -LRB- horses and camels rushing through Tahrir Square , thousands praying as protesters threw rocks behind them , apparent innocents taking bullets to the head , and Mubarak s none-too-ambiguous podium appearance just last night -RRB- are indelible in the minds of viewers around the world . We have introduced various players -LRB- opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei , VP Omar Suleiman and protest talisman Wael Ghonim among them -RRB- , little knowing what their influence might be .

ANDERSON COOPER , CNN ANCHOR : We have Wael Ghonim on the phone . I just want to get him because we 've lost him twice on the phone . Wael , your thoughts on this extraordinary moment . WAEL GHONIM , EGYPTIAN ACTIVIST -LRB- via telephone -RRB- : I 'm proud to be Egyptian . I just want to say , you know , from the bottom of my heart congratulations to all Egyptians . And , you know , I want to say welcome back , Egypt . To me , I 've read about Egypt in the history books . And , you know , they convinced us for 30 days -- for 30 years that Egypt died and there 's no more Egypt . We are just , you know , a generation that need to eat and sleep . You know , tens of thousands on the 25th decided to start a search , a journey for Egypt . And then they convinced hundreds of thousands then they convinced millions of people . We were all looking for Egypt and thank god that we found her today . I just want to say , welcome back , Egypt . I just want to say to Hosni Mubarak and to Omar Suleiman and to all those people who thought that being in power means you can oppress people , you know , hard-luck guys , you know , at the end of the day , we have a choice and we 've made our choice , by the way , very early enough and you should have respected that . You are responsible of the killings of 300 innocent Egyptians . You guys paid the price , are still going to pay the price . It 's enough , it 's enough for you guys that in history books they 're going to talk to you -- they 'll say one word to describe you , the dictators .

Today is the day for celebration . It 's very hard for me now to even think . We have been -- we have n't been sleeping for a few days . We 've been under a lot of war -- among the media war . I 'm was also -- I 'm also mind in the morning -- and a lot of people saying , Wael , you have been all the time logical and not emotional , what 's going on with you . So I need to refer -- restore my calm attitude . I 'm not an angry person , and I became an angry person . I need to rest and sleep . So does my friends . There are a lot of grateful officials -LRB- ph -RRB- Egypt that we trust . These guys -- there are a lot of people who care about Egypt . And today I think the problem is solved . The real problem is solved because the people in power were the problem because they did n't want to leave , they were scared of , you know , losing power and then pay the consequences . Now as they lost power , there will be no problem . COOPER : How concerned are you that the apparatus of the state repression , the secret police , the interior ministry are all still there ? GHONIM : Come on , they are not there . We are much stronger . We are much -- we are much stronger than all these guys . We 're much stronger than all these guys . So I met with the minister of the interior so many times . I speak to him one-to-one . I told him what I do n't like , I tell him -- so this is what works . I , you know , one year ago I said the internet is going to change the political scene in Egypt . You know , today I will tell -- you know , on the 25th , I said that what was Egypt before 25th of January is never going to be like Egypt after 25th of January . Today , I 'm telling you Egypt is going to be a democratic state . Egypt will start a new start and you will be impressed how fast we will be developing . COOPER : And your thoughts at this moment also must turn to all those who have lost their lives just in the last two weeks , so much blood has been spilled . Those people are the real heroes . Those people are the real heroes . You know , like there are lots of people that we know that have died . And also , I would n't forget those who are arrested . There are about a thousand people that no knows where are they right now . We are looking for them . We want them back . And , you know , the real heroes are the ones in the streets . The real heroes today are every single Egyptian . There is no one leading this . Anyone who is telling you he is one of the leaders is not saying the truth . The leaders , you know , on Tahrir Square was every single person there . The leader in Alexandria is every single person there . This was a revolution . As I told you guys on my interview this is a revolution 2.0 . Just like Wikipedia how everyone is contributing to the content and there is now master plan . Our revolution , everyone is contributing to the revolution and there was no master plan as well . COOPER : Did you believe this day would come when you set up that first website , when you were in detention and blindfolded and held ? GHONIM : Certainly , I fully believed . I knew this from the day that I left Tunisia . I knew it that Hosni is going to leave Egypt . COOPER : You knew from the day the dictator left in Tunisia that Mubarak would leave ultimately ? Because at the end of the day , you know , at the moment you break the psychological barrier of fear , the moment you break the fear , the moment you convince people that if they die it 's better for them to die for a good cause than to live without dignity , which is something that we all worked on in our message at the very beginning , then you should be sure that you are going to win . Because these guys are so corrupted , these dictators do n't care about the people . They care about their lives . And for them life is much , you know , life is much worth it . And it 's shame for us , you know , I was -LRB- inaudible -RRB- went I said I was ready to die . I love my life . We all want to live . We do n't want to die . We all want to live and we all want to build our country . We all want to make our society free and open-minded . We all want this country to go where it should be . We should be among those great countries in the world . We can do it and we will do it . WOLF BLITZER , CNN ANCHOR : Wael , this is Wolf Blitzer in Washington . First of all , do you trust the High Council of the Egyptian military to supervise implementation towards democracy ? GHONIM : I am not a political expert and I am -- such a question right now I would n't answer because I do n't have the background to answer . But what I care about now is that everyone -- I trust 80 million Egyptians . I really trust 80 million Egyptians and I really trust that these people in the street now have broken the psychological barrier , after being ready to die for such a good cause of liberating their country , will always make sure that whomever in power is going to work on the people 's agenda . And I also believe that the army , that the Egyptian army , is so unique . And the fact that these guys really want the safety of Egypt . And they have already issued a report that says that they are respecting our demands , that they want to protect our demands , and we want our demands to happen . So , definitely , the Egyptian army is trustworthy right now for me , and I 'm not really worried , because as I said , I trust 80 million Egyptians . BLITZER : The other question , Wael , I had is first Tunisia , now Egypt . You 're giving Facebook a lot of credit for this ? GHONIM : Yes , for sure . I want to meet Mark Zuckerberg one day and thank him , actually . BLITZER : Tell us why you think Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg helped get people in Egypt and Tunisia and presumably other countries in the not-too-distant free . GHONIM : Well , I ca n't talk about Tunisia . I 'm talking on behalf of Egypt , because -- BLITZER : All right . So tell us about Egypt . GHONIM : Yes , Tunisia was a bit of a different case . This revolution started online . This revolution started on Facebook . This revolution started in June , 2010 , when hundreds of thousands of Egyptians started corroborating content . You know , like , we would post a video on Facebook , it would be shared by 50,000 people on their walls within a few hours . We -- you know , I always said that if you want to liberate us , society in Egypt , give them the Internet . If you want to have a free society , just give them the Internet . The reason why the Internet is -- like , help you fight the media war , which is basically a war that the Egyptian government , the Egyptian regime playing very well in 1970 , 1980 , 1990 . And when the Internet came , it really could n't . I 'm going to talk a lot about this . I plan to write a book called `` The Revolution 2.0 . '' That will say everything about , you know , from the start , from when there was nothing until the end , and highlight the role of , you know , social media and the rest of the stuff . HALA GORANI , CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR\\/CORRESPONDENT : Wael , this is Hala Gorani at the CNN Center . I was just curious -- you know , you 've become an emblem for so many in this revolution , a figurehead . Your name , your appearances in Tahrir Square , I talked about . Do you want to now become involved in politics in your country ? Do you want to take on a leadership role in this pro-democracy movement , Wael ? GHONIM : I want to go back to my company and work . I do n't -- I think it will be a big mistake right now for me to be involved . Also , if you read history , you know , the people who help making the revolution should not be part of the revolution afterward . I think my mission has been accomplished . I just need to work for a few days to make sure that the country is in safe hands , and then I need to disappear from the scene . I was not the leader , by the way . It just happened I got all the attention that I do n't deserve . And I 'm not downplaying the role . This is the truth . The real people you guys should be hosting on your show is not me . It 's actually the people in Tahrir Square who slept 18 days and saw their friends and families dying beside them . Those are the real heroes . And I want you -- I urge you to actually meet a lot of these guys , and do n't put a lot of spotlight on people like me . At the end of the day , my role was accomplished . I really wanted this to be an anonymous movement until I was arrested and , you know , they found out . And then a lot of -- you know , a lot of speculation , and some news agencies announced that I was the admin of the page . I really did n't want to be known for this moment . I do n't want all the attention to come to me . My mission is over . I want to go back to see my kids . I want to go back to start working , you know , do some work . I want to be a Normal person . And this is about the Egyptians heroes . Those guys -- I 'm not worried about this country having to see all these people in the street right now . BLITZER : Wael Ghonim , it 's been a pleasure listening to you and hearing from you . More importantly , congratulations to all the people of Egypt right now . This is truly a revolutionary day in the history of Egypt , a proud country with thousands of years of history . We 're watching new history unfold . And we want to thank you for all your good work . Thanks very much , and we hope to stay in close touch with you . GHONIM : I want to say a final word . Thanks to you and you folks on Tahrir Square . You guys have played a great role in saving the lives of hundreds , if not thousands , of people . This regime did not care about the people , and they would have killed a lot of people if there was no international media . CNN did a great job . You guys deserve a great recognition from all the Egyptian people . We 're not going to forget your role . And I wanted to clarify when I said I did n't want to talk to international media . It was only because I do n't want the regime to start doing media -- I have nothing against the American people , of course . My wife is American . And I also have nothing against international media . It 's just the fact that the regime had been , you know , misleading all the Egyptians and telling them the wrong messages . You guys are heroes , as well . You are part of the revolution . You should be proud of yourself . BLITZER : Well , we just want to say the whole world was watching what was happening on the streets of Cairo , in part because of us , but in part because of other television satellite networks , in part because of you and what millions of Egyptians were doing on Facebook , on Twitter , and all sorts of other social network sites . Anderson or Hala , do you have a final thought you want to share with Wael before we let him go ? COOPER : Wael , we just got a thing crossing the Reuters wires saying that Egypt 's Supreme Military Council will sack the cabinet , suspend both houses of parliament , and govern with the head of the Supreme Court . That just tells me what I thought of the military . These guys do n't want to be in power . These guys want Egypt to come back . I think that we are on the right track . I think that even if -- I 'm not scared . I 'm not afraid of -- I mean , I do n't fear the history . As I told you , even if I do n't trust anyone , I just 80 million Egyptians . This is the time where history is being rewritten right now . As I said on Twitter before , that day -- you know , the last line of corruption and , you know , oppression has been written . We took a pen from them , we flipped the page . And now we 're drawing our future . We are dreamers , and we made it happen . And it 's time now to celebrate for a couple of days , and then go back and start thinking about , how can we develop the strategy and what 's the best for us ? GHONIM : Wael , I just have one question . I think it 's going to be one of those moments when we all remember , you know , where we were when a historic event took place . Where were you and what was your immediate reaction when you heard Omar Suleiman say the president has stepped down ? I was actually in my mom 's house with a lot of -- you know , we were meeting in my mom 's house a lot to decide -- like , a lot of activists . And we were having -- it was sort of like the center of my plan , of my planning session . So I was there . And all of a sudden , like , I heard my mom screaming . I went out and , you know , it was amazing . She started hugging me and kissing me and hysterically crying . And it was -- you know , the rest of the family came . It was really good . BLITZER : All right . Let me just thank Wael again . Wael , you 'll be happy to know the Twitter universe is exploding right now with your words that you want to meet Mark Zuckerberg . Do n't be surprised if you get a call from him sometime soon . We wo n't be surprised either . I mean , ask him to call me . Ask him to call me . BLITZER : He 'll be calling you . I would n't be surprised . You 'll let us know how that conversation goes . Let 's go to -- I think we 're going to go to Ivan Watson . He 's over at the presidential palace . Excuse me , Arwa Damon . She 's in Tahrir Square . Let 's go to Arwa first . We 'll check in with Ivan in a few moments . But Arwa , set the scene for us . And do me a favor when you 're there . I want to hear from the crowd . Take a moment and let 's hear what the folks are saying . ARWA DAMON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : First of all , the scene here is something completely unimaginable . The ambience , the energy that has been emanating from these demonstrators who have been here day in , day out , for more than two weeks now , Wolf , they have truly achieved the unimaginable , and they 're fully aware of that . To think that demonstrations that began through the Internet , through Facebook and Twitter , have now resulted in one of the Middle East 's longest-standing dictators stepping aside , it 's something that no one , not just me , in the entire region ever imagined could be possible . The crowds are so happy at this point in time . They erupted in complete celebration . Strangers hugging each other . People praising one another saying , `` Thanks to God , '' calling Mubarak -- keep bearing in mind , they still want to hold him accountable for the billions of dollars that he has managed to gather over the years that he 's been in power . They also want to hold him accountable for the blood that has been spilled here . But at least now they know and they say that that blood has not been spilled in vain . And I 'm sorry , Wolf . I did not catch the second part of your question . BLITZER : I want to hear a little bit of the sound from the people in Tahrir Square . If you or your photographer can get that microphone up , let 's just listen and then come back in a few seconds and you 'll translate what we 're hearing . Just be quiet for a second . DAMON : How are you feeling ? DAMON : Wolf , I do n't know if you caught that , but two young men here very excited , unable to speak , unable to put their emotions into words . -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- they 're busting out in song right now . We 're not just a bunch of people . We 're not just a bunch of people anymore . DAMON : Wolf , I do n't know if you heard all of that , but there you have it . The crowd here now -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . BLITZER : Yes , it 's hard to hear , but we made it out . These people are really , really excited , Arwa . Let 's listen in once again , see if we can make out what 's going on . DAMON : Wolf , if you 're still with me , this is truly an incredible moment . COOPER : Wolf -- one of the things , Wolf , that man was just saying is , `` We 're just not a bunch of kids . '' And what he 's referring to is comments made by Vice President Suleiman and President Mubarak over the last two weeks , basically categorizing these people as just young people kind of full of youthful exuberance , but who need to go on home , get back to work , go back to school . At one point , the vice president was even saying , we 're not going to push them out , but we 're going to tell their parents to bring them home . It was a patronizing attitude which infuriated many , and particularly last night , in the comments made by Suleiman and particularly by Mubarak . It really angered people , feeling like they were -- like the blood that they had spilled and the sacrifices they had made had been ignored and was being -- and that they were being disrespected , as many people feel they 've been disrespected over the last 30 years by the secret police and by uniformed police there who kind of have a very heavy hand and a cavalier attitude and feel they can do whatever they want . Ivan Watson is by the presidential palace . Ivan , the scene there is , I assume , very similar to Liberation Square . But this is the first time -- it was only in the last 24 hours that we had started to see even crowds going as far as the presidential palace . IVAN WATSON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : That 's right . Just a few thousand people here this afternoon , and the crowd starting swelling . And when the news came out , my God , it was an explosion . Now it 's a big street party here . You 've got people honking their horns . There were fireworks , people throwing confetti , dancing in the street right here , as well . And what 's interesting , Anderson , before , many of the demonstrators were predominantly young men . But now families are out in the streets with their kids . And I 'm right next to a 32-year-old out Rania Zaid -LRB- ph -RRB- , who is out here with her husband and little son Ali . Why are you here ? How do you feel right now , Rania -LRB- ph -RRB- . RANIA ZAID -LRB- ph -RRB- , PROTESTER : I 'm very happy because of the revolution . And I finally feel secure for my children . Egyptians and their culture and history really deserve freedom . WATSON : And people here saying they 've never seen a party like this before , Anderson . It 's really -- I expect there will be dancing in the streets all night tonight here in Cairo -- Anderson . COOPER : It 's incredible to see these pictures , Hala , that we 're looking at from Liberation Square . Right before , we were seeing the overpass , the highway overpass where , just a week ago , there were pro-Mubarak mobs throwing rocks from -- looks like there is a large bonfire in one part of the square . Let 's listen in . Frederik Pleitgen is there overlooking the scene . Frederik , are those fireworks or some sort of incendiary device someone is just kind of waving around ? FREDERIK PLEITGEN , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Yes . I mean , it 's an absolutely amazing scene here . You were talking about this highway overpass , Anderson , just a second ago . If we pan down there , I can tell you that right now , it 's a big street party that 's going on . The people are dancing in the streets . Traffic seems to be backed up almost all the way to Sudan , it looks like , there 's so many cars coming in . There 's people walking around with giant Egyptian flags . And one of the interesting things that happened right after we heard the announcement , or shortly after , is that you 'll remember those barricades where that street fighting was going on just a couple of days ago , where the pro-and-anti-Mubarak protesters were beating up on each other . All those barricades just toppled down , and an amazing amount of people charged onto Tahrir Square . And that 's where the crowd keeps going and going . There 's more and more people now that these boundaries have come down who are charging in there . Meanwhile , right in front of us , on that big highway overpass , it 's becoming more and more of a parking lot , as there 's almost no way to get through here . People just absolutely dancing in the street , setting off fireworks , and walking around with these giant Egyptian flags . And really , the interesting thing is also the cheering just has n't died down ever since the announcement was made . And there still is a massive stream of people coming towards Tahrir Square . It seems like thousands , tens of thousands , are walking over the streets below us , and also on that highway overpass -- Anderson . COOPER : Frederik , I think it was exactly a week ago when you were -- had snuck back into the square after two days of heavy fighting . You made your way into the square and actually were behind the barricades looking at the rocks and all the weaponry that the peaceful crowds there had had to try to assemble to defend themselves . It 's an extraordinary turn of events one week later to see that same spot full of nothing but joy . It 's an amazing turn of events . And , I mean , I remember that you were down there , as well , in that area when those people were facing off and those street battles were so vicious . I mean , if you just think back at all the things that we saw when we were down there , the camel and horse charge , the rocks flying back and forth , the sticks , as you said , those people who were fortifying those positions for such an amount of time , and then to have this end so peacefully is really a remarkable thing . And it 's something that we 've been seeing ever since those pro- Mubarak demonstrators came off the street , is that this crowd has just become absolutely peaceful . They were still quite wary that the military might try and take the barricades down , might try and drive them off the square . However , the crowd itself , the anti-Mubarak protesters , always a very peaceful crowd , always intent on stopping violence , never letting a situation get out of hand . That 's certainly the way it has been over the past couple of days . And one of the interesting things , Anderson , I have to say , form yesterday , last night , when we were hearing Mubarak 's speech , people were so angry . But people then came up to me and they told me it is important that they can be angry , but they can not get violent , because they knew that their message was going to be much more powerful if they did n't become violent . And many of them believed that Hosni Mubarak was trying to incite them to be violent so that he could mount a crackdown . But they said it is something that they can not do , and they really felt that their message would just have that much more impact if they remained nonviolent . And as we can see it seems to have had just that effect -- Anderson . GORANI : Fred , I have a quick question . Where are all those tanks that were in Tahrir Square -- BLITZER : Hala -- hold on one second , everybody . Just stand by for one second . The vice president of the United States , Joe Biden , is in Kentucky , and we 're told he 's speaking right now about Egypt . JOSEPH BIDEN , VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : And we stood for and we continue to stand for a set of core principles . The first is that violence and intimidation against peaceful demonstrators is totally , thoroughly unacceptable . Secondly , that the universal rights of the Egyptian people must be respected and their aspirations must be met . And thirdly , that the transition , the transition that is taking place , must be an irreversible change and a negotiated path toward democracy . Now , I would add one last point . And I think Mitch would agree . Even in this contentious political climate in which we work , on this issue the United States is largely speaking with one voice , Democrats and Republicans alike , speaking with the same voice . This unity has been important , and it will be even more important in these delicate and fateful days ahead . So I will not speak more about this today . I had planned on speaking more about it , but it 's much more appropriate that we all wait . And the president will deliver his statement on this in about an hour . But what is at stake in Egypt and across the Middle East is not just about Egypt alone . It 's not -- it will not just touch Egypt alone . You may remember that all this began when a fruit vendor in Tunisia , fed up with the indignity of a corrupt government and a stagnant economy , literally set himself on fire . And in doing so , ignited the passions of millions and millions of people throughout that region . Word spread across national boundaries , and movements emerged , led by people no older than some of the students in this room using some of the same social media tools that the students in this room and many of you use , which I might add is a powerful example of our increasingly interconnected world . It 's a vivid demonstration of the transformative times in which we live , times that many of you will have the opportunity to literally shape . Few generations ever have the opportunity just to bend history just a little bit . Few ever have that opportunity . This generation and we do . As we began the second decade of this young century , so much is in flux -- BLITZER : All right . So there you have a little preview of what the president of the United States might be saying within about an hour or so from now . Joe Biden , the vice president , speaking in Kentucky as history unfolding in Egypt right now . He says this is a pivotal moment in history right now . A fair statement indeed . Kate Bolduan is over at the White House . About an hour or so from now we 'll be seeing and hearing the president of the United States . Kate , what are they saying at the White House ? Any immediate reaction beyond what we just heard from the vice president ? KATE BOLDUAN , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Well , Wolf , we 're hearing -- the morning started pretty slowly and pretty quiet around here , and it is abuzz here at the White House right now . We 're told that President Obama was informed of President Mubarak 's decision to step down when he was in the Oval Office , during a meeting in the Oval Office . And then the president himself stepped out of the Oval Office to the outer oval to actually watch several minutes of television coverage as the crowds were erupting on the streets of Cairo and really across Egypt . And what we heard from Vice President Biden right there , when he talked about the core principles that the U.S. stands for , that mirrored almost exactly what President Obama said in his strongly - worded statement that he put out last night talking about the universal rights of the people of Egypt needing to be respected , as well as a key phrase that -- a key phrase calling for `` concrete and irreversible political change to be set into action . '' I 'm sure that we 'll be hearing more of this from President Obama . As you mentioned , we 're expecting to hear from him probably in about an hour to get his reaction to what is all unfolding on the streets of Cairo and what he is learning . But I 'll tell you this , Wolf . One of the last things that President Obama said in his statement last night I think is -- probably we 're going to hear more of in the days to come , as well as this afternoon . He says that , `` I know the Egyptian people will persevere , and they must know that they will continue to have a friend in the United States of America , '' reaffirming that the U.S. supports the people of Egypt and really reaffirming what we have heard from this president all along , that the future of Egypt lies in the hands of the Egyptian people . But as one White House official has told our John King , it 's a pretty unpredictable chapter that we are now entering . And I 'm looking forward to hearing from President Obama in about an hour and what he sees as the path forward could be -- Wolf . BLITZER : As they celebrate in Cairo , in Tahrir Square , we 'll be getting ready to hear from the president of the United States . We 'll have live coverage here on CNN and CNN International in one hour or so from the White House . Let me bring back Hala Gorani . Hala , I know that U.S. officials are relieved , at least right now , that the Egyptian military is taking charge , because the U.S. does have a very strong , important relationship with the Egyptian military , the highest leaders , the top commanders of the Egyptian military . And they have confidence that the Egyptian military right now , at least for a transition to democracy , to free and fair elections , they 're confident that the Egyptian military , better than any other institution in Egypt , can get this job done . So they 're taking a little breath at the White House and they 're pleased by this latest turn of events . GORANI : Yes , they have a strong relationship with the Egyptian military . People in the streets are telling our reporters that they trust the military to transition the country . Now , that 's , of course , going to be something we 're going to have to look out for . But look at these crowds , a live image of Tahrir Square . Fred Pleitgen is , I think , in the middle of all of this . Fred , we just the viewers to take in the atmosphere here . Just tell us what you 're seeing and what you 're hearing . PLEITGEN : Well , I have this great vantage point which is , of course , right above everything that 's going on here . And I can tell you it 's absolutely amazing to see . It seems like almost all of Egypt trying to come here with their cars . People have been honking . People are waving the Egyptian flag . And there 's so many people who are just sort of dancing on the street , dancing around . It really is a remarkable scene , especially in light of the fact that we saw so much violence in this area . As you can see , the sort of massive highway overpass , one of the main thoroughfares through Cairo , is just starting to turn into a parking lot with more and more people coming here . And on the square , you can just see how it 's getting fuller and fuller as more and more people are coming in here , also waving Egyptian flags . We 've been able to speak to some people who are down there , and many of them said that this was really the beginning of a new era for this country . There were some actually who were calling for President Hosni Mubarak to be tried in court , but others were just saying they truly believe this is a new beginning for their country , this is their chance for freedom and democracy . And one of the interesting things that some were saying to us is they were saying that they hope that America will not intervene , will allow them to do this , and that America will have patience with these people who have just apparently , they believe , won their freedom . So it really is amazing . And there 's so many people , also , Hala , who we saw who were crying , in tears . It 's an absolutely remarkable scene -- Hala . Where is the military , briefly ? Are the tanks still out there in Tahrir ? The tanks still are out there . PLEITGEN : And if we -- I 'm sorry . If we pan down there , you 'll see a couple of people that are sort of gathering around the tanks . So the tanks are actually still there . They 're keeping their positions . And the people , as you can see , they 're really obeying the orders . There 's a bunch of cars in front of that tank . They 're not moving past the tank to try and go down the highway overpass , although it seems some of them might have been trying to do that . So it does appear , even though you have all of this going on , from our vantage point , at least , as though the military is still very , very well in control . We have not had any reports of any violence , we 've had not any reports of any buildings , government buildings , or anything being damaged . It still seems as though there is that amount of respect that we 've been seeing between the military and the people who -- the former protesters , who I guess are now people who are just celebrating this moment . So it is a very peaceful moment . There 's nothing of any sort of tension in the air between the military and the people . The situation seems to be very much under control -- Hala . Fred Pleitgen , thank you -- Anderson . COOPER : Hala , we have with us watching this as well , Jim Woolsey , the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency . Obviously , as a former CIA officer , as an analyst , it 's the job not to get I guess too caught up in the moment , but try to look down in the hours , days and weeks ahead . I point out today is actually the 32nd anniversary of the Iranian Revolution , a revolution which began with extraordinary excitement and was quickly overtaken in unexpected ways . As an intelligence officer , what do you want to -- what questions do you need answered in the days ahead ? JAMES WOOLSEY , FMR . CIA DIRECTOR -LRB- via telephone -RRB- : Well , your reporter just quoted an Egyptian there on the street as saying Egypt now has a chance for freedom and democracy . And I think that is exactly the right way to phrase it , because there will be institutions and people trying to undermine that chance . I think first among them would be Iran , and Iran working with the Muslim Brotherhood the way they work with Hamas in Gaza . And the Egyptian military , because of its traditions and its being a draftee army and so forth , has good relations , as you 've seen , with the Egyptian people . And I think they will not be the problem . The problem will be exactly , Anderson , what you drew the allusion to , the possibility that something may happen along the lines of what happened in Iran in '' 78 and ' 79 . And if that does happen , it will be Ahmadinejad and his regime , operating through Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood and similar organizations , to try to undermine this great and remarkable and wonderful opportunity for Egypt . COOPER : It seems critical for that not to happen -- I mean , the critical steps for that not to happen are to try to build up democratic institutions in Egypt , which Mubarak , frankly , systemically dismantled , eliminated over the course of 30 years . So the idea , I suppose it would concern you if there were calls for immediate elections because there really are n't many organized opposition forces that have any legitimacy other than the Muslim Brotherhood . WOOLSEY : Right , and that 's what happened in Gaza . Hamas called for immediate elections , and we got one vote , one man , one vote once , and it 's now a theocratic dictatorship . Revolutions in the past have gone this way for all sorts of reasons . The French revolution went that way . The bad guys eventually took over . The same thing happened in the Russian revolution ; it 's happened in Iran . The phrase `` the revolution devours its children is an old one , '' and we all have to do everything we possibly can to work with the forces of stability and change in and Democratic and law-abiding direction in Egypt to help them economically , to help them politically and see to it that this does not become an Islamist operation the way Iran has and Gaza has , and I 'm afraid Lebanon may be on the way to being . COOPER : When you heard Wael Ghonim saying -- calling this revolution 2.0 saying that Facebook , you know , is where this began for him at least , that 's where he started his activism , does the intelligence community understand that at this point ? I mean , are they on top of that kind of the Facebook , the Twitter , as a driving force in some of these movements ? WOOLSEY : They may be beginning to be . I know people who for years now have been trying to get them to help get the right types of equipment and software into places like Iran in order to take advantage of people 's desire for freedom . We should have been doing exactly what has happened in Egypt . We should have been trying to help foster that in Iran and help set up servers , protect their Facebook , protect their Twitter , everything . And we really have not . But this is a good step because the administration is now starting to criticize the Iranians ' dictatorship for being hypocritical . It was just on your screen . I wish they had done that and helped with the Facebook and the rest a year-and-a-half ago when all of the brave Iranians were slaughtered by the Iranian government . But if we can maintain our support for a movement toward democracy and freedom and the rule of law , not just by one quick election in Egypt and do the same thing in Iran and in the rest of the Middle East , I think we can put aside this thing that Charles Krauthammer this morning . A great son of , he said until a week or two ago it was really just supposed to be George W. Bush , Tony Blair and a handful of neo-cons who thought there could be democracy and freedom in the Middle East . And it looks like we 've got a lot of Egyptians neo-cons out there . Where did they come from ? COOPER : Do you have any doubt there are other dictators in the Arab world and autocrats who are watching this with fear in their hearts ? WOOLSEY : I think there are probably quite a few , and if we can help work with them as we did at the end of World War II when the communists were working very hard , France , Italy and elsewhere to take over , we worked with the forces for democracy . We had CIA operations , we had economic aid , we had the Marshall Plan . We worked very hard , and we helped keep western Europe free during the Cold War because of some of the decisive steps that Harry Truman and others made in beginning in the late '40s . And we need to do that again . We need to be on the side of the rule of law and a quick evolution toward democracy , but not necessarily in favor of really quick votes in places we do not want more Gazas with Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood organization running . COOPER : Want to break back in Wolf , as we continue to watch , Wolf , these extraordinary developments . WOLF BLITZER , CNN HOST , `` SITUATION ROOM '' : And it might be good time to -- maybe Jim Woolsey wants to listen in to get some reaction from outside Egypt throughout the region . Let 's go to CNN 's Reza Sayah . He 's in Islamabad , Pakistan , where folks are watching as they are all over the world especially in the Muslim world and the Arab world , Reza , with keen interest . What are you hearing ? REZA SAYAH , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , Wolf , we 've been monitoring reaction from Iran , not so much in Pakistan . Of course , the images we 've seen today and over the past couple of weeks in Egypt remind many people of the uprising after the disputed 2009 elections in Iran . That 's when Iran 's opposition movement to so - called green movements emerged , and I think a lot of supporters of that opposition movement today are looking at what 's happening in Egypt , the celebration in Cairo and I think for them , it 's bittersweet sentiments . They were a civil rights movement , as well , and I think by nature , civil rights movements are very happy and thrilled when other civil rights movements are victorious . But I think Iran 's opposition movement is looking at this celebration tonight and saying , this could have been us , this should have been us . They too gave lives and lost lives in the streets of Tehran and other cities in Iran . They too fought in the streets for much longer than the Egyptian movements did , but they did n't enjoy the rewards that the Egyptian people are enjoying tonight . So , I think it 's a bittersweet moment for Iran 's opposition movement . The uprising in Egypt had created a lot of buzz in Iran , and the question , could this spark a comeback for the green movement that had been mostly snuffed out on the streets . And I think when you look at what 's happening tonight with the resignation of President Mubarak , that 's going to add fuel to the fire . Could there be a comeback ? Many of you already know that on Monday , there 's been a protest , a rally proposed for by the two leading opposition leaders , Mir Hossein and Mousavi and -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . Iran 's hard-line leadership was quick to object to it and warn everybody not to come out . So , it 's going to be very interesting to see what happens on Monday . Will the events in Cairo tonight spark a comeback in the streets of Tehran on Monday ? If it does , if Iran 's green movement makes a comeback on Monday , there 's going to be very little doubt that it had a lot to do with the events in Egypt tonight . BLITZER : Yes , those dominos are beginning to fall . Tunisia , Egypt , what 's next ? Well , you heard Wael Ghonim , the revolutionary , the protest leader in Egypt predict , look at Facebook and you 'll find out what is next . So we 'll take a closer look at Facebook and we 'll take a look and see how this plays out in Iran , specifically among other countries in the region . Reza , thanks very , very much . Let 's go back to Hala . She 's watching all of this unfold , as well . GORANI : It 's 7:37 p.m. right now in Cairo , Egypt , a country that 's gone through a revolution . The power of the people taking down this dictator in power for more than a generation . And Nic Robertson is overlooking Tahrir Square , the beating heart of this pro-democracy movement . What are you seeing from your vantage point ? We 're looking at these pictures along with the rest of the world , Nic . Truly an historic , historic moment for that country and for the rest of the region , as well . Tell us what you 're seeing . Checking that Nic Robertson is can hear me as we continue to let the pictures speak for themselves , really -- NIC ROBERTSON , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : -- it just gives you an idea of the situation here that it is a carnival atmosphere . It is people singing , people dancing , forming circles , dancing in circles , traditional dancing . But I think while all this euphoria is going on here , it 's interesting to pause for a moment . I was talking earlier on with an Arab diplomat who has a very keen sense of what Saudi officials are thinking at this time . And he told me that just this afternoon , President Mubarak called King Abdullah in Saudi Arabia and told him that he was stepping down . Now , we know over the last few days that King Abdullah of Saudia Arabia has told president Mubarak to hang on , to stay in leadership , not to leave the country because this is something of great concern for Saudi Arabia . I talked with this same diplomat since President Mubarak has stepped down . and he 's told me that this is a very worrying situation for Saudi Arabia . This is not what they wanted to happen here . This message that a social network revolution can topple a leadership is very destabilizing for the region . They believe that the only good thing that 's come out of the situation so far here in Egypt is the fact that the army is in control , and from what we 've seen down here in Tahrir Square this evening , the people very much support the army soldiers standing atop their tanks , standing at the site of their tanks being kissed by the people , hands being shaken . I saw one little boy with an Egyptian flag painted across his face , target a soldier 's sleeve . He was so small , and the soldier bent down , and this young boy kissed the soldier on his cheeks . That 's the sort of thing we 're seeing here . That 's the affection people are showing for the army . It does seem to be perhaps the only thing the people have in common with some of the leadership in the region . Saudi Arabia , in particular , the only thing they can take away from this right now is the fact that the army has a strong control and leadership role , Hala . GORANI : And Nic , we hear from some contributors who have n't necessarily been to Egypt , in fact , about fears coming from the United States . Other countries that Islamist movements would take over if snap elections took place , for instance . But describe the diversity of the crowd . That 's one of the things that struck me most , really , is the representative sort of -- how representative of society as a whole these demonstrators are . ROBERTSON : And right now , it 's exactly as you saw it , Hala . It 's a huge cross-section . A lot of young people , men , women , children , people coming down here with their families . Almost surprising , you would think families would bring their families into this atmosphere . But it 's a celebration . This is weeks of relief . How this will turn out being called out in raw emotion , raw euphoria , an electric atmosphere where everyone is represented here . The Muslim Brotherhood , who people have feared could become the dominant political force here , really do n't have the political strength as people see it at the moment to become a dominant force . They 've got political organization , some of the opposition groups have n't had . But in a true democracy and other groups would have a chance to find their feet , build a power base , build support . All these young people that signed up to Facebook to come out here on January the 25th , they 're not all Muslim Brotherhood . These are all young people who are doing this out of the aspiration to have this revolution that we 've now witnessed here in the last few hours . So , the notion that an Islamic group could come to the forefront here really does n't seem to be borne out by with we see on the streets . And even if you think about the Muslim Brotherhood , I was talking with a young man recently who was a third-generation Muslim brotherhood , but left the organization , an extreme intellectual . Left the organization as other young followers had because he did n't think that they had a good vision for the future . The young elements of the Muslim Brotherhood are also using Facebook and Twitter , and a part of this revolution , as well . And they do n't aspire to many of the things that people often fear that they might . So , a huge diversity and huge current of differing opinions here , Hala . GORANI : All right . Interestingly , a leaderless pro-democracy movement . Anderson , we 'll have to see in the coming days how they organize themselves and what their relationship with the military morphs into , eventually . COOPER : One person who has no doubt been thinking about that is Mohamed ElBaradei , Nobel laureate , also a man who returned to Egypt weeks ago to take part in this movement and is talked about as a potential leader of a future Egypt down the road . Dr. ElBaradei , first of all , where were you when you heard the news , and what went through your mind and your heart ? DR. MOHAMMED ELBARADEI , NOBEL LAUREATE\\/EGYPTIAN OPPOSITION LEADER -LRB- via telephone -RRB- : Well , I was at home , and , you know , I have been going through up and down since yesterday hoping to hear that piece of news , and it finally came . It was just a sense of liberation for me , for every Egyptian . A sense of emancipation of the whole Egyptian people , and for the first time , Egypt has a chance to be democratic , to be free , you know , to have a sense of - Egyptians can have a sense of dignity , of freedom . So it 's amazing , it 's just like 180 degrees . It 's something we never experienced in our lifetime . COOPER : We were just talking to Jim Woolsey , a former director of the CIA , who was pointing out in the past other revolutions which have started out with such exuberance sometimes get betrayed . How does that not happen this time ? What do you see happening in the weeks ahead ? ELBARADEI : We -- I hope , you know , that we have to be -- the army is that to have to of course , share power with the people . I think , you know , with 10 million people in the street every day , I think the message was not only sent to Mubarak but the army that the people have to be in control . And we would have to be vigilant , we will have to ensure during the transition period we would have all the guarantees for a free and fair election . All the guarantees for becoming a democratic institutions . And I have no doubt that people after going through what they have gone through are not ready to go back or to see their revolt , revolution aborted . COOPER : Do you know , does Vice President Suleiman still have a role at this point ? Is he still vice president ? ELBARADEI : I think , as far as I know , he is gone . I think , you know , because the army took over . So the president is out and his vice president is out . And it would be the military command . And I was told that they will , as soon as possible , reach out to the -- to wide sector of the Egyptian society -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . And I hope that will happen as soon as possible because the army is there to help the country through the transition , to ensure stability during this period . But we need to go back to law and order , to the economy start to function . We need to go back from a country that was going down the drain to a country that is looking to the future . COOPER : For the -- originally you had wanted a three-member commission of sort of technocrats running the country in order to transition ultimately to a place where you get free and fair elections . Because Mubarak has eliminated and systemically wiped out so many democratic institutions in the country , there really are not many democratic institutions . How long a period of time do you think Egypt needs before you can have free and fair elections ? ELBARADEI : Well , I 'd like -- I 'd like to see a year . A period of a year . I think that 's what we need at least to help get started , established . Get people to get engaged . We have to start from scratch and to my mind I think we need a year . We need a presidential -LRB- ph -RRB- council where we could have one military person sharing power with two civilians . We need a government of national unity and we need to build all the institutions necessary . So we do n't need to rush . We need to make clear that , as you 've said , that we will not be -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- , you know , after what we have gone through and we have learned from the experience of everybody else . I just got the call from George Papandreou , who was telling me that Greece went through the same process and he would like to brief me on the difficulties of going from a dictatorship into democracy . And so I got people from the states , you know , Washington administration , telling us that they are ready to help the Egyptian people in every way they can . So the good will is there . We just need to make it on our own and we need to take the time to do it right this time . COOPER : There are some in the crowd who are still calling for Mubarak to be put on trial in some way . Is that something you would want to see ? ELBARADEI : I do n't want to see that right now , frankly . I mean the country needs to be united , to work towards a future . I mean we have so many challenges ahead of us and we would like to make sure that , you know , we need to build our economy . We need to have a socially cohesive society . We need to have -- build democratic institutions . I think we need to , you know , we need to , you know , not to worry about retribution at this stage . And I think as far as Mubarak personally is concerned , he should leave in dignity . I think that 's what -- I know the Egyptians are angry . I know the Egyptians are feeling , you know , terrible about all the killing and the torture and -- but at least Mubarak needs to go and we need to look forward . At least that 's what I think and I hope that would -- I would tell people , let 's focus on the future . Let 's have a process of reconciliation at this stage . What we need is reconciliation between -- and a country at peace with itself . GORANI : I have a quick question . Do you trust the -- Mohamed ElBaradei , this is Hala Gorani at the CNN Center . ELBARADEI : Hi , Hala . Do you trust the military for a full year ? I mean do you trust the military as an institution to usher the country sort of into a brand-new era of true democracy for Egypt ? Do you think that they will be able to do that as an institution ? ELBARADEI : Well , Hala , I think , you know , we needed them and I tweeted this morning , in fact , asking for the intervention because the country was really going into a period of violence . I was afraid of a bloodbath here when people thought that Mubarak was going to resign yesterday and then he reversed his decision at the last minute and continued to hang on to power . So there was a lot of anger , a lot of frustration in the street . And it was the right thing for the army to come . But the army , I think , heard the Egyptian people . They do not want to replace Mubarak by a military coup . That 's not a gain in the cause . And the writing was on the wall . We need to be liberated . We need to be democratic . We need social justice . And what I understand , Hala , that the army is going to reach out as soon as possible to a wide sector of the Egyptian society as possible . I 'd like that -- to see that started tomorrow so we can have a sharing of power , the civilian and the military , and tell them what our demands are , what they need to do . We do n't have the experience of running the country , but we need it for ensuring any stability -- stability during this period of turbulence we are going through . We need to make sure that the economy is started -- running again . We need to make sure that tourists will come . Law and order , you have heard about -- you know , Anderson got beaten here . You know , it -- and many others . It has been terrible for a few weeks . So we have a lot of work on our hands and I hope the army will understand that we put our trust in them , but they need to -- they need to , you know , to live up to our expectation . BLITZER : Well , can I just ask one question to Mohamed ElBaradei before I let him go . This is Wolf Blitzer in Washington . I 'm getting a lot of e-mails and tweets from Egyptians saying what about the money Mubarak may have -- may be worth , what $ 20 billion -- as much as $ 70 billion . They want the money . Is that something that people should press for right now , Ambassador ? ELBARADEI : Wolf , absolutely . I mean I think -- I think this is money that they owe to Egypt . I think the first thing -- I mean if we are not going for trial , but definitely we are going for the money . This is the money that owed -- that they owe to the Egyptian people . And as soon as I see , you know , people from the army , I think that is going to be one of the priorities . But we have to frozen -LRB- ph -RRB- all their assets outside . I mean this is dictatorship . You know , we have suffered for 30 years and they have gotten -- got away with murder . But at least the money that we need here for development should come back to the Egyptian people . It 's the money that the Egyptian people , Wolf . BLITZER : And finally , President Obama is getting ready to address the nation in about a half an hour or so from the White House . Give me one point you really want to hear him make . ELBARADEI : I want to hear him loud and clear that he is with the Egyptian people , that he make a commitment that they will never support an authoritarian system in Egypt any -- under any circumstances . That they will put all their -- whatever they can under the disposal of the Egyptian people . I heard that already from Washington , but I would like to hear President Obama say that publicly . I think the Egyptian people need to restore confidence that Americans , the U.S. , means what they say when they talk about democracy , rule of law . And as you know , it has been , you know , they have been walking very tightrope . The rope finally has been broken and we need to hear loud and clear that the Egyptian administration -- that the American administration , that the American people are all with us on our march towards democracy , freedom and justice . BLITZER : Mohamed ElBaradei , thanks very much . Congratulation to all the Egyptian people on this historic day . We will stay in obvious close touch with you , as well . We appreciate what you told us . ELBARADEI : Thank you very much , all of you . GORANI : Well , we have reaction from around the world . Iran , the UAE , Germany , all reacting to what 's going on inside of Egypt today because of its importance in the region and its importance as setting an example to the rest of the Arab world . But today is a day to take in the atmosphere in Tahrir Square , that epicenter of the pro- democracy movement , and Arwa Damon is there among the crowd . Arwa , has the sort of atmosphere kind of gone down a notch or are people still in full party mood around you ? DAMON -LRB- via telephone -RRB- : Hala , the party here is definitely still going on . There 's live music on stage . The atmosphere is truly electric . I 'm surrounded by a young group of friends . They 've been out here demonstrating day in and day out . And I 'm going to ask this to one of them , Homas -LRB- ph -RRB- . What are you feeling right now ? We just got our liberty . People here are so happy really . DAMON : And what is going to happen tomorrow ? But it took -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . We are just -LRB- ph -RRB- proud to be Egyptians . DAMON : Hala , this crowd out here , as we just heard from Mohamed , yes , they have lost a lot , the country has sacrificed a lot to make this happen , but these demonstrators have also achieved what was truly unthinkable three weeks ago , that President Hosni Mubarak would no longer be the ruler of Egypt . And to think that all of this was started by a call to demonstrate on the Internet , on FaceBook and at Twitter , people right now relishing the fact that they are at the forefront of history . Not just making history in Egypt , Hala , but as we know so well , history across the entire region . GORANI : Let 's take a look at some of these scenes . And I saw one young man there holding up a sign that read FaceBook there , that he 'd scribbled FaceBook there on his sign . And Wael Ghonim , the activist whose FaceBook page served as a virtual meeting point for these activists , said he wanted to meet Mark Zuckerberg . That that was one of his goals in life . I 'm sure he might be getting a phone call . Let 's take a look at these pictures . The tent city in Tahrir Square on your screens now . And ordinary Egyptians waving flags . A day of national pride for those who say they were not going to give up until President Mubarak stepped down . And this day has come for them . And there we see Arwa . Arwa , can you still hear me ? DAMON : Yes , I can hear you . GORANI : Tell me , who 's around you right now ? Who are the people around you ? Sort of by and large , are they young , are they old , are they families ? Who 's come out tonight ? DAMON : Well , it 's actually a little bit of everybody . There 's young , there 's old . There 's people from all walks of life . We 've been talking to this young group of friends here . They have not been at the forefront of all of this . Ingi -LRB- ph -RRB- , tell me , what is going through your mind right now ? How are you feeling ? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I 'm feeling so happy . -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- for Egypt and I hope that this -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- all the people come back and I think that everyone 's happy . So this is a good sign -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . DAMON : And did you ever believe that you guys would actually all accomplish this ? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : I was just thinking about this a while ago and this is what we did . Why everyone -LRB- ph -RRB- coming here and -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- at the beginning . They -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . But I think it 's going to help us and good luck . I hope everything -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- in the coming years and a lot of expectations -LRB- ph -RRB- and we -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- working skills -LRB- ph -RRB- and finding about -LRB- ph -RRB- -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . DAMON : Thank you so much . You can see the crowd behind us . There really are people from all over . People who want to talk , obviously . Of course there -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . Of course you can . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- with Egypt . We got him to step down , Mubarak . And -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . We can take our -- we can take our -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- freedom in our -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . DAMON : Everybody 's very emotional here tonight . Anybody -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE : I love Egypt . DAMON : You 're proud for what 's happening . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- freedom for -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . DAMON : We 've been hearing this over and over again , these similar sentences , people saying that for the first time they are truly proud to be Egyptians . That they have managed to regain control of their country . Their -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- they say is now in their hands . BLITZER : That stuff happening at Tahrir Square .

The measure appears to be an effort by Iranian authorities to obstruct access to several websites that are promoting a rally on Monday -- the 25th day of Bahman -- proposed by Iranian opposition leaders in support of the uprising in Egypt , Saham News reported Saturday . Two Tehran residents also confirmed the block via e-mail to CNN . Iranian authorities on Wednesday warned against any attempt by the opposition movement to hold the rally , according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency . `` We definitely see them as enemies of the revolution and spies , and we will confront them with force , '' Revolutionary Guard Cmdr.

Iran is going to try to do what Egypt just did , but if they fail , that failure will also spread like cancer through all of the muslims countries even Egypt causing problems and putting possibly the whole country under another dictator who could be even worse . History has shown us time and time again that in situations like this one must be very careful and I doubt that the Egyptian military will let the power go so easily in 6 months after they enjoy the benefits of it . What the United States should be doing is dismantling the nuclear warheads that we help Egypt get so in case of a catastrophe in that country , this WMD do n't fall in the hands of other jihadists or unwanted dictators , which will just be another big headache for all of us ...

Tahrir meaning in Arabic liberation and amnesty after the revolution . Egyptians are certainly basking it . Also , a point of pride in what many are calling the new Egypt . Ordinary people are pitching in to clean up the enormous mess in the revolution 's wake . Details of what may have been former President Hosni Mubarak 's parting verbal shot at the United States and the Obama administration . We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world . I 'm Wolf Blitzer . This is a special report , REVOLUTION IN EGYPT . There are still certainly lots and lots of questions about what 's going on in Egypt right now . There is no doubt that there 's an enormous challenge ahead for the Egyptian people . Let 's go straight to Cairo . CNNs Arwa Damon is standing by with more on this remarkable , remarkable day after the revolution . Arwa , what happened today ? ARWA DAMON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Well , Wolf , we saw massive crowds down in Tahrir Square again . Just looking at it from the outside , it would appear as if the people were demonstrating , but , instead , of course , they were celebrating , having achieved what so many are saying was unthinkable , inconceivable just three weeks ago . This revolution that started out , as we have been reporting , on Facebook and Twitter , then taking on a life of its own , growing to such a degree where it truly did encompass people from all walks of Egyptian society , succeeding in bringing down one of the Middle East , what many people though was one of the Middle East 's strongest dictators , President Hosni Mubarak . The crowds down today in Tahrir Square celebrating , cleaning up , repainting some parts , and also bringing in a flag in memory of those who died . Many people very happy , euphoric even , but at the same time , there is a growing sense of anxiety because the future is just so uncertain . We 're seeing a lot of debates springing out amongst people as to whether or not they should stay in Tahrir Square as some would like to do to make sure that the military does live up to its pledges to hand over to a civilian government , that it does , in fact , lift emergency law that we do se those constitutional amendments that so many are saying the country desperately needs while others , the majority saying , look , we 've achieved it , we need to give the military a chance to do its job . Our focus right now has to be getting the Egyptian economy up and running again . These unemployed people need to go back to work . Those who have n't been able to go back to work since these demonstrations began need to be doing that as well . The realization that this is such an exciting but at the same time equal if not more so sensitive time for Egypt , Wolf . BLITZER : A real sensitive moment , Arwa , as you well know . If those -- the hardliners , let 's say , the demonstrators , if they want to stay at Liberation Square or Tahrir Square , will the military let them stay or are they shall , we say , encouraging them to leave ? DAMON : That 's a great question , Wolf . And really that is one that we 're only going to be able to answer when we see what exactly does happen . The military , so far , has not made any moves to aggressively move in throughout this entire process and remove the demonstrators themselves , but at the same time , we have been hearing the military coming out really urging the citizens to work with them , also to work with the police force which many fear and loathe trying to bring this country together again because it has been ripped apart by what happened . And there is a significant trust deficit between the people and the police , between the people and the government , and to a significantly lesser degree , between the people and the military . So , the military is not likely to want to jeopardize that the thinking amongst the demonstrators that we 've been talking to . They 've been saying , look , if a group does stay behind , it is likely to be smaller in number . They 're going to continue to be peaceful . Of course , the overarching issue in all of this to bring about some sort of a revolution is the problem that this is a largely leaderless revolution . Between the youth movements , there are various small pockets of groups forming each other , trying to get representation . Of course , there are all the other opposition groups as well . So , what is going to be really critical moving forward is to try to bring about some sense of unity instead of more divisions , Wolf . BLITZER : Arwa Damon on the scene for us in Cairo . She 's been doing an excellent job reporting as our entire team has done . Arwa , thanks so much . There are still huge questions about Egypt 's new military leadership and whether officials from the Mubarak government will continue to have power . I spoke earlier with the Egyptian ambassador to the United States , Sameh Shoukry , about that . BLITZER : Let 's talk about who 's in charge right now . How does that work ? The military is in charge , General Tantawi , the defense minister , is he in charge right now of the country ? SAMEH SHOUKRY , EGYPTIAN AMNBASSADOR TO U.S. : He is in charge by virtue of his chairmanship of the supreme military council . Today 's communication indicates that the council had decided to maintain the existing government as a caretaker government to govern the normal affairs of state . BLITZER : So , what about the Vice President Omar Suleiman ? What is his job ? SHOUKRY : I 'm not aware of whether Suleiman has retained any position under the new structure . He was vice president to a resigning president . And I think his status , to me , at least at this moment , is unclear . BLITZER : Is he still the head of -- you do n't even know if he 's the head of the foreign intelligence services of Egypt ? He relinquished that position when he was appointed vice president and then new person was appointed . BLITZER : So , it 's unclear what if any job he has . But you still report to the foreign minister , I assume ? BLITZER : Is there a new foreign minister ? Is there an on old foreign minister ? Mr. Gate was the foreign minister . Is he still the foreign minister ? SHOUKRY : Mr. Gate continues to be the foreign minister . As I mentioned , the council has decided to maintain the current government as a caretaker government until it appoints a new government . So , the current ministers will continue to operate and function . BLITZER : Stand by for more of my interview with Ambassador Shoukry . That 's coming up later this hour . President Obama is warmly welcoming today 's pledge by Egypt 's new military rulers to carry out a Democratic transition and to honor Egypt 's international commitments , including its peace treaty with Israel . The White House says the president made a number of phone calls to foreign leaders today to discuss developments in Egypt , including speaking to the king of Jordan and the prime ministers of Britain and Turkey . Some angry criticism of President Obama 's handling of the Egypt revolution from the ex-president of Egypt himself . We 're talking about Hosni Mubarak . Brian Todd is looking into this part of the story for us . Some pretty amazing words from Mubarak on the eve of his stepping down . BRIAN TODD , CNN CORRESPONDENT : That 's right , Wolf . An extraordinary conversation we 're learning about between Hosni Mubarak and a member of Israel 's parliament during the very hours when Mubarak 's fate was in the balance . This was on Thursday , the day before Mubarak resigned , the day he went on national TV to say he was n't stepping down . I 'm told by two Israeli officials that Mubarak had a telephone conversation that day with Benjamin Ben Eliezer , a former Israeli cabinet minister and current Member of Parliament who these officials say is close to Mubarak . The officials could n't give details of that conversation , but Reuters quotes Ben Eliezer as saying in a televised interview that Mubarak had some very harsh words about the U.S. goverment . According to Ben Eliezer , Mubarak said , quote , `` We see the Democracy the United States spearheaded in Iran and with Hamas , in Gaza , and that 's the fate of the Middle East . '' Then Eliezer quote Mubarak as saying , this is reported by Reuters now , about the U.S. government , quote , `` They may be talking about Democracy , but they do n't know what they 're talking about , and the result will be extremism and radical Islam . '' We tried , but we 're unable to reach Mr. Ben Eliezer to independently verify his take on what Mubarak said . The Egyptian ambassador to the United States , Sameh Shoukry told Wolf just a couple of hours ago that he does not have knowledge of that conversation . Wolf , it is extraordinary -- we are hearing that Ben Eliezer is close to Mubarak , not necessarily unusual , but he might have a conversation with him during those hours when it 's so critical , just ingrate -LRB- ph -RRB- inside and maybe Mubarak 's bitterness at the time . And we 're also told from this Israeli parliamentarian that Mubarak on that Thursday suggested he was ready to hunker down in Cairo . TODD : He was defiant even until the end , maybe reflected in that speech . And , you know , we do n't know if this conversation took place before or after that speech on Thursday when Mubarak gave no indication that he would step down , but Ben Eliezer quotes Mubarak , according to Reuters , is saying , quote , `` I have been serving my country , Egypt , for 61 years . Do they want me to run away ? I wo n't run away . Do they want to throw me out ? I wo n't leave . If need be , I will be killed here . '' You know , it 's extraordinary to get some of that insight of these private conversations at those very tense moments . You saw how he was on that speech on Thursday . It was just surreal watching him up there , being that defiant . BLITZER : We believe he 's still in Sharm el-Sheikh , the resort at the southern tip of Sinai , the Red Sea , but we do n't even know that for 100 percent . TODD : For sure . We do n't know where he 's going . Thanks very much , Brian Todd reporting . With successful uprisings in Tunisia and now in Egypt , the world is watching to see if other Arab countries follow suit . Jordan is the subject of a lot of speculation right now , but that country 's foreign minister , Nasser Judeh , insists everything there is just fine . We spoke by phone just a little while ago . VOICE OF NASSER JUDEH , JORDANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER : Jordan is Jordan . I 'm watching all the media outlets , and I 'm seeing the comparison , and I 'm seeing the expectations , and one would confidently say that here in Jordan , we had demonstrations as we have every year when it comes to economic issues and governments adopting policies that are unpopular . But in Jordan , we enjoy freedom of speech and freedom of expression . And yes , while we have economic hardship , we still have economic stability and political stability and political reform that is initiated by its majesty , the king , by the government , that the iterance -LRB- ph -RRB- of majesty 's vision , so we 're okay . BLITZER : That 's the foreign minister of Jordan , we spoke a little while ago . When we come back , we 're digging deeper into the U.S. intelligence community . Was there a failure ? And what did the director of national intelligence , James Clapper , really mean when he said the Muslim brotherhood in Egypt is largely secular ? Much more of our coverage right after this . BLITZER : Certainly , still a carnival atmosphere in Tahrir Square in Cairo , but there 's always the risk that Egypt 's revolution could open the door to extremism . Listen to what the former CIA director , Michal Hayden , told CNN 's Barbara Starr . MICHAL HAYDEN , FORMER CIA DIRECTOR : It 's very rare for revolutions as they progress to break towards the center . They generally break towards the extremes . And that 's why this has to be so carefully managed and why the Egyptian military has to be generous in its approach to this kind of change . One danger , if this stalls , if people become frustrated and it breaks to the extremes , one of the extremes represented by the history , if not the present , are the Muslim brotherhood . And that would be very bad , I think , for Egypt , for the United States and for the region . BLITZER : Let 's bring in our national security contributor , Fran Townsend . She serves on the CIA 's External Advisory Board . Fran , thanks very much for coming in . We heard the director of national intelligence , James Clapper , say he did n't necessarily think that the Muslim brotherhood would be such a threat . He also , at one point , said it was largely secular and that 's causing a huge uproar that maybe he does n't understand what 's going on in Egypt . FRANCES FRAGOS TOWNSEND , CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CONTRIBUTOR : Well , I mean , historically , as you just head from Mike Hayden , a former CIA director , the Muslim brotherhood is really the ideological predecessor to groups like al Qaeda , very extremist , very violent . After years of repossession under the government of Mubarak , they 've been really decimated and have become more now in this revolution more politically involved . In fact , they 've backed el-Baradei , the Nobel laureate , and his involvement in a new government -- BLITZER : The former head of International Atomic Energy Agency . And so , I think what you 're hearing though and in Mike Hayden statement , and I happen to agree with Mike Hayden is that while they 're weak now , you run the risk that extremists in the region will support them and will encourage them towards the fringe , towards the extreme Islamist fringe , and that would be horrible for the region . And I have to say , Wolf , our allies in the region who have suffered under extremism and been battling it like Saudi Arabia , Bahrain , Kuwait , the United Arab Emirates , they worry about the foothold of an extremist element inside Egypt like the Muslim brotherhood . BLITZER : And that 's why all of them reportedly were encouraging President Obama to not pressure Mubarak to step down so quickly . They thought that could undermine a smooth transition . TOWNSEND : That 's exactly right , Wolf . And so , our allies in the region are not happy with us for the way we handled it , and they worry very much about the potential at least for extremism . BLITZER : Well , how much of a threat is the Muslim brotherhood in Egypt right now ? The way it 's formatted to the United States , shall we say ? TOWNSEND : Well , they are -- the Muslim brotherhood would never be regarded as a potential ally for the United States or pro-American policy . That said , they had been very weak , both politically , operationally . So , at the moment , I do n't think people would regard them as a big threat -- direct threat to the United States . But , again , their allies in the extremist community throughout the region including people like al Qaeda and Hamas and others , there 's the potential there . And that 's why somebody like Mike Hayden , a former CIA director , is saying , this has got to be very carefully managed , and our intelligence community is going to be key here in helping us get a sense about what direction this is going to go in . BLITZER : I 've somewhat studied Egypt for a long time . I suspect the Egyptian military leadership will keep a close eye on the Muslim brotherhood . They 're not going to let them do things that the military does n't want them to do , but that 's just my assessment . Given some of the early statements , Hillary Clinton , the Secretary of State saying , it was a stable situation in Egypt . The vice president of the United States , Joe Biden , saying Mubarak was not a dictator . Was there some sort of intelligence failure in the United States , intelligence community ? You serve as an adviser , external advisory board . Was there an intelligence failure that the U.S. did n't grasp what was going on ? TOWNSEND : You know , Wolf , I think it 's , right now , a little early to be able to figure that out . I suspect what 's going on , though , I ca n't say directly , is that we 're going to -- the intelligence community will do a self-assessment and look at what did they know and when did they know it ? What judgments did they make based on what they knew and when were they right and wrong ? And often time , we go through that sort of process in the intelligence community to be better the next time . I 'll tell you , the U.S. military and the Egyptian military have a very close relationship as does our intelligence community with the Egyptian intelligence community . And let 's remember , Omar Suleiman who became the vice president under Mubarak was the head of their service . And so , there are -- BLITZER : He 's now , for all practical purposes , gone . TOWNSEND : That 's right . But as this was developing , there were lots of close relationships . And so , the fact that we did n't had a clear and good grounding and understanding of what was happening ought to be concerning to the president , given the depth of our relationship there . BLITZER : But you have good sources . The Saudi Arabia right now , King Abdullah and others , they 're concerned . TOWNSEND : Absolutely , they 're concerned and rightly so . Given the history of the Muslim brotherhood , given what they 've advocated in terms of violence and how they have infiltrated the neighboring countries historically to cause chaos and unrest , I do n't blame the regional allies for being very concerned . What they see -- if you 're sitting in the seat of our Arab allies , they see a 30-year ally of the United States who was cut loose , frankly , from their relationship with the U.S. because from their perspective , it was politically expedient for the U.S. to back the protesters and not Mubarak . Forget whether or not we agree or disagree with that . That is the perspective of our allies . And we 're going to have to deal with that going forward if they do n't trust us to be loyal to them . BLITZER : Fran Townsend served in the Bush administration as the Homeland Security adviser to President Bush , as well . Thanks very much for coming in . She 's now a CNN contributor . There 's much more coming up . We 're going back to Cairo . They 're cleaning up Tahrir Square . We 'll update you on that . Egyptians are certainly celebrating in Cairo , but they 're also celebrating around the world , including right here in Washington . Our special report continues right after this . BLITZER : Revolutions are n't just historic , they 're also messy . CNN 's Fred Pleitgen has more on the clean-up under way right now in Cairo 's Tahrir Square . -LRB- BEGIN VIDEOTAPE -RRB- FREDERIK PLEITGEN , CNN CORRESPONDENT : After the revolution , it 's not all celebration for the people here . A lot of them have come together and are actually cleaning up the area at Tahrir Square which , of course , has seen a lot of violence . There 's a lot of trash also there from people camping out the past days . And now , they 're cleaning up , and they say , they believe that because they 've now taken back their country , they want to make their country clean and nice so that everyone can enjoy it and so that they , themselves , can be more proud of their revolution . So , this is the new Egypt right here ? And you 're happy to do this ? Because cleaning up is not everybody 's -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE : I do this for my help -- I am very , very happy to do that . I live with my daughters and my wife , and we come here with my friends to do that . PLEITGEN : And this is where it starts ? Cleaning the streets is where it starts ? PLEITGEN : Looks like hard work . What are you doing ? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : We are cleaning the new Egypt , our new Egypt . PLEITGEN : So , this is people taking control of their country and making it more beautiful . What does this symbolize , then ? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : This energy inside ourselves , and just you scratch a little piece and we all came out to say , this is the new Egypt . This is the new world , and I can swear and promise you , see Egypt after five years from now , just five years . PLEITGEN -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : There appear to be some scuffles between the military and some of the people here at some point , but the military tells us it was just a couple of folks that were causing trouble . The military says it has no issues with people staying here , however , it does want to open this area at some point so businesses can reopen on Tahrir Square . UNIDENTIFIED MALE -LRB- translator -RRB- : It was three troublemakers . We arrested them , but we let them go again . PLEITGEN -LRB- on-camera -RRB- : There 's a big clean-up also going on here at the barricades that lead into Tahrir Square . And of course , these barricades are so symbolic of what was happening here over the past couple of days . This was the scene of some of the worst street fighting as pro-Mubarak demonstrators attacked the anti-Mubarak crowd . And of course , in the end , the anti-Mubarak demonstrators prevailed . Now , this area is getting cleaned up as well as we can see people who are taking control of their country and taking things into their own hands . Fred Pleitgen , CNN , Cairo , Egypt . BLITZER : The celebrations that started in Egypt spread around the world including right here in Washington , D.C. CNNs Sandra Endo has more on that -- Sandra . SANDRA ENDO , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Wolf , here outside the Egyptian embassy in Washington , D.C. , it is a street party . People are here waving the Egyptian flag , dancing in the streets , playing music , and smiles all around . They 're also holding up signs that say , Egypt 's revolution inspires the world , and that 's certainly the message they want to send out to the entire world watching all these events unfold . And this man has been here for a couple of weeks now leading the protests which is now a celebration . Where were you when you heard the news and what went through your mind ? I just jumped , almost broke the door of the office . I was hysterical , ecstatic . The first thing that went through my mind , that those who have died did not die in vain . That was my main concern . I 'm not talking about those who died in 13 days . I 'm talking about those who have died in the past 30 years out of persecution , torture , have been killed , kidnapped by the state security police . So , finally , finally , we got our country back . 7,000 years of Egypt that is 7,000 years old was just reborn . ENDO : What do you want to see next , though , for the country ? I do n't care who 's going to be there as long as it is who the people want . So , what we want is a Democratic system by which nobody can abuse their powers . That they will vote it . The minorities will give empower women . That 's what I 'm looking for . I 'm looking for a Democratic system and for the people to actually make their voices heard . ENDO : All right . Thank you so much and congratulations . You can see the dancing and the celebration continues . What 's really striking , though , is the amount of young people who are out here celebrating their country 's victory and all the hard work of so many protesters who have been calling for the resignation of Mubarak and now celebrating in the historic moment of the country -- Wolf ? BLITZER : Sandra , thanks very much . We 're going to go back to Cairo and check in with Nic Robertson . He 's on the scene for us on this , the day after the successful revolution . Also , more of my interview with the Egyptian ambassador to the United States , Sameh Shoukry . That 's coming up right here on our special report , REVOLUTION IN EGYPT . BLITZER : Some protesters are staying put in Cairo 's main square refusing to leave until the country is under civilian leadership instead of military rule . Here 's our senior international correspondent , Nic Robertson , with the latest . NIC ROBERTSON , SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Wolf , it 's still carnival party atmosphere in Tahrir square , but there 's a confusion about it as well . While we were down there watching the people come in and celebrate , young families bringing their young children in , really recognizing that this is a moment in history that they want their children to share , to remember , to be there to sort of feel the atmosphere of it , confusion because there were large groups walking away from the protests singing and chanting , `` everyone should leave now , '' `` everyone should leave now '' signaling that they believe that they should recognize what the army is saying and let the army continue as it said it will with the transition to civilian rule . But on the time frame of letting this current government run through to the elections . Those protesters who want to remain there , who are now celebrating but are threatened to remain on in the coming days , say they want this transition to civilian rule to happen very , very quickly . The army has said that their legitimate demands will be met . But this is what 's happening . But it really is , at the moment , still a celebration . But you can see the confusion in all of this beginning to bubble up here , Wolf . BLITZER : Is there a clear sense that the military is in charge , that the old political leadership effectively is gone ? Is that what I 'm hearing , I 'm sensing , Nic ? ROBERTSON : I think the lack of voices that we 're hearing , other than from the military at the moment , is a clear indication of that . There was a moment in Tahrir Square today when the army wanted to clear away some burnt-out military vehicles . They went to move them , they were part of barricades , and some of the demonstrators went to stop them . They did n't want that to happen . The army called in additional soldiers to come in with sort of riot gear on . It got sense for a few minutes . A couple of people were led away . We understand they will be released later . But it gave an indication that the army is n't going to stand idly by , that they are going to try and sort of keep this under control and head in the direction they want to go in . So at the moment , they 're very much in control . But also you get the sense that they are letting this party play itself out to a degree , let everyone come and have their moment , come and have some fun , but perhaps try and regain some order as the numbers draw down , Wolf . BLITZER : A significant statement from the military leadership , one welcomed here in Washington , that they would honor -- Egypt would honor all of its international treaty obligations , including the peace treaty with Israel . That was certainly welcome news in Israel . What are they saying in Cairo about that ? ROBERTSON : Well , certainly it 's recognized in Washington that many of the military chiefs here have spent time training and doing programs -- military programs inside the United States . So there 's certainly a thorough understanding of the military here . What they 're saying will happen here and the indications that they 're giving is that Israel -- rather , Egypt is going to recognize all its -- all its obligations , its international treaties and that nobody should expect any changes to come overnight . How that will look , perhaps in six or eight months ' time , if there is a new democratically-elected political representation in this country , that may be something different . But the military is really offering internationally , as well as internally , continuity at the moment , Wolf . BLITZER : All right . Nic , thank you . This is certainly an uncertain time for all Egyptians especially -- especially those who played some key roles in the Mubarak regime . I spoke a little bit earlier today with the Egyptian ambassador to the United States , Sameh Shoukry , and I asked him if the defense minister of Egypt right now is really the man in charge . SAMEH SHOUKRY , EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR TO U.S. : He is in charge by virtue of his chairmanship of the Supreme Military Council . Today 's communication indicated that the council had decided to maintain the existing government to -- as a caretaker government to govern the normal affairs of state . BLITZER : So what about the vice-president Omar Suleiman ? What is his job ? SHOUKRY : I 'm not aware of whether Mr. Suleiman has retained any position under the new structure . He was vice-president to a resigning president and I think his status , to me , at least at this moment , is unclear . BLITZER : And is he still the head of the -- you do n't even know if he 's the head of the Foreign Intelligence Services of Egypt ? SHOUKRY : No , he relinquished that position when he was appointed vice-president so a new person was appointed . BLITZER : So it 's unclear what , if any , job he has . But you still report to the foreign minister , I assume . BLITZER : Is there a new foreign minister ? Is there an older foreign minister ? Mr. Gheit was the foreign minister . Is he still the foreign minister ? SHOUKRY : Well , Mr. Gheit continues to be the foreign minister . As I mentioned , the council has decided to maintain the current government as a caretaker government until it appoints a new government . So the current ministers will continue to operate and function . BLITZER : I guess the question is , how does all this affect an Egyptian ambassador to the United States , this tumultuous change that occurred in your country within 18 days ? What 's been the impact on you ? SHOUKRY : Well , we , of course , followed every minute , every second of what has been going on with a great deal of concern and pride to see the Egyptian people undertaking this protest movement in the way that they have , peacefully , indicating their desires , their aspirations . And this outcome , I think , is one that is -- is one that all Egyptians are proud of . As for myself , our service is a political service . We have no political affiliations and we serve the people of Egypt -- I serve the people of Egypt and I serve of the pleasure of the current government . BLITZER : You 're a career diplomat . BLITZER : So , presumably , you 'll stay -- you 'll serve whoever the new foreign administrator of Egypt is . I guess the main point right now is , you 're happy that this revolution succeeded . Is that fair to say that ? SHOUKRY : All Egyptians , I think , have indicated their happiness that -- the Egyptian people have indicated what their desires and aspirations are and the people will be fine with the form of government that they accept . BLITZER : Are you confident that the military rulers right now -- there , in fact , these military rulers will eventually lead the way to democracy , free and fair elections ? SHOUKRY : Well , certainly the -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- has spoken , the population has spoken and they have spoken loud and clear . And the military and the second communicate and then the fourth communicate have made every indication that they are leading the country in accordance with the reform program that will return the rule and authority to a civilian and freely-elected government . BLITZER : The former president of Egypt -- I never thought I 'd be saying that -- the former president of Egypt , Hosni Mubarak , he 's reported to have had a phone conversation with a former Israeli ambassador in Cairo the day before he stepped down saying the United States , the Obama administration was naive , they did n't understand who was behind these demonstrators , the Muslim Brotherhood or Iran or Hamas and that the U.S. would regret its support for the demonstrators . I want you to react to that . SHOUKRY : I have no particular knowledge of that conversation . I believe the American-Egyptian relationship is a deep and lasting one , one that both parties have extracted immense interest and benefits from . And I presume that these relations will continue to flourish . BLITZER : I guess the question is , do you agree with Mubarak -- assuming the reports are accurate , do you agree with President Mubarak -- former President Mubarak that the U.S. is naive about the Muslim Brotherhood ? SHOUKRY : I believe that all factions in Egypt -- all political factions in Egypt are going to partake in developing the way forward and will do so under the supervision of this youth revolution that was widely supported and will take their lead from the electorate and from the people who will put them in office . BLITZER : As you know , there a lot of speculation how much money the Mubarak family amassed over the years . Anything from $ 2 billion or $ 3 billion to $ 70 billion . I have no idea how much money they amassed . But we know the Swiss government froze all the bank accounts associated with the Mubarak family . Have you received instructions here in the United States to go after Mubarak money in private American banks ? SHOUKRY : We 've received no instructions in that regard . BLITZER : Do you know if he has amassed a lot of money here in the united states ? SHOUKRY : I have no idea whatsoever . BLITZER : Tell me something that you 're free to say today that you were n't free to say only a few days ago because there 's a new freedom in Egypt right now . Give me an example of the freedom that you now have . SHOUKRY : Well , I am free to express the position of my government without any form of restriction . I did that previously and I do that today . BLITZER : You 're free to criticize the Mubarak government ? SHOUKRY : I 'm not in a position to criticize . I 'm in a position to transmit the instructions of my government . SHOUKRY : It 's a very deep and close connection . There 's a high level of cooperation and coordination . There 's a parallelism of interest related to regional -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . BLITZER : How will it be affected by this revolution ? SHOUKRY : From everything that has been issued in terms of the president 's statements and others , there is a recognition of the value of this revolution , of the value of Egypt 's direction in the future and it is our hope that it will strengthen this relationship . BLITZER : So you 're pretty happy right now ? BLITZER : And you 're happy about what has happened in Egypt ? SHOUKRY : Every Egyptian is proud that the Egyptian people have taken their future into their own hands and have been able to forge it in a peaceful and mature manner . BLITZER : Well , good luck to all the people of Egypt . Thank you , Mr. Ambassador . You 've been very helpful to us over these past 18 days . I remember when you called in to help clarify what exactly was going on because that night that Mubarak spoke out and he did n't step down , we were all confused at what was happening . But the next day , we heard the Vice-President Suleiman give a one little sentence line , Mubarak is stepping down , and that was it . Did you ever think that would happen in your lifetime ? SHOUKRY : It 's a remarkable development , one which is a matter of pride for Egypt and one which I 'm sure will set Egypt on a road of great development . BLITZER : Ambassador Shoukry , good luck . BLITZER : When we come back , we 're going to the pyramids right now . How are they reacting there ? Tourism , a lifeline for Egypt . Much more of our special coverage right here . Revolution in Egypt coming up . BLITZER : If you want to take the pulse of Egypt on this first day after the revolution , head to any of Cairo 's ubiquitous coffee shops . Once again , here 's CNN 's Arwa Damon . DAMON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : In the most traditional of Egyptian settings , there are already subtle changes . The state newspapers , for example , that used to propagate the government message now praise the revolution . Conversations center around topics untouchable three weeks ago . No one was bold enough to openly express their dissatisfaction , says Hani -LRB- ph -RRB- . At 61 , he 's the eldest among this group of friends . They would head to the demonstration site on a near daily basis and gather here afterwards to debate . We will talk about corruption and the need to dissolve parliament completely and have free and fair elections , Hani says . The coffee shop is right in between Tahrir Square and state TV headquarters , where this man works as a studio director . I am happy and sad . I am sad because this is a president who carried us through wars and tough times , he explains . He demonstrated against his own network on Friday , realizing he had to make a decision between right and wrong . His breaking point was the day that pro-Mubarak thugs stormed through the crowds on horse and camelback , unleashing violence that claimed hundreds of lives . I am happy because we 've been freed of things that were forcibly imposed on us , he says . The people were so repressed , it was as if we were buried alive . The bubble of oppression burst , they joke , and we do n't know how to clean up the mess . Egypt is like a newborn baby that needs to be protected , Mustafa -LRB- ph -RRB- adds . And then after a year or two , he can stand on his own . Everyone in society has to do their part . Of course there is anxiety because we 're in an unknown transition right now , he elaborates . Is this going to be for the better or what 's going to happen ? There 's no anxiety or fear , he jumps in , disagreeing . The power is now with the military , and the military is a very respectable force . They have the ability to choose the ones who are intellectual , politicians who can inject the country with major change . The country has , without a doubt , already changed . With so many unknown pieces thrown into the mix , no one is entirely sure how it 's going to play out . Arwa Damon , CNN , Cairo . BLITZER : Not everyone is happy with the upheaval of recent weeks , especially those who rely on the country 's tourist industry which has come to a virtual standstill . CNN 's senior international correspondent Nic Robertson has more . ROBERTSON : Wolf , down here in Tahrir Square , you could quite easily get the impression that the whole of Egypt is celebrating Hosni Mubarak 's removal . But I went out to the pyramids earlier on today where so many tourists like to visit . I talked to some of the people who work out there . They do n't quite share all this happiness . ROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Close to Egypt 's ancient pyramids , horses charge along the lanes , but not in celebration . The men here who make their living from tourists are angry . This man is one of them . President Mubarak stepped down yesterday . How do you feel about that ? ROBERTSON -LRB- on camera -RRB- : Why bad ? ROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : These are the streets the horse and camel riders , who so dramatically attacked and terrorized protesters in Tahrir Square , came from . ROBERTSON : The violent images of that day helped scare the last of the dwindling tourists away . Now the president 's gone , he is desperately trying to rebuff their tarnished image , get the tourists back . We do n't think about politics here . We are not politic people . We think only about our political -- it 's how much I get , how I make business , how I can work , how I can feed my family , how I can feed these horses . ROBERTSON -LRB- on camera -RRB- : A return of the tourists ca n't come fast enough here . Local businessmen say about 50,000 people are employed in the tourist industry and there are about 1,500 camels and 5,000 horses . And every day they 're not working , they 're getting hungrier . -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Stables are full of idle horses , running up huge food bills . One horse , about $ 15 a day . Fifty in this stable alone . Tourists stay away if protests continue . You have done what you want , you get what you want . It 's not every day we start again to think about something else , something new . That 's not the way . ROBERTSON -LRB- on camera -RRB- : But as we talk , a glimmer of better days ahead . ROBERTSON : So how do you feel seeing these tourists up here ? We would like to put our hands together and we start to help each other . ROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Time to look forward and not back . ROBERTSON : So what he 's saying is he wants to put behind him all the violence that happened here over the past few weeks . It 's not clear yet if this crowd here is quite of the same opinion -- Wolf . BLITZER : Nic Robertson , thanks very much . Let 's hope tourists start coming back in huge numbers to Egypt right now . They certainly need that business . When we come back , some amazing photos , amazing photos from the revolution in Egypt . BLITZER : CNN 's Mary Snow has the story of one freelance photographer who got swept up in the drama of the revolution . MARY SNOW , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Wolf , unlike many photographers and journalists working for news organizations , Andrew Burton decided last week to get on a plane and travel to Egypt by himself . SNOW -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : It was February 2nd , the day pro-Mubarak supporters showed up in Tahrir square . Early on , they did n't seem to mind Andrew Burton 's camera . ANDREW BURTON , FREE PHOTOGRAPHER : They were very passionate about having their voices be heard . SNOW : The freelance photograph had just arrived in Cairo . He says as the day wore on , he watched tensions escalate on TV and ventured back into the crowds . It was this photograph that triggered an ugly turn . A man appeared to be writing over anti-Mubarak graffiti . And moments later , Burton , like many journalists that day , came under attack by pro-Mubarak supporters . It was anti-Mubarak protesters who came to his aid . BURTON : Four or five men encircled me and kind of sheltered me while the mob kind of kicked and punched and hit us with sticks . SNOW : In the crowds , there were army tanks and Burton was taken to one . BURTON : I remember looking up and there was a soldier screaming , waving a pistol at the crowd . And , at that point , I was pulled into the tank by soldiers and kind of dumped head-first into this tank that was right outside Tahrir Square . I had some food with them . I think they probably made fun of me a bit . I was pretty shaken and scared at that point . SNOW -LRB- on camera -RRB- : What did they say to you ? BURTON : They asked me my name and what I was doing . I explained that I was a news photographer . SNOW -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Hours later , a soldier helped him get back to his hotel . Two days later , Burton was back in Tahrir Square . This protester heads into the crowd carrying a sling , as doctors stood ready to treat the injured . But the intense clashes from earlier in the week were n't repeated . Protesters pray at the end of the day . By Sunday , Burton notes a different mood . Protesters rest inside makeshift tents . Christians and Muslims side by side and families gather . BURTON : This is the father and the mother and the mom smiled at me with such a big smile and she said , this is a revolution baby . SNOW : And this anti-Mubarak protesters wears a sign that reads `` please go . '' SNOW : And these images are really underscoring how quickly the situation on the ground is changing from day to day and some of the risks that journalists take every day to tell this story -- Wolf . BLITZER : Mary Snow , thanks very much . And good luck to all the people of Egypt . Thanks very much for watching . I 'm Wolf Blitzer . The news continues next on CNN .

'' Khalil AbdulMouminm , the league 's general secretary , called the situation `` very tense on the ground '' and said police were preventing protesters from assembling , with authorities blocking all entrances to the capital . `` We want this rally to break the wall of fear in the first place , '' AbdulMouminm said . `` And to trigger change in order to reach our legitimate demands , like lifting the emergency law after all these years , liberating media , freedom of political expression .

The problems are similar to those that fueled uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia . `` Population growth and associated problems -- unemployment and underemployment , inability of social services to keep pace with rapid urban migration , inadequate industrial management and productivity , a decaying infrastructure -- continue to affect Algerian society , '' the U.S. State Department says in a background note about Algeria .

The violent images of men on horseback storming Cairo 's Tahrir Square armed with whips - among the most emblematic scenes from the 18-day revolt - not only galvanized the anti-government movement , leading to former president Hosni Mubarak 's ouster after 18 days of protests , but also scared away visitors who normally tour the Great Pyramids on horses and camels , tourist industry worker Ayman al Myonir said .

The clashes , which left a small number of people injured , followed an anti-government protest Friday night in which men armed with knives attacked more than a thousand demonstrators , according to human rights groups . A group of around 700 people turned out Saturday morning at the gates of Sanaa University to give their support to the Egyptian people following the ouster of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , said Fuad Dahaba , a member of parliament for the opposition Islah party . The protesters also demanded change in Yemen and called for the fall of President Ali Abdullah Saleh 's regime . `` Yes to the revolution , no to oppression , '' they chanted , alongside cries of `` The people are the power '' and `` Saleh , leave -- leave while you can . '' Thousands of other anti-government demonstrators began marching through Sanaa 's streets to join the protest at the university . At the same time , about 400 pro-government demonstrators had been gathering at Sanaa 's Tahrir Square in a festival atmosphere , chanting `` No to chaos , yes to peace . '' Those pro-government demonstrators then walked from the square to the university gates , where their rival protesters tried to stop them from gathering in the same spot and clashes erupted , according to Faisal Al-Namsha , 32 , an anti-government demonstrator . Al-Namsha said he was attacked by the government supporters , who began hitting with sticks and fists when the clashes began . Anti-government protesters , some of whom were also carrying sticks , fought back , Al-Namsha said . At least six anti-government demonstrators were hurt , he added . Security forces then stepped in and the demonstrations ended . Anti-government protests have recently spread across Yemen , inspired by the revolts that ousted the Tunisian and Egyptian presidents . The protesters Friday had initially taken to the streets of Sanaa to support Mubarak 's ouster but later changed their focus to Yemen . `` Yesterday Tunisia , today Egypt , tomorrow Yemen will open the prison , '' some chanted Friday , according to Human Rights Watch . A prominent Yemeni human rights lawyer , Khaled Al-Anesi , said he suspected pro-government demonstrators involved in the knife attacks Friday were security forces in civilian clothes , but government spokesman Tareq Shami denied that . `` We did not call for any protests and those out today from both sides were expressing their opinion , '' he said Saturday . Al-Anesi said at least 17 people were arrested , most of them rights activists . A day after the clashes , Yemen said it is confident the military council that took over Egypt will steer the nation through the political crisis , the Yemeni official news agency reported Saturday . Yemen `` expresses its respect for the choice and the will of the Egyptian people , '' a government official said , according to Saba news agency .

Cairo , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Egyptians on Saturday cleared burned cars , garbage and debris that accumulated over 18 days at Tahrir Square , a sign that Cairo and the rest of the country were ready to rebuild and get back to work while the country formulates a plan for governance . A day after President Hosni Mubarak stepped down , employees and businesses readied themselves for Sunday , the traditional start of the work week . The country 's stock market is expected to reopen Wednesday . Wael Ghonim , a cyberactivist who is a Google executive on leave , wrote Friday on his Twitter account , `` Dear Egyptians , Go back to your work on Sunday , work like never before and help Egypt become a developed country . '' Volunteers repainted black-and-white-striped street curbs around a monument by the Egyptian Museum , which had been on the front line in street battles between Mubarak 's foes and supporters . Police were starting to move barricades and trying to restore vehicle traffic at Tahrir Square , where many protesters vowed to remain . Monument for martyrs of Tahrir Square `` It 's time to start rebuilding the country , '' protester Yehya Kheireldin said , pointing to the hundreds of volunteers armed with brooms who are sweeping away the debris left by the sit-in . In the immediate future , the military -- largely respected by Egyptians -- will have to grapple with guiding the country of more than 80 million people through the transition amid massive problems of unemployment and considerable economic underdevelopment , said CNN correspondent Ben Wedeman , who is based in Cairo . Former Egyptian Trade Minister Rachid Mohammed Rachid recently told CNN that the new government must show it is business-friendly . The African nation virtually shut down during the unrest , losing vital tourism dollars as well . CNN 's Nic Robertson reported Saturday that citizens who make their living off foreign tourists are angry . `` Young boys 17 years old and 18 years old , they want to say , ` We are hungry , we want to eat , we want to work , ' '' said businessman Ayman el Myonir . Businessmen near the famed Pyramids say about 50,000 people are employed in the tourism industry , Robertson reported . `` We try to help each other . We would like to put our hands together , and to help each other , '' said el Myonir . As thousands reveled in their improbable revolution , the nation 's newly appointed military caretakers laid out priorities Saturday geared at establishing stability , though they revealed little to elucidate the future . The Armed Forces Supreme Council said it was committed to a democratic process resulting in civilian rule , but urged respect for the reviled police forces that had brutally clashed with protesters in the early days of the uprising . `` The armed forces council calls on the people to cooperate with the policemen , '' Lt. Gen. Sami Anan , who some see as a potential presidential candidate , said on state television . `` We ask our policemen to adhere to their slogan : Police is at the people 's service . '' It was unclear whether the statement signaled a return of the police security apparatus , noticeably absent from the streets after the violent clashes and the deployment of the army . CNN 's Arwa Damon visited a coffee shop in central Cairo , where patrons said they now feel free to speak honestly about Egypt 's political problems . `` I am happy and sad , '' said Fateh , a customer . `` I am sad because this is the president who carried us through wars and tough times . '' He said the turning point came when Mubarak supporters rode horses and camels into the Tahrir Square crowd . Gallery : Protesters celebrate Mubarak 's resignation The military , meanwhile , announced measures geared toward establishing stability after the abrupt death of a 30-year dictatorship in the Arab world 's most populous nation . Anan , the armed forces chief of staff , said Egypt would still honor international treaties and commitments , a statement perhaps aimed at calming a jittery Israel that has quietly watched dramatic change unfold in its Arab ally . `` Egypt is a country of institutions and it honors its legal obligations , '' Sameh Shoukry , Egyptian ambassador to the United States , told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer on Saturday . The revolution is something `` all Egyptians are proud of , '' the diplomat said Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979 . The Israelis on Saturday welcomed the Egyptian statement and Defense Minister Ehud Barak spoke on the phone with his Egyptian counterpart Hussein Tantawi , who heads the supreme council , the Israeli Defense Ministry said . `` The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces is confident in Egypt 's potential , institutions and people to successfully go through these difficult times , '' Anan said . But as thousands of people still celebrated on the streets , the army 's first statement since Mubarak 's departure did little to spell out how long Egypt would remain under military rule . `` They want to see structural change , '' Parag Khanna of the Global Governance Initiative told CNN Saturday . `` They want to see a change in the Constitution . They want to see democracy . That speech did not tell them any of those things . '' Thousands of Egyptians were in a still electric Tahrir Square Saturday , vowing to stay there until , as one protester put it , `` Egypt is ruled by a civil government , not a military one . '' A marble memorial was going up to remember those who died in the 18-day uprising . Human Rights Watch has documented 302 deaths , a number the monitoring group called conservative . Kheireldin said an `` unspoken plan '' had been reached between the military and a group of protest organizers to take down barricades and tents in Tahrir Square , even though some people wanted to hold out longer . Tantawi , the head of the military 's supreme council , has a controversial reputation among the armed forces and had been derided by midlevel officers as `` Mubarak 's poodle '' for his fawning over the now-ousted president , according to U.S. diplomatic cables sent from the Cairo embassy in 2008 and published by WikiLeaks . The Constitution allows for only two scenarios for a head of state to relinquish power . The first stipulates that if the president has to step aside temporarily , the vice president steps into the top role . That is what the regime briefly orchestrated Thursday . If the office of the president is vacated or the president becomes permanently disabled , the Constitution states that the parliamentary speaker is to assume the role until new elections can be held . Those elections , in turn , must occur within 60 days . In opting for a third way , which put all power in the hands of the military , the Mubarak regime in effect rendered the Constitution inoperable . Shawee El-Sayed , an independent member of Egypt 's parliament and an expert on the country 's Constitution , said Mubarak 's move to transfer power to the military left Suleiman without an official role . `` The next step the council must -LRB- decide -RRB- is whether or not to validate the Constitution -- otherwise there will be a constitutional vacuum , '' he said . Saturday , Anan , the supreme council 's spokesman , said the current government would remain in place until a new one could be formed . State television reported , citing a judiciary source , that several high-ranking government officials , including the former prime minister and interior minister , were facing lawsuits and were barred from traveling out of the country . U.S. President Barack Obama , meanwhile , praised the Egyptian military for acting responsibly and said it now needs to help ensure a credible transition as it attempted to better gauge the unfolding situation . Adm. Mike Mullen , chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , plans to visit key U.S. allies Israel and Jordan this weekend , a Pentagon official told CNN Saturday . Under Secretary of State Bill Burns was already in Jordan meeting with King Abdullah , the State Department said . U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates spoke with Tantawi on Saturday , the sixth phone conversation with the minister since the start of the Egypt uprising , a Defense Department spokesman said . It was the first call since Mubarak stepped down . Among other things , Egyptian authorities need to set about `` protecting the rights of Egypt 's citizens , lifting the emergency law , revising the Constitution and other laws to make this change irreversible , and laying out a clear path to elections that are fair and free , '' Obama said . But some analysts were sounding the alarm over the takeover by the military , which has suddenly become accountable for the nation . Analysts with Stratfor , a global intelligence company , said Egypt had essentially experienced a coup . `` Egypt is returning to the 1952 model of ruling the state via a council of army officers , '' the Stratfor statement said . `` The question now is to what extent the military elite will share power with its civilian counterparts . '' But even as officials hash out the details of Egypt 's murky political future , its people power rippled throughout the region . In the Yemeni capital , Sanaa , protesters chanted : `` Yesterday Tunisia , today Egypt , tomorrow Yemen will open the prison . '' And in restive Algeria , anti-government protesters chanted `` Change the power . '' Security forces clashed with the crowds . Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh told CNN that the country 's `` democraticization procession is well on track . '' King Abdullah II swore in a new government Wednesday .

FAREED ZAKARIA , HOST : This is GPS , THE GLOBAL PUBLIC SQUARE . Welcome to all of you in the United States and around the world . I 'm Fareed Zakaria . I 'll give you my take on the extraordinary events in Egypt in just a minute . But first , let tell you what 's coming up . Egyptian ambassador Sameh Shoukry was President Mubarak 's top representative in the U.S. Whom does he represent now ? And what is their plan to transition to democracy ? Next up , one of President Mubarak 's strongest opponents , Mohamed ElBaradei . What 's next for the opposition ? Then , the heart of the story , the Egyptian military . Can we expect them to make way for democracy after 50 years in power ? We have a panel of experts . And finally , Jamie Dimon , the CEO of JPMorgan Chase . He 's one of the few bankers to emerge from the financial crisis with his reputation enhanced . Some have even called him a hero . He rarely talks in front of a camera , but you 'll hear him defend his profession and offer his take on the American economy . But before we begin , let me give you my take on American foreign policy over these last few weeks . We watched history being made last Friday as the dictatorship yielded to peaceful protests , but barely had that ended that we began our grand national tradition as Monday morning quarterbacks . The administration has been behind the curve , people said . It was divided , others report . It should have embraced democracy much sooner and wholeheartedly . I think this is unfair . The Obama administration faced a genuinely difficult balancing act . On the one side was Hosni Mubarak 's regime , which have been a staunch American ally for 30 years . It kept the peace with Israel , fought al Qaeda and other Islamic terrorists , blockaded Hamas , confronted Hezbollah -- in other words , it did everything Washington asked of it . On the other hand was the vital need to support the people of Egypt in their morally justified and politically powerful quest for democracy . So let 's look at what other presidents in such situations did . Ronald Reagan faced a similar dilemma with the Philippine dictator , Ferdinand Marcos . Marcos ran a repressive and rapacious regime , but was staunchly anti-communist and an ally of America . Unrest in the Philippines began in August , 1983 , when Marcos ' goons assassinated an opposition leader . It took Ronald Reagan three years to decide to push Marcos to leave office . Bill Clinton faced a somewhat similar problem with Indonesia 's Suharto in 1997 , and for months all the administration did was issue calls for reform . Finally , a year and a half after the protests began , the Clinton admission acquiesced as the IMF pushed Suharto out of office . It took Barack Obama one week to shift from a policy of supporting Mubarak to publicly calling for a transition to democracy . Now , maybe that 's an eternity in the world of cable news , but it 's pretty fast by my clock . It 's easy for pundits to say that Washington should have pushed Mubarak out . First , that exaggerates Washington 's power . Imagine if the president had asked Mubarak to leave and he had n't . Secondly , it does n't acknowledge the real tradeoff that Washington confronted , ensuring that other American allies did n't watch and decide that if they ever faced protest , Washington would throw them overboard at the drop of a hat . Given all these pressures , I think that the Obama administration found a responsible way to junk a decades-old policy and get on the right side of history . Let 's get started with the show . ZAKARIA : Joining me now , the Egyptian ambassador to the United States , Sameh Shoukry . Ambassador , thank you for joining us . SAMEH SHOUKRY , EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. : Thank you for having me . ZAKARIA : Ambassador , I 'm just looking at this fifth communique from the military council , the most recent one , and it seems to lay out a set of -- a set of guidelines that the constitution has been deactivated , parliament is dismissed , the council will run the country , the prime minister will stay in place until a new government is formed . Is that new government , as far as you know , going to be formed in some kind of coalition with the opposition groups or is it just another new government that will be formed with the existing people in the regime ? SHOUKRY : It will depend on the duration , whether the -- that new government will be formed after the parliamentary elections , or it might be formed before the parliamentary elections . And then , of course , it will depend on the outcome of those elections . So I think it 's a little bit early to define when that might happen . But , in any case , for the time being , the current government will run the day-to-day activities of governance . ZAKARIA : And point eight in this nine-point communique is conducting elections , but it does not say over what period , nor does it say whether they will first be parliamentary or presidential elections . Can you -- can you shed light on that ? SHOUKRY : Well , the communique has just been issued so we need to look into it a little bit more carefully . I believe there was a timeframe of a six-month period for parliamentary elections to be held , if I 'm not mistaken , and within that timeframe I believe those are the -- that is the first priority . ZAKARIA : Do you believe that this transitional government will be able to incorporate members of the opposition or is it going to have to be -- is it going to have to wait until the elections are held ? SHOUKRY : One would presume it would wait until the elections are held . Its current composition is basically a technocratic government to run the day to day affairs , to take care of the security void that has happened and to also address the issues related to the economy . The Egyptian economy has suffered during this period of unrest and was suffering from the global recession with a rising unemployment rate . That is -- those are the two priorities . ZAKARIA : Tell me , Ambassador , as an Egyptian citizen , how do you react to last week 's events ? SHOUKRY : These are unprecedented events , certainly a matter of pride for all Egyptians , that the people have spoken in such an organized and peaceful manner , were able to -- to present their aspirations and to affect the -- effect change . This is a matter of a small point in the history of Egypt in terms of its long civilization and it 's contribution to its region , but a very major event in terms of how Egyptians will forge their future . ZAKARIA : Do you think that it will have a greater impact beyond Egypt ? SHOUKRY : Egypt has always been a trendsetter in -- in its region . The region looks to it in many aspects that I 'm sure also in this regard many lessons will be learned . ZAKARIA : Do you worry about some of the concerns that people raised , the Muslim Brotherhood using the ballot box to gain power and create some kind of an Islamic republic ? SHOUKRY : I believe that the people of Egypt will rely on their history , their previous experience , some -- the diverse nature of the composition of the population . Egypt has been a secular country . It has a strong cultural background and will rely in forging ahead for the future on its experiences of the past . So I believe that all varying political ideologies will be represented within a free and fair elections and it will be up to the people to decide who serves their best interest . ZAKARIA : Now , for now you are maintaining the -- the treaty with Israel . That has been made clear in both communiques , both recent communiques by the military . But is it not fair to point out that if there were a new parliament and a new elected national assembly , it could , by democratic vote , aggregate this treaty ? SHOUKRY : Egypt is a country of institutions and has always made it a point to honor its legal commitments as a legal commitment and undertaken , one which -- one would expect , and rightfully so , that it would be upheld . The peace treaty has benefited Egypt , has benefited the region in terms of creating stability and peace and giving an opportunity for Egypt to concentrate on its development . It is in -- has been in the best interest of the Egyptian people . ZAKARIA : What about the blockade of -- of Gaza ? This is something that the Mubarak regime enforced quite vigorously . Many people in Egypt , I would venture to guess , a majority , feel otherwise , feel that Gaza should not be blockaded . Will that blockade be enforced now ? SHOUKRY : Egypt has never blockaded Gaza . The blockade of Gaza was an Israeli policy . Egypt has only one crossing with the Gaza , which is a rougher crossing . It 's a crossing for individuals and has been operated all through this last six months on a very regular basis to provide assistance , humanitarian assistance , when need arose to the people of Gaza and to also provide them freedom of access as individuals for educational purposes , medical treatment and general purposes of travel . So the -- the status of our crossing is -- is operational and will I 'm sure continue to be so within the confines of its -- the legal terms under which the -- the crossing is a -- is manned . ZAKARIA : Ambassador , thank you very much for joining us . ZAKARIA : Back in a moment with a view from the other side , the opposition . ZAKARIA : For the last two weeks , right here on this show , Egyptian Nobel Laureate Mohamed ElBaradei has been clear about one thing -- President Mubarak must go . Now that 's happened . We decided to check in with Mohamed ElBaradei . Thanks you for joining us . MOHAMED ELBARADEI , LEADING OPPOSITION FIGURE : Fareed , it 's always a pleasure to be with you . ZAKARIA : You must be a happy man , Mohamed . ELBARADEI : Oh , extremely happy man , Fareed . I ca n't even begin to describe my feeling and the feeling of every Egyptian here , that we got rid of this nightmare that has been there for 30 years . ZAKARIA : Now what next ? A lot of people worry , Mohamed , that -- that you have an opposition that is divided , that the regime will -- will play to that and at the end of the day you will not really get what you want . ELBARADEI : Fareed , I am frankly -- started to get worried , and people are becoming to be -- to be apprehensive because we thought that we would lay out the -- the roadmap for the transitional period . So far we have done nothing of that . They -- they have been talking to each other . They have n't talked to the people . And , as you can see , people are still in the streets , and I was told today that by Friday , if we do not see a -- you know , the -- the roadmap , then people will go back to the street . I -- I understand that the army might need some time , but they need to lay out what -- what they are up to . We need clearly a transitional period . We need heavy participation by -- by the civilian with the -- with the army . It could not be just the army running -- running the show . We have n't even seen one of them on -- on the -- on television . It 's just simply periodical statements by a spokesman for the army , very short and terse statement saying we are for legitimacy , we are for transition , but we need more than that , Fareed . ZAKARIA : What about clarity , Mohamed , from the opposition ? What -- you know , can -- can you unify and present a set of demands ? And are you empowered to speak for the opposition ? ELBARADEI : Well , I think -- I think the opposition , as you said , Fareed , clearly is fragmented after 60 years of oppression . But -- but I think the opposition is all of one mind . We need -- we need to , you know , co-manage the transition . We need to -- to reach within a year a -- a country that is ready for a free and fair election and to elect a president and -- and a new parliament . On all this , I think there is no disagreement , Fareed . So we -- all we need -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- army to reach out to us right now . ZAKARIA : And if by Friday there is n't a meaningful roadmap to -- for a transition , you would call for the protests to begin again ? ELBARADEI : I think that 's what people are saying , and I think they 're making already preparations , the protests would go back into the street by Friday . But -- but they need to come out of their headquarters and start talking to -- to the people and tell us what -- what is in store for us . ZAKARIA : Mohamed ElBaradei , thank you very much . ELBARADEI : Thank you , Fareed , for having me . ZAKARIA : Back in a moment with a look at who holds all the power in Egypt -- the military . ZAKARIA : You 're looking at Tahrir Square in Cairo . Today it 's filled with traffic instead of tens of thousands of protesters . But while some things have changed , much else in Egypt remains the same . The Egyptian military took power in a coup more than 50 years ago and it still has power today . So what makes anyone think the generals will hand over power to democratic forces ? That 's what I want to get to the bottom of . Joining me here in New York are Richard Haass and Steven Cook , both of the Council on Foreign Relations , Richard of course being the president . Both have deep knowledge of the inner workings of the Egyptian military . And joining me from Sharm el-Sheikh , Egypt , Nic Robertson , CNN 's senior international correspondent . Nic , what is your sense about the trust factor between the public and the military ? Does the military have the public 's trust ? NIC ROBERTSON , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : It does at the moment , Fareed , and we 've seen that so many times , most poignantly , perhaps , when the police fled from the streets , beaten back by the crowds on the 28th of January , that very violent Friday afternoon clash as the army arrived a couple of hours later . And since then we 've seen people shaking the hands of the soldiers , rushing up and kissing them after President Mubarak stepped down . So -- so that -- that trust has n't been lost with the majority of the people . That 's something that the army has managed to maintain . And , really , that 's golden for them at the moment . It is in a way , there 's the squander . Obviously there have been demands that there should be a speedier transition for them to move to a civilian administration , speedier than the six months that they 've announced . But at the moment the majority do seem to support the military and they see them , unlike the police , as not being corrupt . They are , after all , a conscript army . People describe them as being their sons , their brothers , their husbands . So there 's a close connection with the people . So , at the moment , that trust really does seem to exist , Fareed . ZAKARIA : Always a pleasure , Nic . Steven , you -- you wrote a book in which you talked about the Egyptian military , and your pointed out they prefer to rule from the back . They -- they do not like to actually have -- because in strange way that allows them to say inflation , unemployment , those are problems of the civilian government . They just maintain power in the back . Does this -- this must be an awkward moment for them . STEVEN COOK , COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS : This is an incredibly awkward moment for the Egyptian military . They went back into the barracks after the shattering defeat of June 1967 and have preferred to stay there with a brother officer in charge . Now , suddenly , after 40 years , they 've been thrust into direct politics , and it 's uncomfortable . And Egyptian politics are a difficult , difficult place to be . And it is -- remains an open question , how Field Marshal Tantawi and the people around him , none of whom are politicians . They 're soldiers , and who prefer order , how they 're going to deal with the rough and tumble world of Egyptian politics ? ZAKARIA : And they 've got huge equities at stake here . The Egyptian military owns factories . They operate toll roads . I mean , they have a kind of commanding position over the Egyptian economy . They 're not going to want get -- to let go of this very easily . RICHARD HAASS , COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS : Of course not . It 's a -- it 's a good life if you 're an Egyptian general with several stars on your shoulder . On the other hand , the fact that they 've moved forward now , they suddenly increased the stakes for themselves . They 've put themselves in quite a risky situation , and as you 're -- your report earlier made clear , now the really hard part begins . As difficult as it was , if you will , to oust Mubarak , now the really tough start happens . The pace of reform , the sequencing reform , constitutional change , elections for what -- when , political opening , all the difficult stuff . And the opposition , which agreed on getting rid of , if you will , modern day furrow -LRB- ph -RRB- , now the opposition begins to split . Not just one or two ways but in perhaps dozens of ways . So all these people out there , all the jubilation , very quickly , we 're going to see it turn to frustration and disagreement . My sense is the happiest days of this revolution are over . And it 's like , you study so much history , Fareed , very few revolutions end as positively as they begin and I would be surprised if this were an exception . ZAKARIA : You talk about , in your book , Turkey and Algeria , and it struck me as a very interesting set of examples because in Turkey the generals ultimately do seek power . In Algeria they have stubbornly clung to power . ZAKARIA : In the Turkish cased , it was really because the European Union forced them to . They did n't voluntarily -- ZAKARIA : -- go back into the -- COOK : Turkey has begun a transition to democracy not because of the generals but despite the generals . Really , the European Union created a whole range of constraints on the ability of the military to actually go in and intervene . The Turkish generals were opposed to these kinds of reforms . That 's why some of the discussion about a Turkish model for -- for Egypt seems misplaced . The military in Egypt is going to have to deal with , as Richard said , an opposition that is splitting , an opposition that has different demands . If you look at the military 's five statements thus far , they have n't tracked too far from when President Mubarak said in his three statements to the country . ZAKARIA : Well , I want to talk about when we come back , what all of this means for the rest of the Arab world . And we 'll get to that in a moment with our great panel , looking at Egypt 's future . ZAKARIA : And we 're back with Nic Robertson in Sharm el-Sheikh , Richard Haass and Steven Cook here with me in New York . Richard , protests in Algeria 's -- Yemen of course has had some instability , a very unusual thing where a group of tribal leaders sign a petition in Jordan . Do you think this is going to spill over ? HAASS : The Jordan one was the most surprising . My general way of saying is I thought their traditional monarchies , the real monarchies were probably secure -- Jordan , Morocco , Saudi Arabia -- and we were looking more at the Yemens , the Algerias , where we thought this be the -- something that would trigger something . Jordan is the most interesting because you do have the first signs of some disaffection -- crumbling is too big of a word , but some splintering of the Bedouin , if you will , non-Palestinian base of Jordan . That 's the place to watch most . I still think that what will matter even more is what happens in Egypt . So my way -- the reason I would n't answer your question yet , people are going to see what happens in Egypt . If it goes badly , like in Iraq , when democracy , quote-unquote , `` broke out '' there after it was imposed , it was so messy , it led to such violence , it actually set back the cause . So I think Egypt 's implications , its consequences , will depend very much on how it proceeds . Does it go well ? Does it go smoothly ? Does Egypt six months from now or a year from now look better , more peaceful , more prosperous , more open , or does Egypt in some ways , does it -- is the military still there ? I think that will ultimately have the biggest effect . ZAKARIA : Steven , I -- I kind of make a distinction in -- in the Arab world between the societies that use mass repression and the ones that use mass bribery . And I think of the ones that use mass bribery -- Saudi Arabia , the Gulf States , is more stable . Is that fair , do you think ? COOK : Well , it seems to be the case that Saudi Arabia certainly has more resources than Mubarak ever had in order to buy political quiescence . But you do see in one Gulf state , in Bahrain , a situation where there is a tremendous amount of disaffection with the ruling family and in fact they are now trying to buy political quiescence . The King of Bahrain has authorized every Bahraini get $ 2,700 this week . So what you 'll see throughout the region is this maneuvering in order to do the best they can to buy political quiescence , while like in Algeria , reinforcing the iron fist . HAASS : In Bahrain , like Syria , the places where very small minorities rule the country . HAASS : And those are two places perhaps to look at for just that reason . ZAKARIA : When you look at U.S. foreign policy , what is the lesson you draw from all of this ? HAASS : So much of the debate has been on the tactics , but the administration got it right . I think you were fair . This is awfully tough . To me , what this does , though , Fareed , is it brings to the floor what in some ways is the biggest single question about American foreign policy , how central should democracy promotion be to what it is we do in the world ? And what you see now is this once again the split between the traditionalists who basically say we really ought to focus on those from what the Egypts of the world do beyond their borders to support through peace process , opposition to terrorism , as opposed to those who say , we really ought to focus on democracy . That ought to be the centerpiece . And I would simply say for those who will take from this , the democracy ought to be at the center of our foreign policy , slow down . Not only do we not know what Egypt is going to look like in six months to a year , we do n't know what the foreign policy consequences of this . And whether it 's China or Russia or a lot of other non-democracies , the United States has an awful lot of equities out there that we simply ca n't afford to put on the back burner while we try to do perhaps the most difficult thing in foreign policy , which is to try to engineer the trajectory of another society . We ought to have some humility about this . ZAKARIA : The one caveat I would make of that , Richard , which however I would imagine you 'd agree to this , the reason in Egypt it was worth while to support democracy was supporting Mubarak and supporting these dictatorships had been breeding a very extreme violent religious opposition that was all directed at the United States , because they said you 're supporting the dictators whom we hate . So there was a cost to the -- to the stability in Egypt , under the direct foreign policy cost to the U.S. . They were killing Americans because of that . HAASS : Fair enough . And Egypt had become so polarized , the total absence of political reform is a dangerous thing . And what the lesson of this is not necessarily all or nothing , but reformism ought to be a part of American foreign policy . And that 's the challenge now in Egypt . What you do n't want to have there is what you might call Mubarakism , without Mubarak . So the question is , can we bring about a gradualism in the direction of a more open society ? We have to be very careful . It may not look like the federalist papers . Egyptian , quote-unquote , `` democracy '' may frustrate people in the street . It may frustrate people in the White House . We 've got to be smart and we 've got to be careful about how far , how fast . And you look at Indonesia and you look at Nigeria , these places that run through it , it takes a while and the struggle to get power from the military takes a while , but over time if you have a democratic leader like the parliament , that gives them a platform from which they get things as well . Nic , I want to ask you about this question of America . Does America figure in the debate any more in Egypt ? Are they looking to Washington or -- and do they think Obama did enough ? ROBERTSON : Well , certainly we 've heard from the army saying that they 're going to provide continuity in terms of their international policies and internal policies as well . So , obviously , part of that international continuity must involve the United States . But there are probably two principle sensitivities here . One is how any U.S. involvement is manifested with Egypt as far as it 's viewed in the region , particularly from the United States principle allies here , Saudi Arabia and Jordan , how will they view how the United States handles the situation . And perhaps more critically for the army and for the United States is how it 's perceived here in Egypt . Because during the demonstrations , particularly in the early days , the refrain that we continue to hear many , many days from the protesters was President Obama is not supporting us . He 's staying with the side of President Mubarak , even as President Obama was shifting his position . So there is a perception that the United States did n't move fast enough by some of the protesters . There will also be a perception among President Mubarak supporters who were many who will say that the United States should n't have been involved and foreign powers influence what happened here . Undoubtedly , that may be an over reading and a misreading of the situation . But these are the sensitivities . So however the United States plays its hand with the army and in Egypt right now , it will -- it will necessarily need to be , I would say , cautious and do it behind the scenes . Because there will be many sensitivities about how it is perceived to be maneuvering . Everyone knows the United States relationship with Egypt is critical in the region and people will be aiming to score points off of it and pull it apart in any way they can , Fareed . ZAKARIA : Nic , thank you very much . And that 's all the time we have for our panel . Richard Haass , Steven Cook , Nic Robertson . We will be right back with Jamie Dimon , America 's top banker by some people 's estimation . JAMIE DIMON , CHAIRMAN AND CEO , JPMORGAN CHASE : Not all bankers are the same . And I just think this constant refrain -- bankers , bankers , bankers , it 's just -- it just does n't -- it 's really an unproductive and unfair way of treating people . ZAKARIA : At the recent World Economic Forum in Davos , I presided over a panel of some of the world 's top businessmen . They were all extremely thoughtful , but I was most taken by what Jamie Dimon said . He 's , of course , the Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase . Dimon and his company emerged unscathed from the financial crisis , in fact , with both their reputations enhanced . If you want to hear what Jaime Dimon had to say about the state of the U.S. economy , the job problem , Europe and why he thinks he and his fellow bankers get a bad rap . -LRB- BEGIN VIDEOTAPE -RRB- ZAKARIA : There is still , as you know , if you look at polls -- polls in the United States , still a widespread feeling in the United States that the taxpayers bailed out the banks and the banks are not helping the taxpayers , they 're paying themselves big bonuses , but that lending has actually contracted in aggregate . You may be up over the last year , but overall , if you look at the amount of lending , which is $ 7 trillion , you 're still at about 2005 levels . What do you say to the average American taxpayer who says , guys , we bailed you out , now -- now give us , you know , do something in return ? In the United States of America , only one-third of credit is provided by banks . Bank lending actually went up after Lehman Brothers failed , not down . It 's a huge misconception . Two - thirds of credit is provided by individuals , corporations , pension plans , you know , et cetera . The huge reduction in credit supplied was the credit supplied in directly to the marketplace . In fact , if you go to any place around the world , you ask people , did you do something more conservative with your money after Lehman went down ? Which everyone says , yes . I would say , well , you caused the crisis . It 's perfectly legitimate as an individual protecting yourself . And JPMorgan last year lent or financed $ 1.4 trillion for corporations , individual around the world , up pretty substantially from the year before and I believe substantially from the year before that . Most banks are lending quite a bit . But remember , some of them are gone . The ones who are gone are no longer lending . So obviously there 's been a reduction . So you may talk to people saying , I ca n't get money and they be that standards have loosened up in the last year , but they have not -- they have not tightened up . So banks are -- we are lending aggressively into corporates , to middle market , small business lending up 30 percent . There is , if you talk to most , there 's a demand issue . A lot of them do n't need the money because they 're not -- because they 're not building inventory , not building plans , they 're not building - You know , a lot of these people have tons of cash . They 're not -- they do n't need to call up their banks because they 've got plenty of money right now . So - ZAKARIA : Let me ask you about one more consequence of the crisis , if I may , which is - DIMON : There 's a huge misconception , in which not all banks needed that T.A.R.P. . You know , not all banks would have failed . And right here , a lot of policy makers and regulation makers -- that one assumption drive so much the anger that they would have failed . I can tell you a lot of banks were stabilizing this problem . JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns because the United States government asked us to . We bought -- we bought not because we wanted to . Wells Fargo bought Wachovia . HSBC was -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . And I can go bank after bank who 's a stabilizing force , trying to make up for the fact that there are other failures . So we -- we lump everyone together like -- and I think it is a terrible thing to do . I do n't lump all media together . There 's good and there 's bad . There 's irresponsible and ignorant and there are really smart media . Well , not all bankers are the same . And I just think this constant refrain -- bankers , bankers , bankers , it 's just -- it just does n't -- it 's really an unproductive and unfair way of treating people . And I just think people should stop doing that . I think that denigrates everything . Not all companies are the same , not all CEOs are the same , not all media is the same . And so I -- we try to do the best we can every day . ZAKARIA : Let me ask you about another consequence of this -- of this crisis . It has been to concentrate assets among the top banks . JPMorgan , Citigroup , Bank of America now represent 30 percent of all assets . You have about $ 2 trillion in deposit . It strikes me that the net effect of the -- of what has happened , is you 're not too big to fail , you 're way too big to fail . So it 's 30 percent of all deposits in America . America is far less concentrated than Europe , Asia , Canada , Australia , France , U.K. , Italy , I mean , way less concentrated . There are reasons for -- it kind of just scale -LRB- ph -RRB- , stuff like that . I wish -- I believe that when we start talking about resolution authority , that we should , the governments , the regulation should be able to take down a JPMorgan in a way that does n't damage citizens of the world . I also think the banks should pay for that . Like in the FDIC , when banks fail , the FDIC takes them over and kind of liquidates them and the rest of the banks pay for that . We 're going to pay $ 5 billion , the FDIC , if a failure of other banks . I -- instead of calling it resolution , I think we should have called it minimally damaging bankruptcy for big dumb banks . Take them down , wipe them out , full bankruptcy , unsecured creditors pay . And that 's -- that 's what they 're trying to get to , which is a little complex . It can be done . That 's what the FDIC did with big banks for many years . Now we 've become global . So I understand , if you 're a regulator , you need to say , OK , what can I do in the U.K. ? What can I do in France ? Can I protect myself ? The answer is you can . It 's a little complicated , but it can be done and that 's the better way to do it . Let these companies fail . Put them in a position they can all fail and the world is fine . ZAKARIA : Could JPMorgan fail without systemic risk in the United States today ? If it 's set up properly , the answer is yes . So -- and the other thing I remembered , Lehman -- if the Lehman Brothers had failed in 2000 -- there 's the thing about complex systems . If Lehman Brothers have failed in 2005 , I do n't think it would have caused this crisis . I guess it was cumulative trauma after -- you had problems in Germany , you had problems in Britain , you had problems in the United States , and the United States was the epicenter . I 'm not going to deny that . But it was -- AIG , WaMu , mortgage brokers and it was around the world . And so things would be very different if -- if they were set up so that they could be handled . Lehman Brothers had $ 200 billion of unsecured debt . If at the point of failure that unsecured debt had been turned into equity , Lehman would have 200 billion of equity and 600 billion of assets and it would have been fine . ZAKARIA : Larry Summers on my program said financial industry fought this reform tooth and nail . They 've spent a million dollars on each congressman , four lobbyists for every congressmen . Is this financial reform change things ? DIMON : You know , I love Larry . A ridiculous statement , OK ? First of all -- first of all , it 's a free -- I remind these people all the time that 's it 's a in a democracy you have the right to petition your government . It 's in the number one amendment in the U.S. Bill of Rights . Most of that lobbyists are own people . When I go to Washington , it counts as lobbying time and they have to add it up and , you know , whatever -- how they would calculate and stuff like that . We did n't fight financial reform , OK ? We wanted resolution authority . We thought there should be oversight committees . We thought -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- should go to clearing houses . We thought there should be better consumer protection . We fought the parts of the reform we thought were irrational . You know , it 's not like you were for or against reform . There 's a -- I complete -- we completely acknowledge -LRB- ph -RRB- the need for massive reform after what happened . But , you know , some of the stuff that got done which is not rational . So we at first to say we 're supposed to bend down and accept it because we 're a bank , I say that 's not fair . So -- and Larry knows the detail too . He knows some of these things . That he did n't support all of the reform . If he would stand up here , he would agree with me , there are a lot of things that -- that had nothing to do with him , which is , you know , people in Congress coming up with their own ideas and what would make sense . ZAKARIA : All right . Jamie Dimon 's proposed resolution authority , for those of you who did n't catch it is the MDBBDB , minimally damaging bankruptcy for big dumb banks . Somehow I feel , Jamie , that you 're a great banker , but you have n't come up with a good acronym for legislation . ZAKARIA : Back in a moment . What keeps Jamie Dimon up at night ? -LRB- COMMERCIAL BREAK -RRB- ZAKARIA : And we 're back with more from Jamie Dimon , the CEO of JPMorgan Chase , perhaps America 's top banker . I asked him about what keeps him up at night ? What 's the next crisis to worry about ? ZAKARIA : Jamie , when you look out at -- at the world , do you worry about the easy money and the low cost of capital and what it can do ? The reason I ask this is , of course , many people believe we got into the problems we did in the financial crisis because there was too much easy money , the cost of capital had collapsed . It was too easy to get loans , too easy to -- to get leverage and people are borrowing too much . Banks were giving too much credit . Now , the solution to this problem has been easy money , allowing people to take lots of debt , encouraging people to take mortgages . In other words , the solution is the very set of factors which were supposed to have caused the problem . Is this a danger ? DIMON : So I do think it 's a danger , but to put in a little historical context , that we 've had -- I think when you plan for risk at all , you 've got to assume there are going to be issues you do n't always understand . And you do n't always know what the path is going to take . In fact , the problem that low interest rates caused last time may not be the problem it causes this time . And so I think wise people prepare for tough times . It does not mean that mankind should accept them . My guess is 500 years from now , we 'll be looking back at how we manage economies a little bit like we look at medicine today like how they need to bleed people when they had certain problems . We are -- we are very -- we 're not particularly good at it . And I think we 're still learning enormous lessons . And I think the actual risk from some of it is lower . Corporations from low rates and leverages way down , hedge funds are less leveraged , private equities are less leveraged , banks were less leveraged and corporations have a lot of money . So I think the leverage issue has been reduced and it 's kind of -- you look , it 's gone to the -- it 's gone to the governments who now have too much kind of leverage which you see in this sovereign crisis . So I do think it did cause part of the problems from last time , but only because there was a mound of other problems waiting to be exposed . You know , from bad mortgage underwriting to certain bad accounting , through gaps in the regulatory system . Some of those things are not there today . So I think it 's very different if it happens . ZAKARIA : What is the danger from municipal default by a state , California , New Jersey or a locality , and if I can add to that , this one for the complexity ? You have a large number of people who come into Congress from the Tea Party who say the one thing they 're sure of , there are no more bailouts . So is there -- you know , what people would call tail risks , is there some risk here that you have pressure on some U.S. state or city and the federal government actually does n't come through because of this anti-bailout atmosphere in Congress ? So , completely separate the states from municipalities . States have a lot of wherewithal , when you talk about this huge deficit , the deficit in California is equal to one percent of the GDP in California , so if they raise taxes one percent , they could pay their deficit . And that 's true for some of the other states and they have the wherewithal . There are 14,000 municipalities . And you are unfortunately going to see some bankruptcies . The 14,000 go from very small to obviously some very large . And it will be an issue for some . And they have built up these -- these obligations , pensions , kind of snuck up on people because a lot of these -- like governments , you know , when like corporations used to until they change accounting , you give things away today , they do n't cost until later and you have to write -- you have to put it in the books today . So I think you 'll see some municipalities use bankruptcy court to try to renegotiate some of those contracts . But $ 3 trillion of total state and municipality debt is -- with all of the -- and some a fraction of the problems . And I do n't think it 's going to cause a systemic issue in the United States . It 'll be in the headlines , you 'll see kind of some to-ing and fro-ing and the total deficit of all states and all municipalities is 200 billion , relative to the total U.S. deficit of 1.5 trillion . So that is really kind of small relative to that . It 's a concern . It 's going to have to be fixed . I just do n't think it 's going to stop growth in 2011 or 2012 . It 's just a negative factor overlying the American system . Can we close by getting one thought -- and what is the thing that worries you the most ? And if you can keep it too one sentence , just , you know , what is the shock to the system that you 're most worried about ? What keeps you up at night ? DIMON : So I 'm going to use the word `` bad policy '' , but before I use that word , I want to say that I think the governments of the world did a tremendous amount of things that saved it from getting far worse . But if you read a lot of economic history , and particularly this book , I know -- I know Ken Rogoff is here . You know , Reinhart and Rogoff wrote a book `` This Time is Different '' , about eight major crises , that financial crises take a long time getting out of . , but it 's not a given that it has to take place . Very often it take a long time getting out of this , because policies in the middle of the crises , not from -- sometimes for venal purposes but often just a lack of knowledge and lack of understanding actually make it worse . And I would love to get people back to work , employed and growing . I think it 's the most important thing that we have to do . And , you know , I know there are unknown -- and I agree with you , but to my attitude , geopolitics , I do n't know -- it 's always there and it will always going to hit us somewhere where we least expect it , so we 've got to be prepared for those . ZAKARIA : That was Jamie Dimon . Back with my final thoughts on Egypt in just a moment . ZAKARIA : Before we go , I want to recommend a book , this week it 's George W. Bush 's memoir , `` Decision Points . '' I read it recently on a plane . I have to say it 's surprisingly well written and frank . You will not agree with all of his decisions . You might not think he 's super smart , but he comes across as an agreeable frank human being and I found it a good read . News moves fast and we 've already moved past that heady evening in Cairo just two days ago when a dictatorship was toppled by people power . We moved on to discussing the problems that remain , the military in power , the divided -- divided oppositions , the weak economy , all totally valid concerns . But can we take a moment to marvel at the courage and the discipline of those crowds in Egypt , those people who risked their lives and created history . In Shakespeare 's `` Henry V , '' the young king tells the crowd on the eve of the Battle of Agincourt that they would remember being on that battle field on that day , St. Crispin 's Day . For the rest of their lives , that they would tell their children they were there , that they would show off the wounds they suffered that day . `` People now in bed , '' Henry V said , `` would feel themselves cursed that they were not hereupon St Crispin 's Day . '' Well , I think people in Cairo in Tahrir Square will remember this day for the rest of their lives and tell their children and grandchildren that this was Egypt 's St. Crispin 's Day . Thank you all for being part of my program this week . I will see you next week .

HOWARD KURTZ , HOST : News was on television , on the web , everywhere , Hosni Mubarak was about to step down . And then he did n't . An Egyptian official he would n't , and then the next day he did . Have journalists been too quick to pass on unconfirmed reports and did they get swept by the jubilation on streets of Cairo ? AOL buys the `` Huffington Post '' for $ 315 million with Arianna Huffington becoming its news czar , but will life inside a big corporation change the essence of what made the liberal site so popular ? Keith Olbermann joins forces with Al Gore , becoming the chief news officer and primetime host at tiny Current TV . Is this a step down for MSNBC 's liberal lion ? Plus , Gawker runs flirtatious e-mails from a shirtless congressman , and before the rest of the media can agree whether it 's news , the lawmaker resigns . We 'll talk to the reporter who cracked the case . I 'm Howard Kurtz and this is RELIABLE SOURCES . The street protest that produced a revolution in Egypt had been remarkable to watch , but the chaotic nature of the story has often left journalists scrambling for information and sometimes getting ahead of the facts . That was the case on Thursday when many news organizations agreed that the drama of Hosni Mubarak was coming to an end . Here 's what it looked like . There in Egypt , live pictures at the moment . We have had two separate sources telling us that President Mubarak may be stepping down tonight . JOHN KING , CNN : I 'm also told by a senior official that privately they have received word from ranking officials in the Mubarak regime that generally give them reliable information that the plan is in place for President Mubarak to yield power to the vice president . But I will add , as the source I spoke to added with me , a little bit of caution and skepticism . RICHARD ENGEL , NBC NEWS : We are hearing stronger than that from two independent sources close to the president , that President Mubarak will likely step down . Two separate sources close to the president say President Mubarak will step down . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : We have a fast-moving situation right now on the streets of Cairo and we 're getting information that President Mubarak may step down as soon as this afternoon . WOLF BLITZER , CNN : Victory , victory , that may be soon at hand for Egypt 's pro-democracy protesters . President Hosni Mubarak expected to announce on Egyptian television within this hour or next hour , but very soon we 're told , that he is stepping down and ending his 30 years in power . CHRIS MATTHEWS , MSNBC : The only thing clear in the long statement from President Mubarak was that he 's not leaving Egypt . No indication that he 's giving up power . It seemed defiant in a very sad way . BLITZER : All right , there you just heard the president of Egypt at least , according to that translation , I did not hear him utter the words that I am stepping down . KURTZ : Because he did not utter those words . But , on Friday , of course , came word that Mubarak finally had resigned , setting off utter jubilation across the country , and correspondents that got caught up in the celebration . HARRY SMITH , CBS NEWS : There 's a state of euphoria , a state of disbelief . People are almost afraid to believe what they know in her hearts is true , that Mubarak is gone . KURTZ : But did journalists rush to judgment before that ? Joining us now here in Washington , Jeffrey Goldberg , national correspondent for the Atlantic . And in Jerusalem , Janine Zacharia , the bureau chief there for the `` Washington Post . '' And in Paris , Christopher Dickey , Middle East regional editor for `` Newsweek , '' who just got off a plane from Cairo about an hour ago . And Chris Dickey , so many news outlets as you saw , as you heard reporting on Thursday that Mubarak had resigned . In such a chaotic situation , should n't journalists have been more cautious ? CHRISTOPHER DICKEY , NEWSWEEK : Yes , I think people should have been more cautious . As I was starting to get those reports , I kept saying to myself , hold back , because the characteristic of the Egyptian revolution has been the ability of the people and the government to surprise us again and again and again . Everything that we thought was predictable in Egypt has been unpredictable . So this seems like another possibility , and in fact it was not what anybody thought was going to happen . People around the president really did think he was going to resign , and then he did n't . KURTZ : And Jeff Goldberg , however we try to rationalize it , and this was sort of like watching the journalistic sausage being made , but those stories were wrong . JEFFREY GOLDBERG , THE NEW YORKER : The stories were premature , let 's call it that . They were wrong , and that 's an excellent point . I do n't know if Mubarak knew what he was going to do . And this whole notion that two sources in the palace , we have it independently confirmed , it was utter chaos from what I 've seen . I 've been in those situations before . No one knows anything about anything . So a great deal of caution is necessary . KURTZ : So relying on sources to provide a definitive account of something that has not yet happened is very dangerous . HURTZ : Janine Zacharia , the Egyptian military announcing this morning without warning that it has suspended the constitution , dissolved parliament , and has set up a six-month transition government . With that and with what 's happened in the last three weeks , how hard is it in the Middle East to separate rumor -- to separate fact I should say from rumor and speculation ? JANINE ZACHARIA , WASHINGTON POST : Well , it certainly has been very difficult . Certainly over the last 18 days when you do n't really have , as Jeffrey pointed out , you do n't really have any official spokesman -- you do n't have -- everybody is sort of hiding from NDP , Mubarak 's party , and it 's very hard to really confirm anything . It seems like the military , however , is taking a different approach and being very direct about what they are saying . On the early reports , though , Howie , I think a lot of people got caught up , remember in that press conference or that statement that the military had made , and interpreted from it that that meant Mubarak was leaving . Then you had the Leon Panetta thing on the Hill , which misled a lot of people , but certainly jumping the gun like that was really irresponsible . KURTZ : Just to explain , the CIA director said that he expected Mubarak to step down and he later backtracked and said he was reacting to media reports . Let me play for you something CNN 's Anderson Cooper said after that bizarre Mubarak address on Thursday . ANDERSON COOPER , CNN : What we heard were the same lies we 've heard from him and his regime for more than two weeks now . What we heard is a man who clearly believes that he is Egypt . He kept repeating this lie that this is all some sort of foreign interference . -LRB- END VIDEO CLIP -RRB- KURTZ : Chris Dickey , Anderson Cooper repeatedly using the word lies . Now I think most journalists would agree with him , perhaps most Americans would agree with him . But should an anchor and correspondent being taking sides on this kind of story ? DICKEY : I think Anderson sort of -- that 's part of the soul of his show is to take sides and be passionate and come across as someone who 's reasonable , but committed to a certain vision of the story . In fact , I do n't think lies is an exaggerated word to use in this context . I mean , when you have a head of a state who 's telling one untruth after another and they are certifiable , and then we come into the situation where he really is lying not only to the country but probably to himself . I think Anderson can be forgiven for using that word in that context . KURTZ : And of course , Anderson Cooper was repeatedly punched in the head when he was covering the demonstrations during those couple of days when they turned violent and when journalists were not just attacked but targeted for attacks . Jeff Goldberg , a lot of euphoria in the coverage . I 'm wondering whether or not there was another side of the story . `` Time '' magazine , for example , quoted a couple of Egyptians as saying they did n't want Mubarak to leave or at least not so quickly , because they valued stability in the country . And there 's also the argument , of course , that Mubarak staying was better for the U.S. because we do n't know what 's going to come next . So what did you make of that aspect of the coverage , where the journalists really seemed to swing behind let 's get rid of this guy ? GOLDBERG : Well , do n't forget . During the Bush administration , there was a period when Bush and Condoleezza Rice were speaking out very strongly against -- at least rhetorically opposed to the Mubarak regime and talking about the necessity for democracy . And there was a great deal of skepticism in the American media about this line of attack on Mubarak , and everybody was then a foreign policy realist and saying Mubarak has been a stalwart ally of the U.S. , which is true , helped us in the war on terror , which is true . Keeps peace with Israel , which is true . Now everybody has sort of swung the other way , probably over simplistically as well , and said this is the only storyline , that Mubarak was an evil dictator and he 's gone and it 's better for everyone . Now , it 's true . It 's probably better for Egypt , but what that 's missing is all of the complexity of this . Egypt has not experienced democracy before . It 's been one dictator after another , and I think we 're losing sight of the fact that now comes the interesting and hard part for Egypt . KURTZ : If you throw too much complexity in , will you ruin my storyline here ? I want a simple storyline . Janine , what these protesters accomplished in 18 days was just extraordinary . But is it possible that there are also millions of Americans -LRB- sic -RRB- who stayed home , who had a different view of whether this regime should be toppled in this dramatic fashion ? ZACCHARIA : Well , you know , I think as you were saying , Howie , I mean , some of the breathless coverage that we saw and the fact that all of the pictures , as Frank Sesno said last week , we 're just addicted to the picture . All of the reporting for television was from Tahrir Square , like the size of the meadowlands basically in New York . I mean , there was not any reporting from anywhere else in the country that day . It was very hard to get some sort of quote\\/unquote , `` balanced pictures , '' and people just got very swept up in it . So I think maybe in retrospect perhaps that was another thing , but it would n't have been as exciting as being there in this sort of post Super Bowl atmosphere . I think one of the other things we have to do when we look back at the coverage is sort of the way that rumor as you mentioned earlier was used . I mean , it was sort of like any guy with a laptop.com was enough to then run with the story without any kind of confirmation . That was enough to propel the story forward . So I think -LRB- inaudible -RRB- , but on a plus side , when was the last time that the U.S. domestic audience was focused on a foreign story for 18 days ? I mean , it is historic like President Obama said . KURTZ : Well , that is absolutely true . Project for Excellence in Journalism finding that 32 percent of Americans following the story very closely , that doubled from the previous week . But this post-Super Bowl atmosphere that you referred to . I want to play a clip -- let me say first of all , I think CNN , you know , which has a great international network , did a superlative job during this crisis . But NBC 's Richard Engel , I thought , you know , really kind of typified the enthusiasm because has so often reported from the middle of those crows . Let 's play a brief sound bite of Engel on Friday . RICHARD ENGEL , NBC CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT : Many Egyptians never thought that they would live to see this day . This is certainly a turning point in this country and , Brian , it could be a turning point for the Middle East . KURTZ : Chris Dickey , is it possible to stand in that sea of humanity , people screaming , crying and just joyous and not get swept away and lose any sense of objectivity ? DICKEY : Yes , it 's possible . But on the other hand , when you 're in the middle of a moment like that and you 're reporting it live on the air , you want to catch the sentiment that exists around you . You can step back when that moment passed and it 's over already . And you can take a look at the context that created it and what 's going to come after . You can even take a look at the Mubaraks . I have a long piece in the new edition of `` Newsweek '' about the tragedy of the Mubaraks who probably really did think that they were doing good all these years but were totally out of touch with their people . On the other hand , if you 're in Tahrir Square , you are in touch with hundreds of thousands of people sharing the same emotion and you 'd look like kind of silly if you were crossing your arms and saying , well , it 's not really as great as all that . GOLDBERG : Well , no , exactly the point I wanted to make which is that you 're being hugged and kissed and there 's euphoria all around you . And it might not be the moment to say , of course , foreign policy challenges remain and we do n't know , of course , if the army is going to , you know -- you 're not going to be able to deliver that level of analysis in the heat of the moment . But , you know , the entire -- you have a structure around you . You have a network and you have other reports who can sort of introduce those questions pretty quickly . KURTZ : Well , we 'll have a chance to do that in the coming days when we do n't have the pictures of people celebrating and\\/or protesting in Tahrir Square . That will be a harder story as you were alluding to earlier . GOLDBERG : But this is the problem . I mean , that once Tahrir Square is empty , now the hard part begins and Egypt 's direction is now being settled . And I 'm afraid , of course , that we 're going , you know , in two weeks or three weeks people are going to barely remember that there was this revolution in Egypt , or two or three days . KURTZ : That is the challenge for journalism . Jeffrey Goldberg , Janine Zacharia , Christopher Dickey , thanks very much for joining us . When we come back , AOL 's big get . What is buying `` The Huffington Post '' mean for the company and for Arianna 's very popular and very liberal side ? KURTZ : It began nearly six years ago at Arianna Huffington 's L.A. mansion with a bunch of her liberal friends . The idea : to create a Web site that would help Democrats by offering a lefty alternative to the Drudge Report . But through smart packaging , a strong dose of culture and entertainment and aggressively linking to other people 's work , The Huffington Post grew into a blockbuster now drawing nearly 25 million readers a month . This week , Huffington announced a deal with AOL 's chief executive Tim Armstrong , the Web site , that always touted its independence from the corporate media , was being sold or sold out , some critics complain , to a major corporation . -LRB- BEGIN VIDEOTAPE -RRB- KARA SWISHER , `` BOOMTOWN '' COLUMN WRITER FOR ALLTHINGSDIGITAL.COM : Why did you sell `` The Huffington Post '' besides the giant pile of money Tim is shoving your way ? ARIANNA HUFFINGTON : And I had just made new year 's resolution already for the end of the year -- SWISHER : Which was to sell your -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- for a giant amount of money ? HUFFINGTON : -- which was for us to accelerate everything we were doing . To going to lockout -LRB- ph -RRB- in time for the presidential election , to go to Brazil where I had just come from and where we wanted to launch Huffington -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- to go global . So the way that our vision came together . Classified -LRB- ph -RRB- that we both believe in real journalism or regional reporting and hiring a lot of both established journalists . KURTZ : So what does all this mean , not just for Arianna and AOL , but for the growing clout of online media ? Joining us now here in Washington , Mark Potts , Internet Media and Strategy Consultant and a former `` Washington Post '' reporter . In New York , Felix Salmon , the business blogger for Reuters . And in San Francisco , Kara Swisher , co-executive editor of `` All Things Digital , '' the journalist who broke the story and conducted that interview we just saw with Arianna Huffington . So Kara Swisher , what does this deal tell us about the value and influence and clout of online media sites ? SWISHER : Well , it was a couple of things going on . Obviously , it 's a lot of money for a site that does n't make a lot of money . So that says a lot . Meaning `` The Huffington Post '' is just like other Internet companies . But I think it says that Tim , for one , AOL really needs something exciting . And to them , `` The Huffington Post '' was the exciting , sort of , addition to their strategy of premium content . And for online , I think it 's probably a little bit of a hype that it means something for online content . Online content has been developing for a long time and here 's the first example of one of the biggest sales of it . And I do n't think it means that it 's growing in power , it just means that people are using it and therefore the more prominent ones are going to be sold for a lot of money . KURTZ : Felix Salmon , more original reporting in recent years , but it 's know more , if you look at the sign as I know you have , for aggregation of other people 's work , packaging more than original journalism . How is that worth 300 million bucks ? FELIX SALMON , FMR . WRITER FOR EUROMONEY MAGAZINE AND PORTFOLIO MAGAZINE : It 's actually not a particularly high valuation . If you look at what lugs -LRB- ph -RRB- of value that when there are acquisitions like this , it 's normally in the sort of five to six times revenues range or -- and if you look at any of the ratios here , they 're pretty much in line . If anything , it 's a little bit low . Back in December , people were saying that `` The Huffington Post '' was worth somewhere between $ 300 and $ 450 million . And this is the lower end of that range . So if you just look at the financials , it 's a pretty justifiable price , I think . And the fact is the page views and audience and loyalty are what `` The Huffington Post '' has . It 's not really a matter of who broke the story in the first place . That has some value , but there 's a lot of value outside that . HURTZ : Loyalty very important online , Mark Potts , and Arianna Huffington also becoming the editorial director for all of AOL 's content . What exactly does she bring to the company we used to call America Online ? MARK POTTS , CO-FOUNDED WASHINGTONPOST.COM : That 's a good question . I 'm a big fan of Arianna . I think she 's done a great job as an impresario , a promoter , building `` Huffington Post . '' I 'm not sure she brings that much to AOL as an editorial brain . I think there are others at `` The Huffington Post '' who contribute a lot to the success of what the site is now , in creating what it is editorially . And I wonder if Arianna actually is one who did that and how much she brings to AOL . KURTZ : Well , she brings a name , obviously , and personality . Kara Swisher , you know , `` The Huffington Post '' has its own very distinct personality and always had its independence . How will being part of a big corporation change that ? SWISHER : I do n't know if she 'll it at all . I think actually she does bring that . She 's a lightning rod . She attracts attention consistently . She 's on television all the time . You know , AOL has no personality whatsoever in terms of editorial . And this brings a personality to it , who manages to bring in some excitement . So , I do n't think that 's necessarily not unimportant for them . I mean , you 'd rather be -- If you 're Tim Armstrong , you 're the guy who 's selling AOL content and I do n't even know what that is , or you will be the guy that bought Arianna Huffington 's blog . And so , I think she will be much more involved than you think . KURTZ : Would I be more likely as a reader to click on any of the other blogs that AOL has , whether it 's `` In Gadget '' or `` Tech Crunch '' because it 's got Arianna ? SWISHER : No , no , no. . But I say -- but it brings attention to AOL as an editorial property . Just like any prominent editor would . I mean , that 's -- it 's so easy to think that because she is so interesting as a personality in journalism . At the same time , you know , some of those sites are actually pretty good . They are very in and of their own right . I think it just brings cohesion , I guess , of what they 're doing and I think a lot of people have been confused about what Tim Armstrong is doing at AOL and the stock has reflected that . KURTZ : Felix Salmon , an `` L.A. Times '' columnist described `` The Huffington Post '' as a galley rowed by slaves commanded by pirates . This is , of course , a reference in the business model in which most of the outside contributors are not paid a dime . Is that a good business model ? SALMON : It 's a fantastic business model if you can get content for free . KURTZ : What about if you 're a writer ? SALMN : These are people who are contributing for their own reasons . And actually Nate Silver has a great column in `` The New York Times '' explaining that they do n't account for a huge proportion of `` The Huffington Post '' total . He 's paying it 's about 4 percent . It might be a little bit more than that , but not much . They provide a base and a voice . And I think one of things that Arianna wants to do is to plug into AOL 's local network or patch , and use all of those extra people around the country to do reporting in the 2012 campaign and that kind of thing . And voice is incredibly important online , it 's the reason that people come back . And , of course , the other reason which you have n't quite touched on yet is that Tim Armstrong was buying technology . `` The Huffington Post '' is a incredibly sophisticated technology company and that technology is very valuable to AOL . KURTZ : It , also , Mark Potts was a well deserved representation as being on the left . As I said , it was founded in order to be on the left . Most of the columnists are liberal . Most of the lawmakers who have posts are Democrats . But Arianna Huffington told me this week , well , she wants to move beyond these left\\/right debates . And she is de-emphasizing politics , or at least it makes up only 15 percent of her total traffic . But I 'm wondering whether being part of AOL will accelerate that process and people who are liberal and who like the liberal voice of `` Huff Post '' will feel that it 's been lost or faded . POTTS : I think it 's a fair question . I think she risks diluting her own brand by moving more towards the center and she 's definitely saying all the right things about trying to be more centrist that she 's now with a news company rather than an opinion company . And with AOL , she wants to -- she wants to toe the middle line . But there are people who come to `` Huffington Post '' because they like the left-leaning . And if they like it going away , and has been drifting away from that , has been drifting more towards the center , if they feel like it going away , it wo n't be the same product for them . -LRB- CROSSTALK -RRB- SWISHER : I 'm just saying , she 's been doing -- she 's been attacking the Obama administration . She 's one of the most prominent critics in the past year . So , she does what she feels like . I do n't think she 's -- I do n't think -- she likes to say she 's not left or right . She 's obviously more left-leaning . But I mean , I think she likes to do what 's interesting and dramatic . So , I think you 're going to see that more than anything else . POTTS : But let 's face it , over the career , she 's been both left and right . KURTZ : Yes , she once was a -- somebody who was a confidant of Newt Gingrich , married to a Republican congressman . KURTZ : But you said earlier that AOL did n't much for identity . You 've written a book on AOL . Why does it seem , at least until now , as kind of a hodge-podge of different sites without a real strong brand ? SWISHER : Because it 's a hodge-podge of different sites without a definite band . You know , I think he 's been trying to pull it out . I think Tim has been trying to pull it out and make something of it . And actually , they 're doing what actually Yahoo ! probably should be doing , create a sort of a premium content destination on the Internet . I mean , someone has to be the Conde Nast of the Internet . It 's not right now , it 's not Conde Nast . But someone 's got to form this thing and it 's not like a gigantic business in the same way . It 's got the same issues about advertising and making money and bringing audience to it . But someone 's got to do this . And so , he 's trying with this company that 's gone through so much history to give it -- to give it a personality and give it a definition . And people like a story and he 's trying to build a story here and this certainly adds to the excitement of that . KURTZ : You know , I 've been asking for a couple of years , Felix Salmon , why `` The New York Times '' or `` The Washington Post '' or CNN or any other major media company did n't start something like `` The Huffington Post . '' You did something interesting . You compared the front pages of `` The Huffington Post '' and `` The New York Times '' in terms of their layout , in terms of how many comments they attracted . What did you find ? SALMON : Well , actually , what I did is I took a `` New York Times '' story which they broke and I compared to `` The Huffington Post '' reblog of that story , where they basically took the news from `` The New York Times '' and said , `` Look , ` The New York Times ' has this news . '' And `` The Huffington Post '' page was much more interesting , had many more exit points , had the stories that my friends were reading on Facebook , had great pictures . It was loads of stuff which you want to click on and you want to interact with and had thousands of comments and likes on Facebook and tweets and retweets and all the rest of it . Whereas , `` The New York Times '' original story which is where the real meat was had none of that really . It was very dull . It was gray , had a few links , no pictures . You had to sort of navigate around by clicking on something called sports or something like that . And the reason why `` The Huffington Post '' has been so much more successful in many ways in terms of getting loyalty and reader engagement is because it has this technology , this architecture , which is very good at that . And `` The New York Times '' report is putting up this pay wall which is just getting to make it ever harder to get somebody who are n't already subscribers to click around and explore . KURTZ : But , of course , Mark Potts , as we go to break , `` The Times '' had the pay the reporter to get the story in the first place . POTTS : Pay the reporter with the story , but all `` The Huffington Post '' ran was a couple of paragraphs of `` The Times '' story . All you need was two paragraphs of `` The Times '' story . You 'll never read the rest of `` The Times '' story . KURTZ : And if -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- is better and it got more people to like it on Facebook , then , obviously , it accomplished something and -- POTTS : And `` Huffington Post '' probably drives more traffic as `` The Times '' story , `` The Times '' itself does . So , `` The Times '' is getting to cut that off -LRB- ph -RRB- . KURTZ : All right , got to go . Mark Potts , Kara Swisher , Felix Salmon , thanks very much for joining us . And coming up in the second part of RELIABLE SOURCES , Keith Olbermann heading to Current TV . Can the former MSNBC star put Al Gore 's network on the map ? Plus , Gawker gets its man . We 'll talk with the gossip reporter about , a story about a congressman 's shirtless pictures on Craigslist and how they cost him his job . KEITH OLBERMANN : There were many occasions , particularly in the last two and a half years were all but surrounded the show but never the show itself was too much for me . With your support and loyalty , and may I use the word insistence , ultimately required that I keep going . KURTZ : When Keith Olbermann and MSNBC had their bitter break-up , everyone in the media world wanted to know what 's Keith is going to do next . We got the answer this week when the liberal commentator joined forces with Al Gore . The former vice president is the co-founder of Current TV , where Olbermann will not only launch a primetime program this spring , but serve as chief news officer . Current TV is not exactly high profile offering such programs as `` Bar Karma '' and `` Kill It , Cook It , Eat It . '' UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Six volunteers , one Devon farm , they are here to find out where meat comes from -- to look the animals in the eye . It 's -LRB- EXPLETIVE DELETED -RRB- . Nearly half of the world 's population is without access to toilets . KURTZ : So will Olbermann 's new cable home diminish his clout or put Al Gore 's operation on the media map ? Joining us now here in Washington , Matt Lewis , blogger and political analyst for Politicsdaily.com . In New York , Rachel Sklar , editor at large for mediaite.com . And in Chicago , Aaron Barnhart , television critic for the `` Kansas City Star '' and editor of TVBarn.com . And Aaron Barnhart , Olbermann cast this as a move towards media independence on his part , away from the corporate media that employed him at MSNBC , and you challenged that on the conference call that he had with reporters . AARON BARNHART , TVBARN.COM : I thought it was particular that I would choose that note to launch his venture on Current TV . Because if you look at what he has done in those two and a half years he was talking about , he launched a free health clinic . He did a number of -- you know , he was his own man . He ended his worst persons in the world segment kind of on his own accord . But really if you go back to his entire eight-year relationship with MSNBC , when did they not play -- when did they not march to his tune ? Here 's a guy who came along , and from a humble perch of an 8 p.m. show , watched by a few hundred thousand people , basically helped NBC find its voice for its cable news channel . He also said on the conference call , he 's the most restless man on television . He 's like a shark . So at some point , it clearly got boring for him . KURTS : Well , now that the shark has moved to Current TV , Rachel Sklar , which averages about 23,000 viewers , I 'm told , in primetime , is this a bit of a step down for Olbermann ? RACHEL SKLAR , FORMER SENIOR CONTRIBUTING EDITOR FOR THE HUFFINGTON POST : It depends how you 're looking at it . I mean , I think Olbermann likes to fashion himself as someone who 's a builder , you know . He enjoyed the fact that he got to go to MSNBC and take credit essentially for the fact where that the network is where it is today . So at Current , he gets to take on that role again . You know , Current is in what is it , 60 million households have access to it , and there 's not only that , but there 's the Current channel and then there is also the clips that will then go forth to the Internet . And so Olbermann has been very smart so far in how he deployed himself because he 's got one basic channel -- one basic target , and that 's the Fox News Channel . Like , you know , he 's got his , FOK , Friends of Keith , and that 's his target . He has n't really been -- KURTZ : You 're referring to guys that he now assumes on Twitter . KURTZ : Let me turn to Matt Lewis , because not only is , as I mentioned at the top , not only is Olbermann going to be the star of Current TV , he 's going be the chief news officer . Does that kind brand this Al Gore founded channel as a left-wing outfit ? MATT LEWIS , LEAVING AS A COLUMNIST FOR AOL 'S POLITICSDAILY.COM : I think it might . I mean , look , first of all , you talked about the break-up with MSNBC . This struck me as a rebound thing , right , where you ca n't be single for long . You have got to jump into a relationship with the next big thing . But , you 're right , if you look at what Current TV is , it 's left of center , but it 's kind -- it 's like a young network , it 's MTV meets NPR . It 's kind of cool , not overtly political . Certainly left of center . This makes it overtly political . To me it makes it a little bit less cool , but I 'm not their target audience probably . KURTZ : Speaking of political , before I move on to the next topic . You announced this week that you are leaving AOL Politics Daily and joining Tucker Carlson 's Daily Caller web site , and you said this is because of Arianna Huffington becoming the editor and news director of AOL . And you called her a far left liberal . Did you think she was going to dictate what you write ? LEWIS : Well , look , here is the deal . If you 're in the business of making widgets , it does n't really matter who your boss is , because widgets are not ideological , right , you 're working for a paycheck . But when you 're an opinion writer , it matters very deeply , the political philosophy of the editorial department . My thing is , I do not have to work for a conservative outlet , but I will not work for a liberal outlet , and that certainly was a prime consideration for me . KURTZ : All right . Don Rumsfeld making the rounds this week pushing his book , his version of what happened during his tenure as defense secretary . First interview was done by ABC 's Diane Sawyer . Let 's take a look . DONALD RUMSFELD , FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY : Hillary Clinton , John Kerry , the French intelligence , the British intelligence , the German intelligence . It was uniform across the board that -- that it was reasonable to assume that he had chemical and biological weapons . DIANE SAWYER : But you were wrong . RUMSFELD : My goodness , the intelligence was certainly wrong . SAWYER : If you had known he did not have them -- SAWYER : If you had -- KURTZ : Aaron Barnhart , what did you make of Sawyer and others who tried to pin down the former Pentagon chief on how much he was wrong about Iraq ? And I 've read his book . He does n't say he was wrong about very much . BARNHART : No , it does n't . And Stephanopoulos probably came closest to nailing him on some points , but -- and I thought Sawyer 's segment was kind of weird because it starts out with his up close and personal thing where we found out about some family tragedy that was going on , which I thought was completely irrelevant to his making a decision to send 4,500 men and women to die in Iraq and Afghanistan . And it 's been four and a half years since he 's addressed the media , was n't really interested in that . You know , this is part of the -- you know , the legacy of the 1980s and '90s when the big thing was to have a get with an author who is coming out with a brand new book . But in the Internet age , it seems to me like we 've all kind of moved on from that . I mean , I would be much more interested in seeing your old colleague , Tom Ricks , who has written a couple of books very critical of Rumsfeld 's management of these wars , engaging him , but of course -- KURTZ : Well , the book leaked out early , as it always does . I got a copy , other reports did too . But it 's still I think useful to have somebody put the guy in the chair , cameras rolling , and try to hold him accountable . Let me get a break here . When we come back , Bill O'Reilly 's Super Bowl sit-down with Barack Obama , was the lack of fireworks good for Fox News ? -LRB- COMMERCIAL BREAK -RRB- KURTZ : Bill O'Reilly said it would be the most watched interview of all time . OK , It was n't . But the setting was fascinating : Barack Obama in the White House on Super Bowl Sunday with one of the most opinionated hosts from the network that his administration had once declared war on . So O'Reilly faced something of a balancing act . Here 's a bit of the interview . BILL O'REILLY , FOX NEWS ANCHOR : Does it disturb you that so many people hate you ? It 's a serious question . OBAMA : You know , the truth is that the people -- and I 'm sure previous presidents would say the same thing , whether it was Bush or Clinton or Reagan or anybody , that the people who dislike you , do n't know you . OBAMA : Even -- the folks who hate you , they do n't know you . OBAMA : What they hate is whatever funhouse mirror image of you that 's out there . KURTZ : Rachel Sklar , O'Reilly took issue with me , saying he did n't put points on board in that interview . Well , it was Super Bowl Sunday . I used a lot of football metaphors . What I meant was that this famous aggressive interviewer did n't really get the president off his script . What was your thoughts ? SKLAR : Well , honestly , watching that , my thought was I really wanted to hear Obama speak more . O'Reilly interrupted him mid-thought a lot of the time . You know , there have been -- there 's been a lot of criticism , saying that that ... KURTZ : I do n't think it was that bad . There was a lot of back and forth . It was n't like he was cutting him off . SKLAR : I had n't seen it ... KURTZ : I have to cut you off now . SKLAR : I had n't seen it when it aired , and I -- when it started , I was like , `` Oh , this is n't so bad . '' Towards , you know , when they got into the thick of it , he really did . He would interrupt Obama before he had a chance to actually answer the question . That 's just -- that does n't serve the audience . That was actually my overarching thought . SKLAR : But I liked the interview . KURTZ : Get an overarching thought from Matt Lewis . O'Reilly came off as reasonable . KURTZ : And as he pointed out a couple days after that , that 's good for FOX , right ? LEWIS : I think it is . And I think there 's a distinction to be made . Bill O'Reilly , I think , is different than Glenn Beck or Keith Olbermann . I think , you know , he certainly can be incendiary , but I think he is also more of a newsman . And let me say , I kind of disagree with you and Rachel both . I thought the interview was fabulous . I thought that both President Obama and Bill O'Reilly deserved an A plus . And I also think ... BLITZER : What was fabulous about it ? LEWIS : Well , first of all , you have to interrupt . You have to interrupt people because that is when you get to the real person . KURTZ : So by interrupting , what did he get ? LEWIS : I think what you saw is the actual President Obama , instead of the talking points , instead of the stuff he rehearsed . And you know what ? I think it was likeable . I think when he interrupted and you got to him off message , people probably liked it . KURTZ : Aaron Barnhart , O'Reilly does n't usually do live interviews . He tapes his program every night . And to me he seemed rushed , just a little off his game . How did you see it ? BARNHART : Yes , I disagree with that , Howie . I thought it was excellent . Count me in with Matt on that . BARNHART : This was the Bill O'Reilly I remember from 11 , 12 years ago when he was , you know , not the 800-pound gorilla . Look , Bill O'Reilly every night has a challenge , which is to find somebody to talk to who 's as formidable and who is as influential and who is as powerful as he is . And most nights you do n't get it . And I think that 's led to somewhat of a distortion of his image over the years . Here with the president , he has somebody that he can really go mano-a-mano with , and both guys think -- you know , I thought were clearly invigorated by it . BARNHART : Look , you know , everywhere else in the world , the head of state expects a vigorous sort of questioning . I remember that Irish reporter who , you know , started interrogating President Bush back in the day , and he sort of looked at her this way , because he was not accustomed to that type of treatment from the American press . Let me close with one exchange between the -- O'Reilly and the president that I did like . Let 's roll that . O'REILLY : How much damage do you believe the media is doing by participating in this rancor ? And people have accused me of that . OBAMA : I do n't think it helps . And the media , unfortunately -- if I have a nice talk with John McCain and we 're agreeing to do something ... KURTZ : That was a good question , and the president is right . Matt Lewis , Aaron Barnhart , Rachel Sklar , thanks very much for stopping by . Up next , the Gawker article that brought a congressman down . We 'll talk to the reporter who wrote the story . KURTZ : I was debating with my staff the other day whether a titillating report by Gawker , the online gossip site , was worth discussing on this program . I voted yes , but before we could resolve it , Congressman Christopher Lee settled the matter : he resigned . The married Republican congressman from upstate New York had sent some flirtatious e-mails to a woman on Craigslist , describing himself as a divorced lobbyist . There were also some shirtless photos of himself . Well , joining us now from New York , Maureen O'Connor , the Gawker staff writer who broke the story . Three and a half hours from the time you posted that piece to Congressman Lee 's resignation . Did you surprise you , that he quit and that he quit so quickly ? MAUREEN O'CONNOR , GAWKER.COM : It most virtually surprised us , especially that the e-mails we had were relatively tame . He had never actually met this woman . There was no evidence of an actual affair . It was really just a sort of PG-13 embarrassing but ultimately not terribly racy picture and flirtation . KURTZ : Something about the online culture I think now that you are -- some cases forced to resign before anything actually happens of this actual nation . And this woman , and she since identified herself to `` The Washington Post , '' as Yesha Callahan , she just contacted you ? What was her motivation ? Why did she come to Gawker ? O'CONNOR : We received an e-mail in our like tips@gawker.com, our tip line , from somebody . And it was a brief email that said I had a chance encounter with a congressman , do you want to hear about it ? And , you know , we almost missed this e-mail because it was so small . And , so , of course , I said , yes . And do you have actual proof of this ? And lo and behold , she actually did . She provided us e-mails that were from the confirmed personal e-mail address of Christopher Lee . We were able to -- his staff confirmed that was his personal e - mail address , after we realized it was the e-mail addressed that he created his personal Facebook account with . So , honestly , the dots were not that hard to connect . KURTZ : Did this woman tell you her name ? O'CONNOR : I did know the woman 's name and her background , although I did promise her anonymity . KURTZ : You did n't push her to go public ? Because , obviously , she decided to go public after the story broke . O'CONNOR : No -- well , we worked with her . And I sort of ca n't go through the details of that . O'CONNOR : But I definitely , you know , I knew -- I looked into the identity and background of the person . We , you know , looked over the e-mails and we looked at the digital evidence to prove that it was , in fact , a real correspondence . So , we sort of had that every step of the way and then , of course , Christopher Lee probably is the person that made this the really big story and ultimately proved it was important when he resigned . KURTZ : And , importantly , you gave the congressman 's office a chance to resign . Now , I worked for `` The Daily Beast . '' We probably would have run the story . `` Politico '' might have run this story . But do you think if this woman had contacted , you know , CNN , `` Washington Post , '' `` New York Times , '' `` L.A. Times , '' `` Wall Street Journal , '' that any of these mainstream outlets would have felt comfortable going with a story about some congressman , you know , sending a woman shirtless photos ? O'CONNOR : You know , I think it may have been presented differently . I mean , what we really do is sort of -- we fill a different niche of reporting essentially . We are a gossip blog . And whereas , say , a beat report on the Hill could know everybody in Christopher Lee 's staff and they might have sources all over the Hill . This kind of story does not come necessarily from that . Christopher Lee was -- it seems like , had a secret double life that he was leading on the Internet . So , what we do is we sort of provide a way for people to -- just regular , private citizens to say , here 's my story and then we reported out from there . So , it 's a little bit of a sort of a different way of getting at what it -- well , it 's ultimately similar because , of course -- I mean , `` The Washington Post '' followed up on this story and they have done plenty of reporting on it after we broke it . You know , `` The New York Times , '' like you said , also went with this story . O'CONNOR : So , we certainly were n't the only one . The key phrase is -- after you broke it . Of course , after he resigned . I got less than a minute . I mean , he was not carrying on with a lobbyist or somebody on his staff , from the public payroll . They did n't have sex . So , why is it a story in your view ? O'CONNOR : Because it 's interesting . I mean -- my job is to find interesting stories , report them out , and then put it out there . I did n't tell him to resign . I did n't say whether , you know , the degree to which we should freak out about this -- to me , it was here is an interesting story -- that 's remarkable that in this day and age that a congressman is corresponding in this manner . This is the way people meet each other online . This is the way congressmen act when they 're living in D.C. . And it 's an interesting story . And that 's why we covered it . KURTZ : I ca n't contradict you . It was very interesting story . Maureen O'Connor , thanks very much for joining us . KURTZ : And still to come on this program , Katie Couric 's future at CBS , a bogus magazine piece about Sarah Palin , and the Angelina Jolie rumors that spread around the world . That 's all next . KURTZ : Some musical chairs this week at CBS News . Sean McManus is out as president of the news division . The son of a legendary sportscaster Jim McKay will return to his other job running CBS Sports . That 's some consolation prize going to Super Bowls and final fours . Meanwhile , Jeff Fager , who has made a mark in the last half dozen years as executive producer of `` 60 Minutes '' is the new chairman of CBS News , but he 's not giving up his old job . Fager will still oversee the news magazine show as well . On this program , a year and half ago , he talked about the awkwardness of succeeding the show 's founding producer , the late Don Hewitt . JEFF FAGER , CBS : It was really a tough time . I mean , he did n't want to go . He said it at one point , `` I want to die at my desk , '' which was tough for everybody . It took him about a year to really get used to it and probably two years to realize that it was probably a good time , and a good moment for him to step down . But it was difficult . And you could understand why . KURTZ : Now , Fager is facing a huge decision . Should Katie Couric stay on as anchor when her contract expires this spring ? And if not Katie , who ? `` The CBS Evening News , '' after all , remains mired in third place . A knowledgeable source told me this week that CBS Chairman Les Moonves has sent word to Couric that he wants her to remain in the anchor chair , that 's something less than her $ 15 million a year salary through the 2012 elections . If they strike a deal , that would buy time for both sides while they figure out the future . Well , this was a heck of a story , was n't it ? Sarah Palin , there she goes again . `` Us Weekly '' reporting that after Christina Aguilera botched the national anthem at the Super Bowl , Palin said spicy Latin princess should n't get such a gig . `` Unemployment is at 9 percent , '' the magazine had Palin telling Sean Hannity , `` Yet we have to suffer through a performance by a foreigner with a poor grasp of the English language . '' Well , as the Web site gossip `` Cop '' reported , the whole thing came from a satire piece . I 'd say that 's worse than forgetting a few star spangled words . And get this -- `` London 's Daily Mirror '' had a big scoop and lots of media outlets picked it up . Angelina Jolie was going to adopt again , this time a 4-year-old girl from Haiti . But Jolie 's spokesman told me the story is flat wrong and the actress never even met the girl when she visited the country after that devastating earthquake .

They 're calling for higher pay , shorter hours , better benefits , and more respect . Egypt 's new government on Sunday ordered banks closed for the next two days after protests by National Bank workers apparently drove out the head of the institution . The chairman of the National Bank of Egypt , Tarek Amer , told employees via e-mail that he submitted his resignation on Sunday , according to a person who received the message . `` I was saddened because I could not enter the bank 's building today due to hundreds of protesting employees , '' the e-mail said , according to a bank employee , who was not authorized to speak to the media and asked not to be named . Amer was joined by two of his deputies and the bank 's head of human resources , according to the message . It was not clear whether the resignations have been accepted . But Sunday evening , Egyptian state television announced that the country 's lenders would be shut down until Wednesday . The announcement asked employees to consider the national interest in the wake of the revolt that drove longtime President Hosni Mubarak from office on Friday . The military council that took power from Mubarak has urged Egyptians to help bolster the country 's economy , which had been paralyzed during the protests . Sameh Shoukry , Egypt 's ambassador to the United States , said Sunday that the new government has made restoring security and reviving commerce its top priorities . `` The Egyptian economy has suffered during this period of unrest , and was suffering from the global recession with a rising unemployment rate , '' Shoukry told CNN 's `` Fareed Zakaria GPS . '' Bank workers complained that members of Mubarak 's family put their allies into positions of power at the bank with grossly inflated salaries . But the National Bank 's headquarters in Cairo continued to function during Sunday 's protests , with disgruntled staff taking turns to work and demonstrate . There were reports of protests at branches of the Bank of Alexandria and the Bank of Egypt as well . And hundreds of police officers launched demonstrations outside Interior Ministry headquarters on Sunday to demand higher wages , shorter hours , better benefits and more respect , participants told CNN . The protesters faced off with a cordon of Egyptian troops outside the ministry Sunday evening . They currently earn 500 Egyptian pounds -LRB- about $ 85 -RRB- a month -- a quarter of what army troops of comparable rank earn , they said . They , too , want to earn 2,000 pounds a month , police protesters Mahmoud Tawfiq and Mahmoud Bedwai said . They also want their hours reduced and to be paid for working overtime , saying they work 12 to 15 hour days and face imprisonment if they refuse to work past the end of their shifts . And they called for free transportation to their job sites and housing once they get there , saying some travel hundreds of miles from Cairo for work at their own expense . Both low-ranking police officers and administrative staff joined in the protest .

Thousands of Italians took to the streets in some 200 cities across the country Sunday in protest of Prime Minister 's Silvio Berlusconi 's alleged behavior toward women . The largest gathering was in Rome , where organizers said 100,000 people gathered , under the slogan , `` If not now , when ? '' In Milan , organizers estimated that 60,000 people gathered . Protests also took place outside Italy , including marches in Tokyo and Geneva . Sunday 's demonstrations were the biggest anti-Berlusconi rallies since the most recent sex scandal broke in January , when Milan prosecutors said they were investigating whether the prime minister abused his power by helping an underaged woman , who he had allegedly paid for sex , get out of jail on a theft charge . Berlusconi has denied that he has ever paid anyone for sex . A string of sex scandals have dogged him . The protests were organized by women 's groups and publicized by internet . The turnout surprised the organizers , who did n't want the demonstrations to be political , though that 's what they became . One woman who came with her family to the Milan rally told CNN that she was `` fed up with the way women are portrayed as objects in the Italian media . The way that young girls are glorified by their looks and youth and then what ? I do n't want my daughter to grow up thinking that that is the only way to be ... that the only thing that matters is to be pretty and show off their legs . ... We are more than that . '' In Milan , demonstrators had banners that said , `` Stop the merchandising of women , '' and `` Berlusconi enough . You bring us shame . '' Many of the speakers at the Milan rally criticized the way Berlusconi 's sex scandal made Italy look , his behavior towards women and his promoting ex-show girls to high government positions . Protesters said leaked evidence from the investigation show he has little respect for female dignity , the state-run ANSA news agency reported . Wiretaps published in the media suggest he surrounded himself at parties at his home with starlets and other women hoping to use their looks to gain positions in politics or at Berlusconi 's Mediaset TV empire , ANSA reported . The investigation began in December , after Berlusconi called police in May , urging them to release Karima El Mahrough , nicknamed Ruby , from jail , where she was being held on theft charges . Prosecutors say the activity took place from February until May 2010 . Both El Mahrough , now 18 , and Berlusconi have denied they ever had sex . El Mahrough said she did not know Berlusconi well but that she did receive 7,000 euros -LRB- about $ 9,300 -RRB- from him the first time they met , on Valentine 's Day 2010 , because a friend told Berlusconi she needed help . The young woman 's former roommate told investigators that El Mahrough confided to her that she did have a sexual relationship with the premier . Berlusconi 's party argued that he believed that Ruby was Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's niece and the phone call to the police station on her behalf was done to avoid a possible diplomatic crisis with Egypt . The lower house of Italy 's Parliament voted against allowing Milan prosecutors to search property belonging to Berlusconi as part of the investigation .

First to you Ivan , can you help translate to us whether you think this sort of action , suspending the constitution , putting a time limit it would seem , on how long the military will stay in control , is that enough to empty the square for weeks to come ? WATSON : The square is mostly empty right now , Candy . The military swept in yesterday and continued today trying to push protesters out , tear down a lot of tents in some cases despite objections from some of the more die-hard demonstrators who have said they do not want to leave until they are 100 % confident all demands are met . I was down there an hour or two ago and actually saw actually the Red Beret military police detaining some demonstrators and small scuffles breaking out . This move is pretty dramatic , because there 's been a question in the air , who is in charge . The Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik who you spoke to last week on the phone just made an announcement , but there was no warning that the military was going to announce such sweeping changes , assuming so much responsibility of the state saying that it was going to dissolve parliament , suspend the constitution , be the representative of Egypt both domestically and internationally and oversee the process of trying to set up the next presidential and parliamentary elections . When it comes to the parliament -- dissolving the parliament , I think the military will have the support of much of the protest movement because the parliament has very little credibility here after the very troubled and widely perceived as rigged election of last November and December -- Candy . CROWLEY : I may have put the question inartfully . What I 'm trying to get as is do you think the moves by the military will be satisfactory to protesters and they will , in fact , stay out of the square , that this is what they wanted , this puts them on the road to where they want to go . Are these good things ? WATSON : I think for the time being many of the demonstrators and protesters are supporting the military and have been working hand in glove in the square , for example , sweeping up debris , repainting the curbs there and you still have hordes of people coming to take photos with the military . The military is riding high now . But there are from some segments of this really historic opposition movement , this protest movement , are some suspicions and there are some doubts . But I think it 's safe to say that the majority of them are kind of in a wait and see mode . It is important to note outside the square we are seeing protests cropping up around some of the main banks , for example , people demanding higher wages , angry at their bosses , the chairman of those companies arguing that the salaries there are too high . And it is likely we 'll continue to see this bubbling ferment of discontent with some of the older institutions in this country that still may be run by people who were very close to the Mubarak regime . The expectations have been raised very high . And as one demonstrator told me today in the square , we have had a revolution . Mubarak is gone now but we still have the same 80 million problems in this country , meaning the entire population of Egypt . CROWLEY : Let me turn now to our Nic Robertson . Nic , I know you drove to Sharm el-Sheikh , so you were able some of the countryside . What we have seen for 18 days has been really Tahrir Square and parts of Cairo . Is it any different ? As you traveled did anything catch your attention ? ROBERTSON : I think there is a lot of military presence controlling the main checkpoints that go under the tunnel under the Suez Canal -- obviously the Suez Canal is strategically vital to the world . Egypt knows that , the army knows that , and they have put in , from what we can see , very tough and stringent checks either side of that tunnel to make sure that everyone that goes through is identified and has their bags searched . It does mean there are long delays . But it does mean it would be hard for terrorists to strike underneath the tunnel and damage this vital part of the global transport network or the shipping network . We also saw driving across the desert , in the Sinai Desert , where it 's incredibly remote , Bedouin farmers , more goats and sheep at checkpoints than policemen , but spray painted on the side in the middle of the desert was `` go Mubarak . '' And I think that really gives you an indication that it was n't just what we were seeing in Tahrir Square but it was across the country that people had the same spirit and feeling that it was time for President Mubarak to step down , Candy . CROWLEY : Nic , tell me about Mubarak . Are we certain he is in his residence in Sharm el-Sheikh ? And is it a given that he can , as he once expressed interest in living out his days in Egypt . Are Egyptians likely to let him live on in peace there ? ROBERTSON : He is -- if you look over my shoulder here , you will see a low white wall some distance behind me there . That is the wall of his presidential compound . It 's incredibly tightly guarded at the moment . To get on the road that drives down there , there are police checkpoints , the police have automatic weapons . There are plain clothes security personnel who ask you searching questions about who you are , what you do , where you 're going to get down the road that approaches that door . And I can certainly tell you that there are very heavy security installations around and at the moment the government here seems to be providing a high level of security for President Mubarak at this time . It 's very close to us here , Candy . CROWLEY : Nic Robertson in Sharm el-Sheikh , Ivan Watson in Cairo , a salute to both of you . Just such great work . We appreciate your time . Up next , Republican Senator Lindsay Graham on how the U.S. should handle the revolution in Egypt . CROWLEY : Joining me now from Greenville , South Carolina , Republican Senator Lindsey Graham . Senator , thank you . I 'm not sure if you got to hear the breaking news at the top of the show , but essentially the military council has said that they have suspended the constitution and that they will be conducting things for the next six months or until there are elections . Is that an OK timeframe , do you think , as far as the way the U.S. is looking at it ? GRAHAM : Well , I think from our national security interests , this election in Egypt is going to define Egypt in the region for decades . And Mr. ElBaradei said it could take up to a year to get democratic institutions in place . Just think what they have to do going forward . There really is no independent judiciary , there are no political parties . The constitution has been used basically to outlaw political parties . So I 'm looking for a free , fair , transparent election that would get the full flavor of Egypt . And a rushed election could help an organization like the Muslim Brotherhood , so my advice to the Egyptian people is , take your time , reach out to the world at large . A lot of people want to help you . And I 'm not so sure you can do all the things you need to do between now and September to have an election that reflects the full will of the Egyptian people and to create democratic capacity . But that will be up to the Egyptian people . CROWLEY : I was talking to an administration official yesterday who talked about being -- there being two different clocks in Egypt . And one of them goes slowly , because it says you are building a democracy from the ground up here . That is not easy to do . We saw that in Iraq under entirely different circumstances , but nonetheless , it takes time when every institution needs to be redone . CROWLEY : And then there is that other clock , that is the impatience that you saw in the square , the impatience that you feel from young people and from their parents . And so you have to find that sweet spot , do you not , between going too slowly to satisfy protesters who could just as easily show back up in the square , could they not ? GRAHAM : You know , that is a very good analysis . And I think your network has done an outstanding job of informing the American people what 's going on in Egypt . Yes , where is that sweet spot ? There will be a desire to look backward , to hold Mubarak accountable . How much money did he steal from the Egyptian people ? Should he and those around him go to jail for abusing the Egyptian people ? That 's going to create friction with the army , because the army has been very close to Mubarak institutions , the Mubarak presidency . So as young people , the Muslim Brotherhood talk about looking backward , that may create some friction going forward . We know what the people are against in Egypt . We do n't yet know what they are for , so there is a lot of friction when it comes to capacity building . You know , how much can you get up and running before September to make the election really meaningful ? So I would err on the time of going slow , building capacity , and as the desire to look back grows -- which it will , to hold people accountable -- that will create friction among the army because a lot of the generals in this army have lived pretty well during the Mubarak era . And I do n't know how much they are going to be into letting people go back and hold him accountable . CROWLEY : Well , and yet these are also the people who the U.S. has mainly been dealing with . CROWLEY : Certainly during the last 18 days , and obviously over the course of the last three decades . When you look at the idea of Egypt recreating itself , what do you worry about most ? Because I have seen people say , I worry about the U.S. intelligence gathering . Egypt has been so helpful , particularly when it comes to Al Qaida and Iran , what 's going on in Gaza . I have had other people say , you know , this was the door to other Arab countries . What worries you most that the U.S. will lose or might lose ? GRAHAM : Well , as we develop a new -- if we can pull this off , if the Egyptian people can create a democracy in the heart of the Arab world , it will be a more significant contribution to civilization than the great pyramids . It really will have a long-lasting effect . I worry that we 'll rush to an election where the Muslim Brotherhood , who is the most organized but does n't represent the true will of the Egyptian people , will have a disproportionate effect . I worry about the army . Will the army hold together ? Will the young officers accept the rule of the senior people ? Will the army really subordinate itself to civilian control as this new democracy unfolds ? You talked about intelligence . I worry about our own intelligence services understanding what the heck is going on . When the DNI of the United States says the Muslim Brotherhood is mostly a secular organization , that sent chills up my spine . It makes me wonder , do we really know what 's going on in Iran ? And if Iran gets a nuclear weapon , all hell breaks loose in the Mideast . So I worry about what happens in the next six months to a year in Egypt affecting our relationship with Saudi Arabia , with Jordan and Israel . Now is the time to stand by Israel without equivocation and help the people in Egypt to form a democracy . But at the end of the day the order , the task they have chosen will be very difficult but doable . CROWLEY : And it could backfire . GRAHAM : Oh , let me tell you , you 've got Jordan and Saudi Arabia are thinking we have thrown over our friend in Egypt . Well , Mubarak was a good ally . He did bring a calming influence . The army has reaffirmed the peace treaty with Israel . But at the end of the day , people in Jordan and Egypt -- excuse me , Saudi Arabia , need to get the message from Tunisia and Egypt . And that is that you 've got to give your people more say , a larger voice in society . This could be a good thing for the region or it could all fall apart . If it falls apart in Egypt , who knows where it ends , what kind of forces does it unleash in the Mideast . So you get one chance to get this right . To the protesters , I know you have had a tremendous effect on the future of Egypt in the last 18 days . My advice would be to go slow , form political parties , take that energy that led to bringing this regime down and chart a brighter future that is based on religious tolerance and secular democracy . And those things are not certain yet , by any means . CROWLEY : Senator , while Egypt was busy reformulating itself , CPAC , which is the , as you well know , a collection of conservative groups , was holding a meeting in Washington , talking about spending cuts and the like . But they also had a straw poll that I just wanted to show you the results of over the weekend . Ron Paul came in first with 30 percent . Mitt Romney next with 23 percent . And then down the line , Gary Johnson , Chris Christie and Newt Gingrich . There were others , obviously a lot of others that I 'm sure you know personally that are thinking of running for president . Is there anybody on this list that you look at and think , I could go with this guy ? GRAHAM : Well , you know , at the end of the day , I 'm looking for the most conservative person who is electable . And that person is yet to emerge . Mitt Romney is probably the frontrunner among traditional candidates . Ron Paul is a well organized , has a lot of energy behind his ideas . But whether or not he could win a general election , I think , is a big if . We have got a tall task as Republicans . We 're going to have to win independent voters . They are very much looking at the Republican Party anew . We are getting a second chance with the American electorate . We did well in 2010 . And I think President Obama is beatable , but we have got to nominate someone that can win over independent voters , who do want smaller government and less spending , but understand there is a role for government . So over the next few months , we 'll see who can pick that mantle up and run with it , the most electable conservative . No one quite knows yet . CROWLEY : Tis the season . Thank you so much , Senator Lindsey Graham . We really appreciate your time . CROWLEY : Up next , we 'll get perspective on how the events in Egypt will shape the Middle East with two former ambassadors . CROWLEY : Joining me now here in Washington , Edward Walker , former U.S. Ambassador to Egypt and Israel during the Clinton administration ; John Negroponte , former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. , former deputy Secretary of State under George Bush . So thank you all this is getting familiar here . And I 'm so glad we have had you to walk us through what 's going on . The latest is the military communique saying we are going to suspend the constitution and we will be running things for six months or until elections . Is it a good thing , a bad thing ? WALKER : It 's a necessary thing . Because you ca n't rebuild until you get rid of the old . If you look through the constitution it 's virtually impossible to think how you would reform it to meet demands of the Egyptian people . And so taking it off the table for now and reconstructing it , particularly those elements related to elections and who can run , it 's critically important for the next step . So this is a positive step forward . CROWLEY : Seems to me September sounds kind of early to recreate a democracy . Is there , how long do you think the military has to show to the protesters and the people of Egypt that they are on the path that the protesters want them on ? NEGROPONTE : I think September is a short period of time . I think it 's a question of what the trend is , how much progress is being made . I do n't think they have to feel bound by a strict deadline . I think the important thing is that they engender enough confidence with the Egyptian people that the Egyptian people think that the military wants the same outcome as they do and that the military just is n't acting according to some hidden agenda of its own . I think that 's the important point . CROWLEY : One of the things obviously that fueled this -- yes , it was Tunisia , an example of something that could be done by a single man . Yes , this was a brutal dictator that they wanted to get rid of . But unemployment , poverty , corruption was really the fuel to this . I mean , that 's what brought everybody -- I kept looking at those people in the square thinking , they are going to be disappointed , because the things that really bother them are going to take years . WALKER : It 's going to take years to get the economy really rolling again . They have taken a hit , but it 's not that big a hit . People talk about tourism disappearing . Well , after the Japanese attack in Luxor it only took I think three months before the tourism industry was back to where it was before . Egypt has amazing resilience and recovery capacity . But they are going to have to change the rules of the game so you do n't have crony capitalism , you do n't have people ripping off the state . They have got to really come clean on the corruption side . CROWLEY : Do you think that there is a way to keep Egyptians day to day happy , content until you can put together democracy ? I think that 's the big fear , is it not ? NEGROPONTE : I agree about the risk of disappointment and that 's a fairly high risk . And it certainly would n't be the first time that that has happened , but it 's also an opportunity . There really is an opportunity here to reinvigorate the economy . It may be an opportunity for some other Arab countries like the Gulf States and Saudi Arabia to come forward with some kind of rehabilitation package for Egypt . Egypt is poised actually , has been poised for the last few years for dramatic economic growth : its good position towards Europe , its large population , its intelligent , well-educated people . So -- I mean , there are opportunities out there if the country can just calm down enough and get its act together . CROWLEY : Who 's running the place ? I realize it 's a military council , but does n't there have to be one person somewhere that goes , yes , no , go this way ? WALKER : Well , Field Marshall Tantawi is the man who has assumed the role of saying yes\\/no , but he 's not going to operate on a unilateral basis . He 's got to reach out both to his council , the supreme council . They are going to have to reach out to more people than that , they 're going to have to bring in civilians very quickly to keep some kind of semblance of movement for the people . And , you know , Field Marshal is a very cautious , conservative guy . But in my talks to him before , he 's never shown any indication of wanting to be the top boss . CROWLEY : So where is the U.S. in all of this now ? I mean , I got the feeling talking to a couple people in the administration over the weekend that they are kind of watching like the rest of us in some ways thinking , you know , which way will this going to go ? They are trying to be encouraging without intervening . You know , it 's another tight rope you have to walk because you do n't want to look like you are pushing something on them . What is our best stance now ? Is it just to stand back and say let us know what you need ? NEGROPONTE : Well , I have difficult visualizing us doing that given our behavior during the last two , three weeks . I mean , I have a feeling we 'll play a fairly proactive role . I think it would be good to restrain ourselves , but I think we 're going to play a role of holding the military 's feet to the fire so that it continues to be responsive to these popular demands , revise the constitution , make it possible for more people to run , make it possible for multiple political parties to thrive sort of all the while at the same time making it clear that it 's up to the Egyptians themselves to decide . CROWLEY : I want to talk about what 's at stake with U.S.-Egyptian relations and the basic fight against terror , but I want to take a break . So if you 'll stand by with me , up next we want to go to CNN 's Fareed Zakaria and we 're going to get his take on the future in Egypt . CROWLEY : Joining me now from our New York bureau , Fareed Zakaria , host of CNN 's `` Fareed Zakaria : GPS . '' Fareed , I know you have just wrapped up a couple of important interviews , one of them with a man who has become , really , the face of the protesters . What did you learn ? FAREED ZAKARIA , CNN : Mohamed ElBaradei -- actually , it was interesting . I think there is some unease among the opposition groups that they have gotten their first go , which was getting rid of Mubarak , but this was n't a personality thing . They wanted to get rid of the regime , the military dictatorship . And they feel that the military , which is now in place with absolute powers , really , is not being clear about exactly what the road map to democracy is . And what ElBaradei told me was , unless , by Friday , they have a fairly specific road map for democracy and a road map for a transitional government , a co-management of the process , the protests will begin again on Friday . CROWLEY : Well , that seems , like , a little problematic . Does he think that , actually -- I mean , given this is a government that 's been entrenched for three decades , that it is something that they can actually do by Friday ? ZAKARIA : I think what he 's looking for are signs that the government realizes this is a transitional period ; in other words , some kind of government of national unity or some , as he puts it , co - management of a process so that it 's not entirely up to the military . Then he wanted a series of more specific things , some of which , by the way , the military have just agreed to . As we 've been having this conversation , there is a fifth military communique out in which the military does say that they are going to dissolve parliament ; they are going to hold new elections , though no timetable for when those would happen . They explained that the Constitution is now no longer active , which makes sense because the way Mubarak left was , you know , kind of , unconstitutional . He -- he would n't normally have handed power to somebody else , the speaker of the national assembly . So some of that has been clarified , but the crucial issue of when these elections are going to be held , what the sequence is , parliament first then presidential elections or the other way around , none of that has been clarified . And I think the protesters are just uneasy at the prospect that they have lost Mubarak but they 've gained a military dictatorship . CROWLEY : Fareed Zakaria , we will be joining you at the top of the hour . We want you to stay tuned for Fareed Zakaria . It is at the top of this hour . We have more with our ambassadors , though , when we come back . CROWLEY : We are back with Edward Walker and John Negroponte , two men with long resumes steeped in this region and elsewhere . It seems to me that there are questions and analysis that come out now that show us two sides . So here 's what -- here 's what I 'm hearing . I want to get you all to comment . Other Arab allies in the region , Saudi Arabia , Jordan among them , have been upset with the U.S. , feeling that they cut Mubarak off and pushed him off a cliff . So they will either step back because they 're upset with the U.S. , or they are now prone to work more with the U.S. on putting more democracy , if that 's the word -- or making their societies freer . What -- how are our good allies in that region going to react to this ? WALKER : Well , you 've got -- King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia is quite upset . I think there -- he genuinely thought that we pushed Mubarak off a cliff . And , obviously , these other guys are concerned about what will happen if their people start to get anxious . And what will our position be ? So there 's a little bit of mending fences that 's going to have to take place and reassurances that have to be taking place . I do n't think the problem is so great in Jordan . His problem is his own people . He 's got to look out for that first . CROWLEY : I did hear from -- on both sides of this diplomatic equation that the Saudis were quite upset and they said it says something about whether you will stand by your friends , the way you 've treated Mubarak , that that was the message that they sent . Is that permanent damage , or ... NEGROPONTE : I do n't think it 's permanent damage , but I also think it 's , sort of , a classic issue when you have a transition from an authoritarian regime to some -- some kind of change . We 've seen this happen in the past as well . But it 's going to call for more diplomacy between us and the region , the entire region , and I think that the relationships will survive . WALKER : Yes , it 's also -- it 's also going to require one message coming out of the United States . And we 've had just too many different voices coming out and indications of differences within the White House or within the State Department and so on . So we need to get the message straight . CROWLEY : And what do you think that message is now ? WALKER : Look , we 're in favor of what 's happened , Mubarak out . We 're in favor of a constitutional government , reformed constitutional government . We 're in favor of free and fair elections . All those things are still there . CROWLEY : But I have had administration officials say to me , look , the president was very clear from the beginning that he wanted -- that he believed in the rights of the protesters to be there and that he wanted the Mubarak government to open up to their demands and to listen to them and that there was n't any kind of cacophony coming out of the White House or coming out of the State Department , that everybody was in synch because the policy was very clear from the beginning . NEGROPONTE : But I think , in addition to what Ambassador Walker just said , yes , we favor these development and we 're supportive , but at the same time we 're not naive . We were n't born yesterday . We know these things take time and that it 's a long-term process and that , while a democratic and representative government may be the long-term goal , we in fact think that democracy and representative government is probably the best way to assure long-term stability of a country and of a region . But we realize it 's going to take time and it 's going to happen in different ways . CROWLEY : Stability in the meantime in the middle . NEGROPONTE : There is always that risk . CROWLEY : Let me ask you about a couple of other things . One is , there is one theory that this was a great victory for al Qaeda . There is another theory that , no , this was devastating to al Qaeda , because first of all the Muslim Brotherhood , the most organized group in Egypt and al Qaeda are enemies . And second of all , what this has shown is that by peaceful means you can take over a government , that it does n't need to be by al Qaeda means . Did al Qaeda win or lose in all of this ? WALKER : Al Qaeda lost on this , because al Qaeda has basically said all along that this is a situation that ca n't be fixed by the people . It has to be fixed by violent revolution and we represent violent revolution . And that 's been their pitch to the Arab people . Now they have been shown to be , you know , without any basis for their complaints . CROWLEY : Let me ask you about Israel . And that is there is one school of thought that says , well , now because of uncertainty they are going to be less willing to engage in the peace process with the Palestinians . There is another that says , no , they will be more willing to engage because they have seen , you know , what 's happened in Egypt . So , are they more or less willing ? NEGROPONTE : Well I 'm not certain , but I think Israel certainly must take some reassurance from the fact that the Egyptian military have reaffirmed their commitment to their international -- the country 's international agreements . Read : commitment to the Arab - Israeli peace process . So , I think that 's good . CROWLEY : And let me ask you about U.S.-Egyptian intelligence information-sharing . One theory , well , you know , because this will be a new government that might not be able to or actually be as friendly to the U.S. as Mubarak was , we are losing a key intelligence partner here who helped with al Qaeda , who has helped with Iran , who has helped in Gaza . Or because it 's a democracy and we are going to share these values , it will even be of greater help . NEGROPONTE : Well , I mean , let me put it this way the most effective and best intelligence cooperation we have around the world is with the most democratic countries . There is a group called the five eyes which consists of the United States , Australia , the United Kingdom , Canada and New Zealand . That 's where we have our best intelligence cooperation . I rest my case . WALKER : Yes , but also keep in mind the Egyptians have a vested interest in some of the same things we have a vested interest in and that is to deter radicalism in the Middle East and so there will be strong incentive for the intelligence community to continue cooperation . CROWLEY : Edward Walker , John Negroponte , thanks for traveling this road with us . I really appreciate it . Up next , the upcoming showdown in Washington over the president 's new budget . -LRB- COMMERCIAL BREAK -RRB- CROWLEY : President Obama submits his 2012 budget to Congress tomorrow and the White House promises major cuts . That may depend on your definition of `` major . '' As part of his package the president will call for a five-year freeze on discretionary spending , which is to say programs the federal government is not required by law to fund . Some programs will get more money , some less . On the less list -- a $ 350 million cut in community service programs , $ 300 million for local housing and economic development programs , and a $ 125 million cut for environmental cleanup . All told , the freeze would save about $ 400 billion over ten years . That 's real money except the u.s. debt is $ 14.1 trillion -- with a t. That is jaw-dropping money . Critics say the problem is discretionary programs really are not really the problem . Alan Simpson is co-chair of the president 's debt commission . ALAN SIMPSON , CO-CHAIR , DEBT COMMISSION : I 'm waiting for politicians to get up and say there is only one way to do this , you dig into the big four : Medicare , Medicaid , Social Security and Defense . And anybody giving you anything different than that , you want to walk out the door , stick your finger down your throat and give them the green weenie . CROWLEY : Which is to say what 's blowing up the budget is in large part the programs the federal government is required to fund -- up next , White House budget director Jacob Lew . CROWLEY : Joining me now here in Washington , White House budget director Jacob Lew . Thank you for being here . The president tomorrow puts out the fiscal year 2012 budget . People are already lost . Why are we doing 2012 in 2011 and all of that . So let 's get down to the basic question , who 's going to get hurt in this budget ? LEW : You know , Candy , this is a very difficult budget . The budget saves $ 1.1 trillion over the next 10 years in domestic spending . It reduces , as you said in your introduction , $ 400 billion , which would bring us down to the smallest government as a size of the economy since Eisenhower was president . LEW : The challenge we have is to live within our means but also invest in the future . As the president said , we have to out-educate , out-innovate and outbuild in order to compete in the next century . In order to do that , we have to make tough tradeoffs . And you listed a few of the examples . There are many , many more . There are scores of programs that are being reduced . And I think it 's important to note that we 're beyond the easy , low-hanging fruit to say that it 's all waste and fraud . We 're reducing programs that are important programs that we care about , and we 're doing what every family does when it sits around its kitchen table . We 're making the choice about what do we need for the future ? And I think the budget does a very good job of it . CROWLEY : So , such as ? Tell us some more ... CROWLEY : ... where are the cuts ? LEW : I can tell you that in -- even where we invest , we 've had to make some tough decisions for cutbacks . So in education , we invest very seriously to make sure that 9 million students can go to college using Pell grant , to make sure that K-12 education -- we have 100,000 new teachers who are trained and experienced in science , technology , engineering and math . But we also have cutbacks . In order to pay for the Pell increase , one of the things we 're doing is saying there will be no more Pell grants for the summer ; they will be for the school year only . In the area ... CROWLEY : No summer school Pell grants from the government ? LEW : Yes , and in the area of graduate student loans , interest will start building up while students are in school . CROWLEY : Now they graduate , and then the interest starts ? All told , there 's $ 9 billion in those proposals this year , and that will make it possible to make sure that 9 million students can go to college . CROWLEY : So you have said in an editorial you wrote that the budget is an expression of our values and aspirations . So if I look at this what we call discretionary spending , things we do n't have to spend on , you want to cut back community development block programs . That creates jobs in communities ; it helps them with infrastructure , that kind of thing . Home heating assistance ; education , as you just mentioned . You 're also going to do -- the Great Lakes Restoration Fund Initiative is getting a pretty healthy cut in what they get from the feds , eight states involved , in trying to keep the Great Lakes economically viable . What does that say about our values and aspirations ? LEW : Well , what it says , Candy , is that we really do have to do what every American family does ; we have to start living within our means . Our budget will get us , over the next several years , to the point where we can look the American people in the eye and say we 're not adding to the debt anymore ; we 're spending money that we have each year , and then we can work on bringing down our national debt . You know , the notion that we can do this painlessly is -- it 's not possible to do it painlessly . We are going to make tough choices . The question is , do we do it in a way where , while we 're making the tough tradeoffs , we 're making the critical investments so that we have a future that creates jobs for the American people so that we can outcompete in the world of the 21st century . CROWLEY : Here 's the problem , I guess . If you are a graduate -- let 's take one of your examples . You 're a graduate student ; you are , right now , getting loans . You do n't have to pay those loans or any interest on them until you graduate . But now you have to pay -- or it accumulates , I 'm assuming -- you have to pay interest beginning on day one of grad school , and that makes it so that you ca n't go to grad school . LEW : Well , let 's just be clear . Interest will build up , but students wo n't have to pay until they graduate . So it will increase the burden for paying back the loans , but it will not reduce access to education . That 's , I think , part of how you can responsibly have a plan that deals with the challenge of solving our fiscal crisis , getting out of the situation where the deficit is growing and growing , but also investing in the future . We have a responsible budget that will cut in half the deficit by the end of the president 's first term . It deals with all parts of the budget , and it 's a plan which we look forward to presenting it to the Congress and getting a bipartisan discussion going on how to achieve it . CROWLEY : The president had a debt commission . They put out a big long report on how to get out of this -- of the debt -- not the yearly deficit but the accumulative number that we are in the red , which is in the trillions , $ 14.1 trillion , I believe , is where we are . And yet very little of that is reflected in this budget . Why was there a debt commission to begin with , since everybody seems determined to ignore what you heard Alan Simpson call the big four , Medicare , Medicaid , Social Security and defense . I know there are cuts in defense , but the commission found many , many more . Why even bother if this document is n't going to reflect it ? LEW : First , I would say that the commission did a very important job . It framed ... CROWLEY : But everybody , kind of , says that . LEW : It framed a discussion which is very much influencing how everyone working on the budget going forward thinks about it . There 's more on the table , more that 's open for the kind of civil discourse that we need in order to make the tough decisions . In our budget , there are many , many ideas that one can look to the commission where they took leadership , medical malpractice , corporate tax reform , pay freeze for the federal government . There are many , many provisions in our budget which were part of what the commission proposed . I think it 's a mistake to say that the commission 's report did not have an impact . It had a very significant impact . CROWLEY : But , basically , they say , look , discretionary spending , great ; we should cut back plenty of things , but what about Medicare ? And where are you on -- where are the big ideas for the big programs that suck money out of the economy ? LEW : Well , I think , if you look at the entitlements , we have some important policy in this budget . There 's a provision that , for the last number of years , Congress has passed on a bipartisan basis to make sure that the payments to doctors under Medicare do n't get cut . The problem is , if the payments to doctors are cut , their willingness to treat Medicare patients would go down . CROWLEY : That does n't cut the budget , though . LEW : Well , when you put it on the national credit card and you say we 're not going to let those changes take effect , it increases the deficit . CROWLEY : But is that the big kind of thing that they talked about on the debt commission ? There 's nothing about Social Security . LEW : We have $ 62 billion of savings to pay for dealing with that provision in Medicare over the next two years . That 's real money ; $ 62 billion is real money . -LRB- CROSSTALK -RRB- LEW : In terms of Social Security , let 's also be clear that Social Security is not contributing to the short-term debt . Social Security is a separate issue . It 's something where we have an obligation to the American people to make sure that Social Security is sound for this generation and the next generation . And the president said he wants to work on a bipartisan basis to deal with Social Security . CROWLEY : But there 's no -- there 's no big ideas , I guess , no big , OK , we 're going to bite the bullet here ; Medicare needs to be means-tested ; Social Security -- you know , the amount of income that you pay Social Security taxes on should go up . There 's nothing like those big things that really ... LEW : Well , I disagree with that . The president took office and we were on a path where the deficit was growing over 10 percent of our economy . Now , he 's put forward a plan that will bring it down in the middle of the decade to a sustainable level . That is a big idea . Because , as every family knows , if you 're having trouble paying your bills , you have to stop adding to the balance . And he has a plan that would do that . He 's called it a downpayment and it 's a responsible downpayment , and he 's extended his hand to work on a bipartisan basis to deal with the long-term problems . I think we have to get that accomplished in the next few years . CROWLEY : I need a yes or no from you about the 2011 budget , which still has n't been passed . House Republicans believe they can take $ 100 billion out of that , right now , for this bill that goes until next October . Is that doable -- not the way they want it . Is it even doable to take $ 100 billion out of that budget ? LEW : Candy , we have a responsible plan that 's before Congress . We look forward to working with Congress . We think that there is a way to reduce spending . We all agree we need to reduce spending ... LEW : ... and we have to do it in a way that 's consistent with our values and invests in the future . We look forward to working with the Congress on that . CROWLEY : $ 100 billion , yes or no ? LEW : We look forward to working with Congress . CROWLEY : Jacob Lew , thank you so much . LEW : Thanks for having me . CROWLEY : Thanks for watching `` State of the Union . '' We hope you will join us next week when our guest will be defense secretary -- former defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld . I 'm Candy Crowley in Washington .

The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said it would appoint a committee to propose changes to the Constitution , which would then be submitted to voters . The council will have the power to issue new laws during the transition period , according to a communique read on state television . Sameh Shoukry , Egypt 's ambassador to the United States , said Sunday that the generals have made restoring security and reviving the economy its top priorities . `` This current composition is basically a technocratic government to run the day-to-day affairs , to take care of the security void that has happened , and to also address the issues related to the economy , '' Shoukry told CNN 's `` Fareed Zakaria GPS . '' Can Egyptians avoid Iranians ' fate ? The next steps for Egypt However , a leading opposition figure said Sunday that the military must explain its plans in more detail or see a resumption of the demonstrations that drove Mubarak from office . `` They need to come out of their headquarters and start talking to the people and tell us what is in store for us , '' ElBaradei told GPS . And a prominent Egyptian activist credited with helping spark the revolution warned against taking too long to establish a new representative government . `` Biggest mistake now is to give the Egyptian people too little too slow . Restoring confidence requires a faster pace , '' Wael Ghonim said on Twitter . Mubarak stepped down Friday after 18 days of protests against his nearly 30-year rule and is now in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh . The longtime president was himself a product of the military establishment that has ruled Egypt since the 1950s , but his abdication leaves a council of generals led by Defense Minister Hussein Tantawi in charge of the Arab world 's most populous nation . Sunday 's military communique said new elections would be held for both houses of Egypt 's Parliament as well as the presidency . Protesters had blasted the November parliamentary elections as fraudulent , and calls for their annulment were among the major demands before Mubarak 's ouster . In the meantime , government ministers are now reporting to the military high command in the same way they reported to Mubarak , Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq told reporters Sunday , in remarks that were carried live on state television . He said he was reviewing candidates to fill vacant government ministries , adding that no one who was not acceptable to the public would be appointed . Sunday marked the first workday since Mubarak 's ouster . For the first time since the uprising began January 25 , traffic flowed freely around Tahrir Square -- the epicenter of the protests -- and the majority of shops around the square were open . Some protesters remained in the square Sunday , vowing to keep protesting until Egypt is under civilian rule . The Egyptian junta now has to grapple with the economic problems that fueled the revolt , including massive youth unemployment and economic underdevelopment . The demonstrations virtually shut down Egypt 's economy , costing it vital tourism dollars as well . New protests at the headquarters of the National Bank of Egypt appear to have forced the ouster of that institution 's chairman , Tarek Amer , and two top deputies , who submitted their resignations on Sunday , according to an e-mail shared with CNN by a bank employee . Gallery : Protesters celebrate Mubarak 's resignation Arab nations react to Egypt upheaval The National Bank 's headquarters in Cairo continued to function during Sunday 's protests , with disgruntled staff taking turns to work and demonstrate . It was not clear whether the resignations have been accepted . However , Sunday evening , Egyptian state television announced banks would be shut down until Wednesday , and urged workers to consider the national interest . Bank workers complained that members of Mubarak 's family put their allies into positions of power at the bank with grossly inflated salaries . Cairo 's stock exchange will freeze transactions from former ministers and businessmen who are now under investigation when trading resumes Wednesday , the exchange 's chairman , Khaled Serri Siyam , announced in a statement on the government-run website EgyNews . Outside the Interior Ministry , hundreds of disgruntled police officers demanding higher wages , shorter hours , better benefits and more respect faced off with Egyptian troops . The police officers currently earn 500 Egyptian pounds -LRB- about $ 85 -RRB- a month -- a quarter of what army troops of comparable rank earn , they said -- and face imprisonment if they refuse to work unpaid overtime . Both low-ranking police officers and administrative staff joined in the protest . Mubarak 's ouster came three weeks after a similar revolt toppled longtime Tunisian strongman Zine El Abidine Ben Ali . And even as officials hash out the details of Egypt 's murky political future , public demands for change have rippled throughout the region . In Yemen 's capital Sanaa on Saturday , protesters chanted , `` Yesterday Tunisia , today Egypt -- tomorrow Yemen will open the prison . '' And in restive Algeria , anti-government protesters chanted , `` Change the power '' on Saturday . Security forces clashed with the crowds Saturday in Algiers and detained roughly 100 protesters , according to the opposition Algerian League for Human Rights . Shoukry said it was a `` matter of pride '' for Egyptians that their revolution was `` organized and peaceful , '' adding , `` Egypt has always been a trend-setter in this region . '' `` The region looks to us in many aspects , and I 'm sure also in this regard , many lessons will be learned , '' he said .
