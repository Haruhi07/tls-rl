CDC researchers said 98 percent of all flu samples from the H1N1 strain were resistant to Roche AG 's Tamiflu , a pill that can both treat flu and prevent infection . Four patients infected with the resistant strain have died , including two children . This year , H1N1 is the most common strain of flu in the United States , although the flu season is a mild one so far , and still below the levels considered an epidemic . Few doctors even test patients for flu , and Tamiflu is not widely prescribed . But the news is sobering because the pill , known generically as oseltamivir , is one of the few weapons against influenza , which kills an estimated 36,000 people in the United States in an average year . It is also considered a key weapon against a potential pandemic of a new type of influenza , and this study suggests the virus can rapidly evade its effects . This season , nine children have died from influenza , most apparently healthy before they got infected , the CDC reports . Last flu season , only 19 percent of H1N1 viruses tested were Tamiflu-resistant , Dr. Nila Dharan and colleagues at the CDC reported . `` As of February 19 , 2009 , resistance to oseltamivir had been identified among 264 of 268 -LRB- 98.5 percent -RRB- U.S. influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- viruses tested , '' the researchers wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association . They interviewed 99 patients and found 30 percent of them had been vaccinated against flu but became infected anyway . The vaccine is known not to fully protect against infection . `` Two patients died on the way to the hospital or in the emergency department . One patient was 4 years old and previously healthy , and one patient was 4 years old with neurological problems , '' Dharan 's team wrote . Dr. David Weinstock of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Dr. Gianna Zuccotti of Brigham and Women 's Hospital , both in Boston , said the quick spread of Tamiflu-resistant flu had surprised doctors . `` Undoubtedly , new surprises await in the perpetual struggle with influenza as one thing is certain -- the organism will continue to evolve , '' they wrote . `` For now , the best tools to mitigate influenza infection are tried-and-true -- vaccination , social distancing , hand washing , and common sense . '' GlaxoSmithKline , which makes the rival flu drug Relenza , said there was no indication influenza viruses were resistant to its drug . Relenza , known generically as zanamivir , is inhaled and is used even less commonly than Tamiflu . Flu already resists two older drugs , rimantadine and amantadine . There is no indication the two other types of season flu now circulating , H3N2 and influenza B , resist the effects of Tamiflu and the CDC recommends using a cocktail of flu drugs in patients now . `` Hundreds of thousands of flu patients continue to be treated with Tamiflu this season , '' Roche said in a statement . `` Treatment with antivirals such as Tamiflu can lessen the duration and severity of illness and can help curb the spread of flu , especially in crowded settings like households , schools and nursing homes .

'' For two years the men , and indeed the women , have openly challenged the might of the state with rallies , demonstrations , strikes , boycotts of government institutions and sit-ins in public spaces . They want the supreme court judges dismissed by then President Pervez Musharraf reinstated and a crackdown on them has again begun as they march towards Islamabad . Is such a protest possible in Afghanistan , the state that Pakistan increasingly finds itself compared to ? Or even more tellingly , in any of the countries in the Middle East ? Or even countries in southeast Asia such as Malaysia ? The Asian Human Rights Commission says throughout Asia there is no parallel to the Pakistani lawyers movement . It was largely because of this that an election took place last February after nine years of military rule . The protests , for all the risks they hold for Pakistan 's fragile democracy , represent the power of a civil society , says Ijaz Shafi Gilani , a specialist in public opinion research , in an article in The News . `` An increasingly empowered and more cohesive society finds itself at odds with the authority of the state . Trust in state institutions has declined while trust in civil society institutions including independent media has risen , '' he says . Pakistan 's problem is not that it is a failing nation , he argues . The problem is the distrust between an increasing vibrant society and the state . `` The year under the stewardship of -LRB- President Asif Ali -RRB- Zardari can perhaps best be described as the one that produced a weaker state , stronger nation .

I just came here after i found an incoming link to my blog site which has been mentioned here in few comments . I had to read all the thread and i wonder why my neighbors only believe in limited exposure to information . On the same Pro-Pakistan site you can find loads of such discussion about the true face of Indian hypocrisy . - Posted by M Junaid Khan I am the culprit for posting the link from your blog . I was posting in relation to the ongoing discussion and I wanted to give Pakistani POV on political instability . It appears Indian rhetoric is music to your ears . Now Mr. non-hypocritic Khan : I am not going to post each and irrlevant article on your blog . You are a true representation of intrusive-media of pakistan . Such a blasphemy on my part to post that link , but I am lucky not to be in Pakistan . Now I saw the new link on India , You are working hard -- keep it up . You exagerated some facts and missed some . It is pity that you are begging to be cited and it does not work that way . If you curb your impatience and see some posts from Indian bloggers , you will find that Indian side has also been covered . Presenting facts is one thing , but glorifying negatives of India , and getting satisfaction out of that , will take Pakistan down faster than it already is happening . Now for your reference India has many positives that offset these negatives and IMHO Pakistan is quite bankrupt that way . I do agree with the article written in this link . In India we are dealing with these problems . We know there are a huge number of children malnurished in India . However , you can not force people to NOT have children because there are too many already . I saw , last year , on You Tube a story of a Pakistani woman who walked infront of a train with her 2 children because she could not afford to feed them . Yes , India spends a lot of money on defense projects . That is due to the threats we have from Pakistan -LRB- covert or otherwise -RRB- and Bangladesh . Kargil and Mumbai attacks are contributing factors . However , you have to admit having a blog called pro pakistan and listing -LRB- correctly or otherwise -RRB- some of India 's problems does make it look like an inferiority complex is at work -- or plain frustration that India is reguarded as a better place than Pakistan by the worlds media . Bollywood movies are Bollywood movies . They are an escapism . People go to the movies to be entertained and not to have the realities that surround their everyday lives thrown in their faces . Its as if you want to show how rosy , pretty , gentile Pakistan is by listing all things negative about India . If Pakistan is so great then : Stop begging the world for aid . Remove all terrorism camps from Pakistan . -LRB- $ 1 = 80.2 Pak Rupee -RRB- -LRB- $ 1 = 501.3 Ind Rupee -RRB- If you do this then maybe , just maybe other nations will feel safe to come and play cricket and for tourism . Maybe , just maybe foreigners from China , Poland , the UN and other countries will not be kidnapped and lose their heads . `` On the same Pro-Pakistan site you can find loads of such discussion about the true face of Indian hypocrisy . '' -- The sources from which you 've quoted are all Indian , wonder who qualifies as a hypocrite ? What 's most amusing is the response to the question posed by you on your pro-pakistan blogsite -- '' Are you still proud to be an Indian ? '' you - `` I certainly am not ... blah blah '' -- who cares ! we are already done with you guys way back in 1947 , you 'll are no longer ` Indian ' ca n't you 'll still digest this fact - layoff ! & give those no-arm race sermons to your own people . `` We started a new series with the title of Incredible India -- Look ! inspite of all it 's short-comings - even a India-hate-filled paki like you ca n't think of anything better , with regards to this advanced , ancient & spiritual civilization called - India , but to term it as ` Incredible India ' . India makes world 's cheapest car , Pakistan makes world 's cheapest terrorist why do i always find indians on anything related to pakistan ? this article was all about pakistan 's civil society yet again all the indians can wanna do it tell the world how great their own country is and how bad we are ... you know what ... even if india was infact the best country in the world i would still rather choose to be a Pakistani ! stop telling the world that there is nothing wrong with India and everything is wrong with Pakistan ... get a life indians ... and move on from Pakistan . . we are here to stay !

For many Pakistanis , that is the next stage in the rapid emasculation of Zardari 's presidency . Article 58-2B of the constitution , which many blame for much of the country 's political instability , has several times been used to sack elected governments . Zardari had promised to ditch it but has yet to deliver . `` The next thing is to throw -LRB- out -RRB- 58-2B -- it will fix the super power of president then , '' was a post on microblogging site Twitter where activists , lawyers and ordinary people , caught up in the drama of the moment , shared information and pictures in real time . He has already lost his Information Minister . Sherry Rehman , a long-time confidante of his late wife Benazir Bhutto , abruptly quit after the government temporarily blocked transmission of the popular GEO news television channel . Two years after Iftikhar Chaudhry was first sacked by then President Pervez Musharraf , Pakistan government officials said he would be reinstated as Chief Justice after a nationwide protest led by Pakistan 's lawyers . It 's been a rollercoaster ride . After he was removed by Musharraf , Chaudhry was reinstated only to be sacked again and placed under house arrest along with many other lawyers when the former general declared emergency rule in November 2007 . At the time , Pakistani lawyer\\/politician Aitzaz Ahsan wrote in an editorial in the New York Times that the leaders of the lawyers movement '' will neither be silent nor still '' . But he also fretted that the lawyers ' movement would be ignored by the United States and overlooked by the forthcoming election . `` Turban-topped , gun-totting mountain men , stern military dictators and corrupt civilian politicians dominate the global media s representations of Pakistan , from Washington to New Delhi best fitting the preferred image of the most dangerous place on earth , '' he said . Pakistani authorities banned public protests and detained hundreds of lawyers and opposition workers nationwide to prevent them from launching Thursday 's planned '' long march '' towards the capital Islamabad to force President Asif Ali Zardari to reinstate a former Supreme Court judge . Many went into hiding according to these reports , vowing to press on with the cross-country motor convoy that will set off from cities in Baluchistan and Sind and then Puinjab on Friday before culminating outside the parliament building in the capital . Maybe this always happens at times of national upheaval . But there is a surprising disconnect between the immediacy of the crisis facing Pakistan as expressed by Pakistani bloggers and the more slow-moving debate taking place in the outside world over the right strategy to adopt towards both Pakistan and Afghanistan . Reading Pakistani blogs since confrontation between the country 's two main political parties exploded and comparing them to international commentaries is a bit like watching men shout that their house is on fire , and then panning over to the fire station where the folks in charge are debating which type of water hose works best . Former chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry has been cited as an outside candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize . The recipient of this year 's prize will be announced in Oslo on Oct. 10 from among 197 nominees , with those fighting for human rights among those tipped to win in the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . With hindsight , it seems clear that a mass movement named after Mao 's Long March but also claiming Gandhi 's principles of non-violence risked disappointing its supporters . The failure of the Long March by Pakistan 's lawyers to restore judges sacked by President Pervez Musharraf , and its dispersal last Saturday , has prompted much debate about why its leaders gave up without at least staging a sit-in . Defense analyst Ikram Sehgal called the Long March a logistical success in its ability to garner mass support without violence , but a tactical failure . `` The tactical failure of this long-lasting tremendous effort founded on great principles has become a strategic disaster for Musharraf 's opponents , '' he writes in The News . `` About Pervez Musharraf , ` with such friends who needs enemies ' , one can paraphrase the saying for him : ` With such enemies why does he need friends ?

The search for such new `` inhibitors '' has grown more urgent in recent years as drugs , like oseltamivir , have become largely ineffective against certain flu strains , like the H1N1 seasonal flu virus . Experts now question how well and how long the drug would stand up against the H5N1 , should it unleash a pandemic . Researchers in Hong Kong and the Unites States screened some 230,000 compounds that were catalogued with the U.S. National Cancer Institute , and found 20 that could potentially restrict the proliferation of the H5N1 . The experts told a news conference on Wednesday one of the compounds , compound 1 or NSC89853 , showed promise . `` We have found a compound that is different from oseltamivir but which acts in the same way , '' said Leo Poon , a microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong . `` An analogy would be like we have a door with a keyhole , but the hole has changed , and the key , in this case oseltamivir , ca n't lock the door anymore , '' he told the news conference . `` But we have discovered another keyhole and another key which can lock the door . '' Their finding was published in the latest issue of the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry . In their experiment , the researchers infected separate batches of cultured human cells with seasonal flu virus and H5N1 and found that compound 1 prevented the replication of both types of viruses effectively . `` Given the problems with drug resistance , this compound can be used to develop a new drug , '' said Allan Lau , professor of pediatrics and adolescent medicine at the University of Hong Kong . But he cautioned it would take as much as eight years for such a drug to be available on the market . Many advanced countries stock up on oseltamivir and zanamivir , two varieties of the same class of drugs that stops the H5N1 virus from multiplying . But the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in March that 98 percent of all flu samples from the H1N1 strain were resistant to oseltamivir , which is manufactured by Roche AG and marketed under the brand Tamiflu . Viruses and bacteria are sturdy organisms that fight hard to survive and adapt swiftly to drugs that are used to kill them , quickly becoming resistant to them . -LRB- Reporting by Tan Ee Lyn ; Editing by Sugita Katyal -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "1186", "dct": "2009-04-21", "dates": ["2009-04-21", "2009-04-21", "2009-04-21", "2003-01-01"], "text": "By Maggie Fox , Health and Science Editor WASHINGTON | Tue Apr 21 , 2009 10:19 pm BST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A new type of swine flu has infected at least two children in California and while both have recovered , U.S. health officials said on Tuesday they were looking for more cases . They say it is possible the children were infected by other people and not by pigs , and said they have consulted with officials in Canada , Mexico and at the World Health Organization although there is no evidence that the new virus is circulating widely . In a special alert , the CDC asked doctors in California 's San Diego and Imperial counties , on the border with Mexico , to test anyone with flu-like symptoms and send the samples in for testing . `` Both of these kids came to our attention because they were seen in clinics which do routine surveillance for influenza infections , '' the CDC 's Dr. Lyn Finelli told reporters in a telephone briefing . Neither child , a 10-year-old boy and a 9-year-old girl , had especially severe symptoms , although the girl had had a fever of 104 degrees , Finelli said . `` We are not making the assumption that there are widespread infections out there and there is not any action that the public should take right now , '' Finelli said . The influenza strain is an H1N1 , the same family as one of the seasonal flu viruses now circulating . But it genetically resembles a virus found in pigs and not in people , officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said . It has never been seen before , the CDC said . `` Neither child had known contact with pigs . The source of infection is unknown , '' they added . `` The lack of known exposure to pigs in the two cases increases the possibility that human-to-human transmission of this new influenza virus has occurred . '' In the past two or so years , Finelli said , 12 known cases of infection with swine flu have been reported but 11 of them followed known contact with pigs . People were near the children were being questioned by CDC investigators and tested if they remember having been sick recently . The boy flew to Texas with his brother and is still there , the officials added . Blood tests may show if people were infected in the past with the same virus . The virus is usually fairly mild but it still kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people in an average year . And every few decades , a completely new strain pops up and it can cause a pandemic , a global epidemic that kills many more than usual . Flu experts are afraid a pandemic could come at any time and are monitoring for new strains . One big fear is that the H5N1 avian flu virus now mostly affecting flocks in Asia , the Middle East , Europe and Africa might mutate into a form that could cause a pandemic . It currently only rarely infects people but has killed 257 out of 420 infected in 15 countries since 2003 , according to the World Health Organization .

The World Health Organization said it was concerned about what it called 800 `` influenza-like '' cases in Mexico , and also about a confirmed outbreak of a new strain of swine flu in the United States . Mexico canceled classes for millions of children in its sprawling capital city and surrounding areas on Friday after authorities noticed a higher number of deaths involving flu-like illness than normal in recent weeks . `` It is a virus that mutated from pigs and then at some point was transmitted to humans , '' Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova told the Televisa network .

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the virus in the United States was a never-before-seen mixture of viruses typical among pigs , birds and humans . All seven American patients have recovered . The Mexican government warned people not to shake hands or kiss when greeting or share food , glasses or cutlery for fear of contracting the flu . Mexico City , one of the world 's biggest cities and home to some 20 million people , was quieter than usual on Friday morning . Normally choking traffic was less chaotic in the absence of school buses and parents driving kids to school . Many people waiting to enter subway stations had their faces covered with surgical masks . The virus is an influenza A virus , carrying the designation H1N1 . It contains DNA typical to avian , swine and human viruses , including elements from European and Asian swine viruses , the CDC has said . WHO said about 60 people in Mexico have died from the disease . The Geneva-based U.N. agency said it was in daily contact with U.S. , Canadian and Mexican authorities and had activated its Strategic Health Operations Center -LRB- SHOC -RRB- -- its command and control center for acute public health events . Surveillance for and scrutiny of influenza has been stepped up since 2003 , when H5N1 bird flu reappeared in Asia .

MEXICO CITY | Fri Apr 24 , 2009 7:50 pm EDT MEXICO CITY -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A strain of flu never seen before has killed up to 60 people in Mexico and also appeared in the United States , where eight people were infected but recovered , health officials said on Friday . Mexico 's government said at least 20 people have died of the flu and it may also be responsible for 40 other deaths . It shut down schools and canceled major public events in Mexico City to try to prevent more deaths in the sprawling , overcrowded capital . Authorities said they had enough antiviral medicine to treat about 1,000 suspected cases reported so far . The World Health Organization said tests showed the virus from 12 of the Mexican patients was the same genetically as a new strain of swine flu , designated H1N1 , seen in eight people in California and Texas . `` Our concern has grown as of yesterday , '' Dr. Richard Besser , acting director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters in a telephone briefing . Global health officials were not ready to declare a pandemic -- a global epidemic of a new and deadly disease such as flu . `` So far there has not been any change in the pandemic threat level , '' Besser said . But the human-to-human spread of the new virus raised fears of a major outbreak . Mexico 's government suspended classes for millions of children in Mexico City , where scared residents rushed out to buy face masks and kept their kids at home . `` We 're frightened because they say it 's not exactly flu , it 's another kind of virus and we 're not vaccinated , '' said Angeles Rivera , 34 , a government worker who fetched her son from a public kindergarten that was closing . Close analysis showed the disease is a mixture of swine , human and avian viruses , according to the CDC . Humans can occasionally catch swine flu from pigs but rarely have they been known to pass it on to other people . Mexico reported 1,004 suspected cases of the new virus , including four possible cases in Mexicali on the border with California . Most of the dead were aged between 25 and 45 , a health official said . It was a worrying sign as seasonal flu can be more deadly among the very young and the very old but a hallmark of pandemics is that they affect healthy young adults . Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova said Mexico has enough antiviral drugs to combat the outbreak for the moment . `` In the last 20 hours , fewer serious cases of this disease and fewer deaths have been reported , '' he told reporters . The WHO said the virus appears to be susceptible to Roche AG 's flu drug Tamiflu , also known as oseltamivir , but not to older flu drugs such as amantadine . Canada has not reported any cases of the flu and is not issuing a travel warning for Mexico , but the country 's chief public health officer David Butler-Jones said the outbreak was `` very concerning '' and Canada was paying close attention . The CDC 's Besser said it was probably too late to contain the outbreak . `` There are things that we see that suggest that containment is not very likely , '' he said . Once it has spread beyond a limited geographical area it would be difficult to control . But there is no reason to avoid Mexico , CDC and the WHO said . `` CDC is not recommending any additional recommendations for travelers to California , Texas and Mexico , '' Besser said . Worldwide , seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people in an average year , but the flu season for North America should have been winding down . The U.S. government said it was closely following the new cases . `` The White House is taking the situation seriously and monitoring for any new developments . The president has been fully briefed , '' an administration official said . In California , where six people have been infected with the flu , Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said authorities were monitoring patients with flu-like symptoms and communicating with Mexican health officials . Mexico 's government cautioned people not to shake hands or kiss when greeting or to share food , glasses or cutlery . Flu virus can be spread on the hands , and handwashing is one of the most important ways to prevent its spread . The outbreak jolted residents of the Mexican capital , one of the world 's biggest cities with around 20 million residents . One pharmacy ran out of surgical face masks after selling 300 in a day . The virus is an influenza A virus , carrying the designation H1N1 . It contains DNA from avian , swine and human viruses , including elements from European and Asian swine viruses , said the CDC , which is already working on a vaccine . Scientists were trying to understand why there are so many deaths in Mexico when the infections in the United States seem mild , Besser said . The CDC said it will issue daily updates here Surveillance for and scrutiny of influenza has been stepped up since 2003 , when H5N1 bird flu reappeared in Asia . Experts fear that or another strain could cause a pandemic that could kill millions . The last flu pandemic was in 1968 when `` Hong Kong '' flu killed about a million people globally .

Here are some questions and answers about the virus : HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED ? Mexico has confirmed 20 deaths from the flu and has 40 other possible fatalities and 1,004 people reported infected . Most of those who died are aged between 25 and 45 . In California and Texas , eight people were infected with the new strain , but all of them have recovered . WHAT KIND OF FLU IS IT AND HOW IS IT SPREADING ? The virus is an influenza A virus , carrying the designation H1N1 and is spreading from person to person . It contains DNA from avian , swine and human viruses , including elements from European and Asian swine viruses , according to the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention , or CDC . The virus is being passed on by sneezing , coughing or physical contact . Though a link to swine flu was originally suspected , the Mexican government has now ruled out any risk of infection from eating pork . The CDC says it is too early to fully assess the threat posed by the new flu virus . The Mexican government said on Friday the rate of deaths has slowed in recent hours and that it has a million doses of antiviral drugs , which is more than enough to treat all reported cases . Central American countries were not reporting any cases of the new flu for the time being . HAS MEXICO EVER SEEN AN OUTBREAK LIKE THIS BEFORE ? Mexico has not suffered a serious flu epidemic before . Many Mexicans vaccinate themselves against common flu , which hits each year in a season that normally ends in February or March . Worldwide , seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people in an average year . WHAT MEASURES IS THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT TAKING ? Mexico City has closed universities and schools until further notice , suspended all major public events and advised people feeling flu-like symptoms to stay home from work . Mexico City 's busiest subway stations are handing out face masks to passengers to use on crowded train carriages . The city government has closed museums , including the popular Anthropology Museum . Authorities recommend people avoid crowded places and have cautioned people not to shake hands or kiss when greeting or to share food , glasses or cutlery . The government has also extended the deadline on filing tax returns by a month to the end of May . WHAT IS THE REST OF THE WORLD DOING TO HELP ? The U.S. government said it was taking the situation seriously and monitoring for any new developments . The CDC said it is working on a vaccine . Geneva-based U.N. agency the World Health Organisation said it was in close contact with U.S. , Canadian and Mexican authorities and had activated its Strategic Health Operations Centre -- its command and control center for acute public health events . The WHO says it is ready to use rapid containment measures if needed , including antivirals , and said Mexico is well-equipped to handle the outbreak . SHOULD TOURISTS WITH TRIPS PLANNED TO MEXICO BE WORRIED ? The CDC and the WHO say there is no need to alter travel plans and Mexico said it saw no need to close its borders . Canada 's government has advised doctors to be on the alert for reports of illness from people who recently traveled to Mexico , but has not recommended canceling trips .

Health officials have been warning that a new strain of influenza that can pass easily from person to person could spark a pandemic , a global epidemic that could kills tens of millions of people . Experts agree another flu pandemic is overdue . Here are some facts about past flu pandemics and pandemic threats : \\* The 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic is the benchmark by which all modern pandemics are measured . Some 20 to 40 percent of the worldwide population became ill and more than 50 million people died . Between September 1918 and April 1919 , it killed more than 600,000 people in the United States alone . In a normal flu season , about 36,000 people die in the United States , and 250,000 to 500,000 globally . \\* While the very young and the very old are most at risk with seasonal flu , the 1918 pandemic primarily struck young adults . It disrupted the global economy . Many small businesses , which were unable to unable to operate during the pandemic , went bankrupt . \\* The virus that caused the 1957 Asian flu pandemic was quickly identified , and vaccines were available by August 1957 . The elderly had the highest rates of death . The Asian flu killed 2 million people globally , according to the World Health Organisation . \\* The 1968 influenza pandemic was first detected in Hong Kong . Those over the age of 65 were most likely to die . It killed an estimated 1 million people globally , according to WHO , making it making the mildest pandemic in the 20th century . \\* In 1976 , a strain of swine flu started infecting people in Fort Dix , New Jersey , and worried U.S. health officials because the virus was thought to be related to the 1918 Spanish flu virus . Forty million people were vaccinated but the program was halted after several cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome , a severe and sometimes fatal condition linked to some vaccines , were reported . The virus never moved outside the Fort Dix area . \\* H5N1 avian flu is the most recent pandemic threat . It first surfaced in 1997 and continues to infect humans who have direct contact with chickens . The H5N1 or avian influenza virus does not spread easily from one person to another . \\* Since 2003 , H5N1 virus has infected 421 people in 15 countries and killed 257 . It has killed or forced the culling of more than 300 million birds in 61 countries in Asia , the Middle East , Africa and Europe . \\* WHO has six pandemic stages . A full-blown pandemic requires sustained , human-to-human spread over many countries of a new and serious virus . -- Sources : U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ; U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ; World Health Organisation -LRB- Editing by Maggie Fox and Eric Walsh -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "857", "dct": "2009-04-25", "dates": ["2009-01-01", "2008-12-25", "2009-04-24", "2009-04-24"], "text": "2009 04 25 08:50 JST By Alistair Bell and Noel Randewich MEXICO CITY -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A strain of flu never seen before has killed up to 60 people in Mexico and also appeared in the United States , where eight people were infected but recovered , health officials said on Friday .

Mexico 's crowded capital , where most of the deaths happened and home to some 20 million people , hunkered down in fear of the swine flu . Tests confirmed that eight New York City schoolchildren had a type A influenza virus that was likely to be the swine flu , the city 's health commissioner said . Kansas state health officials confirmed two cases of swine flu , CNN reported , adding to the original eight cases in the United States . Officials from WHO and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention helped Mexican health experts test hundreds of patients with flu symptoms for the never-before-seen virus . In Mexico City , parents canceled kids ' parties , bars were closed and residents stocked up on DVDs as people stayed home for the weekend to avoid contamination . `` I think it 's worse than they 're telling us , '' said 35-year-old Lidia Diaz , sniffling and wearing a surgical mask as she headed to a clinic in the capital . WHO declared the outbreaks a `` public health event of international concern '' and urged all countries to boost their surveillance for any unusual outbreaks of influenza-like illness and severe pneumonia . The agency stopped short of raising the threat level for a pandemic -- a global epidemic of serious disease . `` It has pandemic potential because it is infecting people , '' WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan said in Geneva . `` However , we can not say on the basis of currently available laboratory , epidemiological and clinical evidence whether or not it will indeed cause a pandemic . '' The last flu pandemic was in 1968 when `` Hong Kong '' flu killed about a million people globally . A pandemic would deal a major blow to a world economy already knocked into its worst recession in decades by the crisis in financial markets . As far away as Hong Kong and Japan , health officials stepped up checks of travelers with flu-like symptoms , and the CDC said it was actively looking for new infections in the United States . `` We are worried and because we are worried we are acting aggressively on a number of fronts , '' the CDC 's Dr. Anne Schuchat told reporters . `` The situation is serious . '' Mexico has said the flu had killed 20 people and could be to blame for 48 more deaths . In all , more than 1,000 suspected cases have been reported nationwide . Most of the dead were aged 25 to 45 , a worrying sign because a hallmark of past pandemics has been high fatalities among healthy young adults . The new flu strain -- a mixture of swine , human and avian flu viruses -- is still poorly understood . Mexico has shut schools and museums and canceled hundreds of public events in the capital to prevent further infections . A significant worsening of the outbreak could hit tourism and consumer spending in a country already weakened by the global economic crisis and an army-led war on drug cartels . Calderon reassured Mexicans that the flu was `` curable '' , while Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard said his goal was to slow the spread of the virus in the capital . No countries or global bodies have issued travel bans to Mexico , but some countries alerted travelers to check websites for information on the flu outbreak . The WHO says the virus from 12 of the Mexican patients is genetically the same as a new strain of swine flu , designated H1N1 , seen in eight people in California and Texas . All of the eight have recovered .

Following are some facts about influenza vaccines . \\* The WHO and CDC prepare samples of virus to give to industrial makers . \\* These samples must be grown in specially produced chicken eggs . The virus is then purified and made into vaccines , a process that takes months . \\* At least 20 companies make flu vaccines including Sanofi Pasteur , Australia 's CSL Ltd , GlaxoSmithKline Plc , Novartis AG , Baxter and nasal spray maker MedImmune , acquired by AstraZeneca Plc. \\* Experts agree the current process for making vaccines is clumsy and outdated , but new and more efficient technologies are still a few years away . \\* WHO and CDC experts are trying to decide if a new vaccine for the H1N1 swine flu strain is needed , or perhaps if a fourth element could be added to the seasonal flu vaccine mix for next September . \\* The health agencies also had been considering adding some vaccines against H5N1 avian influenza , which occasionally infects people and is also considered a major pandemic threat . \\* Tests show the H1N1 component of the current seasonal flu vaccine does not protect against the new strain . \\* Consulting firm Oliver Wyman found that drug companies would need four years to meet global demand for vaccines if a pandemic broke out today , but new technology could significantly boost production by 2014 . \\* Currently , drug makers could make up to 2.5 billion doses of pandemic vaccines in one year , meaning it would take four years to meet global demand , Oliver Wyman found . In a best-case scenario , they could make 7.7 billion doses in 1.5 years . \\* Compounds called adjuvants can be used to boost a vaccine 's effectiveness , so it could be diluted and used in more people . \\* Current global demand for seasonal influenza vaccine is about 500 million doses a year . \\* The CDC recommends that 261 million Americans -- 85 percent of the population -- should be vaccinated against flu .

The picture is changing every moment . '' Guan , who has been studying and tracking the spread of the H5N1 bird flu virus ever since it was discovered in people in Hong Kong in 1997 , said there would be `` many problems '' if swine flu reached China and India , `` where populations are so dense and health infrastructure is still insufficient . '' The virus , which carries swine , avian and human DNA and the designation H1N1 , has already killed up to 103 people in Mexico , infected 20 in the United States and six in Canada . There are many questions surrounding this virus , such as why it appears milder in the United States and deadlier in Mexico . `` It may seem weaker for now in the United States , but we do not know if it will get more virulent when it goes to another place as it mutates constantly , '' said Guan . `` When it goes into a place like China , there will be very high transmissibility among people . '' Microbes like viruses mutate all the time and can swap or mix DNA with other viruses they come into contact with . And nobody knows whether they could become more or less deadly , experts say . Guan said the swine flu virus was very different from the seasonal human H1N1 flu virus . `` It is almost a new subtype , '' he said , adding that as it was already transmitting efficiently among people , the world already had a pandemic on its hands . Currently the World Health Organisation classifies the virus as a `` public health emergency of international concern '' that could become a pandemic , or global outbreak of serious disease . `` This is what I am very worried about . The WHO is always very cautious -LRB- about raising its alert system -RRB- but it is wasting time , '' Guan added . The current phase of alert is 3 on a scale of 1 to 6 .

Mexicans returned to work in large numbers after the weekend , despite worries over a virus that has killed up to 149 people there , and spread to the United States , Canada and Europe , but economists have warned that a global outbreak of deadly flu would seriously curtail economic activity . The World Bank estimated in 2008 that a flu pandemic could cost $ 3 trillion -LRB- 2 trillion pounds -RRB- and result in a nearly 5 percent drop in world gross domestic product . An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or SARS , which disrupted travel , trade and workplaces in 2003 , cost the Asia Pacific region an estimated $ 40 billion . It lasted six months and killed 775 of the 8,000 people it infected in 25 countries . The current flu outbreak tempered optimism that the global downturn could be starting to slow after governments committed trillions of dollars to interventions and stimulus . `` We almost have to wait to see not so much the contagion aspect but how deadly is this , '' said Alan Ruskin , chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich , Connecticut . While a mild strain may have a limited impact , `` if you start getting a number of fatalities , then it ramps the issue up substantially at every level , from a human standpoint and from an economic standpoint , '' he said . In Washington , the Obama administration said it was too soon to determine the potential economic impact but U.S. Treasury officials were monitoring the situation . Regardless of the effect of the virus on the global economy , International Monetary Fund Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said he did not see a global economic recovery before 2010 . Strauss-Kahn told CNBC television he hoped the worst was over but that `` green shoots '' in the global economy were mostly in the United States . A Reuters survey of analysts across European and the United States taken April 21-27 found a slim majority saying the bottom had yet to be hit in the worst global recession since World War Two . The vast bulk of them said the crisis would last anywhere from six months to another two years . `` Financial and macroeconomic stability are still some way off and we do n't yet have the foundation for a solid recovery , '' said Lena Komileva , chief G7 market economist at interdealer broker Tullett Prebon . Mexico 's peso dropped more than 4 percent and U.S. stocks fell in volatile trading as investors fretted about the flu outbreak . The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.6 percent . European shares recovered from early losses , with the FTSEurofirst 300 index closing up 0.4 percent . Airline and leisure-related stocks were hit by fears the outbreak would hurt travel but drug makers rose on hopes the virus would result in strong vaccine sales . Separately , General Motors Corp said it would close plants , eliminate brands and exchange $ 27 billion of bonds for equity in a last ditch effort to avoid bankruptcy and earn continued government support . Despite risks of more financial turbulence , European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said lowering interest rates is not necessarily the best way to fight a recession . `` Our actions have been different from those taken by other central banks , reflecting differences in economic and financial structures , '' he said of the ECB 's reaction to the crisis in a speech to the Foreign Policy Association in New York . `` Indeed , given the different economic structures , they need to be different to reach the same objective . '' The ECB meets on May 7 and markets expect it to cut the benchmark interest rate from 1.25 percent to 1.0 percent . The U.S. Federal Reserve starts a two-day meeting on Tuesday and is expected to leave benchmark rates at or near zero . Earlier , other European Central Bank policymakers suggested further reductions in the main refinancing rate but differed as to how far they should go . The delicate state of the global economy was underlined by the Japanese government , which cut its economic forecasts on Monday , saying gross domestic product would shrink 3.3 percent over the next year . The Bank of Japan is expected to keep interest rates near zero when it meets on Thursday but has maintained a cautious view on the global outlook . BOJ Governor Masaaki Sharakawa has signalled the BOJ 's monthly policy review will predict a gradual recovery towards the end of this year or early in 2010 . -LRB- Reporting by Reuters correspondents worldwide ; Writing by Dena Aubin ; Editing by Patricia Zengerle -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "194", "dct": "2009-04-27", "dates": ["2009-04-27", "2009-04-27", "2009-04-27", "2009-04-27", "2009-04-27", "2009-04-27"], "text": "KUALA LUMPUR , April 27 | Mon Apr 27 , 2009 4:19 am BST KUALA LUMPUR , April 27 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Malaysia 's benchmark stock index .

Margaret Chan , director-general of the United Nations agency in Geneva , is charged with deciding on when to move from one phase to another . Her decision is based on advice from international public health experts who held an emergency meeting Monday . The WHO emergency committee is assessing the risk from a swine flu outbreak that has killed up to 149 people in Mexico and spread across the world . The current phase of alert is 3 , on a scale of 1 to 6 . A full-blown pandemic , level 6 , denotes sustained , human-to-human spread over many countries of a new and serious virus . Here are details of the six phases : No animal influenza virus circulating among animals is reported to cause infection in animals . Animal influenza virus is known to have caused infection in humans and is therefore a potential pandemic threat Animal or human-animal influenza virus causes sporadic cases or clusters of cases in people , but no human-to-human transmission , except in specific circumstances Human to human transmission of an animal or human-animal influenza virus able to sustain community-level outbreaks `` The ability to cause sustained disease outbreaks in a community marks a significant upwards shift in the risk for a pandemic . '' \\* PHASE 5 : The same virus causes sustained community-level outbreaks in two or more countries in one region `` While most countries will not be affected at this stage , the declaration of Phase 5 is a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent and that the time to finalize the organization , communication , and implementation of the planned mitigation measures is short . '' The virus causes sustained community-level outbreaks in more than one region `` Designation of this phase will indicate that a global pandemic is under way . '' Pandemic levels dropping below peak levels , but countries need to be prepared for a second wave . -LRB- For a summary of the new WHO scale , go to : -LRB- For more Reuters swine flu coverage , please click here : An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "302", "dct": "2009-04-27", "dates": [null, null], "text": "\\* Airline stocks fall 15 percent in U.S. on flu scare \\* Hotels and cruise ship operators also lower \\* Health fears ` could stall ' airlines recovery By Tim Hepher and Karen Jacobs PARIS\\/ATLANTA , April 27 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Panicked sellers fled investments in air , land and sea on Monday as fears of a flu pandemic rekindled memories of the Asian SARS crisis that caused widespread industry turmoil six years ago . From Sydney to New York , selling hit the world 's leading airline brands , hotels and cruise operators and the cost of insuring airline debt rose following the outbreak of swine flu . The United States declared a public health emergency and Americans and Europeans were urged to avoid non-essential travel to Mexico , where 103 people have died from the outbreak . Investors wiped $ 5 billion off the value of leading U.S. airlines in just 10 minutes of trading , with all of the carriers most heavily exposed to Mexico racking up double-digit losses . N , which offers more seats than any foreign airline into and out of Mexico , according to data provided exclusively to Reuters by airline schedules consultancy Innovata , saw its stock fall by 15 percent . American Airlines parent AMR Corp AMR . N and US Airways -LRB- LCC . N -RRB- , the second and third foreign airlines in terms of passenger capacity to the same country , suffered similar falls . In Europe , major network carriers Air France-KLM -LRB- AIRF . PA -RRB- and British Airways BAY . L fell almost 10 percent and Spain 's Iberia IBLA . MC , which offers the most capacity to Spanish-speaking Mexico from Europe , gave up 7 percent . Airlines have lurched from crisis to crisis in the past year as carriers grappled with high oil prices , then the credit crunch , a slump in business travel and plunging cargo trade . Some executives have been tentatively predicting relief from months of weak traffic figures and eying benefits from cost cuts including more than 25,000 job cuts in the United States . But Helane Becker , a transportation analyst with Jesup & Lamont in New York , said the flu scare could stall any recovery . `` In the summer of 2002 , international airline traffic was down 14-15 percent so we would expect something similar , and we would expect any recovery to be pushed from the third quarter of '09 into the fourth quarter of '09 and 2010 , '' Becker said . The SARS epidemic broke out in early 2003 , postponing a recovery from recession worsened by the Sept 11 , 2001 , attacks . However its economic impact was mostly confined to one quarter . In Hong Kong , Cathay Pacific Airways -LRB- 0293 . HK -RRB- -- which at one point considered grounding its fleet during the SARS crisis -- lost 8 percent and Air China -LRB- 0753 . HK -RRB- fell 13.5 percent . SE said it had taken steps to ensure lessons learned from SARS were used to try to contain the scare . It said cabin crew would try to spot unwell passengers . `` We have standard operating procedures in place based on the experience gained from handling the SARS outbreak . Staff have been briefed on the nature of the disease and are on the alert for customers who appear unwell , '' a Singapore spokeswoman said . `` As the situation for now is primarily precautionary , there are no plans to disinfect our aircraft or for our cabin crew to wear masks . However , we do carry emergency packs . '' American Airlines reassured travellers it was prepared to deal with any type of illness on board a flight and that it had full ground-to-air communication with its medical staff . It said it would allow passengers to any city in Mexico to change their plans without any fee or penalty , but there were no immediate reports of any airlines canceling flights . In Madrid , passengers arriving from Mexico were given information packs on what to do if they fell unwell . Shares of U.S. hotels and cruise companies joined the rout . Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd -LRB- RCL . N -RRB- -LRB- RCL . OL -RRB- sank 14 percent in New York , while Carnival Corp -LRB- CCL . N -RRB- was off 9 percent . U.S. giant Starwood Hotels & Resorts -LRB- HOT . N -RRB- lost nearly 8 percent and Marriott International -LRB- MAR. . N -RRB- fell about 5 percent . Carnival said there were no reports of guests showing symptoms of swine flu on its ships . Not all analysts were rattled by the swine flu outbreak . Howard Wheeldon , senior strategist at BGC Partners in London , said airlines were used to living through boom and bust . `` The one thing about airlines is they recover from events like this amazingly quickly . It is damaging and unhelpful , but not the end of the world for them , '' he said .

In 2003 , Asia was feeling the effects of the October 2002 Bali bombings , a tentative world recovery was underway from the bursting of the technology bubble and there was conflict in Iraq . Likewise today , other factors , such as job and income losses from the credit crisis , could make it difficult to isolate the effects of any swine flu outbreak . But SARS provides the last main point of reference in how the world dealt with a pandemic that was spread by human-to-human contact and how it affected economies and markets . Here are some questions and answers about the severe acute respiratory syndrome , or SARS , crisis : WHAT WAS THE IMPACT OF SARS ON ASIA ? The World Health Organisation declared SARS a pandemic in March 2003 . By June of that year , it had lifted an advisory warning against traveling to SARS affected countries . There were some 8,000 cases and close to 800 deaths . The most visible impact of SARS was on tourism and consumption patterns in the most affected countries : Singapore , Hong Kong , China and Malaysia , although others in the region also suffered . Singapore and Hong Kong slipped into recession in 2003 . Other countries affected by SARS included Canada , South Africa , Sweden , France and the United States . Deaths were reported in Asia , Canada , France and South Africa . According to the Asian Development Bank , the cost of SARS in terms of lost GDP in nominal terms for East and Southeast Asia was about $ 18 billion or 0.6 percentage points of 2003 GDP . The main channels through which SARS affected economies was through tourist arrivals . ADB data shows a 20-70 percent drop on tourist arrivals in April 2003 in the most affected economies , while others in Asia also saw declines of 15-35 percent , leading to estimated tourism revenue losses of nearly $ 15 billion or 0.5 percent of GDP . SARS-affected economies experienced drops in retail sales growth in the order of 5-10 percent in early 2003 . Hong Kong 's economy shrank 2.6 percent and Singapore 's by 2 percent in the first half of 2003 . Overall growth was ironically helped by a simultaneous decline in imports and investment . HOW DID MARKETS REACT TO SARS ? Market reaction was relatively muted , possibly because the panic over SARS lasted for just about one quarter and governments reacted quickly . The Singapore dollar SGD = fell nearly 4 percent against the U.S. dollar between the end of January 2003 and the end of April 2003 , but it then rallied . MCSI 's emerging Asia-ex-Japan index . MIAPJ0000PUS fell around 14 percent between January and March 2003 . From the end of March it rallied by 56 percent during the rest of the year Hong Kong 's benchmark index . HSI shed 18 percent of its value between December 2002 and April 2003 , bottoming at a 4-year low . For a graphic on economic and market impact , click here : China had price controls for SARS-related drugs , tax waivers for affected industries such as hotels , interest subsidies for tourism sectors . Hong Kong 's government announced a package of measures worth around 1 percent of GDP , which included tax reductions and loan guarantees . Singapore likewise had a SARS relief package including measures for airlines . It also eased monetary policy in July 2003 by a one-off devaluation of the currency . Malaysia 's package was close to 2 percent of GDP and included cheaper loans , support for job training and tourism sectors . IS THE ECONOMIC SITUATION DIFFERENT NOW ? The starting point for most economies is much lower , since the credit crisis has already plunged a lot of the developed world and countries such as Singapore , Japan and Hong Kong into recession . Tourism received a big boost between 2004 and 2007 and is now a much bigger contributor to growth , with revenues comprising between 6 and 9 percent of GDP in Hong Kong , Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore .

Countries around the world have moved to contain the spread of a possible pandemic after a new swine flu outbreak killed 103 people in Mexico . Twenty cases have been identified in the United States and six in Canada , with no deaths reported . Possible cases are being checked as far afield as New Zealand . `` With SARS and H5N1 , there was a lot of impetus to improve preparedness in many countries in Asia , but there is still a huge variation in preparedness , '' said Malik Peiris , a virologist and professor at the University of Hong Kong . Densely populated cities in developing countries such as China or India would encounter major problems , said Guan Yi , a Chinese virologist at the University of Hong Kong who helped fight SARS and bird flu and trace their sources in the past . `` If it goes to China or India , where populations are very dense and infrastructure is not enough , there will be many problems , '' Guan said . `` We are counting down to a pandemic . '' Health experts are also worried about impoverished countries such as Laos , Cambodia and Myanmar , which have rudimentary public health systems , meaning a delay in reporting cases and risking the spread of outbreaks . Since SARS and H5N1 swept through Asia in 2003 , governments around the region have beefed up disease surveillance systems , built hospital isolation units and maintained stockpiles of Tamiflu , a drug that appears effective against the new virus . However there are still big discrepancies between countries . While many dead birds found in Hong Kong are routinely tested for diseases like H5N1 , that would be hardly be possible in sprawling countries like China or India . Sophisticated laboratories have been set up in Hong Kong and even Indonesia , which has four such facilities . In Thailand , there are flu monitoring systems in place in the countryside , a legacy from battling H5N1 . However , experts are jittery because such facilities are scarce and there are many questions surrounding the new virus . `` Indonesia has prepared a system in case of a flu pandemic . But there is something I am not certain of , the early warning , reporting and action system , '' said I Gusti Ngurah Mahardika , a virologist at Udayana University in Indonesia . `` The laboratories and government research institute are of course ready , but the question is , do the rest -LRB- in the country -RRB- have the early diagnostic -LRB- systems -RRB- already ? '' `` I am trying to find out about the H1N1 that spread in Mexico and California , why is it new ? How is it connected to swine ? '' Thailand strengthened its pandemic preparedness after an initial slow response to bird flu in 2003 , and health experts say it now has a `` robust '' surveillance system , improved laboratory facilities and better training . Health Minister Witthaya Kaewparadai said 14 medical centers were capable of tackling an outbreak of swine flu . Another six mobile units were on standby to handle remote outbreaks . `` It will take us four hours to verify suspected cases , '' Witthaya said , adding Thailand had enough Tamiflu stockpiled in the country to treat 300,000 patients , and the government drug maker can produce more if necessary .

It 's already having an effect on markets and travel plans , in addition to the obvious impact on public health . The impact on markets could become more significant in time , but the impact on the media was practically immediate . Cable television programmers went into crisis mode and a look at newspaper front pages and website home pages around the world showed a range of responses , from the almost hysterical to the concerned and more measured .

Says . The BBC website focused on the confirmation of flu cases in the UK , with extensive Q&A 's on the origins of the disease and how it spreads and contributions from readers who were dealing with disease -LRB- some of them medical professionals in Mexico -RRB- . Big , bad-news stories can mean surges in audiences for media outlets and they certainly raise the adrenalin level of editors and reporters . They offer the temptation to go to excess , but they also offer the opportunity for us be of priceless service to our customers , clients and readers . The question for me is how we in the media make sure we report accurately and informatively on the story and its impact on the markets and consumers lives without minimizing and without sensationalizing it . `` This is the type of story where our goal to stay factual and keep perspective is essential to uphold , '' says Reuters Editor-in-Chief David Schlesinger . `` Our role is neither to trivialize nor to hype or scaremonger , but to describe accurately what is happening and put its implications in context . '' Reuters has focused a great deal of resources rightly , given our customers and audience on the implications for the markets and the impact on the global economic downturn . On Monday afternoon , Reuters.com was leading with Will global recovery catch the flu ? atop a package of stories on possible market scenarios , the EU travel warning and factboxes on health precautions and industries being affected . One story noted , not surprisingly , that travel and tourism stocks were in turmoil . Reuters.com also featured a special coverage page with the latest news , accompanied by a sober presentation of `` Swine Flu Facts . '' There 's even an invitation to receive updates on Twitter . Call me a skeptic on Twitter , but 140 characters wo n't do much to add context to the story . Still , no one ever said Twitter was about context and at least you can follow developments , whether or not you 're near a computer . My Reuters colleagues especially the ones working bravely and tirelessly in Mexico are succeeding in upholding the goal of staying factual and keeping events in perspective . It 's our mission to provide the information and insight our audience and customers need to make intelligent decisions about their investments and their lives . As shown by the World Health Organization 's decision Monday to raise the pandemic alert to Level 4 , and later to Level 5 , there 's plenty of drama to report without adding to it . The flu story is still in its early stages and it remains to be seen if this becomes one of the biggest stories of our time . Whatever happens , it wo n't hurt us all to take a deep breath now . The CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION -LRB- CMA -RRB- made a rather stark and dismal prediction in August of 2008 . And , the strange thing is ; there were no images of PERSONS , constantly appearing on the Main Stream Media -LRB- MSM -RRB- news papers , websites , and of course in High Definition on digital TVs wearing surgical or chemical masks -LRB- respirators -RRB- . The World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- had nothing much to say about this drastic prediction which the CMA had made . The CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL & PREVENTION -LRB- CDC -RRB- in the UNITED STATES , also did not appear too concerned , especially given their close proximity to the geographic landmass known as Canada . The basis for my assumption , leading me to believe that neither of these CORPORATE organizations had attached much or any concern , actually became somewhat obvious . By this I make reference ; there was an imminent predicted demise of thousands , or perhaps hundreds of thousands of human beings , but yet , it was business as usual . You could have hopped on a jet plane and fly to Mexico , drive across the North American borders to do some shopping , no problemo ... no alert measures went into effect , i.e. , like the WHO is doing now , e.g. `` Alert 5 ? or , as the UNITED STATES HOMELAND SECURITY might soon do , with their trendy color system , e.g. `` Amber Alert . '' Well , I ve rambled on long enough now , so I ll come to my point : In August 2008 , the CMA claimed that up to 21,000 Canadians will die this year -LRB- 2008 -RRB- , due to air pollution , and with 3,000 of those deaths due to short-term exposure to smog . I don t know of any pharmaceutical research CORPORATIONS that are currently trying to develop a VACCINE for air pollution or SMOG . So , perhaps a flu pandemic might actually be a good thing ... being locked down in our homes , and or detained in FEMA detention camps , will definitely be pay back to the industry , which ultimately must bear the responsibility for the deaths of 21,000 human beings . Last reported , Mexico was losing $ 53 million dollars per day , because of the flu . Great to read a balance . I am in Mexico right now , been here some time . I am shocked at the BS media hype coming out in my country back home ... causing a panic . The main misleading statement is saying there are 150 dead without backing this up with the facts . The facts are only eight people have been officially confirmed deaths from the virus and these cases my not be directly from the virus . They also forget to mention the thousands who die of the flu and complications each year . e.g. about 100 a day in the USA alone . I think it is shameful they way the media is hypering this up and misleading the public . And the terrible impact on the country of Mexico . Mexico is a great place to live and retire , rated number one by the organization International living two years running . This is an alarm that world has to wake up . This is an obvious that world is going to loose so many billion people this year as the testimony was said by so many christian server begining of this year . well we are not that far before the government can step in and stop the big tragedy As serious as a pandemic can be , the Spanish Flu of the early 20th century is a prime example , things can get out of hand . Remember that swine flu has been with us before . In 1976 it was detected on a US military base . There seems to have been some deaths , and then the subsequent over reaction in vaccinating millions of Americans . The vaccine proved to be more deadly -LRB- many people got serious , long lasting side effects -RRB- than the virus itself . That being said , it would be a mistake to try to label this `` The Mexican Flu '' just as it is misleading to name the 1918 pandemic `` The Spanish Flu '' as it actually originated in the US . No one is sure where the new N1H1 strain originated , but it has been here before , and some think that this might have even been the very same virus from 1918 . Medicine has come a long way , in 1918 there were n't even antibiotics readily available . As to why many people are dying in Mexico City , -LRB- 150 out of 22 million is a strange thing to call many -RRB- it is the most populated city in the world with high poverty -LRB- difficult to get treatment if you have no insurance or money -RRB- . I also read that many in Mexico are having a difficult time getting the two viral drugs available to combat N1H1 . Relax , be extra cautious and clean , and make sure you eat well . God Bless A nice lttle site to save you surfing the web about swine flu . every media outlet will exaggerate in order to secure more audience for ad sales , and every government will exaggerate to have a handy excuse to assume ` special powers ' -- like they just did in Mexico . At this rate , I imagine the TSA here in the States will be taking throat cultures before they let you board a plane . Take disease outbreaks seriously -- sure . You would n't want to be the government that did nothing until it was too late . But to scare half my neighbors into stocking up on surgical masks and half the third world into slaughtering all their pigs ? In a week , I expect to hear about the sanitation crisis resulting from all those carcasses -RRB- . There is a middle ground between blind panic and sleepy complacency . We used to be able to count on the news to help us find it . I think it 's an outrage the hype this story is getting . The news media just does n't have enough to say to be on air 24\\/7 . This is more irresponsible than their usual panic though . Schools have closed , the stock market has been affected -- people are so frightened . And , for what -- So far , one person has died of this strain of flu -- whereas , in a normal outbreak , thousands die routinely from flu . I live in Mexico , close to the Belizean border . It astounds me how everyone has over reacted to this . I know it could be serious , and I do n't want to minimize any possible danger but it is frightening to see an entire country completely shut down . My workers are frightened and the information coming from all countries is so confusing . If you go to the CDC and WHO websites and get real information , it is far less serious than is being hyped . I 'm a citizen of the US but I 'm ashamed at the misinformation and superiority that I feel coming from my own country . I think Mexico has done a brave thing in shutting down the country . Would any other country do this with 20 confirmed deaths ? I do n't think so . Someone out there owes Mexico some Kudos . Has anyone found out if the HIN1 strain in Mexico is fatal or is it that the patients were not given the adequate antiviral medication on time ? Example a healthy 29 yrs Mexican died after 9 days . However all the cases outside Mexico have recovered -LRB- except for the Mexican baby in Taxes -RRB- . Is this a case of mistreatment or the strain being more virulent and deadly ? I think this article needs to be circulated around Reuters . When I first entered the site here , the top story was `` Mild Pandemic or Millions Dead ? '' Phrases like `` millions dead '' may grab attention , but they 're exactly the kind of sensationalism Mr. Wright 's article was warning against . `` Which common household product can cause sudden death in toddlers ? Tune in at 11:00 pm for this and more ! '' The Hype has really been irritating me . The only positive point is that headlines seem to have temporarily stopped switching eight times a day between slight global recovery and deepening global meltdown . I was getting dizzy ! The best thing about the swine flu craze is the short-selling potential of all these stocks that will soon deflate whenever the flu fears subside or their vaccines prove impractical . This was in direct reference to the inefficient detection and timely dissemination of information , regarding the current emerging Swine Flu pandemic ... the World Health Organization along with the CENTERS for DISEASE CONTROL & PREVENTION -LRB- CDC -RRB- has paled in comparison to a two year old Seattle , Washington based company with just 50 employees VERATECT CORPORATION . They alerted the public to a growing number of swine flu cases , weeks before the CDC and the WHO did . VERATECT accomplishes their daily business activities , via the use of computer algorithms , and human analysts , to monitor online and off-line sources , for hints of disease outbreaks , and worldwide civil unrest . Perhaps the CDC , the WHO , HHS , DHS , NSA , CSIS , RCMP and , even MI5 , could learn a thing or two from this start up company from Seattle . They could perhaps partner with them , or other such CORPORATIONS , in an effort to satisfy the needs of certain public and private institutions . Clients of these geek computer algorithms , and human analysis , were actually forewarned of the potentially severe outbreak of Swine Flu , and much sooner than the general public was too , apparently . This new and growing business , which others are into as well , garners its source materials from data being captured from the likes of ; bloggers , on-line chatters , twitters , news media sources , and of course , government websites . There is really nothing stopping the CDC , the WHO , et . al. , from using this available data to enhance the speed at which they respond to outbreaks of Swine Flu , H5N1 , Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -LRB- SARS -RRB- etc. . With the likes of this high tech , alerting technology , the possibilities will now be limitless . Had this method of prediction been available many years ago , the incidences of fatally injurious accidents to unsuspecting citizens , might have been minimized . In particular , the Swine Flu vaccination program of the 1970s , which was responsible for horrendous side-effects such as , paralysis and death , comes to mind . Not to mention the on-going controversy of the Polio vaccines , especially with the recent negative publicity from Nigeria , and other third world countries . It has been stated ; some of the obvious and important benefits of this intelligence gathering science , apart from possibly saving human life will better manage the financial reporting , and insurance coverage mitigating potential class action lawsuits due to negligence especially important in the UNITED KINGDOM , where the government recently crafted the CORPORATE Manslaughter , and CORPORATE Homicide ACTs . With this cutting edge into the future knowledge , 21,000 Canadians might have had sooner awareness that they would die in 2008 from air pollution and smog Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ? WORLD VISION INCORPORATED pays good money for this unique style of pre emptive intelligence . It is said , that they can actually use the alerting technology to determine where contaminated drinking water might exists , on this planet . The leader of the CDC 's international swine flu team thinks this type of technology is somewhat useful and , sensitive to emerging threats . However , Dr. Scott Dowell also thinks it generates a lot of noise . '' On the subject of noise or sound , the CORPORATION which truly possessed the widest vision capabilities ; was PANASONIC . More than two months ago now , and before any inkling of Swine Flu -LRB- A-H1N1 -RRB- , this company came up with the perplexing plan ; repatriate the families of overseas employees , out of fears of an imminent flu pandemic . A PANASONIC spokesperson said ; employees will stay put , but families of those working in China , Asia -LRB- excluding Singapore -RRB- , the Middle East , Africa , Russia and South America are to return to Japan . So perplexing was this decision , that it triggered a reaction from WHO spokesperson , Gregory Hartl : There 's really no reason for anyone to all of a sudden take such actions , because today is no different from yesterday . '' Hartl of the WHO said ; there is no justification for this decision , particularly from a public health perspective . There is no sense that the risk has risen , and we are definitely still in Phase 3 . Phase 6 = Condition Pandemic . It 's all hype to focus attention elsewhere away from what our elected officials are doing . Re : Posted by Jason-May 1st , 2009 -- 4:59 pm GMT I agree with you : We all need to keep focused on what our elected OFFICALS are doing . And , perhaps equally , if not more important jason ; some of the things which they have , already done . The hype seems to be an effective way of distracting people from the government 's antics and also to keep our minds off the economy crisis . I do n't know for sure how big this swine flu epidemic will get but at the moment , I think it 's all hype . So today Mexico reports that the worst of the swine flu is over ; and it is no worse than a regular flu . How much money was spent on this ? Did Obama not asked for a billion dollars , and asked companies to give as much time as the employees asked ? How much did this cost to airlines , travel agencies ? How much did this cost to the Mexican and world economy ? I think the news media need to do some real soul searching . Hype sells but it will eventually backfire . I have a consipiracy theory , this could have been made to create terror among humanity . some makers of medicine & vaccine and genius in developing diseases may have created the H1N1 for profit & commercial purpose . Yes , I make it a point to read all comments on the blog . I like for the discussion to be largely among readers , since I 've already had my say -- and at some length . However , when appropriate I will wade back in to the debate . Hey Raul from May 4th , 2009 -- Re : I have a conspiracy theory . I can surely agree with your written expression , but only positively on one point -- It is a conspiracy . And , these situations are no longer theories . YouTube this : Luke Rudkowski -- ` U.S. media does n't want truth ' . Just imagine how many people caught TB or AIDS everyday by global statistics and WHO should have declared world pandemic for every known communicatable disease , you will feel much better for a curable flu .

It has killed up to 81 people in Mexico and spread to the United States and Canada . Here are some questions and answers about the outbreak : HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED ? HOW MANY ARE INFECTED ? All the fatalities have been in Mexico , where the government is reporting at least 20 and up to 81 deaths from the flu virus . Most of the dead are between 25 and 45 -- the age group past pandemics have tended to strike . Mexican officials said , however , that most of the 1,300 suspected cases were found not to have swine flu . In the United States , the flu has infected 20 people in California , Kansas , Texas , New York and Ohio . Canada has confirmed six cases . Possible infections have also been detected in Spain , France and New Zealand . WHAT KIND OF FLU IS IT AND HOW IS IT SPREADING ? The virus is an influenza A virus , carrying the designation H1N1 and is spreading from person to person . It contains DNA from avian , swine and human viruses , including elements from European and Asian swine viruses , according to the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention . It is passed on by sneezing , coughing or when people pick up the virus from their hands . It likely originated in pigs , but the Mexican government and the World Health Organisation have ruled out any risk of infection from eating pork . The Geneva-based WHO has declared the flu a `` public health emergency of international concern . '' It poses the biggest risk of a large-scale pandemic since avian flu re-emerged in 2003 , killing 257 out of 421 infected in 15 countries . The Mexican government is stressing that it can be treated and it has one million doses of antiviral drugs . HOW IS THIS FLU DIFFERENT FROM ORDINARY FLU ? The swine flu is characterized by common flu symptoms -- sudden fever , muscle aches , sore throat and dry cough -- but may cause more severe vomiting and diarrhoea . Common seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people in an average year , often targeting the elderly . Most people die from pneumonia and flu can kill previously healthy people for reasons no one quite understands . It can also worsen bacterial infections . New flu strains can spread fast because no one has natural immunity and a vaccine can take months to develop . This new strain of swine flu is genetically different from the H1N1 virus that the seasonal flu vaccine protects against . HOW BAD COULD IT GET ? A 1968 a `` Hong Kong '' flu pandemic killed about one million people globally . In a 1918 `` Spanish '' flu pandemic between 40 million and 100 million people died . However , the WHO says the world is now better prepared to withstand a flu pandemic . WHAT MEASURES IS THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT TAKING ? Mexico has closed all schools in the capital and two central states until May 6 and stopped hundreds of public events in Mexico City , including concerts . Mexico City has shut 70 percent of its bars and nightclubs , closed churches and cinemas , and the army is handing out surgical face masks on the street . The government is recommending people avoid crowded places and refrain from greetings like shaking hands , kissing or hugging . People have been told to wash their hands frequently and avoid sharing food or kitchenware . It has also issued an emergency decree that gives it the power to isolate sick people , enter homes or workplaces and regulate air , sea and land transportation to try to stop further infection . The government has even extended the deadline on filing tax returns by a month to the end of May . WHAT IS THE REST OF THE WORLD DOING TO HELP ? The U.S. government is monitoring developments and the CDC and the WHO are working on a vaccine . The WHO has activated a command and control center for acute public health events nicknamed the `` war room . '' It says it is ready to use rapid containment measures if needed , including antivirals . The WHO has a stockpile of 5 million treatment courses of the antiviral Tamiflu , by Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG and Gilead Sciences Inc , and of Relenza , made by GlaxoSmithKline , which have both proven effective against the virus . Countries and regions also have antiviral supplies and the United States has released 25 percent of its 50-million course stockpile of the two drugs . SHOULD TOURISTS WITH TRIPS PLANNED TO MEXICO BE WORRIED ? The CDC and the WHO say there is no need to alter travel plans and Mexico has said it saw no need to close its borders .

The company was able to state the likelihood of H1N1 outbreaks based on its patented Replikin Count -LRB- TM -RRB- genomics technology , which examines specific regions in virus genes which have been linked with past epidemics . The April 2008 announcement , attached below as published on the Web , stated that in H1N1 the company had then detected the highest concentrations of these specific regions ever seen , except for those from the 1918 pandemic which killed millions of people . Today , the company is actively pursuing licensing partnerships to apply its groundbreaking technology not only to early warning systems , but also to the development of synthetic vaccines to prevent or slow future epidemics . A synthetic H1N1 Replikins Vaccine is available for testing . A similar synthetic Replikin Vaccine has been shown to successfully block the entry of H5N1 virus into , replication in , and excretion from chickens . The company is able to produce these vaccines in as little as 7 days , rather than the many months needed for traditional vaccines , because they are synthesized at the peptide level . The following is the text of the April 2008 release in which Replikins was able to pinpoint the high risk of H1N1 outbreaks : -- H1N1 Influenza Virus with Highest Replikin Count -LRB- TM -RRB- Since the 1918 Pandemic Identified in the U.S. and Austria Boston , MA -LRB- PRWeb -RRB- April 7 , 2008 -- Replikins , Ltd. has found that the Replikin Count -LRB- TM -RRB- of the H1N1 strain of influenza virus has recently increased to 7.6 -LRB- plus\\/minus 1.4 -RRB- , its highest level since the 1918 H1N1 pandemic -LRB- p value less than 0.001 -RRB- . A rising Replikin Count of a particular influenza strain , indicating rapid replication of the virus , is an early warning which has been followed consistently by an outbreak of the specific strain . The current increase appears to be specific to H1N1 ; there was a concurrent 80 % decline in the Replikin Count of H3N2 , for instance . The current H1N1 appears to be rapidly replicating simultaneously in the U.S. and Austria . It may succeed H5N1 as the leading candidate for the next expected overdue pandemic . However , the same virus replikin structures detected by FluForecast -LRB- R -RRB- software in all three previous pandemics , namely 1918 H1N1 , 1957 H2N2 , and 1968 H3N2 , as well as in H5N1 , have not yet been detected in the currently evolving H1N1 . There is evidence that many factors , including virus structure , host receptivity , and the environment , together with infectivity and rapid replication , need to converge for a pandemic to occur . For H5N1 , the high human mortality rate , which peaked at over 80 % in 2006-07 in Indonesia , as well as current low infectivity , both appear to limit H5N1 's ability to produce a pandemic . Furthermore , the H5N1 rapid replication cycle which began in 1996 now appears to be over . The H5N1 virus produced less than 300 World Health Organization confirmed deaths over the past 10 years . On the other hand , H1N1 , with an estimated human mortality rate of only 2.5 to 10 % , but with much higher infectivity , produced an estimated 50 million deaths in the 1918 pandemic . A number of countermeasures exist today which did not exist in 1918 , however . Among these is Replikins ' ability to manufacture synthetic vaccines based on current sequences , with a seven day production turnaround . -LRB- end of 4\\/2008 release -RRB- In the April 2008 announcement above , as published on the Web , Replikins stated that it had detected the highest levels of its specific genome regions ever seen in any virus samples , except for those from the 1918 pandemic which killed tens of millions of people .

The views expressed are his own -- If you look no further than the latest headlines , you might think a worldwide flu pandemic was already underway with a very real threat to millions of lives . While there are many unanswered questions early on in the outbreak of flu from Mexico , it is crucial to remember that the number of deaths and reported infections remain small -- even if its spread across the globe has proved worryingly rapid . While the infected need access to medical care and anti-viral drugs , the rest of the world needs an inoculation against scary statistics and misinformation . The Internet Age allows facts and rumor to spread almost instantaneously . But knowing of outbreaks across the globe must not be confused with risks of catching the disease . Already in this outbreak , Lebanon 's health minister has called for a halt to the national custom of greeting one another with kisses . Several countries including Russia and China have banned pork imports from Mexico and parts of the United States in the belief that meat could spread the flu . So far , up to 149 are reported to have died of swine flu in Mexico . The World Health Organisation has upgraded the level of pandemic threat to four on a scale of six -- sustained human-to-human transmission . Stage five signals an `` imminent '' pandemic . However , influenza is a big killer every year , with or without a pandemic . WHO estimates flu kills upward of 250,000 to 500,000 people year after year . `` Normal '' flu epidemics infect 3 to 5 million a year . Statistics are complicated by inconsistent reporting . Flu often leads to other ailments that end up being listed as the ultimate cause of death . Flu 's typical victims are the elderly , the infirm or the young . The difference with swine flu outbreak in Mexico is that otherwise healthy adults aged 20-50 are vulnerable . But so far the new swine flu death rates are lower than other recent pandemic scares , a report by Barclays Capital notes . The 2,200 swine flu infections reported have resulted in deaths in 7 percent of cases . Avian flu has killed 61 percent of the 421 people infected since 1997 . The death rate from SARS was around 10 percent . Outside Mexico , 50 infections have been reported in the United States , Canada , Israel , New Zealand , Spain and Scotland . But health experts are baffled that infections outside Mexico appear to be milder and have caused no deaths . The world 's most recent flu pandemic 41 years ago was the 1968 Hong Kong outbreak , which claimed one million lives . Historically , pandemics occur about three times a century . But like predictions of the next big earthquake , medical experts profess they have no idea when to expect the next pandemic . Inevitably , comparisons end up turning back to the Spanish Flu of 1918-1920 , which killed more than 50 million people , or 2.5 percent of the world 's population . That scourge followed the massive troop movements of World War One at a time of poor communications and before the invention of penicillin and modern healthcare systems . Post-war censorship rules restricted access to news , which limited the ability of communities to make informed decisions to protect themselves against the spread of the flu . The descent into a global pandemic is not inevitable . Air travel may spread the disease in its early stages , but modern communications and medicine can arm us to respond quickly as the disease evolves . The media must stop scaring people with numbers that in the big picture are meaningless . Thank you Eric for putting some sanity to this . Finally , a journalist not succumbing to hysteria over this swine flu business . Thank you very much , sir , for an intelligent analysis of this viral outbreak . A shame other practitioners of the ` media art ' still believe that ` If it bleeds , it leads ' . It is to early to declare a death rate of the swine flu . The 7 procent you state is based on uncertain information from mexico . WHO says only 7 deaths are confirmed to be caused by H1N1 , or swine flu . The statistics are also based on the number of reported cases who are hospitilaised . The real number of infected could be alot higher in mexico , if you count people who havent sought medical treatment . This would dramaticaly lower the death rate . My point is that you are basing this percentage on really bad statistics . @ '' That scourge followed the massive troop movements of World War One at a time of poor communications and before the invention of penicillin and modern healthcare systems . '' What does penicillin have to do with viral influenza ?? Do you wanted to say that now we are safer because we have antibiotics ? Would be quite monumental ignorance . Es correcto el enfoque de analizar la informaci n de manera m s objetiva . Es necesario estar prevenidos contra la falta de tica de los medios que propagan informaci n del todo inexacta . Ojal se profundice m s en ese aspecto . If the rest of the media would refrain from using attention grabbing headlines and statistics , our lives would be much more free from media induced stress . We 've been talking amongst ourselves at work about just how much hype their is in this story -- you 'd think we were experiencing the 1918 Spanish Flu outbreak all over again ... The difference between swine flu and SARs was how the virus was spread . Swine flu affects many more people more rapidly . Suppose you have an attack rate of just 10 % and a case fatality rate of 1 % -LRB- significantly lower than the 7 % cited by Eric and this is possible if the denominator in Mexico 's numbers are much lower than estimated -RRB- in metropolitan area of 20m people . 2m will fall ill and 20,000 will die in that city alone . Lets not be too flippant about this . The worry concerning viruses that transfer from farm grown animals to humans and then from human to human has been greatly ignored by the media , in spite of warnings from public health officials for years that a terrible pandemic was not only possible , but inevitable . If anything , due to politics , governments around the world are being too conservative in dealing with this outbreak . When it comes to statistics it way too early to make any judgement about the percentage of deaths . People need to take this seriously and do the one thing that is most protctive and wash their hands every chance they get , at least for 25 to 50 seconds -LRB- try counting some time this is much longer than you think -RRB- . While labled Swine Flu , this is a hybrid containing DNA from Avian Flu , but is aparently easily transmitable between humans . To try to say this is just another Flu bug is less than factual . Personaly I would take this out break seriously . An ignorant analysis predicated on the two mistaken beliefs that 7 % is a low mortality rate and that waiting until the problem is obviously a serious problem , as indicated by the number of cases , is a safe plan . The mortality rate in the 1918 flu pandemic was 2 % . Multiply that by 50 million and see what you get . SARS and Avian influenza have thousands only or less . The growth rate in an influenza epiemic is exponential . Once you have lots of cases in your community you are guaranteed thousands of cases very soon . Do the math , read some history , read something about epidemic influenza , and learn . Sorry , but unknowns are scary . We do n't know about a lot of things in this : the source , infection rates , death rates , even mutation rates . Even your estimates amount to random guesses based on too-little information . Young , otherwise health people are dying in Mexico from a new and poorly-defined virus . Comparing it to seasonal flu deaths is unfair because those deaths are usually the `` otherwise vulnerable . '' It 's sad , but we 're used to this . We 're not used to thinking that WE could die from being sneezed on . That 's scary stuff . That 's good cause for reasonable concern . Then , factor in the unreasonable reactions that are bound to come up . Politicians that want to be re-elected by unreasonable constituents are , without any doubt , going to be pressured into making unreasonable decisions . Then , factor in the opportunistic reactions , like using any old excuse that comes along to protect against imports competing with local producers . There 's bound to be a lot of that . A lot of stuff is going to happen the next while and little of it will be good . Most of it will be human-caused nonsense , but that 's just the way it is . I do n't see how blaming the media will make any difference . If they did n't report every little tidbit of information , updated hourly , with detailed comparisons to every other epidemic that ever happened , then the bloggers would do it for them . People will be as afraid as they want to be , and potentially-deadly unknowns are scary . ... and with the seemingly omni-present 24\\/7 media coverage of Iraq , the US Presidency and `` the economy '' losing its collective luster , unfortunately `` the media '' has a new focal point -- and it includes the easiest and most dangerous words that can be woven into journalism : `` could '' and `` might . '' If we removed those words alone from the average daily newscast there would be a lot of `` dead air '' to fill ! Jim -- most flu is a blend . This is a new blend , but nothing ` special ' . It happens to be H1N1 , which is the same as the ` Spanish Flu ' of 1918 , and deaths in the 20-50 age group is particularly unusual -LRB- similar , in fact , to the 1918 flu -RRB- . But Eric 's main argument is completely sound . The numbers are way too low to draw any conclusions from since the ` error bar ' is huge . This flu is essentially ` contained ' at the moment , since we 're not seeing infections doubling every day . `` The numbers are way too low to draw any conclusions from since the error bar is huge . This flu is essentially contained at the moment , since we re not seeing infections doubling every day . '' You say the error bar is huge , then you go on to rely on the erroneous information to decide infections are not doubling . You have no idea how many infections there are ! No one does right now . It can take 1-4 days to identify this virus in a single patient . There are tens of millions of poor people in Mexico with no real health care . As for this editorial-it is so lacking in scientific merit that I question Rueters judgment . To say that the number of deaths is not so worrying because the number of total cases is probably much higher-how do you know there are not now or soon many more deaths ? And to think that our health care system will be any help , how absurd . It would be utterly overwhelmed by the first hundred thousand-the hospitals are already full ! What killed millions of people during the Spanish Flu was lack of care . Their loved ones were sick or dead , and they lay in bed , dehydrated and drowning as their lungs filled with fluid . Do more research , talk to a virologist ! And as for the penicillin , whilst not effective against viral flu , it will do the business against the opportunistic bacterial infections which are often the killer complications of flu itself . I suggest you look at the update WHO report as of yesterday . 7 confirmed deaths all in Mexico . Not in the hundreds . It is after all flu season and now anyone with a sniffle will panic just a quick question ; in your article you mention that the 1918 to 1920 flu pandemic was set against the backdrop of a world without penicillin . How is the development of antibiotics relevant to a viral infection for which they are useless against ? I think there 's a difference in HOW it 's affecting people . It isnt affecting the elderly alone , it 's affecting ALL ages , whereas the flu we are used to , affects the elderly and at risks and those are the ones that are dying more readily . But that isnt the case with the swine flu . It 's affecting & killing all ages\\/risk groups . And the vaccine TwinFlu or whatever -- they are only going to give it to the elderly and at risk ones . What about the rest of us ?!?!?! I 've seen this all before in 1977 when we lined up to get our `` swine flu '' shot in the Air Force . Now , like then , we have no idea if it 's `` the big one '' or not . Use common sense and do n't buy the hype . I agree with the notion that the media spreads information that , occasionally , tends to be false and that , due to the internet age , this information gets to Americans at a rapid pace . However , I do have a problem with your argument that is accompanied by statistics . First , you argue that this specific flu is getting out of control , basically , because of the media and that past flu 's have actually taken more lives and have a much greater percent of deaths . I am unable to see the parallel when you say `` Avian flu has killed 61 percent of the 421 people infected since 1997 . The death rate from SARS was around 10 percent . '' These are to purport that the deaths are incomparible and , thus , the swine flu is not as bad as others and should be seen this way . But , these cases of the swine flu have occured within a one week , perhaps less or more , period of time , where the Avian flu has 421 people infected -LRB- a lesser number -RRB- , from 12 years ago and counting . These numbers are hardly comparible . - What do I do if I suspect I have swine flu ? Become a recluse until your symptoms disappear . Stay home , rest and drink lots of fluids . - What should I do if I get sick ? If you live in areas where swine influenza cases have been identified and become ill with influenza-like symptoms , including fever , body aches , runny nose , sore throat , nausea , or vomiting or diarrhea , you may want to contact their health care provider , particularly if you are worried about your symptoms . Your health care provider will determine whether influenza testing or treatment is needed . If you are sick , you should stay home and avoid contact with other people as much as possible to keep from spreading your illness to others . Here is a news paper article and info from the CDC web site . Basically if you are an adult in good health your going to have the flu . If you are very old or very young or have a bad immune system you will get the flu which whether it is swine or any other type it is a serious risk to your life and you need to get medical attention fast . If you are a healthy adult you have little more to worrie about wxcept catching the damn flu . Since the majority of cases will not be reported due to mild cases the odds are you will most likely to pick this up in the office or from you school kids . Drink lots of non-dairy fluids -LRB- cranberry juice and ginger ale are the best mixing them is n't bad either or green or black tea and hot toddies are great -RRB- Take vitamins B & C 50mg of zinc three times a day for three days Colloidal Silver use as directed based upon concentration . Colloidal silver is a catalyst , disabling the particular enzyme that all one celled bacteria , funguses and viruses , use for their oxygen metabolism they suffocate . Resistant strains fail to develop , and the body does not develop a tolerance . Yet it is of no harm to human enzymes or any part of the human body chemistry Lastly make sure you eat chicken soup . Chicken Soup for Colds and Flu 1 bunch of parsley stems The washed green tops of two leeks Put in medium large stock pot , cover with water-2 above chicken , bring to a boil , reduce to simmer and let simmer for 5 hours -LRB- overnight is ok as long as it is a low simmer -RRB- . Strain broth and de-bone chicken . Allow broth to cool in refrigerator then remove the fat Add of the chicken back to the broth . Chop : celery and leek bottoms , peeled carrots , turnip and parsnip and add to pot One cup of chopped parsley leaves and adds to pot Add cup of frozen peas Bring to boil then turn down to simmer for 1.5 hours . Take two large bowls daily . The other half of chicken can be used for a number of dishes or made into chicken salad . Is it true that in the ' 70 ? s the vaccine for the swine flu actually killed\\/injured more people than the disease itself ? Toddlers in Mexico get this flu and survive . A toddler in the US gets the flu and dies . Maybe the difference is how the US medical system treats the flu ?? I don t know how the US toddler was treated , but maybe it s better to not give too much Tylenol and allow the fever to run its course . Fever has been shown to have a protective effect . I 'm sorry , but this is just lame . You fulminate about statistics but obviously lack medical insight . There is just no way you can stop this pandemic if it will turn out to be a pandemic flu strain . The 1918 era should have given you that insight . You are right about one thing ; we simply have no clue how to estimate the odds of this becoming a pandemic . Somehow this bears resemblance to the financial crisis we are in . Estimating odds or chances is more difficult than a statistician will admit , please be brave enough to admit that and choose your words more carefully in the future , please . Hopefully this will just blow over , but maybe it will not and if not -- this might be a show stopper ... This is blown way out of proportion , this happened in 1976 while an American economy was attempting to recover from gas crises . In 1976 , 200 million inoculations were purchased by the US government for a swine flu which never came to fruition , the result ? Millions of dollars of revenue gained by Big-Pharm to arm us for a battle that never was . Panic leads to confusion , and when you have a bunch of confused , scared people , the one who screams the loudest is touted as a savior . OK , One question here : Who the heck is Eric Auchard ? Sorry , sir , but all you seem to be doing is trotting out a bunch of statistics without any context -- I guess sometimes you become what you ridicule , eh ? The fact is , we \\* do n't \\* know where we will be with this issue in a week , a month , a year . Yes , there is some hype out there . But this `` do n't worry , be happy '' BS is every bit as irresponsible , if not more so . To state that `` ... modern communications and medicine can arm us to respond quickly as the disease evolves '' is , pardon the pun , hogwash . Medical systems worldwide -LRB- big example being right here in the United States -RRB- are pushed to the limit as is ; it would take months to get a vaccine developed in meaningful numbers , and ramping up the production of antivirals will take a long time as well . Yeah , they might all be wrong and I sure hope they are . But , thank you very much , I prefer to get my info from sources like the U.S. CDC and the WHO -- who incidentally upped their pandemic alert level about a half hour ago -- than from some self-appointed gatekeeper and guardian of the public trust such as Eric Auchard , whoever he may be . Let the boarders be wide open and let 's fear monger some more : `` American officials reported the first swine flu fatality outside Mexico today , ... . although it later emerged that the 23-month-old baby girl who died in Texas was a Mexican who had been taken to the United States for treatment '' . This is a good time to dampen the fear by handing out ineffetctive face masks . This was an imminent pandemic a week ago . I do not understand , being a medical professional myself , why they are not advising the use of N95 masks with air tight goggles along with the ` mom 's good advice of wash your hands '' . Well , I have an idea . We do n't have enough medical grade masks . We do n't have enough Tamiflu . After giving out Tamiflu to the medical people who need and deserve it , how many doses will be left for the public . We are poorly prepared for this , and I think that the CDC and WHO feels this will run its course . They can not predict the damage , but as the writer says , if it is 7 % that is huge ! We do not have enough respirators for the severely ill . An ounce of prevention , using N95 masks , which , BTW are very hard to get now , and goggles , with relative social isolation , and hand washing is good . N95 masks can be made to last longer by putting useless surgical masks over them . Keep in mind N95masks , are called ` respirators ' , and yes , they will help . Putting a surgical mask over your N95 will extend the use of your N95 if you can still get one . People , people , do n't be too cool to wear a mask ! And , unfortunately do n't rely on your government to hand you an N95 ! They are not giving out the useless surgical masks that Mexico gave out in an act of desperation . I do not expect 7 % mortality , however even 3 % is high . Seasonal flu kills many , most of them octogenarians or the already very ill . H1N1-this avian-swine-human mutation is dangerous . Seldom in history have populations exposed to a never before seen organism faired well , look at measles , and small pox in the Native Americans . Americans should know by now , we are not the ` golden child ' we may have seen ourselves as . This disease can spread 7 days prior to the victim knowing they are ill and 7 days while they are ill . If you want to go thru this just exposing yourself and your kids and simply washing your hands , before you heed that advice , ask the physician or official telling you that , how many packs of Tamiflu and N95 or higher rated masks they have at home . I find it hilarious when people use as an argument that ` health officials have been saying that a pandemic is inevitable ' ... Does that mean because someone dies 4000kms away that I should just accept that my fate is to roll over and die from a runny nose ? And forgive me , but I 've been to Mexico City -- it is easily the most polluted and disgusting slum in the world so the term ` otherwise healthy adults ' in that berg does n't mean the same thing to me as that statement regarding someone from Vancouver or Geneva . I 'd also like to say this : 5 years ago no one had ever heard the word pandemic , much like 2 years ago no one had a clue what a sub-prime mortgage was . The media in America is essentially gov ' t controlled , and all this crap being spewed is propoganda to keep the public afraid . Just like Islamic terrorism in America -- two attacks in 10 years and you 're all so anxious and panicked that you 've given away your human rights and those of visitors to your country . In the Middle East and Afghan there are attacks EVERY DAY ! and I 'd argue they have more day-to-day freedoms than Americans now -LRB- well , not in Afghan -- that place is an unthinkable disaster . -RRB- Do n't buy the hype -- just wash your bloody hands and throw away used tissue instead of stuffing it back in your pockets . And hey , try to exercise a bit too and not eat grease burgers . The toddler that died in Texas was from Mexico . `` two attacks in 10 years and you re all so anxious and panicked that you ve given away your human rights and those of visitors to your country '' -- Might be true about human rights but you can jump off a bridge if you think 3000 dead because of some nut job is small . Personally you should have been here to watch what happened . And yes people are over reacting to the flu , but not much you can do when the world is run based on emotion . Honestly its just hard to tell what can happen after a week . im just so angry that mexico didnt or couldnt do anything sooner to stop those sick pigs spreading there flu . Common sense needs to prevail here . Statistically and historically speaking , a minimal number of people have died from this flu virus but this does n't stop the whole world going into panic mode . Would n't it be great if the WHO and global governments put as much effort into stamping out HIV AIDS and all the other ills of this world , like famine , malaria , TB and deaths from internecine strife -- just for starters ? Is birsen smith for real ? Marty , yes it is true ! do I think it would be wise to line up for a flu shot if they come out with one for this flu strain ? No , as long as you are a healthy individual . If you are one of those at risk then if I was you I would be camped out to get a good spot in that line . This is the flu folks . The flu kills people every year . This may be a little more nasty strain but , if you are a health individual you should not have to worry . Stay healthy by exersice and eating right . Wash your hands and stay away from sick people . If you get it , I mentioned a few tips for helping make it through the illness . If you are one of those at risk then you need to think about anti-virials and aggressive medical care . There are lies there big lies and there is statistic . You do statistic wrong ! Check your initial data in US alone 25,000,000-50 ,000,000 with 36,000 deaths . That give ~ 0.1 % mortality rate . `` WHO estimates flu kills upward of 250,000 to 500,000 people year after year . `` Normal '' flu epidemics infect 3 to 5 million a year . '' That gives us 10 % mortality rate ! Worse than SARS 8300 cases and 750 deaths 9.5 % rate . There are lies , there are big lies and there is statistic . `` A vaccine needed for bad statistics '' !!! . Most likely you mistaken number of flu related hospitalizations with total flu case count . in US alone 25,000,000-50 ,000,000 cases with 36,000 deaths . That give ~ 0.1 % mortality rate . `` WHO estimates flu kills upward of 250,000 to 500,000 people year after year . `` Normal '' flu epidemics infect 3 to 5 million a year . '' That gives us 10 % mortality rate ! Worse than SARS 8300 cases and 750 deaths 9.5 % rate . '' Maybe the difference is how the US medical system treats the flu ?? '' No ... the toddler was from Mexico and was coming to the US to be treated . Be careful with the 170 + deaths figure . The WHO says only 9 deaths are confirmed . The posting is good and the points made valid . However , in a posting about incorrect use of statistics , it would have helped if the stats provided were correct . The 1918 `` Spanish Flu '' outbreak had a Case Fatality Rate -LRB- CFR -RRB- estimated to be 2.5 % -5.0 % . That means that 2.5 % -5.0 % OF THOSE INFECTED died . A very different thing than 2.5 % of the global population dying . I 'm an RN in the Central Texas area , an agency traveling nurse working in many area emergency rooms and reading a host of information from CDC , WHO , and popular media . Two things are clear , hype Sells and improves ratings , and people panic . Were n't we all supposed to die ? Disappeared , as does all other media related panic ... unless or until I hear it directly from a truly reliable source , common sense rules . Hand washing and remain calm . Unfortunately , panic will rule the day because as they say `` there is NO CURE for stupid '' . Next year we will be asking each other whatever happened to swine flu . Please just exercise common sense and turn your bs filters on in regard to media hype in print or on tv . Because the medical community is literally on the `` front lines '' we generally receive pertinent information before it is released to the media . A LOT of creativity exists between our information and what you hear or read . I agree that a vaccine is for bad statistics and irresponsible media . Eric , I think you are trivialising the risk from Swine Flu -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- . Your article mentions the Spanish Flu -LRB- also H1N1 -RRB- killing more than 50 million people in 1918 . What you fail to mention is the mortality rate from the Spanish Flu also started slow , just like the 2009 Swine Flu -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- & it was the deadly second wave of the virus that hit in the Fall\\/Winter that killed most people . You need to read Flu Safe -- Surviving the Pandemic by Dr. Wayman -LRB- www.flusafe.org -RRB- . Some mathematical models are suggesting the POSSIBILITY of more than 100 million people will die from Swine Flu 2009 . That is why Dr. Margaret Chan , the head of the World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- , is saying `` all of humanity is under threat '' . This is n't about saving lives -- this is about economics . What a better way for Governments to deflect attention from the GFC than to create something even more scary to think about -- in doing so our perspective is changed and we become grateful for what we have got not what we might get ! . `` I thought I was poor because I had no shoes , and then I met a man who had no feet '' Not many statisticians are currently getting worked up and hysterical about the swine flu .

Determining the impact of cold , heat , dryness and humidity on the H1N1 strain -- which has killed up to 149 people in Mexico and had milder effects elsewhere -- could illuminate the countries and regions most vulnerable to infection . Climate information may also provide clues into whether the virus is likely to return year after year on a seasonal basis . Following are details about seasonality of regular flu , and the weather and other factors affecting its patterns , according to data from the World Health Organization , World Meteorological Organization , and leading scientists : Flu incidence peaks in the winter season in temperate parts of the world , generally described as areas outside the tropics . Cold and dry conditions help the virus survive outside the body , meaning that droplet particles take longer to evaporate and remain airborne for more extended periods in winter . Influenza outbreaks do occur in the tropics , though less frequently than in areas with less heat and humidity , and without the seasonality seen in areas with wintry weather . Poor laboratory and health data , especially from Africa and Latin America , have made it difficult for international experts to track viral transmission in tropical regions . School cycles have also been shown to affect the seasonality of flu . Winter school breaks tend to reduce flu transmission to children by as much as 25 percent , mainly because they provide fewer opportunities for the virus to spread among large groups . The precise strain of virus circulating , which can change from flu season to flu season , can also affect how virulent it is and how many people may fall ill in a given outbreak . The levels of immunity in the population , vaccination programs , hygiene practices and other practices also play a role .

TAIPEI | Tue Apr 28 , 2009 6:06 am BST TAIPEI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Global airlines could face an even bumpier landing than during the 2003 SARS crisis if a new swine flu outbreak becomes a pandemic , hitting an industry that is already reeling from the global economic downturn . Airline stocks in Asia continued a sell-off on Tuesday on concerns about the outbreak that began in Mexico , with Cathay Pacific -LRB- 0293 . HK -RRB- falling 1.7 percent in Hong Kong after dropping 8 percent the previous day . In Taiwan , China Airlines -LRB- 2610 . TW -RRB- and Eva Airways -LRB- 2618 . TW -RRB- fell 4 percent and 7 percent , respectively , after dropping 7 percent in the previous session in one of the markets hardest hit by the SARS outbreak six years ago . `` Airlines are already in a weakened position with the global crisis sapping demand for corporate travel , '' said Stone Lin , an airline analyst at Yuanta Securities in Taiwan . `` The summer months of July-September are typically the peak season for most airlines , with most bookings beginning right now . With sentiment so weak , and worsened by the swine flu issue , it 's unlikely anyone is going to go rushing to book holidays or corporate travel , which means the second half of this year wo n't be pretty for most airlines , '' he said . The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome -LRB- SARS -RRB- in 2003 , centred in Asia , provides a chilling example of what could happen if swine flu follows a similar course . During the SARS outbreak , which began in China and quickly spread to Hong Kong , Taiwan and Singapore , global airline traffic halved . Airline stocks responded in kind , with carriers such as Cathay , Japan Airlines 9205 . T and Korean Airlines -LRB- 003490 . KS -RRB- tumbling 25 percent or more . Ratings agency Standard & Poor 's also warned of potential disruption to the airline industry depending on how the current outbreak unfolds . `` Though swine flu has not yet caused health problems on a similar scale , we believe airlines are at risk of suffering reduced traffic because of government-imposed quarantines and travellers ' fears , '' S&P credit analyst Philip Baggaley said in a note . A spokeswoman for Cathay Pacific declined to comment on how the crisis might impact earnings , but said the airline was reminding colleagues to monitor the situation . Most analysts said it was still too early to say how big the risk could be to airlines . `` The overall situation is weaker now ... because there are two headwinds the airline industry is facing : one is the global recession and now this outbreak of swine flu , '' said Daphne Roth , analyst at ABN Amro private bank . But she added the current situation is also different from SARS as information about the illness was coming out in a much more timely and transparent manner . A swine flu crisis could have less impact on Asian airlines than SARS since it originated and is currently concentrated in North America , said Viwat Techapoonphol , strategist at Tisco Securities . `` The SARS outbreak was here in Asia and badly hit the tourism industry at that time because governments worldwide issued warnings to avoid coming to Asia . This time round , swine flu is far away in Mexico and , relatively , the impact to Asia should be smaller than with SARS , '' he said .

She 's going to be immediately briefed on the issues that we 're working on right now , '' he said after the ceremony , which was conducted by the executive clerk of the White House with the president holding the Bible on which she took the oath . After the swearing-in , Sebelius immediately went into a briefing on the flu situation with Obama 's Homeland Security adviser John Brennan , White House spokesman Reid Cherlin said . The Senate confirmed Sebelius as health secretary in a 65-31 vote earlier in the day , filling a crucial spot in Obama 's cabinet amid growing fears of a possible swine flu pandemic . The Senate brushed back Republican opposition to her nomination because of her support for abortion rights . Sebelius was tapped by Obama to lead his push to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system . But she takes office as U.S. health officials rush to prepare for a possible widespread outbreak of a new strain of flu that has killed scores of people in Mexico and sickened at least 64 in the United States . The confirmation of Sebelius allows Obama to fill the last open seat in his cabinet . Democrats said the swine flu outbreak made it all the more important to end the delay in filling that pivotal position . `` It is essential for the health of the nation , that president Obama has in place and the nation has in place , a strong secretary of health and human services to make sure that our federal efforts on this potential pandemic are ably coordinated , '' said Democratic Senator Mark Warner . The Sebelius nomination had been delayed by Republicans opposed to her support for abortion rights and a failure to initially report the full extent of her campaign contributions from a doctor who performs abortions . Sebelius , a former insurance commissioner , will lead Obama 's push to enact by the end of this year an overhaul of the $ 2.5 trillion U.S. healthcare industry , one of the main political goals of his administration . -LRB- Reporting by David Alexander and Donna Smith , editing by Todd Eastham and Vicki Allen -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "525", "dct": "2009-04-28", "dates": ["2009-04-28", "2009-04-28", "2009-04-28"], "text": "LONDON | Tue Apr 28 , 2009 9:03 pm BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Testing whether a person has swine flu is not easy and it can take days to confirm that suspected cases are actually caused by the virus , a health expert said on Tuesday . The World Health Organization has confirmed 79 cases of a virus it said has spread from Mexico -- where it has killed up to 149 people -- into the United States , Canada , New Zealand and Europe , raising fears of a pandemic . But officials suspect more than 1,600 people may have the infection -- a disparity explained in part because there is no quick test , said Andrew Easton , a virologist at the University of Warwick in Britain . `` Many countries now will have several labs to carry this out , '' he told Reuters in a telephone interview . `` You ca n't do this in the field . '' WHO officials only report cases that have been confirmed by their own staffers , in their own labs , at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and a few other places . Mexico , for instance , ships samples to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta or Winnipeg in Canada for testing . While testing for seasonal flu is relatively simple , doing the same for H1N1 is far more complicated and none of the three techniques are widely available . One way to confirm swine flu is with a test that involves growing a virus culture in a lab and then sequencing its genetic material . Testing increases of antibodies and a technique called real-time PCR are the other approaches . The PCR technique -- which researcher Easton called the most efficient -- uses a device to amplify copies of genes so researchers can easily compare a sample taken from a sick person to the genetic material of the potentially pandemic infection . `` You start with a small number of copies of the virus genes and the technique multiplies them up in a test tube to give them many hundreds of thousands of copies of the virus genes which are easy to measure , '' Easton said . The first step for doctors and health officials is often collecting a sample at a local clinic or hospital and then sending it on to a more well-equipped lab for analysis . This can produce some of the biggest delays . Next researchers must purify the sample to get rid of natural compounds that may interfere with a reading -- something that also takes time , Easton said . `` Once you know the genetic makeup of the virus , the machine can tell whether the -LRB- genetic -RRB- sequence is that of the suspected infection , '' Easton said . `` If everything was optimized and there were plenty of people around to handle the result you could easily get a result that day . '' The PCR device itself can within a few hours compare the genetic makeup of the sample with that of a pandemic virus , Easton said . But a challenge for researchers is designing a test that health officials can conduct in the field , he added . `` It is technology that is stopping us from doing that at the moment , '' Easton said . -LRB- Reporting by Michael Kahn ; Editing by Maggie Fox -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "653", "dct": "2009-04-28", "dates": ["2009-04-28", "2009-04-28"], "text": "WASHINGTON | Tue Apr 28 , 2009 6:32 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - What 's in a name ?

But the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- said it would only call for large-scale production of such a pandemic vaccine if it strongly believed the world was on the edge of an unstoppable global outbreak of flu . Switzerland 's Novartis AG said on Tuesday it had received the genetic code of the new virus strain , enabling it to start work on evaluating production , and it hoped to receive the actual virus in its laboratories `` in the near future . '' Still , it is likely to take between five and six months before a vaccine is commercially available , according to the The delay is not for want of trying . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has already taken a sample of the H1N1 virus causing the disease , produced a vaccine virus strain and is growing it up , marking the first stage of the production process . These samples , which can then be distributed to companies , must be grown in specially produced chicken eggs in a cumbersome system that experts agree is outdated . New and more efficient technologies based on cell cultures are , however , still a few years away . While the race is on to prepare a pandemic vaccine , health authorities and companies still have to make the tricky decision of when , or indeed whether , to switch capacity from producing seasonal vaccines to making the new shot . `` If you go to pandemic flu production , people wo n't get normal flu shots -- it is a huge consideration , '' said WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl . At least 20 companies , in addition to Novartis , make flu vaccines , including Sanofi-Aventis , GlaxoSmithKline , Baxter International , Australia 's CSL and nasal spray maker MedImmune , now part of AstraZeneca . They are currently geared to producing season flu shots , which vaccine specialists say will not stop the new form of swine flu spreading around the world , although people who have been immunized may end up with milder symptoms . So-called swine flu is a variant of the H1N1 form of the human influenza virus , but tests show the H1N1 component of the current seasonal flu vaccine does not protect against the new strain . A big challenge facing manufacturers will be making sufficient quantities of vaccine from a limited supply of active ingredient , or antigen . One option to extend supply is to use an additive , known as an adjuvant , to increase the body 's immune response and reduce the amount of antigen needed in each shot . Several companies are working on this approach . Glaxo , in particular , said it believed its novel adjuvant technology could make a significant contribution to antigen sparing . The British company previously developed a vaccine against the H5N1 strain of bird flu -- originally thought to pose the biggest pandemic threat -- using a special adjuvant that allowed an extremely low dose of active ingredient to be used . Credit Suisse analysts said companies with the know-how to make pandemic flu vaccines stood to benefit from additional sales , adding there could also be an increase in seasonal flu vaccine demand as disease awareness increases .

The WHO raised its pandemic alert level for the swine flu virus to phase 4 , indicating a significantly increased risk of a pandemic , a global outbreak of a serious disease . The last such outbreak , a `` Hong Kong '' flu pandemic in 1968 , killed about 1 million people . Although the new flu strain has so far killed people only in Mexico , there were more than 40 confirmed cases in the United States , including 20 at a New York City school where eight cases were already identified . In Mexico City , fearful Christians paraded a centuries-old statue of Jesus , believed to protect against disease , through the streets for the first time in more than a century . The swine flu is not caught from eating pig meat products , but several countries imposed import bans on pork from the United States . Stocks in companies such as airlines were also hit as investors worried about the impact on travel . Spain became the first country in Europe to confirm a case of swine flu when a man who returned from a trip to Mexico last week was found to have the virus . Texas health authorities confirmed a third case of swine flu at a school near the Mexican border and California said it now had 11 confirmed cases . The U.S. State Department and the European Union urged citizens to avoid non-essential travel Mexico and other areas affected by swine flu . Mexico relies on tourism as its third biggest source of foreign currency and millions of Americans travel there every year . Mexican Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova said the outbreak was now suspected of having killed 149 people and warned the number of cases would keep rising . Thirty-three million Mexican schoolchildren will be off school until the middle of next week as authorities seek to contain the outbreak . Schools in the sprawling capital had already been closed but the government ordered classes canceled across the country until May 6 . Most of the those who died were between 20 and 50 years of age , an ominous sign because a hallmark of past pandemics has been the high rate of fatalities among healthy young adults . Worldwide , seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people in an average year but the new strain worries experts because it spreads rapidly between humans and there is no vaccine for it . Oil prices fell more than 2 percent to close to $ 50 a barrel as investors feared a new blow to an already fragile global economy if trade flows are curbed and manufacturing is hit . The MSCI world equity index fell 0.8 percent and U.S. stocks also slipped . Flu fears hit U.S. airline stocks hard as investors worried that the travel industry would suffer . Shares prices for UAL Corp , the parent of United Airlines , shed 14 percent , while Continental Airlines Inc lost 16 percent . Other travel and leisure stocks such as Hong Kong 's Cathay Pacific Airways and British Airways fell sharply , whereas makers of drugs and vaccines , such as Roche , were higher . But his condition , like that of the cases in the United States and six in Canada , was not serious . Spain had 26 suspected cases under observation , health officials said . A New Zealand teacher and a dozen students who recently traveled to Mexico were being treated as likely mild cases . In the first confirmed cases in Britain , Scotland 's health minister said two people tested positive for swine flu and were being treated under isolation near Glasgow . Suspected cases were also reported in France , Norway , Germany , Sweden and Israel . Large numbers of Mexicans made it to work in the capital despite the flu outbreak . Traffic in the city of 20 million was brisk as workers , many in surgical masks , packed buses . `` I preferred to come by car instead of public transport because I did n't want to be in contact with so many people , '' said 25-year-old graphic designer Andres Beltran .

The health department said it was `` urgently '' investigating how to increase its stockpile of face masks for healthcare workers who would come into contact with infected patients if the outbreak became widespread . But it said it was not advising the general public to wear masks . `` Although we are aware that face masks are being given out to the public in Mexico , the available scientific evidence does not support the general wearing of face masks by those who are not ill whilst going about their normal activities , '' a health department spokesman said .

At a Pentagon briefing earlier in the day , Marine Corps Commandant General James Conway said the ill Marine at Twentynine Palms had not been to Mexico , where as many as 159 deaths have been attributed to the virus . Two other major Marine bases in Southern California , Camp Pendleton and the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar , reported no suspected or confirmed cases of swine flu on Wednesday . In an unrelated case reported by the U.S. military , two 16-year-old boys described as military family members were treated at an Air Force base clinic in Texas last month for what turned out to be swine flu . The American Forces Press Service said those two cases were initially identified as part of the U.S. military 's worldwide influenza screening program . -LRB- Editing by Dan Whitcomb and Peter Cooney -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "353", "dct": "2009-04-29", "dates": ["2009-04-29", "2009-04-29", "2009-04-29"], "text": "\\* 23-month-old child dies in Texas of swine flu \\* Death is first outside Mexico and first in U.S. \\* Official says child was in Houston for treatment By Maggie Fox , Health and Science Editor WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A 23-month-old child has died in Texas from the new H1N1 swine flu , becoming the first death in the United States from the virus , a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official said on Wednesday . A Houston health official said the child was a Mexican who traveled to the city for medical treatment . It is the first death from swine flu reported outside Mexico , the country hardest hit by this influenza outbreak . U.S. officials have confirmed 65 cases of swine flu , most of them mild but with five hospitalizations in California and Texas . `` Unfortunately , this morning I do have to confirm that we have the first death of a child from H1N1 flu virus . And this is in Texas , a 23-month-old child , '' Dr. Richard Besser , acting head of the CDC , told the CBS `` Early Show . '' `` The child came to Houston for medical treatment . The family had traveled to South Texas . The child became ill and they transported the child to Houston for medical care , '' Houston health department spokeswoman Kathy Barton told CNN by telephone . She said she did not know which part of Mexico the child came from . President Barack Obama , speaking at the White House before a one-day visit to Missouri , said the confirmed death underscored the urgency of taking steps against the disease . `` This is obviously a serious situation . Serious enough to take the utmost precautions , '' Obama said , urging state and local authorities to increase their vigilance . `` Every American should know that the federal government is prepared to do whatever is necessary to control the impact of this virus , '' he said . Besser of the CDC had predicted that as they searched for cases , CDC experts would find severe infections and deaths in the United States , even though most of the patients had mild illness . `` As we look , we 're going to find more cases . We 're going to find more severe cases and I expect that we 'll continue to see additional deaths , '' Besser told NBC 's `` Today '' show . He said additional details would be released by Texas authorities . Mexico previously had reported the only deaths -- 159 , based on symptoms and initial tests , with seven deaths so far confirmed by additional laboratory analysis at the World Health Organization . Influenza regularly kills people around the world , with an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 deaths from the seasonal virus every year . Every year at least a few perfectly healthy children die from seasonal influenza in the United States . WHO and CDC officials have been trying to assess just how serious the new H1N1 swine influenza strain is . It has been found globally , with cases across North America , Europe and New Zealand . `` We have about 100 cases outside Mexico , and now you have one death . That is very significant , '' said Lo Wing Lok , an infectious disease expert in Hong Kong . The CDC recommends frequent hand-washing to avoid infection with the new flu virus . It also recommends that people who are sick stay home , cover sneezes and coughs , and avoid unnecessary travel to Mexico until more is known .

Nevermind that the World Health Organization has ruled out any risk of infection to humans from eating pork . Nevermind that the influenza-A virus contains DNA from avian and human as well as swine H1N1 viruses , but unfortunately -LRB- for the pork industry -RRB- has been tagged as `` swine flu '' by global health authorities and therefore by the media . The net result is that , amid the confusion and potential risks of appearing unprepared , at least six countries have decided to panic over pigs , imposing import bans on live pigs and pork products from Mexico and the United States . Indeed , the country with the largest pig population in the world -- China -- is going full-bore on a perceived threat to the domestic pig industry . China 's quaratine authority took immediate action by banning pork imports from Mexico as well as 3 states in the United States , vowing to destroy any pigs that arrived at its borders . On Tuesday , in a meeting hosted by Premier Wen Jiabao , China 's cabinet worked out an 8-point flu prevention strategy , including one to strengthen inspection to detect any outbreaks of swine flu among pigs and to strictly supervise trade of live pigs as well as some pig breeding areas . Why all this attention to pigs ? Agriculture Minister Sun Zhengcai said the possibility of the virus spreading to pigs can not be ruled out , although there was no mention that the avian portion of the virus 's DNA might also lead to an outbreak among poultry . To be fair , screening of people arriving at China 's airports has also been stepped up , though so far no human cases of the flu have been announced in the country . What is clear is that when the world 's most populous nation raises concerns about a staple food in the country 's diet , it most certainly will affect prices . Early signs are that consumers have begun to avoid pork , much to the dismay of breeders and others in the industry . In fact many farmers want to avoid publicity at all costs for fear that any further news coverage even to correct the misimpressions -- will hurt business . The Beijing News on Wednesday reported that pork prices in the capital have dropped significantly . It cited a pig breeder in a Beijing suburb , Li Wei , as saying he worries that consumers might shift to mutton or beef if the `` swine '' flu scare keeps spreading . Two years ago , China 's pork industry was racked by blue ear disease , which decimated pig numbers and caused prices to spike skyward . Since the start of the year , prices have been falling in response to subsidies Beijing offered to replenish supplies . Now they 're dipping faster , this time in part due to government efforts to protect the sector . Hopefully , when we look back , the sudden recent dip in pork prices will turn out to have been the worst of China 's casualties from the global flu scare .

A 23-month-old child died in Texas on Wednesday , becoming the first death from swine flu outside Mexico , where the H1N1 strain raised alarms when it killed young adults who are normally more resilient than babies and the elderly . The virus has caused mainly minor symptoms in countries with confirmed infections outside Mexico , and the outbreak remains tiny in scale compared to other epidemics such as malaria , hepatitis , cholera and meningitis . However , as it continues to spread epidemiologists worry that swine flu could have a devastating impact on people whose immune systems are weak due to the AIDS virus or other diseases . World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- spokesman Gregory Hartl said adults who suffered severe pneumonia and died from the virus in Mexico may in fact have fallen into this category . `` It is a question which a lot of our scientists have been looking at , '' Hartl told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday , when asked why the deaths so far have been clustered in Mexico . `` Maybe people were infected with other illnesses too that made their illness more severe . Maybe they were immunologically suppressed , '' he said . According to WHO estimates , there are 33 million people infected with immune-weakening HIV worldwide , and another 9 million people are diagnosed with tuberculosis every year , a disease that only rears its head when immunity levels are low . If swine flu infiltrates those communities , and takes hold in impoverished and densely-populated areas such as urban slums , where tropical and other diseases are rife , health experts expect the outbreak could quickly become more severe . With health budgets already stretched by the global economic downturn , WHO officials are appealing to governments to keep ensuring HIV and tuberculosis patients get the drugs they need to stay strong , and to improve access to medical care and testing facilities in poor areas . `` Many of the world 's poorest people are particularly vulnerable to lethal airborne diseases , '' said Glenn Thomas , a spokesman for the Stop TB Partnership . `` With health resources already stretched in low income countries , a new disease pandemic could jeopardize effective TB control and other health programs , '' he said . WHO Acting Assistant Director-General Keiji Fukuda stressed that while it is important to keep a close watch on swine flu -- in case it ramps up into a full-blown pandemic -- other epidemics and diseases need continued attention and care . But we are also mindful that even in this kind of situation other urgent health matters and issues do not go away , '' he said .

Veronica Berlusconi , who has publicly lamented her husband 's eye for younger women in the past , also accused him of going to the birthday bash of an 18-year-old woman in Naples but not attending the coming-of-age-parties of his own children . Veronica , 52 , who rarely appears with her husband , said she agreed with Italian newspapers ' descriptions of her husband 's party 's choice of female candidates as `` entertainment for the emperor , '' in what newspapers saw as a reference to him . The latest public clash between the Berlusconis , which dominated mainstream newspaper front pages along with swine flu and Fiat 's rescue of Chrysler , follows a media debate over `` starlets in politics . '' `` Women in Politics -- Veronica 's Wrath , '' was the way La Stampa of Turin put it . In an e-mail to Italian news agency Ansa , she praised politicians such as former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and German Chancellor Angela Merkel and then added : `` But what 's happening today -LRB- in Italy -RRB- behind a front of bodily curves and female beauty is grave . '' She added that it offended all women and particularly those who had fought in the `` frontline '' for women 's equality . Her 72-year-old husband , speaking to reporters during a trip to Warsaw , said he was sorry his wife had apparently believed `` what she read in the papers '' and added that it was all `` a campaign -LRB- against him -RRB- hyped by the leftist press . '' The controversy exploded earlier this week when an on-line magazine close to Berlusconi 's main conservative ally , lower house speaker Gianfranco Fini , criticised how centre-right women candidates were being chosen for the June European elections . That article , seen by some media as a reference to Berlusconi 's party , said women politicians could not be used like `` pieces of costume jewellery '' to attract votes . Berlusconi 's People of Freedom party is considering a number of former actresses and television personalities as possible candidates in the June European election , media reports say . As party leader , he has a powerful voice in who makes the list . `` Some have written that it is all part of entertainment for the emperor . I agree , '' Veronica said . `` What is emerging from newspapers is shamelessly trashy , all in the name of power . '' Berlusconi told reporters in Warsaw it was `` absurd '' that women who speak several languages and have several degrees should consider themselves excluded from politics just because they had been on television or in show business . Veronica Berlusconi also took her husband to task for recently dropping in at the birthday party in Naples of an 18-year-old woman whose father is a political acquaintance . `` That surprised me very much too , '' Veronica said , `` Even because he never came to the 18th birthday parties of his children , even though he was invited . '' Berlusconi has three children with Veronica and two by his first marriage . He has been in hot water with her several times in the past in a very public way . Two years ago , she criticised him for flirting with young starlets at a party . He later issued a syrupy public apology in the press , saying : `` I beg you to forgive me .

Full Article Egypt orders cull of pig herds , U.N. says a mistake CAIRO | Wed Apr 29 , 2009 11:31 pm IST CAIRO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Egypt , hit hard by bird flu , has ordered the slaughter of every pig herd in the country as a precaution against swine flu , a step the United Nations said was a mistake . The H1N1 swine flu virus is spread by people and is not present in Egyptian animals but culling pigs , largely viewed as unclean in Muslim Egypt , could help quell any panic . Twenty six people have died in Egypt from the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus and experts fear any flu pandemic could have a devastating impact in a country where most of the roughly 80 million people live in the densely packed Nile Valley , many in crowded slums in and around Cairo . But the United Nations said the mass cull of up to 400,000 pigs was `` a real mistake '' . `` There is no reason to do that . It 's not a swine influenza , it 's a human influenza , '' said Joseph Domenech , the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation 's chief veterinary officer , told Reuters . He said the FAO had been trying unsuccessfully to reach Egyptian officials . Pigs are mainly raised by Egypt 's Christian minority . In a statement earlier on Wednesday , Health Minister Hatem el-Gabali said : `` It is decided to slaughter all swine herds present in Egypt , starting from today . '' Cabinet spokesman Magdy Rady said Egypt would compensate farmers for their losses . Rady said swine farms in Egypt were in poor condition and constituted a health hazard . `` That 's why people are really getting afraid , '' he told Reuters before the decision was taken . Swine flu has killed up to 159 people in Mexico and one in the United States , and cases have also been reported in Europe as well as in neighbouring Israel . Egypt has not reported any cases , but has stepped up monitoring at airports . Egypt has been harder hit by the H5N1 bird flu virus than any other country outside Asia . Experts have long feared the bird flu virus could mutate into a form that spreads easily among people , sparking a pandemic that could kill millions . Egypt has suffered a surge in human cases of bird flu this month even as the flu season nears an end . Experts say the culling of pigs is unlikely to have an impact on the spread of swine flu if it reaches the country via air travellers . `` I would n't say it is beneficial for swine flu . It would be beneficial for the general hygiene ... Generally speaking , pigs can transmit many other diseases , '' Hussein Gezairy , regional director for the World Health Organization , told journalists . Mona Aly Mehrez , director of the state-run Animal Welfare Research Institute , said Egypt had long wanted to move pigs away from urban centres as a precaution due to the bird flu threat . But Rady said relocation , which would could six months , was not viable and Egypt wanted to remove even a theoretical risk . Experts say that it is technically possible but extremely unlikely that swine flu -- a mix of swine , human and avian flu -- could find a way to combine with H5N1 in Egypt to create yet another flu strain . -LRB- $ 1 = 5.6406 Egyptian pounds -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "478", "dct": "2009-04-29", "dates": ["2009-04-29", "2009-04-29", "2009-04-29"], "text": "CHICAGO | Wed Apr 29 , 2009 10:56 pm BST CHICAGO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Using a new tracking tool , search engine giant Google said on Wednesday it saw a spike in searches for information about flu among people in Mexico last week even before news of the outbreak became widely known . Google said it has put together a flu trends tracking system for Mexico based on the U.S. Google Flu tool launched last fall that is used by U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to figure out where influenza is heating up . It is based on Google 's observation that people who are sick with flu tend to search for the same types of information on the Internet , and these searches can be used to predict where an outbreak may be occurring . `` We have seen evidence in Mexico that Google users also search flu-related topics when they are experiencing flu-related symptoms , '' Jeremy Ginsberg , lead engineer for Flu Trends at Google , said in a telephone briefing . Studies show that between 35 and 40 percent of all visits to the Internet are started by people looking for health information . Ginsberg said the Mexican data have not been cross-checked with years of data on actual flu cases in Mexico like the U.S. flu tracker has , so the data may not be reliable . But he said the company is optimistic that the system , which generates maps based on peaks in flu-related searches , `` may reflect actual flu activity . '' `` We did see a small increase in many parts of Mexico before major news coverage began last week , '' he said . Ginsberg said people search for different things when they are sick -- like the word thermometer -- than they do when they are looking for news about flu outbreaks . Ginsberg said the group has also seen a spike in U.S.-related flu searches that correspond with increases in U.S. cases being reported .

Online searches for the phrase `` swine flu '' during the past week have sent millions of Internet users to Wikipedia , Google and websites of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta , according to online tracking experts . For example , a random Google search on the words `` swine flu '' late on Tuesday yielded about 5.4 million hits . Online traffic to www.cdc.gov jumped 442 percent in the week ending April 26 , and `` we are likely to continue to see an increase in Internet visits to the CDC site over the coming days , '' Hopkins said . Much of the online buzz was propelled by social networking sites , said Susannah Fox , associate director at the Pew Research Center 's Internet & American Life Project . `` Social media create a hive of information , and we are the bees who are dipping into the hives and then going back into the real world with the information that we find , '' she said . `` Some people are really into the hive ... spending a lot of time on Twitter , Facebook and using these social media . '' The new strain of flu has been blamed for as many as 149 deaths in Mexico , while the cases documented in the United States and other countries have been mild by comparison . Still , some experts believe the intensity of media coverage has raised the public 's anxiety level . `` There 's a distinction between obviously keeping our readers and viewers up to date and sensationalizing the story .

Robert Thompson , professor of media and popular culture at Syracuse University in New York , agreed that the media has to balance restraint with the imperative of covering an important story . `` If as many people had swine flu as those that are covering swine flu then it would be a pandemic to reckon with , '' he said . After wall-to-wall flu coverage on Monday , the major U.S. cable networks -- CNN , Fox News Channel and MSNBC -- turned much of their attention on Tuesday to U.S. Senator Arlen Specter 's switch from the Republican to the Democratic Party . `` Cable news channels have a very hard time covering two different stories simultaneously , '' independent media analyst Andrew Tyndall said . MSNBC President Phil Griffin said Monday 's flu coverage was `` event-driven '' by briefings from high-ranking officials , including President Barack Obama , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg . But the networks filled time between news conferences with interviews of public health officials urging people to wash their hands and cover their faces when they sneeze or cough . `` The public health authorities know they have these channels available for getting their message out , '' Tyndall said . `` There 's not much journalism going on . They 're offering carriage to a message that they 're not controlling very much . '' Griffin said news executives are always mindful of the potential for stoking unwarranted public anxiety . Pew Research 's Fox said those following the story are increasingly turning to the Web and seem headed toward informative rather than sensational sites . `` Blogs , Twitter and other social technologies are helping to turn up the volume , but mostly people still get most of their news from mainstream sources , '' she said . -LRB- Editing by Frances Kerry and Eric Beech -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "610", "dct": "2009-04-29", "dates": ["2009-04-29", "2009-04-29", "2009-04-29", "2009-04-29"], "text": "Assistant agrarian technician Katja Meindl looks at some human saliva samples during the analysis for swine flu virus at an institute in Oberschleissheim near Munich , southern Germany , April 29 , 2009 .

Hoping to calm consumers and protect the pork industry , the European Union 's executive Commission is avoiding using `` swine flu '' to refer to the virus that has killed 159 people in Mexico and one in the United States . It prefers to say `` novel flu . '' Pork producers fear the term `` swine flu '' will not only cause consumption to fall but could also give countries an excuse to impose politically-motivated bans on meat imports . `` Not to have a negative effect on our industry , we decided to call it novel flu from now on , '' European Union Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou told reporters in Brussels . `` We know that the consumption of pork is safe ... -LRB- when -RRB- it is cooked , '' reiterating that there have been no cases of the virus being transmitted from pigs to humans . Despite the Commission 's public statements , EU sources said it had sent an internal document in which the term became confused . It referred to `` novel flu '' in English , `` Mexican flu '' in French and `` swine flu '' in German . Even so , EU members Slovenia , Italy and Spain , and veterinary authorities in the Czech Republic , have started avoiding `` swine flu . '' Italian media still use `` swine flu '' but the country 's authorities refer to `` the A\\/H1N1 influenza virus . '' `` What we have is a media pandemic because calling it swine flu just pushes on the accelerator , causing unimaginable harm , '' Italian Agriculture Minister Luca Zaia said on Wednesday . The Czech veterinary authority prefers `` H1N1 '' or `` Mexican flu '' -- the term also used by Belgian authorities -- and the Hungarian government also faces pressure over the name . `` Panic-mongering , rather than the illness , causes a fall in demand -LRB- for pork -RRB- , '' Zoltan Forian , director of agricultural consultancy company Agrar-Europa Kft , told the daily newspaper Magyar Nemzet . Some producers are particularly concerned after Russia banned meat imports from North and South America . Former Cold War foes Washington and Moscow have in the past accused each other of using trade bans for political purposes . U.S. hog prices have fallen because of concerns the virus could weaken economies , slow trade and hurt meat consumption . Richard Bessert , acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States , said `` swine flu '' led to the misapprehension that people can catch the virus from pork . `` That 's not helpful to pork producers . That 's not helpful to people who eat pork . It 's not helpful to people who are wondering , how can they get this infection , '' Bessert said . Israel has its own reasons to oppose use of `` swine flu . '' Under Jewish dietary laws pigs are considered unclean and pork is a forbidden food , although the non-kosher meat is available in some stores in Israel . `` We will call it Mexico flu .

A decision to produce vaccine against H1N1 would not necessarily come at the expense of the seasonal flu vaccine , but we have nothing like the capacity to vaccinate the whole world s population and , as always , the poorest and most vulnerable people will be last in the queue for vaccine . We also are interested in the genomutability -- if that 's the correct term -- of this strain ; quite how much potential does it have to alter as it spreads . The flu virus is unstable and unpredictable . If anyone knows the answer to this question please let me know . However , there is no evidence that the virus will cause more serious disease as it spreads . If anything , disease morbidity is more likely to decrease in the long-term as population-wide -LRB- herd -RRB- immunity increases . I m also getting asked by the news editor whether this is all hype . Someone who can shed light on that would be very useful ! No , it s not all hype . My feeling , based on what we know so far , is that estimates of tens of millions of deaths are hype , but what we might see is a pandemic of relatively mild illness similar to the 1968 pandemic . The 1968 pandemic caused by the H3N2 flu virus is estimated to have caused an excess mortality of around 1 million people ie , equivalent to the mortality of about two annual flu seasons . However , I am definitely not predicting 1 million deaths from H1N1 because there is insufficient evidence on which to base a prediction . I am still looking at why there are deaths in Mexico and not elsewhere . The CDC says there are hospital admissions there and they expect deaths so does this support the iceberg theory that we were only seeing the worst cases reported in Mexico and if there are sufficient cases elsewhere we will see deaths there too . Every year , seasonal flu causes 250000-500000 deaths in vulnerable , and otherwise healthy , people . So it is likely we will see deaths outside Mexico from H1N1 . Indeed , the death of a 23-month-old child in Texas was reported this morning . Many mild cases may have gone unreported in Mexico , which , if this is the case , means that the death rate in Mexico is not as high as it appears to be . I received a flu shot last Nov. . Does that shot contain any benefit against this year 's Swine Flu virus ? Its hard to know who to believe -- one minute we are told its dying down and H1N1 is on the way out then we hear of more and more people with it -- over 1000 in the UK that are being screeded . Why is there not more preventive measures at schools and hospitals and public places ? The only thing I have seen and I have said this before is where a Headmaster brought in a vizexon bio-decontamination team to fog a school to prevent or at least help prevent students from catching the flu -- why dont more schools take this approach ?

Here are some questions and answers about the outbreak : HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED ? HOW MANY ARE INFECTED ? All deaths so far have been in Mexico , where 20 of the 149 reported fatalities have been confirmed to be from the H1N1 swine flu virus . There are 1,600 suspected cases in Mexico and 64 confirmed cases in the United States , and a few cases in Canada , New Zealand , Britain , Spain and Israel . WHY ARE THERE ONLY DEATHS IN MEXICO ? No one is sure . It is important to remember that health officials are now taking a snapshot of the past -- they are not reporting on new infections at this point , just tracking down old infections and they are only finding them where they are looking . The Mexican authorities looked in hospitals , where serious cases will , of course , be found . U.S. health officials found their cases during routine screening of people with flu-like symptoms , most in walk-in clinics , so they have naturally found milder cases . Influenza experts say they fully expect to find deaths in other places , including the United States and elsewhere , as the search goes on . One problem is that people die of respiratory diseases regularly and the cause is often not determined . WHY WOULD IT KILL SOME AND NOT OTHERS ? Seasonal influenza kills 250,000 to 500,000 people every year in a normal year and all sorts of factors determine who dies . Elderly people often die but sometimes perfectly healthy adults and children die . Sometimes flu makes people susceptible to bacterial infections , called secondary infections , and if the virus and the bacteria are circulating at the same time in the same place there can be clusters of deaths . WHAT KIND OF FLU IS IT AND HOW IS IT SPREADING ? The virus is an influenza A virus , carrying the designation H1N1 , but it contains DNA from avian , swine and human H1N1 viruses . It appears to have evolved the ability to pass easily from one person to another , unlike most swine H1N1 viruses which only very occasionally infect people and usually only infect one person and then stop there . Flu viruses are all passed on by sneezing , coughing or when people pick up the virus on their hands . This one likely originated in pigs , but the Mexican government and the World Health Organization have ruled out any risk of infection from eating pork . The Geneva-based WHO has declared the flu a `` public health emergency of international concern '' and raised the threat level for a pandemic , a global epidemic of new disease . H1N1 swine flu poses the biggest risk of a large-scale pandemic since avian flu re-emerged in 2003 , killing 257 out of 421 infected in 15 countries . It is not clear yet whether this virus could actually become a pandemic . HOW IS THIS FLU DIFFERENT FROM ORDINARY FLU ? The swine flu is characterized by common flu symptoms -- sudden fever , muscle aches , sore throat and dry cough -- but may cause more severe vomiting and diarrhea . New flu strains can spread fast because no one has natural immunity and a vaccine can take months to develop . This strain is confusing because it is an H1N1 -- a type that has been around since the 1918 `` Spanish Flu '' pandemic that killed at least 40 million people globally . Usually if a new flu strain is related to one that has been around for years , people have some immunity and they no longer can cause pandemics . But this new strain has taken on genetic elements from animal viruses , and this may be genetically unique enough to pose a pandemic threat . HOW BAD COULD IT GET ? A 1968 a `` Hong Kong '' flu pandemic killed about one million people globally . The 1957-58 pandemic killed about 2 million . The 1918 pandemic killed between 40 million and 100 million , according to some estimates . However , the WHO says the world is now better prepared to withstand a flu pandemic . Vaccines and antiviral drugs are available that were not around during previous pandemics . In 1918 , there was a first wave of mild flu in April . It then seemed to disappear during the Northern Hemisphere 's summer but came back severely in August . WHO and CDC officials say it is possible this virus could behave in the same way , or completely differently . ARE THERE ENOUGH DRUGS AND VACCINES ? Most countries have been stockpiling supplies of two antiviral drugs -- Tamiflu , known generically as oseltamivir and made by Roche AG and Gilead Sciences Inc ; as well as Relenza , known generically as zanamivir and made by GlaxoSmithKline and Australia 's Biota Inc. . A third company , BioCryst Inc. is working to license its experimental flu drug peramivir . Older flu drugs called amantadine and rimantadine do not work very well any longer against any influenza strain except sometimes in combination with newer drugs . There is no vaccine yet against this new strain and health officials say the seasonal flu vaccine is unlikely to provide any protection against it . The CDC and WHO are working with companies to start making a new vaccine if it is needed , but the process takes months . It is proven to be the best way to protect against infection with a range of germs , including flu . Experts generally agree that face masks , especially the surgical masks now seen on the street of Mexico City , offer very little protection . Flu viruses can float on little particles of spit or mucus , in general no further than three to six feet , but they then settle on surfaces and can be transferred to the mouth , eyes or nose . -LRB- Reporting by Maggie Fox , Editing by Anthony Boadle -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "748", "dct": "2009-04-29", "dates": ["2009-04-29", "2009-04-29", "1918-01-01", "1918-01-01", "2009-04-29", "1968-01-01", "2009-04-29", "1969-01-01", "1918-01-01", "2009-04-29"], "text": "By Maggie Fox , Health and Science Editor WASHINGTON | Wed Apr 29 , 2009 7:30 pm BST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The new H1N1 swine flu has spread to nine countries , may have infected more than 2,500 people and killed dozens in Mexico , including a toddler from Mexico visiting Texas who became the first U.S. death . The World Health Organization says it can not be stopped and the best the world can do now is try to mitigate its effects . Although it is not yet a pandemic -- a global epidemic of a new and serious disease -- it could quickly start one . Here are a few ways the situation could develop : This is the worst-case scenario . Every 30-40 years the world suffers an influenza pandemic , with a new strain of flu spreading rapidly , causing serious disease and killing hundreds of thousands of people within a few weeks . The 1918 pandemic is considered the worst-case scenario . At least 40 million people died in 18 months and the epidemics passed over communities in waves . But that was in the pre-antibiotic era , in a time when even simple infections killed people , no mechanical ventilators were available and vaccines were primitive at best . The general population had little idea of how diseases were transmitted . Even so , experts predict a 1918-like flu would keep 40 percent of the workforce out at any time , with people either sick , caring for sick relatives or children out of school , or simply lying low . That would lead to shortages of supplies and even power outages . If this kind of pandemic struck today , millions could die , world trade would slow to a crawl and many economies would crumble . This last happened in 1968 . The H3N2 strain killed an estimated 1 million people . Experts predict that a strain of such virulence today would have less severe effects , with antivirals available that were not on the market 40 years ago . Even with vaccines , drugs and better public education , ordinary seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people every year . The difference with a pandemic strain is that there would not immediately be a vaccine against it and it would likely cause serious disease among broader age groups than the very young , very old and immune-compromised who are generally vulnerable to influenza . There could be disruptions to trade and travel , currency fluctuations , interruptions of supplies needed for manufacturing and a shortage of antivirals and the antibiotics needed to treat the `` co-infections '' that often accompany flu . Some reports predict a shortage of ventilators , and hospitals in many countries , especially the United States , already operate at full capacity and would be overwhelmed by an influx of newly sick people . Everyone is hoping this flu strain will just fizzle out . Influenza is a promiscuous virus , readily swapping genes with other flu viruses in a person 's or animal 's body . It also mutates constantly . Both these factors mean it can quickly grow worse , or become milder . It could at any time lose its ability to transmit easily from one person to another , or could become as mild as regular , seasonal flu . But it would take months to know whether this has happened . Flu strains often disappear over the summer months , re-emerging in late summer or early autumn . The 1918 flu strain did this with a vengeance . For now , the World Health Organization says only that a pandemic is possible . `` It 's probably premature to think of this as a mild pandemic , as a severe pandemic , '' the WHO 's Dr. Keiji Fukuda told a briefing on Wednesday . `` It is very clear that we can not predict what the course of this will be .

Egypt , where pigs are mainly raised by the country 's Christian minority , described the order to slaughter the animals as a precautionary measure in a country hard hit by bird flu . Up to 400,000 pigs could be culled , a cabinet spokesman said . Joseph Domenech , the chief veterinary officer at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation , told Reuters his staff were trying to reach Egyptian authorities to correct any confusion about a virus that has killed humans but not been found in pigs . `` It 's a real mistake . There is no reason to do that . It 's not a swine influenza , it 's a human influenza , '' said Domenech , adding the FAO had been trying to reach Egyptian officials but has so far been unsuccessful . `` There is certainly no support from FAO for that decision . '' The new H1N1 flu strain -- a mixture of swine , human and avian flu viruses -- has killed up to 159 people in Mexico and a 23-month-old boy in the United States . But since no pigs have been found with the disease , groups like the FAO and the Paris-based Organisation for Animal Health -LRB- OIE -RRB- are lobbying for a name change . `` This is one of the results of this strange way of defining the disease as a swine influenza . That 's why the FAO and OIE are fighting to get that name changed because it 's a totally undue focus on swine , '' he said . Egypt , harder hit by the H5N1 bird flu virus than any other country outside Asia , is deeply worried about the effects of another flu virus after extensive damage to its poultry industry and economy . Egypt 's al-Ahram newspaper said owners of culled pigs could receive 1,000 Egyptian pounds -LRB- $ 177 -RRB- per animal in compensation , although an Egyptian cabinet spokesman said the issue was still under discussion .

But she added that the world `` is better prepared for an influenza pandemic than at any time in history . '' Nearly a week after the H1N1 swine flu virus first emerged in California and Texas and was found to have caused dozens of deaths in Mexico , Spain reported the first case in Europe of swine flu in a person who had not been to Mexico , illustrating the danger of person-to-person transmission . Both U.S. and European officials have said they expect to see swine flu deaths . Despite worries that a major flu outbreak could hit the struggling global economy , world stocks rallied on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve said the U.S. recession appeared to be easing . Almost all cases outside Mexico have had mild symptoms , and only a handful have required hospitalization . `` We doubt that the markets will react with the same worry as found during avian flu scares in the past , '' said Citigroup analyst Tobias Levkovich in New York . Chan also urged companies who make the drugs to ramp up production . Two antiviral drugs -- Relenza , made by GlaxoSmithKlin and Tamiflu , made by Roche AG and Gilead Sciences Inc. -- have been shown to work against the H1N1 swine flu strain . Drugmakers have donated millions of doses of their drugs to the WHO . She also alerted governments to be ready to distribute stockpiles of their drugs . Vaccine makers were on standby to begin making a new vaccine if needed . In Mexico , where up to 159 people have died from the virus and around 1,300 more are being tested for infection , people struggled with an emergency that has brought normal life virtually to a standstill over the past week . `` I 'm depressed . I do n't understand where this came from , how it spreads , how long it will last or what it will to the economy , '' said an elderly woman named Licha , sitting on a Mexico City park bench and wearing a surgical mask . Germany and Austria reported cases of the illness , bringing the number of affected countries to 9 . Texas officials said a 22-month-old boy had died -- the first confirmed U.S. swine flu death -- while on a family visit from Mexico . In the Texas border city of Brownsville , where the young Mexican was first diagnosed and many residents have families on both sides of the Rio Grande river border , some residents said they were now reluctant to venture south to Mexico . `` I am extremely concerned because you could die , '' said Santiago Perez , 18 , a student at Pace High School . About 30 U.S. Marines in southern California on the biggest military base in the United States were quarantined after one was confirmed to have contracted the illness . President Barack Obama , facing the sudden flu emergency along with his broader drive to pull the United States out of its deep recession , said the Texas death showed it was time to take `` utmost precautions . '' Kathleen Sebelius , Obama 's newly confirmed health secretary , spent her first day in office on a rapid-fire media tour as the administration sought to calm public fears while urging public health vigilance . `` We know that the cases will continue to rise , '' Sebelius said . Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the Customs and Border Patrol was keeping an eye out for sick travelers , as usual , and had checked 49 people with flu-like symptoms . She said 41 had been cleared of H1N1 infection and eight were still being studied . `` We are preparing for the worst ; hoping for the best , '' Napolitano said . `` All of us should be dusting off our business contingency plans , looking at things like telecommuting and the like so that things keep operating . '' Many Americans were heeding the warnings , snapping up hand sanitizers , wipes and soap . `` I figure it 's going to get worse before it gets better , right ? '' said Kathy Ivcich , 53 , a real estate agent in Chicago . Mexico 's central bank warned the outbreak could deepen the nation 's recession , hurting an economy that already shrank by as much as 8 percent from the previous year in the first quarter . France said it would seek a European Union ban on flights to Mexico . The EU , the United States and Canada have advised against non-essential travel to Mexico , a popular tourist destination , with many of the cases linked to travel there . Many tourists already in Mexico were hurrying to leave , crowding airports and trying to change their tickets . `` We did n't want to get stuck here , '' said Australian Alex Grinter , who left her beach vacation in the southern state of Oaxaca to get an early flight to Vancouver . In Mexico City , a metropolis of 20 million , all schools , restaurants , nightclubs and public events have been shut down to try to stop the sickness from spreading . H1N1 swine flu is seen as the biggest risk since H5N1 avian flu re-emerged in 2003 , killing 257 people of 421 infected in 15 countries . In 1968 a `` Hong Kong '' flu pandemic killed about 1 million people globally , and a 1957 pandemic killed 2 million .

Adjuvants are additives that help boost the effectiveness of vaccines . A study showed that when MF59 was added to Aflunov it can provide a broadly-cross reactive immune response covering all known H5N1 antigenic variants , even when that booster dose is administered six years after the initial dose . Manufacturers have started to take the first preparatory steps in developing a vaccine against the H1N1 swine flu virus that is being linked to the deaths of as many as 176 people in Mexico . Ten countries have reported cases of the H1N1 strain . `` These data reinforce the potentially broad applicability of the MF59 adjuvant and the role it can play in pandemic preparedness efforts around the world , '' said Andrin Oswald , chief executive of Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics . `` We will use these new insights , as well as our strong leadership position in cell based flu manufacturing , as part of our efforts to develop a vaccine against the current swine flu outbreak , '' Oswald said . By 0718 GMT , shares in the group had risen 1.3 percent to 43.28 , largely in line with the European pharmaceuticals sector . Novartis said earlier this week it had received the genetic code of the new virus strain , meaning that it could start work on evaluating production and it hoped to get the actual virus in its laboratories in the near future . The group also said on Thursday a Phase II study had shown that Aflunov provided a protective immune response in children from 6 months to 17 years , making it the first and only pre-pandemic avian vaccine with a good safety profile and which is effective in building an immune response as early as 6 months .

The World Health Organization said it would remain for now at its current alert level -- one step below full pandemic -- and that it would no longer refer to the H1N1 virus as `` swine flu '' to appease beleaguered meat producers . New confirmed flu cases were reported in the United States , Canada and Europe , although a case in Peru , which would have been the first confirmed case in Latin America outside of Mexico , was later discounted . Almost all cases outside of Mexico have been mild , only a handful of patients have required hospital treatment , and most global markets have shrugged off concerns . But the case count continues to rise , and officials say there are many unanswered questions about the outbreak . U.S. officials said new infections were occurring and at least 298 U.S. schools closed around the country because of possible infections . Canada recorded its first case of person-to person transmission of the virus . In Mexico , the worst hit country with up to 176 deaths , President Felipe Calderon told government offices and private businesses not crucial to the economy to stop work beginning on Friday to avoid further spreading a virus that is striking across age and class lines . `` There is no safer place than your own home to avoid being infected with the flu virus , '' Calderon said in his first televised address since the outbreak started . In Mexico City , where the virus has already brought public life to a standstill , some were skeptical while others vowed not to take part in the shutdown . `` Closing businesses is not right and not fair . What are we going to live on ? said Andres Garcia , who works in a tailor shop in the old colonial center of the capital . Mexico 's assembly for export factories known as maquiladoras , a pillar of the economy , said it would defy the shutdown call while some of the country 's mines also vowed to stay in operation . `` We have commitments that we have to meet , and if we do n't meet them , the cure will end up being worse than the disease , '' council head Cesar Castro told reporters . With its tourism industry savaged , shoppers staying home and exports to the United States in steep decline , Mexico could find itself in the longest , deepest recession it has seen in years , according to analysts . Mexico 's peso was hammered by flu fears on Thursday and its stock market slid . But most global markets were taking the flu news in stride as traders focused on hopes that a deep U.S. recession may be nearing its end . `` The information that we have at this stage is it is a relatively minor -LRB- economic -RRB- event , '' International Monetary Fund chief economist Olivier Blanchard said , although he added that some countries and sectors could see `` quite dramatic '' fallout from the outbreak . Previous studies at the World Bank have said a severe flu pandemic which triggers a clampdown on trade could cost the global economy trillions of dollars . The WHO and flu experts say they do not yet know enough about this new strain to say how deadly it actually is , how far it might spread and how long any potential pandemic may last . Flu epidemics generally last a few weeks or months in any single community , and can pass around the world in one or two waves over 18 months to two years before fading out . U.S. officials have reported 109 confirmed swine flu infections in at least 11 states and the only death recorded outside of Mexico -- a Mexican toddler visiting Texas . The White House said on Thursday that a member of the advance team that went with Obama to Mexico had also come down with flu-like symptoms and passed them to his family , although all of them had recovered . U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told a public webcast there were still many unanswered questions . `` We know what happens year in , year out with seasonal flu . What we do n't know is if this is going to be more virulent or milder , '' she said . Normal seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people around the globe in an average year , including about 36,000 in the United States . Worldwide , 11 countries have reported confirmed cases of the H1N1 strain , with the Netherlands the latest to join the list . It said a 3-year-old who had recently returned from Mexico had contracted the virus . Switzerland also confirmed its first case on Thursday in a man returning from Mexico . Peru 's health minister Oscar Ugarte told Reuters that further tests on a suspected case there had determined it was not the new flu strain . Flu preparations were intensified after the WHO raised its alert level to phase 5 , the last step before a pandemic . The WHO recommended all countries track any suspect cases and ensure medical workers dealing with them wear protective masks and gloves . But it stopped short of recommending travel restrictions , border closures or any limitation on the movement of people , goods or services . Keiji Fukuda , acting WHO assistant director-general , told reporters there was no new evidence to prompt the agency to move to its top alert level which would signal a global pandemic was under way .

Most cases occur when people come into contact with infected pigs or contaminated objects moving between people and pigs . \\* Pigs can catch human and avian or bird flu . When flu viruses from different species infect pigs , they can mix inside the pig and new , mixed viruses can emerge . \\* Pigs can pass mutated viruses back to humans , and these can be passed from human to human . Transmission among humans is thought to occur in the same way as with seasonal flu -- by touching something contaminated with flu viruses and then touching one 's mouth or nose , and through coughing or sneezing . One of the most effective prevention measures is regular hand washing . \\* Symptoms of swine flu in people are similar to those of seasonal influenza -- sudden fever , coughing , muscle aches and extreme fatigue . This new strain also appears to cause more diarrhea and vomiting than normal flu . \\* Vaccines are available to be given to pigs to prevent swine influenza . There is no vaccine to protect humans from swine flu , although the CDC is formulating one . The seasonal influenza vaccine may help to provide partial protection against swine H3N2 , but not against swine H1N1 viruses like the one circulating now . \\* People can not catch swine flu from eating pork or pork products .

The new strain has infected 257 people . The WHO has confirmed eight deaths although many more people are suspected to have died from the virus . It derives from a swine influenza virus but the new strain has been found only in people . While it contains mostly swine flu genetic sequences , it also contains small amounts of human and bird flu virus genetic material . No pigs have been confirmed to be sick with it . WHO has consistently said the disease can not be caught from eating pork if it is prepared properly . `` There is also no risk of infection from this virus from consumption of well-cooked pork and pork products , '' it said on its website on Thursday . The name of the flu led several countries to ban imports of pork from Mexico and the United States , where the outbreak first appeared , and authorities in Egypt have ordered a cull of pigs . U.S. and European food industries and governments had been calling for a change in name to remove the link in people 's minds between the disease and pigs .

Egypt , already hit hard by bird flu , fears another flu virus could spread quickly in a country where most of the roughly 80 million population live in the densely packed Nile Valley , many in crowded slums around Cairo . But the United Nations said the mass cull of up to 400,000 pigs was `` a real mistake '' because the new strain -- a mix of swine , avian and human viruses -- has not been found in pigs . Farmers in the most populous Arab country said the state had begun confiscating animals . State news agency MENA said Egypt had also culled thousands of birds as a precaution . `` They have destroyed us . The pigs were our livelihood , '' said 21-year-old Hanan Ahmed , whose family runs a small farm with around 25 pigs in Cairo . `` They took them . And they beat them and us . They said they will take them to the slaughterhouse and kill them there , '' she added , saying she had received no compensation . The H1N1 swine flu virus is spread by people , not pigs . But culling swine , largely viewed as unclean in Muslim Egypt , could help quell any public panic . Pigs are mainly raised by the country 's Christian minority . Dozens of pigs were killed in the early phase of the cull . In the southern village of Deir Abu Hennes , workers suffocated 25 piglets in plastic sacks and killed dozens of adult pigs and gave the meat to their owners , a local official said . Some farmers there took their pigs to a graveyard to try to hide them from authorities , but the animals were found and killed on the spot , the official and residents said . Swine flu has killed up to 176 people in Mexico and one in the United States , and cases have also been reported in Peru , Canada , Europe , Israel and New Zealand . Egypt has not reported any cases , but has stepped up monitoring at airports . Agriculture Minister Amin Abaza said authorities had already confiscated more than 1,000 pigs despite efforts by some farmers to hide the animals . He said the pigs would be slaughtered and their meat would be frozen . Abaza said he was seeking the army 's help with the slaughter , which Egyptian state media reported could take up to a month to complete . In one slaughterhouse near Cairo , workers wearing masks used their boot-clad feet to hold down the snouts of pigs while they tested them for illness prior to slaughter . `` The issue of slaughtering more than 300,000 heads of pig is a difficult one , especially since private pig slaughterhouses are not enough . We will seek the help of armed forces slaughterhouses , '' Abaza told Reuters . `` The meat will be preserved in freezers after it is removed from the bones and will be offered for sale to consumers , '' he said . Egyptian officials have stressed that while they believed there was a need for a cull , the meat was safe . An official from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said on Wednesday his group had been trying unsuccessfully to reach Egyptian officials to correct any confusion about the virus . The Paris-based Organization for Animal Health said states should focus efforts on `` appropriate disease surveillance '' and strengthening biosecurity measures at premises where pigs are handled and slaughtered , rather than culling them . `` The culling of pigs will not help to guard against public or animal health risks presented by this novel A\\/H1N1 influenza virus and such action is inappropriate , '' the organization said in a statement . Egypt 's state-run al-Ahram newspaper has said pig owners could receive 1,000 Egyptian pounds -LRB- $ 177 -RRB- per animal in compensation , but an independent newspaper reported on Thursday no compensation would be paid .

The first 160 layoff notices go out on Friday , primarily to contractors producing the space shuttle fuel tanks outside New Orleans and the shuttle solid rocket boosters in Utah . The prime contractors for those components are Lockheed Martin Corp and ATK Thiokol . `` This is the first significant loss of manufacturing capability , '' shuttle program manager John Shannon told reporters . The three-ship shuttle fleet is due to be retired after eight more flights to finish building and equipping the International Space Station and a final servicing call to the Hubble Space Telescope . Managers on Thursday settled on a May 11 launch date for shuttle Atlantis ' 11-day mission to Hubble . Liftoff is set for 2:01 p.m. EDT -LRB- 1801 GMT -RRB- from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida . NASA officials said that they were monitoring the nationwide alert over the new swine flu , or influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- flu virus , but so far the disease was not affecting any of its operations . `` We 're not doing anything special at this point , '' said NASA 's associate administrator for space operations Bill Gerstenmaier . NASA plans to replace the shuttles with Apollo-style capsules that in addition to traveling to the space station will be able to fly astronauts to the moon 's surface . Hoping to keep the new spaceships , named Orion , on track for a 2015 debut , NASA said earlier this week it had decided to produce only one version of the capsule with room for four astronauts , rather than the six-seater version that had been planned for flights to the station . Money for developing Orion and its launcher , called Ares , is coming from funds that previously went toward shuttle operations and station construction . The shuttle is the only vehicle that can service orbiting satellites , such as the Hubble telescope , as well as handle massive construction efforts , like assembly of the space station . NASA has made four previous servicing calls to Hubble to repair equipment and install new science instruments . The observatory , which was launched in 1990 , has been instrumental in reshaping scientists ' understanding of the universe and expanding public knowledge of astronomy . Its observations have been used by astronomers to determine that space is expanding at an increasingly faster rate , that massive black holes live in the hearts of most galaxies and that new planets likely are born in flat disks of gas and dust that circle stars . The final visit to Hubble features five spacewalks to install a new camera , resuscitate two failed instruments and other work . NASA hopes the mission will leave Hubble in good enough shape to continue working until at least 2014 when an more sensitive replacement telescope is put into orbit . -LRB- Editing by Pascal Fletcher and Eric Walsh -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "690", "dct": "2009-04-30", "dates": ["2009-04-30", "2008-01-01", "2009-04-30", "2009-04-28"], "text": "UAE says no ban on pork , but shops clear shelves -LRB- Updates to make clear no pork ban , adds supermarket comments -RRB- DUBAI , April 30 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The United Arab Emirates has not banned pork imports , a senior official said , but some supermarkets have pulled pig meat from their shelves as a precautionary measure against swine flu .

Although there was no official federal ban , some supermarkets and local authorities had begun to take precautions . Earlier on Thursday , a spokesperson for the Abu Dhabi Food Control Authority said there was a ban on `` all imports of pork products as a precautionary measure to protect consumers '' .

And a lab with the new test has been set up in Mexico in the hope of finding out how many of the 2,500 suspected cases are in fact the new strain of H1N1 swine flu . `` Now there is a lab that is up and running in Mexico that is able to do diagnoses , '' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention acting director Dr. Richard Besser told reporters . Before , Mexico had to send samples to the CDC in Atlanta or a World Health Organization lab in Winnipeg , Canada , meaning a lag of several days . `` This is really a big step . It is going to help us with the studies there . We will be able to confirm cases , the risk factors for those cases . It is going to be very helpful in terms of speeding up the course of those studies . '' Besser said the CDC is sending out testing kits to U.S. states that will allow individual state labs to confirm their own cases of swine flu . `` We are in the process of rolling out testing capability in every state , '' Besser said . The new strain , a strange mix of two swine flu strains with dribblings of genetic material from avian and human flu virus , may have killed up to 176 people in Mexico and a toddler in Texas . But the symptoms it causes are virtually identical to regular seasonal flu , as well as a host of other respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more exotic coronaviruses . A quick on-the-spot test can tell doctors if a patient has influenza and some will tell whether it is type A. But more sophisticated tests must be done to show whether it is an H1N1 , the type that includes both one of the seasonal influenza strains and the new swine flu strain . Even further testing will show if it is the new strain , but this requires either a process called PCR , which amplifies and analyzes the genetic material of the virus , or using a test called an antibody test to see if the patient 's immune system has mounted a defense against the virus . `` What is being rolled out right now by the CDC is a specific test for this new virus , '' said the CDC 's Dr. Lyle Petersen . It will fit onto the PCR platform used in state health departments for influenza surveillance and will produce a result in a matter of hours , Petersen said . But it is not something a doctor or clinic can do . `` You need a fancy machine to do it , '' he said in a telephone interview . For now , the CDC recommends only that people with flulike symptoms who have some kind of recent travel to Mexico or who have been in close contact with a known swine flu patient should get the test . Petersen said there is a limited amount of material , called reagent , that can be used to make the PCR tests work . And if the disease is spreading , that will become clear anyhow . `` No one is going to recommend doing wholesale testing anyway . If you have a giant outbreak of flu you do n't need to test every single person if you know what it is , '' he said . -LRB- Reporting by Maggie Fox , Editing by Sandra Maler -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "919", "dct": "2009-04-30", "dates": ["2009-04-30", "2009-04-30", "2009-04-30", "2009-04-29"], "text": "LONDON | Thu Apr 30 , 2009 2:27 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Dead pigs in China , evil factory farms in Mexico and an Al Qaeda plot involving Mexican drug cartels are a few wild theories seeking to explain a deadly swine flu outbreak that has killed up to 176 people . Nobody knows for sure but scientists say the origins are in fact far less sinister and are likely explained by the ability of viruses to mutate and jump from species to species as animals and people increasingly live closer to each other . `` The pig has been considered the mixing bowl of influenza viruses . Both avian flu and pig flu viruses have spread via the pig to humans , '' Paul Yeo , a virologist at Durham University in Britain , said on Thursday . `` The problem now with this virus is that it has picked up a mixture of elements , now including human elements . It 's a complex virus . '' Twelve countries have confirmed cases of the H1N1 strain , a new infection that has brought the world to the brink of a pandemic . Finding the source of a new virus is key for scientists because understanding how it jumped to humans can lead to better drugs and vaccines as well as help prevent future outbreaks . But one link experts probably wo n't be exploring is an Internet report charging that Mexican drug cartels working with al Qaeda unleashed the swine flu . `` The claim of the conspiracy theorists is that this new combination could not have occurred naturally , but this is not true , '' the New Scientist 's biology editor Michael Le Page wrote . `` Flu viruses consisting of a mixture of human , swine and bird strains have been found before . '' Sound science , however , is no match for the Internet and unsubstantiated media reports when it comes to providing a forum for ideas that have forced responses from governments and companies alike . China 's Ministry of Agriculture , for example , on Wednesday denied overseas reports charging that dead pigs found in a south eastern province might be to blame for swine flu , according to an official Xinhua news agency article . And in Mexico reports in at least two newspapers focused on a factory farm run by a subsidiary of global food giant Smithfield Foods . Some of the rumors mentioned noxious fumes from pig manure and flies -- neither a known vector for flu viruses . Those reports brought a swift reply from the biggest U.S. hog producer . `` Based on available recent information , Smithfield has no reason to believe that the virus is in any way connected to its operations in Mexico , '' the company said in a statement . Viruses spread much more easily on factory farms where animals are packed together than in the wild but so far there is no evidence that any one particular farm is the source . -LRB- Reporting by Michael Kahn ; Editing by Maggie Fox and Richard Hubbard -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "983", "dct": "2009-04-30", "dates": ["2009-04-27", "2009-04-30", "2009-04-30", "2009-04-29", "1918-01-01", "1957-01-01", "1968-01-01", "1918-01-01"], "text": "Mexican transit policewoman wears a surgical face mask in Mexico City April 27 , 2009 . GENEVA | Thu Apr 30 , 2009 11:39 am EDT GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Swine flu will carry the name `` pandemic '' even if the new virus turns out to cause mainly mild symptoms as it sweeps the world , raising questions about how serious the global alert actually is . Although it has been deadly in the disease epicenter , Mexico , and caused the death of one Mexican infant in the United States , in other countries people infected with swine flu have fared well , with diarrhea the biggest complaint . The World Health Organization is expected to move quickly to designate a full pandemic -- at level 6 of its 6-point scale -- within days to reflect the continuing spread of swine flu among people who have not been to Mexico , including in Europe . Margaret Chan , the WHO 's director-general , on Wednesday night raised the world flu alert level from 4 to 5 and said : `` It is really all of humanity that is under threat during a pandemic . '' Echoing other infectious disease experts , and drawing on her experience fighting SARS and bird flu outbreaks as health director of Hong Kong , she said viruses such as the H1N1 swine strain needed to be closely watched in case they worsen . `` We learn from previous pandemics . Pandemic virus is precarious , unpredictable , and will take us by surprise , '' she told reporters at the WHO 's headquarters . But Chan acknowledged that the disease may well cause more discomfort than death , noting that many patients infected in the United States have recovered on their own and without medicine . `` It is possible that the full clinical spectrum of this disease goes from mild illness to severe disease . We need to continue to monitor the evolution of the situation to get the specific information and data we need to answer this , '' she said . `` There may be a possibility that the virus will die out and stop , and that would be the best for us . But it can turn the other way . '' Several theories are circulating about why swine flu has killed as many as 176 people in Mexico while having mild and more manageable effects elsewhere . Some experts speculate that the Mexican victims did not receive appropriate medical care or suffered other health complications that made them vulnerable to the flu . For the time being , the WHO 's own guidance to people who suspect they have been infected with swine flu is essentially the same as advice for seasonal flu care . Its website 's `` frequently asked questions '' about the virus tell people who have a high fever , cough or sore throat to rest and take plenty of fluids , wash hands frequently , and avoid work , school or crowds as much as possible . -LRB- www.who.int\\/csr\\/disease\\/swineflu\\/faq\\/en\\/index.html #q 11 -RRB- Keiji Fukuda , the WHO 's acting assistant director-general , said that swine flu appeared very similar to normal seasonal flu , a disease that is rarely fatal for healthy adults but can kill the elderly and infirm . Between 3 and 5 million people experience severe illness due to regular , seasonal flu around the world each year , and between 250,000 and 500,000 die as a result . Fukuda said it was not yet clear whether swine flu would turn into a mild or severe pandemic , raising the possibility that the virus could have more serious effects as it continues to permeate new communities or as climate conditions change . There were three pandemic flu outbreaks in the 20th century -- in 1918 , 1957 and 1968 -- known respectively as Spanish , Asian , and Hong Kong influenza . An estimated 50 million people died in the first outbreak , about 2 million in the second and between 1 and 3 million in the third . `` In the 1918 pandemic , the first wave was mild , but by fall , the second wave killed many people . So whichever way this virus swings , we ca n't possibly know , '' said Guan Yi , a microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong . `` At this point , chances are it will be mild , but we ca n't rule out it will turn virulent . And even if it turns milder , it can still kill , depending on the kind of person it infects . '' Health experts fear swine flu could be especially dangerous for the old and infirm , especially those with immune-system suppressing diseases such as HIV\\/AIDS . Its spread to poor countries that lack medical staff , drug stockpiles , and diagnostic tests -- and where tropical and other diseases are also prevalent -- is another serious concern . Guan Yi said that if it spread to Egypt or Indonesia , where H5N1 bird flu is endemic , it might combine with that virus . `` It could turn into a very powerful H5N1 that is very transmissible among people . Then we will be in trouble , it will be a tragedy .

Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang told reporters the man arrived on a China Eastern flight on Thursday afternoon after a stopover in Shanghai . He had a fever and went to Ruttonjee Hospital for help on Thursday evening , Tsang said . The Mexican is now in hospital in a stable condition . The confirmation of the H1N1 infection was made by a laboratory at the University of Hong Kong . `` He did n't leave the hotel -LRB- except to go to hospital -RRB- because he was feeling sick , '' Health Minister York Chow told a news conference . Two companions of the Mexican and a friend he met in Hong Kong were now in isolation wards at another hospital , he said . Tsang said he had accepted the recommendation of government health experts to seal off the Metropark hotel in Wanchai district where the Mexican was staying . Dozens of police wearing surgical masks stood guard both inside and outside the hotel late on Friday . Hotel guests were prevented from leaving while outsiders could not get in . `` I assure you the Hong Kong government will try its best to conquer the virus , '' Tsang said . `` At the present moment , I would prefer to do it more stringently instead of missing the opportunity to control the spread of the virus . '' Chow said the hotel had about 200 guests and over 100 staff and they would be quarantined for seven days . He urged those who were not in the hotel as well as taxi drivers who took the Mexican to the hotel and to hospital to report to authorities . The drastic action left some visitors distressed . Cinmei Sinaga from Indonesia was left standing for hours on the pavement with her eight-month-old daughter . `` I do n't feel that they are doing anything to help me . I just need my passport but we can not go to another hotel and my baby needs to sleep . I feel scared , '' she told Reuters . The affluent financial hub on the south coast of China is widely seen as one of the best-prepared Asian cities to deal with the new H1N1 flu virus , given its experience in handling sporadic outbreaks of H5N1 avian flu , as well as SARS in 2003 which killed 299 people . The order to seal off the Metropark hotel brought back memories of how SARS started in Hong Kong in February 2003 . A doctor from mainland China who knew he had been infected with SARS had traveled to Hong Kong to try to seek medical help . But before he could get admitted to hospital , he infected eight people in a lift lobby of the Metropole hotel where he was staying . Some of them then went on to spread the disease in Hong Kong , Singapore , Canada and Vietnam . To tackle the H1N1 flu virus , Hong Kong authorities have beefed up surveillance at airports and hospitals , improved public health response systems and stockpiled over 20 million doses of the anti-influenza drug Tamiflu .

Henshaw , 18 , and a senior at Steele High School northeast of San Antonio , was among the first U.S. patients to catch a new strain of the H1N1 swine flu virus , which has spread to 13 countries . Within days Henshaw 's fever spiked to 102 degrees Fahrenheit -LRB- 39 degrees Celsius -RRB- , and he was confined to bed . `` I could n't lift my head up to get out of bed to take a drink . I was really sick , '' said Henshaw , who along with his family have been under voluntary quarantine for a week . `` I could n't stop coughing .

Cases have been reported around the world , mostly among travelers from Mexico , but they have been mild and most people recovered so far with little or no treatment . The only death outside Mexico was a Mexican toddler visiting Texas . Henshaw has recovered and is feeling better . But he 's still confined to his two-story stucco house , along with his family , who were advised by local health officials to remain in `` voluntary quarantine . '' A `` do not disturb '' sign hangs from the front door and the phone has been turned off in an attempt to ward off an onslaught of calls from journalists . Inside , surgical masks hang from the doors and cans of Lysol and hand sanitizers are in plentiful supply .

Raul Rabadan and colleagues at Columbia University in New York analyzed the published genetic sequences from the H1N1 virus that has brought the world to the brink of a pandemic . `` The closest relatives to the virus we have found are swine viruses , '' Rabadan said in a telephone interview . `` Six segments of the virus are related to swine viruses from North America and the other two from swine viruses isolated in Europe\\/Asia , '' they wrote in the online journal Eurosurveillance . The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week after discovering this virus in two U.S. children that it had four virus types -- two swine , an avian and a human component . It may be even more complex than that . Influenza viruses mutate constantly and they also swap genetic material with one another promiscuously , especially if an animal or person is infected with two strains at once . Rabadan 's team said this particular strain looked partly like another hybrid , or what scientists call a reassortant , virus . `` The North American ancestors are related to the multiple reassortants , H1N2 and H3N2 swine viruses isolated in North America since 1998 , '' they wrote . `` In particular , the swine H3N2 isolates from 1998 were a triple reassortment of human , swine and avian origin . '' Scientists can study those genetics to try to track the origin of the new virus . Mexican officials have denied it came from pigs in Mexico and pork producers have been battling rumors it could have come from pig farms there . Rabadan said the findings did not show the virus came directly from pigs . `` We do n't know how long this virus has been in humans , '' he said . Many different influenza strains are circulating at any given time and pandemic strains -- the ones that cause global outbreaks from a whole new strain -- are believed to have come from animals . `` We know that with the two pandemics in 1957 and 1968 they were coming from a mixture of human and avian viruses , '' Rabadan said . The H1N1 strain that caused the far more serious 1918 pandemic appears to have been virtually a pure avian strain , according to published analyses . -LRB- Reporting by Maggie Fox ; Editing by Peter Cooney -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "378", "dct": "2009-05-01", "dates": ["2009-05-01", "2009-03-01", "2009-04-01", "1990-01-01"], "text": "Clinton has `` mild allergies , '' not new flu U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has twice been to Mexico in recent weeks , and so when she appeared at two State Department events on Friday with a cough and apparent cold symptoms , reporters asked an obvious question .

ORLANDO , Florida | Fri May 1 , 2009 12:09 am BST ORLANDO , Florida -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Mickey Mouse , Pluto , the Fairy Godmother and other Walt Disney favorites were still dishing out kisses , handshakes and high-fives at the Magic Kingdom on Thursday , despite the flu virus alert gripping the United States . At the world famous Florida theme park , which is run by Walt Disney Co and visited by millions each year , enthusiastic crowds filled the avenues and rides , apparently unworried by the warnings of a possible pandemic of a new strain of influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- virus . The United States has declared a health emergency and in Mexico , where up to 176 people have died following the outbreak there of the virus originally termed `` swine flu , '' the government has ordered a five-day partial shutdown of nonessential government offices and businesses . The Mexican Health Ministry also warned people against touching or kissing while greeting each other . Authorities in the United States , who have reported 109 confirmed swine flu infections but only one death , are recommending that people sick with flu symptoms seek treatment and stay home . Florida is testing a number of suspected cases . At the Magic Kingdom on Thursday , one mother pressed her baby 's face into the costumed character Pluto 's furry snout for a kiss . Other youngsters continued to snuggle up to various other Disney characters and share `` high-fives , '' while fidgety kids slid their hands along the rope lines while waiting to get on the rides . Among the crowds were the Jansens from Amsterdam in the Netherlands . They said they were not worried about bringing their 2-year-old and 7-year-old children to the Magic Kingdom . `` There 's no concern for us . We always go to the big public places with the kids , '' said Ed Jansen . `` Just like any Dutch man or Dutch woman , we have both feet on the floor . We 're not a panicked people . '' Coordinating the international campaign against the new flu virus , the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- has its current alert level just one notch below a full pandemic . Despite some official fears that crowded venues could increase contagion risk , there were no visible extraordinary precautionary measures in place at Disney 's Magic Kingdom . Trash sweepers , as usual , swept up bits of garbage almost before they touched ground , but they did not appear to be doing any extra disinfecting or unusual cleaning . The Walt Disney Co. has maintained a tight-lipped stance about the flu alert , wary of any news that could trouble its carefully crafted guest experience at the world 's largest theme park . Disney spokeswoman Andrea Finger in Orlando told Reuters this week , `` We 're not really talking about it , '' declining to say whether any special health measures were being taken . Disney World representatives held a closed-door meeting with public health leaders on Thursday in Orlando to discuss the flu alert . After the meeting with Orange County Health Director Dr. Kevin Sherin , Disney representative Mike Griffin told local media the company was `` monitoring the situation . '' Sherin and Orange County Mayor Rich Crotty said they had full confidence in Disney 's contingency plans in the event of a health emergency , but they gave no details . `` We truly have world class theme parks in Orange County and Osceola County , '' Sherin said , referring to Disney World , Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando . `` These are the best in the world . The practices they have to protect cast members and staff and guests are second to none . '' Universal Orlando is co-owned by the Blackstone Group and NBC Universal , a unit of General Electric Co. . Most visitors seemed determined not to let the alarm over the spreading flu virus spoil their family fun . `` We come from a tropical island and we have many kinds of fevers , '' said Puerto Rican retiree Luis Larregoity and his wife Miriam Cruz . Ann Genthner , a grandmother from Boston visiting the Magic Kingdom with her daughter-in-law and two grandchildren , said she had n't bothered to follow the news about the flu . `` I thought about it , but it did n't affect me in any way , '' Genthner said .

At least not yet , and U.S. pork producers are doing everything they can to make sure that the new H1N1 virus , known around the world as the `` swine flu , '' stays out of their herds . `` That is the biggest concern , that your herd could somehow contract this illness from an infected person , '' said Kansas hog farmer Ron Suther , who is banning visitors from his sow barns and requiring maintenance workers , delivery men and other strangers to report on recent travels and any illness before they step foot on his property . `` If a person is sick , we do n't want you coming anywhere on the farm , '' Suther said . Those sentiments were echoed by producers around the nation this week as fears of a possible global flu pandemic grew , with more than 200 people sickened , including more than 100 in the United States , and at least 177 dead , all but one in Mexico . `` There is no evidence of this new strain being in our pig populations in the United States . And our concern very much is we do n't want a sick human to come into our barns and transmit this new virus to our pigs , '' said National Pork Producers chief veterinarian Jennifer Greiner . `` If humans give it to pigs , we do n't have things like Tamiflu for pigs . We do n't have antivirals . We have no treatment other than to give them aspirin , '' said Greiner . The World Health Organization on Thursday officially declared it would stop calling the new strain of flu `` swine flu , '' because no pigs in any country have been determined to have the illness and the origination of the strain has not been determined . The never-before-seen H1N1 flu virus has elements of swine , avian and human varieties . Still , U.S. hog farmers said flu fears have hit them hard in the wallet as hog prices plummeted this week in response . Many countries reacted to the outbreak earlier this week by banning pork or meat from U.S. states that have human cases of the flu . And Egypt ordered the slaughter of all pigs in the country as a precaution . U.S. hog producers have already been struggling financially for more than a year due to poor prices and high feed costs . If the new flu strain does hit their herds , it could spur further price declines , and could potentially spread broadly through herds . To try to protect against such a scenario , industry groups and veterinarians this week warned farmers to step up their biosafety protocols , keeping pigs in barns behind security fences with access by any outsiders extremely limited . Purdue University veterinarian Sandy Amass said farmers should keep an eye on pigs for `` coughing , runny nose , fever and a reduction in feed intake , '' and to have the animals tested immediately if they exhibit such flu symptoms . `` Pigs get flu just like people get flu , '' Amass said . `` We 're want to do everything possible so the pigs do n't get infected . '' For Carroll , Iowa , producer Craig Rowles that means if any of his workers feel sick , they are ordered to take time off work -- paid -- to keep them away from the pigs . `` It 's a real issue , '' Rowles said . `` If the pigs get it , there is n't much we can do . Water , aspirin , and bed rest , that 's all we 've got .

Health workers are rushing to get a fuller picture of the outbreak of H1N1 swine flu , which the World Health Organization fears could tip into a pandemic . Mexico , the worst-hit country , has reported 176 deaths from the new strain of the H1N1 virus . Cases have been reported around the world , mostly among travelers from Mexico , but they have been mild and most people recovered so far with little or no treatment . The only death outside Mexico was a Mexican toddler visiting Texas . Experts have been struggling to explain why so many deaths in Mexico and nowhere else , but the CDC report suggests there is a simple explanation -- there are many cases in Mexico , most are mild , and just the bad ones have been seen so far . `` The clinical spectrum of swine-origin influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- virus illness is not yet well characterized in Mexico . However , evidence suggests that swine-origin influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- virus transmission is widespread and that less severe -LRB- uncomplicated -RRB- illness is common , '' the CDC said in a special report . `` To date , case-finding in Mexico has focused on patients seeking care in hospitals , and the selection of cases for laboratory testing has focused on patients with more severe disease . Therefore , a large number of undetected cases of illness might exist in persons seeking care in primary-care settings or not seeking care at all . '' But more information is needed , the CDC team stressed . The CDC has sent test kits to Mexico that will help get a better picture of who is sick . It is difficult to know without special tests because respiratory diseases are so common and many infection look like flu . `` Additional investigations are needed urgently to evaluate the full clinical spectrum of disease in Mexico , the proportion of patients who have severe illness , and the extent of disease transmission , '' the CDC said .

Mexican officials said hospitals were seeing fewer new cases of people with symptoms from the new swine flu virus and cut the estimated death toll from the outbreak . `` It would still be imprudent to say that we 're past the worst of it but I do think ... we are in a stage of stabilization , '' Mexican Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova told reporters . Costa Rica , Italy , and Ireland confirmed cases of the virus , which has now been found in 18 countries . In Geneva , the World Health Organization said H1N1 influenza had not spread in a sustained way outside North America , as would be required before the pandemic alert level is raised to its highest level . But it said that would probably happen soon . `` I would still propose that a pandemic is imminent because we are seeing the disease spread , '' Michael Ryan , WHO director of Global Alert and Response , told a briefing . Few are ready to take chances with the new virus , widely dubbed swine flu . In Hong Kong , police quarantined a hotel after a Mexican guest fell ill with the virus , which may have killed more than 100 people in Mexico , the worst-hit country . Mexico called the action `` unjustified '' and advised its citizens to avoid travel to China . Mexican authorities cut their suspected death toll to up to 101 from as many as 176 as more test samples came back negative . Fewer patients with severe flu symptoms were checking into hospitals , suggesting a falling infection rate , and no new deaths were reported in Mexico City in the past two days . The World Health Organization said 15 countries had reported 615 infections , not including the later reports of confirmed cases in Ireland , Italy and Costa Rica . The United States , the second hardest-hit country , said it had confirmed 160 cases in 21 states . U.S. officials said they were encouraged by reports from Mexico that the outbreak may be leveling off , although they said it was too early to relax . `` We are remaining vigilant , '' said Dr. Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . `` We have seen times where things appear to be getting better and then get worse again . ... I think in Mexico we may be holding our breath for some time . '' Almost all infections outside Mexico have been mild . The only death in another country has been a Mexican toddler who was taken to the United States before he fell sick . President Barack Obama said the United States was responding aggressively to the new flu strain and was closing some schools temporarily and distributing antiviral drug supplies as needed . The White House said Obama spoke to Mexican President Felipe Calderon on Saturday about U.S.-Mexican cooperation on limiting the spread of the virus . Scientists are still trying to assess how the new virus behaves and how it compares to regular seasonal flu strains , which kill between 250,000 and 500,000 globally every year . The outbreak remains tiny compared with other epidemics such as malaria , hepatitis and meningitis . But the WHO hiked its pandemic alert level to 5 from 3 this week -- the last step before a pandemic -- due to its rapid spread and the possibility it could hit hard in poor and disease-prone communities , including among people with HIV . Ryan said the WHO would send more than 2 million treatment courses of antiviral drugs to poor countries to help them prepare for the virus , which is already causing havoc with a travel industry that flies hundreds of thousands of people to and from Mexico each week . China suspended flights to Mexico after Hong Kong authorities on Friday confirmed a Mexican man who flew via the Chinese mainland was infected with the flu strain . Hong Kong was hit hard by the 2003 SARS outbreak . Police in surgical masks quarantined 200 guests and 100 staff inside a Hong Kong hotel where the Mexican , 25 , had been staying , saying they would be confined for a week . `` They said everybody needed to go back to their rooms . I do n't want to go to my room because I want to be out , '' an Australian man at the hotel told a TV reporter by telephone . Public hospitals in Mexico have noted a steady drop in patients turning up with fevers , suggesting the infection rate may be declining as people don face masks and use hand gel . Cordova said of 159 suspected flu deaths , tests showed 58 died of other causes . He said 16 deaths were confirmed as caused by the H1N1 flu and 85 were being tested . In Mexico City , big parks , museums and zoos were shut and in the sprawling metropolis of 20 million people many were heeding a government call to stay home for a prolonged five day-holiday to try to stem new infections . Jose Francisco Suarez , 15 , said he wanted to get back to school . `` We 're sick of this situation . A few days off school would n't be so bad but now there 's nothing to do , '' he said during a break playing basketball with two friends .

Police wearing surgical masks sealed off the Metropark hotel on Friday night after test results on the 25-year-old Mexican man were confirmed , ordering approximately 200 guests and 100 staff to stay in the hotel for the next seven days . The measures taken by the authorities in Hong Kong underscore the concern here about the new flu and the confirmed case , Asia 's first . Hong Kong was badly hit by the SARS virus in 2003 and has had many episodes of H5N1 bird flu for more than a decade . Officials said no one would be allowed to leave the hotel in the Wanchai district , an area popular with tourists . `` They said everybody needed to go back to their rooms . I do n't want to go to my room because I want to be out , '' an Australian man in the hotel told local television by telephone . `` They told me I will stay here . I wo n't be allowed out and this is it . '' Brice Chevallereau , a French tourist , checked into the hotel on Friday afternoon but did not stay the night . When he returned to the hotel on Saturday , he was told by authorities he would have to be quarantined . `` Why do I have to go inside ? '' `` I just stayed two minutes in the lobby . It 's not fair . '' Journalists and camera crews massed on the street outside the hotel , which is being guarded by police and cordoned off with blue and white tape . Shops near the hotel were shuttered . `` How can there be business ? The police vans are all around here , '' said Li Mingtai , a waiter at a nearby restaurant . Twelve guests who had refused to stay were taken to a lodging house close to the border with mainland China . The site was used to quarantine Hong Kong people who were exposed to the SARS virus back in 2003 , a government spokesman said . PASSENGERS URGED TO COME FORWARD The Mexican man arrived in Hong Kong from Mexico on Thursday following a stopover in Shanghai . He developed a fever after arriving and took a taxi to a hospital on Thursday evening . He is in a stable condition , officials said . Authorities appealed for 142 passengers and crew on the same flight as the Mexican to report to health officials . Lo Wing-lok , an infectious disease expert , said the government was over-reacting . `` He would have been infectious starting from the time he was on the plane . Think about all the people around him on the plane , while he was going through customs , waiting for baggage , in the taxi , in the hotel and when he got to hospital , '' Lo said . `` So how can it be effective if the government is just trying to isolate people in the hotel , it is a mission impossible . '' Health officials said the `` essential needs '' of those inside the hotel would be looked after . They would also get regular medical check-ups and psychologists were on standby . An elderly couple passed a bag of clothes to police at the entrance for their daughter , who works in the hotel . The new virus , which is largely swine and part avian and human , has killed up to 101 people in Mexico , but confirmed cases in other countries have been mild . Nevertheless , news of the infected traveller caused jitters in Hong Kong and some people were taking no chances . In subways , ferry terminals and on the streets , more people went about their business on Saturday wearing surgical masks , although some had masks fashioned out of cloth . At the checkout counters in a supermarket , residents rifled through masks and sterilisers . A sign nearby said : `` Prevent flu infection .

Around 4,500 fans crammed into the MGM Grand 's Garden Arena for Friday 's weigh-in while many more were turned away . `` It was probably the biggest weigh-in we 've ever had , '' said Richard Sturm , president of sports and entertainment for MGM Mirage . According to former middleweight and light-heavyweight champion Bernard Hopkins , the huge turnout gave further proof that boxing was still in excellent shape . `` Today showed that boxing is n't going anywhere , '' Hopkins told Reuters . `` The pay-per-view numbers are going to show , I believe , that boxing is alive as long as people are getting something they can be excited about . '' Hopkins , who is now a partner with Golden Boy Promotions who look after Hatton , said the struggling economy had placed an extra burden on organisers to produce competitive bouts . `` We 've got to take risks because now people are choosing wisely with their dollars , '' he said . `` They 're not going to buy tickets just because your name is Bernard Hopkins if you 're fighting Donald Duck . '' Boxing experts are eagerly anticipating Saturday 's 12-round bout because of its competitiveness and unpredictability . Although Pacquiao is widely regarded as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world , he has never fought at light-welterweight where Hatton is unbeaten after 44 bouts . However Sturm said the popularity of the two fighters in their respective countries had been another significant factor in the fight 's huge interest . `` Both of these fighters have tremendous fan bases , '' he said . `` They 're icons and they both have the same number of fans . `` The British fans may be louder but Pacquiao has a fan base here -LRB- in the U.S. -RRB- that is n't all from the Philippines .

Police wearing surgical masks sealed off the Metropark hotel on Friday night after test results on the 25-year-old Mexican man were confirmed . They ordered the approximately 200 guests and 100 staff to stay in the hotel for the next seven days . The measures taken by the authorities in Hong Kong underscore the concern here about the new flu and the confirmed case , Asia 's first . Hong Kong was badly hit by the SARS virus in 2003 and has had many episodes of H5N1 bird flu for more than a decade . `` As this is the first confirmed case in the Greater China region and there is still little information about the severeness of the influenza , we need to be very cautious in dealing with the situation . We decided to take comprehensive and stringent measures to prevent any massive outbreak in Hong Kong , '' a government spokeswoman said . Officials said no one would be allowed to leave the hotel in the Wanchai district , an area popular with tourists . `` It just feels surreal because you are trapped , '' said Juliet Keys , who arrived from Singapore on Thursday to attend and planned to leave on Sunday . `` I 'm fine but it is a bit frustrating because I have a three-and-a-half year old daughter -LRB- and husband -RRB- in Singapore . '' Keys , speaking to Reuters by telephone , said she was given a health check and a 10-day course of the antiviral drug Tamiflu . Health officials held a briefing for those inside , Keys said . `` People are pretty good . A few are emotional , frustrated at not being able to get out because of things like work commitments , '' Keys said , adding guests had been given rice and some side dishes to eat . A frustrated Australian man in the hotel told local television by telephone he wanted to leave . Brice Chevallereau , a French tourist , checked into the hotel on Friday afternoon but did not stay the night . When he returned to the hotel on Saturday , he was told by authorities he would have to be quarantined . `` Why do I have to go inside ? '' `` I just stayed two minutes in the lobby . It 's not fair . '' PASSENGERS URGED TO COME FORWARD The Mexican man arrived in Hong Kong from Mexico on Thursday following a stopover in Shanghai . He developed a fever after arriving and took a taxi to a hospital on Thursday evening . He is in a stable condition , officials said . Authorities appealed for 142 passengers and crew on the same flight as the Mexican to report to health officials . Lo Wing-lok , an infectious disease expert , said the government was over-reacting . `` He would have been infectious starting from the time he was on the plane . Think about all the people around him on the plane , while he was going through customs , waiting for baggage , in the taxi , in the hotel and when he got to hospital , '' Lo said . `` So how can it be effective if the government is just trying to isolate people in the hotel , it is a mission impossible . '' Health officials said the `` essential needs '' of those inside the hotel would be looked after . They would also get regular medical check-ups and psychologists were on standby . News of the infected traveler caused jitters in Hong Kong and some people were taking no chances . In subways , buses , ferry terminals and on the streets , more people went about their business on Saturday wearing surgical masks , although some had masks fashioned out of cloth . At the checkout counters in a supermarket , residents rifled through masks and sterilizers . A sign nearby said : `` Prevent flu infection .

Mexican Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova said the flu was easing but warned that it was too early for Mexico -- the epicenter of an outbreak that has spread to 19 countries -- to let down its guard . The mayor of Mexico City , Marcelo Ebrard , said the capital of 20 million inhabitants was likely to resume normal activities on Thursday , observing certain health precautions , after a five-day partial shutdown to limit the virus ' spread . Cordova said the H1N1 flu outbreak appeared to have peaked in Mexico between April 23 and 28 and fewer people had gone to hospitals with serious flu symptoms in the past few days . `` The evolution of the epidemic is now in its phase of descent , '' he told a news conference in Mexico City , where millions of people heeded government advice to stay at home . After days of alarm that had kept streets eerily quiet , the atmosphere in Mexico City appeared more relaxed on Sunday , with some people venturing out on bikes or running . Many no longer wore the surgical masks that have been almost obligatory in the city in the last week as residents feared infection . But millions of Catholics stayed away from churches , watching Sunday mass on television instead . Mexican authorities have scaled back their estimate of deaths from the flu strain to over 100 , down from 176 . Only 19 deaths in Mexico are confirmed as being caused by the new flu . But new cases of the virus , which mixes swine , avian and human flu strains , still were being tracked across the world , keeping alive fears of the threat of a pandemic . The World Health Organization said its laboratories had identified a total of 898 H1N1 flu infections in 18 countries , including one case in Italy . Its toll lags national reports but is considered more scientifically secure . The flu has spread to 30 U.S. states and infected 226 people , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said . It appears to be hitting mostly younger people , with very few cases reported in those over 50 years old . CDC acting director Richard Besser said there were `` encouraging signs '' that the new strain was not more severe than what would be seen during normal seasonal flu . But he still expected the virus to have a `` significant impact '' on people 's health . `` We 're not out of the woods , '' Besser told `` Fox News Sunday . '' The U.S. government said it hoped to have a vaccine ready for the new flu strain by the autumn . In Britain , Health Secretary Alan Johnson said the spread of the new flu strain had been contained there . A World Health Organization spokesman said in Geneva its emergency committee had no meeting scheduled to review its global alert for the H1N1 flu , which it set last week to 5 , one notch below pandemic level . Health officials and scientists from around the world have been focusing on how the new mutated , mongrel flu strain may be passed between animals and humans . The WHO said flu surveillance should be increased in both humans and animals now that the latest H1N1 strain was found to have infected pigs in Canada . Canadian health officials said a traveler carried the virus from Mexico to Canada and infected his family and a pig herd . Mexico has seen a stabilization of serious cases in the past few days , bringing some relief to its population , millions of whom have stayed indoors in line with a government order for non-essential businesses to remain closed through Wednesday . `` We 've been indoors since Friday . So now we 've come out to enjoy some fresh air , '' cyclist Silvia Rodriguez told Reuters , relaxing on the grass of a central park in Mexico City . Others were more wary . `` I 'm not totally convinced that the worst is over , '' said Juan Antonio Hernandez , 48 , a caretaker . A Mexican Embassy official in China said Chinese authorities were quarantining more than 50 Mexican business people and tourists after some showed flu symptoms . Asia 's trade and tourism could be hit by the latest flu outbreak but lessons learned from the SARS epidemic in 2003 would boost efforts to counter the effects . SARS , or severe acute respiratory syndrome , killed more than 800 people around the world in 2003 after first appearing in southern China .

He ranted lightheartedly about germ-filled ties and bottom-pinching theater seats on Sunday as he issued new health safety guidelines for Mexicans preparing to return to work and school after a five-day shutdown . Citizens must continue to avoid physical contact , wash hands frequently and say goodbye to the tie , Cordova said . `` There is even a guideline -- and this is why you have n't seen us wearing ties -- it 's because the tie can harbor germs . We tend not to wash ties as often as other clothing and so all the microbes fall onto your tie when you sneeze and then we your ties falls into the soup and all over the place , '' he said . The moment of comic relief contrasted with the grave tone adopted at his previous , twice-daily press conferences to update reporters on the death toll from the new strain that has spread to 20 countries and infected just over 1,000 people worldwide . Mexicans have been forced to change their customs during the epidemic , to avoid spreading infection . The kiss on the check is out , rubbing elbows is in . The face mask has become a politically correct fashion statement , even if just left dangling around the neck . And bottles of antiseptic hand-washing gel are all ubiquitous . Journalists attending the minister 's press conferences dutifully hold out their hands so that security guards can administer a squirt of gel , a prerequisite for entry . Restaurants , movie theaters , schools and businesses have all been closed and are likely to reopen on Wednesday . But authorities do n't want Mexicans getting too close to each other just yet . `` The guidelines recommend that there be a minimum of two meters -LRB- six feet -RRB- between one person and another , '' Cordova said . `` For example in restaurants there should be unoccupied tables and distance between the diners .

The MSD -LRB- R -RRB- Point of Care Influenza Test , which is being developed under a contract with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- , is the investigational device referred to in the CDC 's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report -LRB- MMWR -RRB- Dispatch dated April 21 , 2009 . As described in the MMWR Dispatch , Patient A visited an outpatient clinic in San Diego with influenza-like symptoms and participated in an ongoing clinical study of the MSD Point of Care Influenza Test , coordinated at that site by the Naval Health Research Center . A nasal swab taken from the patient tested positive for Influenza A on the MSD test , but the specific subtype could not be determined by the test , suggesting the possible presence of a novel influenza strain . Per protocols established for conducting the clinical trial , this result prompted further testing at a reference laboratory that confirmed that the virus was not a common seasonal strain . The virus was ultimately identified by the CDC as a novel strain that included components having swine influenza lineage . MSD 's Point of Care Influenza Test has been in development since 2006 under a contract with CDC , supported by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority -LRB- BARDA -RRB- , an office under the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response -LRB- ASPR -RRB- within the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services -LRB- HHS -RRB- . MSD 's test supports BARDA 's goal of advancing rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests for novel influenza viruses . Currently-available point of care influenza tests are designed to detect influenza A and B infections . The MSD Point of Care Influenza Test is designed to additionally identify influenza A infections by subtype , differentiating between common human A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- , common human A -LRB- H3N2 -RRB- and avian A -LRB- H5N1 -RRB- influenza strains . The MSD Point of Care Influenza Test has been granted an investigational device exemption by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is currently undergoing evaluation in a multi-site clinical trial . The test , which consists of a portable instrument and disposable test cartridges , reports results from a nasal swab sample within 15 minutes . The early identification of the 2009 A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- swine flu infection as a result of the use of MSD 's test highlights the need , identified by BARDA and the CDC , for point-of-care tests with the ability to differentiate between common and novel strains of influenza .

MADRID\\/GENEVA | Mon May 4 , 2009 12:48 pm EDT MADRID\\/GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The World Health Organization is likely to raise its flu alert to the top of its six-point scale and declare a pandemic , its director-general indicated in an interview published on Monday . In remarks setting the scene for another alert increase , but without saying when , WHO chief Margaret Chan warned against over-confidence following a stabilization in the number of new cases of the H1N1 strain that has proved deadly in Mexico . `` Level 6 does not mean , in any way , that we are facing the end of the world . It is important to make this clear because -LRB- otherwise -RRB- when we announce level 6 it will cause an unnecessary panic , '' she told Spanish newspaper El Pais . `` Flu viruses are very unpredictable , very deceptive ... We should not be over-confident . One must not give H1N1 the opportunity to mix with other viruses . That is why we are on alert . '' The WHO 's pandemic phases reflect views about how a virus is spreading , and not how severe its effects are . Last week the United Nations agency raised the alert level twice , from 3 to the current 5 , in response to the sustained transmission of H1N1 in Mexico and the United States . Before issuing a level 6 alert , the WHO would need to see the virus spreading within communities in Europe or Asia . A declaration of a full pandemic would send a signal to governments worldwide to institute their pandemic response plans , which may include measures affecting hospitals , schools or public events . Phase 6 would also trigger increased support for developing countries which lack the drugs , diagnostic tests , and medical staff to respond appropriately to the flu that the WHO has said could be especially dangerous for people with HIV\\/AIDS . While the top-level alert would not have an automatic effect on the world 's flu vaccine production , the WHO is expected to make an announcement alongside any such declaration to specify whether manufacturers should switch from making seasonal to pandemic flu vaccines . In her remarks to El Pais , Chan said that weather patterns could play an important role in how the flu continues to spread . The southern hemisphere is about to enter winter , when seasonal flu cases normally spike , the infectious disease expert said . `` We have to be very careful . No one can predict what is going to happen when countries in the south have flu peaks and this new one arrives -- which it is going to do , without a doubt , '' she said . On Sunday , a WHO spokesman said the relatively large number of infections in Spain of what has been commonly known as swine flu -- at 40 , according to the WHO 's count -- seemed to be mainly `` imported '' cases involving people returning from Mexico , the epicenter of the disease outbreak . Chan echoed this and said that so far , there were not many flu patients in Europe that have not been to Mexico or had direct contact with those who had . `` It is true that the number is small , but because of that I would say that we have not seen the full situation or the whole picture of what is happening . The situation is evolving and the virus is changing , '' she said . Chan , who fought SARS and bird flu in her previous job as Hong Kong 's health director , said it was too early to predict what proportion of the population would catch the new flu strain after the European Union predicted 40 percent of the population would become infected .

Asia has been hard hit by the collapse in global demand largely because of the region 's heavy reliance on exports . Singapore , Hong Kong , Taiwan and Japan are in recession and growth elsewhere is the weakest in years . `` Poverty is worsening in many countries . The extremely urgent climate change agenda could be affected , '' Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said at the annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank . `` If all this goes unchecked , down the road we could see social and political unrest in many countries , '' he told representatives of the ADB 's 67-member countries , including finance ministers and central bank governors . To counter the downturn , the ADB said it will raise lending by half and Asian governments agreed at the weekend to launch a $ 120 billion fund countries can tap to avert a balance of payments crisis . Japanese Finance Minister Kaoru Yosano warned that private capital flows into Asian developing nations could turn negative in 2009 after falling below $ 100 billion in 2008 from over $ 300 billion in 2007 . `` ADB should play a leading role to cushion the impact of such a brutal reversal in capital flows , '' he told the meeting , adding though that a resurgence in Asia could trigger a global recovery . Longer term , it was vital for emerging Asian economies to build domestic demand to counter the reliance on export earnings , ADB delegates said . Many Asian exporters have seen demand for their products halve from a year earlier as the deepest global downturn in decades hammered world trade . `` The Chinese government 's basic approach is to expand domestic demand , particularly consumer demand , to promote growth , '' Finance Minister Xie Xuren said . Karen Mathiasen , the chief U.S. delegate , said the shift to rely more on domestic demand would be profound . `` Such a fundamental economic transformation will not be easily or rapidly attainable , but ultimately will be key to underpinning a healthy , global and balanced recovery . '' To achieve this goal , ADB Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said Asia needed to channel more savings into investments and consumption . `` They need to spend more on health , education and social security to reduce household needs for precautionary savings . They need strategies to transfer more corporate savings to households to encourage greater consumer spending . '' The ADB has forecast that the region 's economies are likely to grow just 3.4 percent in 2009 , the slowest pace since the Asian financial crisis a decade ago . It sees growth recovering to 6.3 percent next year if demand rebounds . But transforming household savings into consumer spending and investments has been a difficult task for Asian policymakers . In the 10 Southeast Asian or ASEAN nations -- Brunei , Cambodia , Indonesia , Laos , Malaysia , Myanmar , the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand and Vietnam -- savings exceed investments by at least 10 percent , ratings agency Standard and Poor 's says . The ADB is meeting on the Indonesian resort island of Bali , where finance ministers from China , Japan , South Korea and ASEAN on Sunday set up a $ 120 billion emergency fund aimed at countering the sort of capital flight seen during the 1997\\/98 Asian financial crisis . It is Asia 's first independently managed multilateral liquidity facility and will be launched by the end of the year . Japan , the region 's biggest economy , also announced a plan to supply up to 6 trillion yen -LRB- $ 61.54 billion -RRB- to support its neighbors in an economic downturn . Several Asian policy makers have flagged the risk of social unrest if governments fail to deal with the crisis . Chinese officials have warned economic discontent could threaten social stability as the giant economy 's growth dropped below double digits for the first time in years . And during the last crisis a decade ago , Indonesia 's long-term president , Suharto , stepped down after street protests . Governments also changed in South Korea and Thailand . To counter the current crisis , the ADB plans to ramp up lending to its developing members to about $ 33 billion in 2009 and 2010 , almost a 50 percent increase over 2007-2008 . Most of the new loans will be for infrastructure . If approved , the bank will also create a $ 3 billion fast-disbursing facility to meet `` urgent needs , '' Kuroda said .

The CDC recommends the use of synthetic tip swabs , such as Flocked Swabs , which exhibit a superior recovery of viruses . Several independent scientific studies published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology and presented at Clinical Virology Symposium show that the quality of the sample taken using Copan Flocked Swabs is comparable to the quality of a sample collected from a nasopharyngeal aspirate or nasal was , which are considered the gold standard for upper respiratory virus samples . The open structure of Copan Flocked Swabs acts like a soft brush that efficiently dislodges and collects cells and mucus , then releases the sample immediately when put in a viral transport medium . In Ontario , the Agency for Health Protection and Promotion also lists Flocked Swabs as the preferred type of swab for respiratory virus sample collection on its latest version of LABstract on H1N1 Flu Virus -LRB- human swine influenza -RRB- , Updated Guidance for Laboratory Testing , Hospital Setting . Copan Flocked Swabs are easy to use , are less invasive and cause minimal discomfort for the patient . Copan holds a worldwide patent on Flocked Swabs . To transport H1N1 viral specimens collected using swabs , the CDC also recommends that the swab specimen collection vials should contain 1 - 3ml of viral transport medium -LRB- e.g. containing , protein stabilizer , antibiotics to discourage bacterial and fungal growth , and buffer solution -RRB- , such as the BD Universal Viral Transport System , which is manufactured by Copan and distributed in different parts of the world under the Copan brand name Universal Transport Medium -LRB- UTM -RRB- . Copan UTM is room temperature stable and available in vials containing 1 or 3 ml of transport medium for different applications . About Copan Diagnostics , Inc. .

Still , a desire on both sides to boost bilateral trade and ship more Mexican raw materials to fast-growing China means the diplomatic flap should only be a temporary setback . Mexico accused China of discrimination after Beijing , worried about the H1N1 flu strain , ordered some 70 Mexicans , including a honeymooning couple , into seclusion , even though none had symptoms . Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa called the isolation measures `` unacceptable '' and `` without foundation '' and advised Mexicans against traveling to China . China rejected the criticism , saying the steps it had taken were purely medical and not discriminatory . `` This should not affect the relationship in the medium-term because we are talking about an overreaction on both sides , '' said Enrique Dussel , an expert on Mexican-Chinese trade at the UNAM University in Mexico City . Across China , a Mexican man in Hong Kong was the only person found to be infected with the new flu strain that has killed 26 people in Mexico , two in the United States and made more than 1,500 people ill in 22 countries . China sent a plane from Shanghai on Tuesday to pick up about 100 of its citizens from Mexico , mainly tourists , students and business people . Some Chinese had been holed up in hotels in northern Mexico for days waiting to leave . The spat has revived old tensions between the two nations , which established diplomatic relations in 1972 . There has been intense trade rivalry in recent years with Mexico blaming China for muscling in on its top export territory by flooding the United States with cheap goods made in low-wage factories . President Felipe Calderon visited Beijing last July in a push to improve bilateral trade and Chinese President Hu Jintao came to Mexico in 2005 promising more investment in areas like auto parts manufacturing and mineral exploration . Yet China has leaned more on South American commodities producers like Brazil and Chile for the materials it needs to fuel its export-oriented economy . Mexico exported just $ 2 billion worth of goods to China last year , Dussel said , but imported $ 34 billion of Chinese products , from clothing and electronics to tourist trinkets . `` Of all the major countries in Latin America , China has the most tense relationship with Mexico , '' said Dan Erikson , an analyst at the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue . `` The swine flu crisis has just revealed once again that they have n't built the partnership that both countries say that they want , '' Erikson said . Other flu-affected nations have had citizens ensnared in China 's quarantine measures , including at least four from the United States and more than 20 from Canada , but Mexico , the epicenter of the outbreak , said it has been unfairly targeted . The person-to-person spread of the virus has kept alive fears of a pandemic , though scientists say this strain does not appear more deadly than common seasonal flu , which can kill 250,000 to 500,000 people a year globally . Governments around the world are reacting to the outbreak with different levels of severity . Many suspended flights or warned their citizens against travel to Mexico . Even as Mexico said the flu crisis seemed to be dissipating and prepared to reopen closed businesses , Chinese nationals wearing face masks and loaded with luggage streamed aboard a Chinese-chartered jet that stopped in Mexico City and the northern city of Tijuana . `` There is a lot of mutual ignorance and no strategic framework . This just shows there is a lot of work to be done '' to improve ties , Dussel said . -LRB- Editing by Catherine Bremer -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "685", "dct": "2009-05-05", "dates": [null, null], "text": "Nurse Practitioners in the Front Lines of Obama Health Care Reform Era : University ... \\* Reuters is not responsible for the content in this press release .

The death of the woman , who was in her 30s and had health problems , followed that of a Mexican toddler visiting Texas . U.S. health officials have predicted that the virus would spread and inevitably kill some people , just as seasonal flu does . The World Health Organization was monitoring the spread of the virus and said 21 countries have officially reported 1,490 cases . The United States has 403 confirmed cases of the swine flu in 38 states , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said , with another 700 `` probable '' cases . U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius warned that `` those numbers will go up , we anticipate , and unfortunately there are likely to be more hospitalizations and more deaths . '' Canada has reported 165 cases . Health officials said the outbreak seemed to be slowing in Mexico , hardest-hit by the virus , which is a mixture of swine viruses and some elements of human and bird flu . At the same time , infections were breaking out globally and are expected to spread . Meanwhile , trade skirmishes have flared over pork , with some countries imposing new restrictions , despite assurances by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization that pork , especially cooked pork , was safe to eat . The question remained how far the virus would spread and how serious would it be . The WHO remained at pandemic alert level 5 , meaning a pandemic is imminent . `` If it spreads around the world you will see hundreds of millions of people get infected , '' the WHO 's Dr. Keiji Fukuda told a news briefing . If it continues to spread outside the Americas , the WHO would likely move to phase 6 , a full pandemic alert . This would prompt countries to activate pandemic plans , distribute antiviral drugs and antibiotics and perhaps advise people to take other precautions like limiting large gatherings . `` It 's not so much the number of countries , but whether the virus sets up shop in any of those countries like it has here and starts to spread person to person . And given the number of countries that have cases , one would think that eventually that criteria would be met , '' said acting CDC director Dr. Richard Besser . He and Fukuda said it would be important to watch the Southern Hemisphere , where winter and the flu season are just beginning . Other pandemics have started with a mild new virus in spring that has come back to cause severe disease later in the year . The WHO said it would begin sending 2.4 million treatment courses of Roche AG 's and Gilead Sciences Inc 's Tamiflu , an antiviral proven effective against the new flu , to 72 nations , including Mexico . Fukuda said the WHO was still trying to answer the most pressing questions , including why more people have died in Mexico than anywhere else . `` More people have had mild illness than have had severe illness , '' Fukuda said . `` The reasons for that are not clear . I do n't think it reflects differences in treatment . '' Most of those who have become ill with the new flu , including in Mexico , have recovered with little or no treatment . Mexico began to return to normal , but a five-day lockdown ordered by the government to try to slow the influenza 's spread cast a pall on the normally exuberant Cinco de Mayo celebrations . Mexican Finance Minister Agustin Carstens said the outbreak could knock as much as half a percentage point off growth this year . Because the flu seemed both mild and unstoppable , the CDC eased recommendations for closing schools in the United States when children or teachers had infections , but advised parents to keep sick children at home to prevent further spread . H1N1 continued to spark trade and diplomatic quarrels . An AeroMexico plane picked up dozens of Mexicans stranded in China after they were quarantined there . Mexican President Felipe Calderon condemned the measure as discrimination against his compatriots -LRB- nSP348835 -RRB- . Singapore also issued orders to quarantine sick travelers . Mexico told the World Trade Organization it was `` deeply disappointed '' by what it called `` divisive measures '' applied by some WTO members against its pork products . -LRB- nL5956461 -RRB- `` Mexico urgently requests all its trading partners to eliminate any restrictive measures established on Mexican products , which are not in accordance with the scientific information available , '' the government said . U.S. and Canadian pig and pork exports have also been hit by bans that rattled the $ 26 billion-a-year global pork industry , in which Mexico , the United States and Canada are among top exporters .

Since the new swine flu virus was first identified two weeks ago in two children in Texas and California , the World Health Organization pushed its pandemic alert level from a three to a five , meaning a pandemic is imminent . Mexico closed schools , stopped public events and took a big hit to tourism . The U.S. government mobilized 25 percent of its stockpile of antiviral drugs and started work on a vaccine against the new strain . But the death toll is being rolled back as Mexican officials realize it will be impossible to know if long-buried or cremated victims died of H1N1 swine flu . And while the infection is spreading rapidly across the United States , it appears to be no worse than seasonal flu . Scientists who study flu say the coordinated , global response was appropriate . `` If it does n't become more virulent , first of all , many people will heave a great sigh of relief , '' said Dr. Scott Lillibridge , who helped set up the Center for Disease Control and Prevention 's Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Program and who is now at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in Houston . But Lillibridge echoes what the WHO and CDC have been saying : viruses mutate and change all the time and it is too early to say how bad this virus really is . `` We are only a few days into a major international mobilization for an outbreak that could continue months into the future , '' Lillibridge said in a telephone interview . The U.S. government has been preparing for this scenario for years . One of the messages that has come up repeatedly is that the 1918 pandemic , cited as the worst-case scenario because it killed upwards of 40 million people , started with a mild arrival of a new virus , now identified as H1N1 , in the spring . It disappeared over the summer , but roared back with a vengeance in August . `` Will there be later disease , and if so , will it be more severe ? '' CDC acting director Dr. Richard Besser asked on Monday . `` There is no doubt in my mind that CDC , the Department of Homeland Security , and the Health and Human Services Department will use the lull to get ready , '' said risk communications consultant Peter Sandman , who has taken a special interest in pandemic flu . `` They will stay focused on this problem . They will continue to get ready for a possible pandemic in the fall . '' Many public health experts also remember the 1976 swine flu outbreak that was n't . Manufacturers raced to make a vaccine and 40 million Americans were vaccinated amid a monster public relations campaign . But the flu never spread . `` One big difference between then and now was that when the swine flu was detected in 1976 , it was found at a single military installation in Ft. . Dix , New Jersey , '' said Dr. Harvey Fineberg , president of the Institute of Medicine and author of `` The Epidemic that Never Was . '' `` In the ensuing weeks and months it was not detected elsewhere -- not elsewhere in New Jersey , not elsewhere in the United States , not elsewhere in the rest of the world . '' Worse yet , some people developed a rare neurological reaction to the vaccine called Guillain-Barre syndrome . Even now , a considerable minority of people believe that vaccines are harmful . In contrast , said Fineberg , this virus spread globally in a matter of weeks , carried by holidaymakers and jet travel , and has shown it can be transmitted from one person to another . `` Last week the lesson is we got lucky , '' said Sandman . `` We have no reason to think we will stay lucky . '' He hopes the alarm bells will continue to ring , at an appropriate level . `` I just hope the government is more worried about the public being caught with its pants down than the government being called fearmongerers , '' Sandman said . `` One thing we have learned about flu is we should not be surprised by anything , '' he said .

The WHO comments appear more cautious than those from the Food and Agriculture Organization -LRB- FAO -RRB- and World Organization for Animal Health -LRB- OIE -RRB- , which said import bans are not required to safeguard public health because the disease is not food-borne and has not been identified in dead animal tissue . The WHO however said it was possible for flu viruses to survive the freezing process and be present in thawed meat , as well as in blood . `` Meat from sick pigs or pigs found dead should not be processed or used for human consumption under any circumstances , '' Jorgen Schlundt , director of WHO 's Department of Food Safety , Zoonoses and Foodborne Diseases . `` While it is possible for influenza viruses to survive the freezing process and be present on thawed meat , there are no data available on the survival of Influenza A\\/H1N1 on meat nor any data on the infectious dose for people , '' he wrote in an email reply to questions from Reuters concerning the safety of pork , respiratory secretions and blood of H1N1-infected pigs . Schlundt warned people to be cautious with blood and meat-juices from H1N1-infected pigs . `` The likelihood of influenza viruses to be in the blood of an infected animal depends on the specific virus . Blood -LRB- and meat-juice -RRB- from influenza H1N1-infected pigs may potentially contain virus , but at present , this has not been established , '' Schlundt said . `` Nonetheless , in general , we recommend that persons involved in activities where they could come in contact with large amounts of blood and secretions , such as those slaughtering\\/eviscerating pigs , wear appropriate protective equipment , '' he said . The new H1N1 swine flu virus is being transmitted from person to person , not from pigs to people . Its global spread has prompted many countries to limit pork imports , however . As many as 20 governments have imposed import bans on live pigs and meat from affected countries to prevent exposure to the virus . Such fears increased after Canadian authorities said on Saturday a herd of swine was infected by a farmer who had returned from Mexico . The WHO said 22 countries have officially reported 1,534 cases of the flu virus . While health officials say the outbreak appears to be slowing down in Mexico , authorities everywhere are asking how far the virus would spread and how serious it would be . U.S. officials confirmed that a Texas woman with the H1N1 swine flu virus died earlier this week , the second death outside Mexico . Last week , a Mexican toddler visiting Texas died . Mexican officials have reported 29 confirmed deaths . While the new virus is mainly spread from person to person through coughing and sneezing , experts do not know for sure how this virus came to be , which animal passed it to the first human patient and when that occurred . But the case of the farmer infecting the pigs in Canada fueled fears of the virus yet again jumping the species barrier -- this time from pig to human -- and possibly becoming more virulent in the process . Joseph Domenech , FAO chief veterinary officer , said on Tuesday : `` This new strain of influenza virus does not contaminate humans easily and has a very low pathogenicity for both humans and pigs , unlike the avian flu which killed millions of poultry . '' On Tuesday , Alex Thiermann , senior adviser to the OIE 's director-general , said there was no difference between raw and cooked meat in terms of H1N1 transmission risks . `` The OIE is very concerned that differences are being made between cooked and not cooked meat .

Research proves over the counter herbal and nutritional supplements can increase Natural Killer Cell levels . Dr. Sponaugle reported , `` We have measured 60 percent increases in Natural Killer Cells , using over the counter formulas containing naturally occurring inositol phosphates . The 60 percent Natural Killer Cell increase is consistent with results published in scientific studies . '' Since Inositol phosphates occur naturally in the body , there is essentially no risk of allergic reaction . AHCC , is an immune booster extracted from mushrooms which increased Natural Killer Cell levels , 200 to 300 percent , in published studies . Florida Detox and Wellness Institute increased Natural Killer Cell levels in one severely immune suppressed patient , from 3 per milliliter to 150 per milliliter . Natural Killer Cell levels tend to decrease with age . Patients with chronic fatigue syndrome , fibromyalgia , Lymes Disease , Babesia , or HIV are more likely to have lower Natural Killer Cell levels . Herpes Simplex , Human Herpes 6 , Epstein Barr and Cytomegalus viruses also suppress immunity . Dr. Sponaugle also recommends reducing sugar consumption , to increase immunity . Studies reveal consuming 100 grams of sugar reduced immunity for over five hours . Researchers measured activity of neutrophils , white blood cells which engulf and destroy bacteria and other harmful microorganisms . Neutrophil activity was reduced over 45 percent , two hours , after sugar consumption . , 30:613 , 1977 Am . , 26:180 , 1973 . Excessive sugar consumption causes chronic immune suppression , in many Americans . The average American consumes 125 grams of sucrose sugar daily , in addition to 50 grams of other refined sugars daily . A typical 12 ounce cola drink contains ten teaspoons or 41 grams of sugar . A Milky War candy bar contains 35 grams of sugar . Many herbal teas and energy drinks are sweetened with high fructose corn syrup , which is essentially a refined sugar . Estimates indicate twenty percent of Americans consume over 75 grams of high fructose corn syrup daily . Since different parts of the immune system work together , through chemical messenger systems , increasing neutrophil activity can enhance Natural Killer Cell activity .

Deaths from the epidemic have risen to 2,148 since the first case was recorded in December from 333 announced by the health minister in early March . The number of reported cases has climbed more than eightfold to 47,902 over the same period . About two-thirds of Nigeria 's 36 states are affected by the epidemic , the ministry said . Nigeria is Africa 's most populous country with a population of more than 140 million . UNICEF said last month that more than 2,500 people had been killed by meningitis this year in West and Central Africa in what could be the worst epidemic for five years . Nigeria , Niger , Burkina Faso and Chad are considered Africa 's high-risk zone . Meningitis is the inflammation of the tissue surrounding the brain and spinal cord , and can be caused by viral or bacterial infections . It spreads mainly through kisses , sneezes , coughs and in close living quarters . The meningitis death toll in Nigeria since December is almost 50 times the number of people killed worldwide by the H1N1 swine flu virus . But the speed with which it has spread underscores the potential dangers if swine flu reaches Africa . Basic healthcare is limited in rural parts of Nigeria , where most people live on less than $ 2 a day , despite the country 's huge oil resources . Many Nigerians fear that an outbreak of swine flu would be devastating . The Health Ministry said no suspected case of swine flu had been recorded in the country but that it had taken steps to contain any outbreak . The worst recent meningitis epidemic in West and Central Africa occurred in 1996-97 when an estimated 100,000 people were infected in Nigeria and 50,000 in Niger . -LRB- Reporting by Camillus Eboh ; Writing by Tume Ahemba ; Editing by Nick Tattersall -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "327", "dct": "2009-05-07", "dates": [], "text": "An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "856", "dct": "2009-05-07", "dates": ["2009-05-07", "2009-05-07", "2009-05-07"], "text": "Flu hygiene hard in slums as Mexico scrubs off flu CIUDAD NEZAHUALCOYOTL , Mexico | Thu May 7 , 2009 4:26 pm EDT CIUDAD NEZAHUALCOYOTL , Mexico -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The water dribbling from the tap is not enough for Miriam Guerrero to clean her fingernails , let alone wash down her hair salon in a Mexico City slum as the country fights a deadly flu virus . With 44 people dead from the new H1N1 flu virus -- many of them in the sprawling capital of 20 million -- the government has urged Mexicans to scrub up as often as they can . But while the wealthy hose down storefronts with disinfectant and squirt hand sanitizer gel abundantly , impoverished families in Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl -- a vast , grimy slum on the northeast edge of the capital -- barely have running water . Low rainfall has left Mexico City 's already strained reservoirs badly depleted , and taps are driest in the poorest areas . Even though city officials have patched up leaky pipes several times , poor neighborhoods still suffer chronic shortages . `` When the water 's running short it 's not easy to keep washing your hands like they say , and there 's not enough to disinfect all the furniture , '' said Guerrero , who often fills her metal bucket from a water truck to clean her small salon . Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl , known as `` Neza , '' and other poor neighborhoods like nearby Iztapalapa , largely rely on the trucks that come around sporadically . Countries around the world are taking measures to halt the spread of the virus , which has infected more than 2,000 people in 24 countries . After grinding almost to a halt for several days , Mexico and its capital were getting back to normal on Thursday , reopening schools , bars , churches and restaurants as health officials said the worst of Mexico 's outbreak was over . But the government warned it was too early to stop taking hygiene measures . Many people still wore face masks and Mexico City restaurants sanitized diners ' hands as they arrived . Home to around 1 million people , Neza is infamous for being next to a huge open-pit garbage dump . `` We are worried about colds , the flu , especially being so close to the dump , '' said Alicia Soto , a vendor of sunflower seed snacks who took her daughter to the doctor two weeks ago , alarmed by her flu-like symptoms . Local health officials say they can not solve the water problem , but they are carting boxes filled with bottles of hand sanitizer to as many health clinics as they can .

I called the swine flu hotline , but all I got was crackling . The reference to `` crackling '' , or pork rinds , starts a host of Internet jokes and puns about the new H1N1 strain of flu that has the world on edge but fortunately , so far , has not reached the pandemic proportions feared originally . Piggybacking this information exchange is a wealth of disinformation . Although this new strain of swine flu has complex origins not restricted to pigs , the association has stuck . To the delight of many , the subject has spammed enough jokes cartoons and bad puns to last out a quarantine . I ve been sent home because I came out in rashers , is one doing the rounds . You can cure it with oinkment , comes the reply . Amid the bad puns are a host of quirky and off beat stories that are keeping the web abuzz . Spare a thought for the only pig in Afghanistan , a curiosity so rare in this strictly Muslim country that it actually lives at Kabul Zoo , where it is exhibited along with a pair of lions , some monkeys , a bear , and assorted other wildlife . Although the poor little piggy is unlikely to ever come into contact with another of its species and even less likely to come into contact with an Afghan it has been quarantined indoors . Actually , it might be the best thing to happen to it . On every visit I have paid to Kabul s zoo , the creature has been subjected to abusive taunts by curious onlookers as well as the the not infrequent thrown stone . Pig farmers in Kansas City were making a great effort to save their bacon by banning outsiders from coming into contact with their swine herds . They even told staff with the sniffles to keep away on full pay . `` If humans give it to pigs , we do n't have things like Tamiflu for pigs . We do n't have antivirals . We have no treatment other than to give them aspirin , '' said Jennifer Greiner , chief veterinarian with the National Pork Producers group . In Malaysia , thousands of Hindus sought blessings from goup of wild boars they believe have mystical powers , the Daily Star reported . Pigs have long been known to be one of nature s most intelligent creatures , but this group appeared to have mastered the art of a free lunch by making a temple their home , where they are fed by visitors who arrive from as far afield as Thailand and Singapore . The pigs do n't have any disease . The country is diseased , '' said Marzouk Badr Adli after residents of the poor Manshiet Nasr shantytown of Cairo clashed with authorities who tried to cull his herd . The United Nations said killing the pigs would be a mistake , but even after the World Health Organization formally distanced itself from using the name swine flu , the language was still causing problems . Under Jewish dietary laws , pigs are also considered unclean and pork is a forbidden food , but Israeli authorities made a ham-fisted attempt to change the name . `` We will call it Mexico flu . We wo n't call it swine flu , '' Deputy Health Minister Yakov Litzman said . prompting an immediate protest from the Mexican ambassador . Confusingly , they then settled on South American flu , despite Mexico still being in North America the last time anyone checked . The European Union , mindful of its enormous domestic pork industry -LRB- and anxious , perhaps , to avoid creating a swine lake -RRB- , said it would call the new virus `` novel flu '' . In true EU style , however , it then produced an internal document which called it novel flu in English , Mexican flu in French and swine flu in German . it truly shows the selfish of American not taking serious steps to prevent H1N1 spreading , as U.S has good and sound health care system , so H1N1 is not a big concern to most Americans , but considering you brought the virus to worldwide , including those countries without good health care system , you should be guilty !

Culprits are aplenty , but one of them is the company 's mammoth size . Until the economic crisis slammed the brakes on car sales last year , Toyota couldn t build them fast enough . To catch up with demand , Toyota put up more factories , from China to the Czech Republic . Reaching annual sales of 10 million vehicles a feat never achieved by any automaker to date -- looked imminent for the 70-year-old carmaker . Now that rapid expansion has come back to haunt it . With consumers holding back on car purchases the world over , Toyota s sprawling manufacturing facilities are a liability . Tumbling sales are forcing dozens of its factories to work half-days , costing the company billions . This year , it expects to build 6.3 million vehicles -- 800,000 fewer than it did in the year that ended on March 31 . Size is a tricky business . Economics says that scale breeds savings , but at the same time , it makes carmakers less nimble . Striking a balance can be tough even for a company like Toyota , which has grown organically as an independent carmaker . Rivals such as General Motors and Volkswagen , meanwhile , have become bigger partly by scooping up brands , often outside their home markets , so achieving synergies is even more difficult . In the late 1990s , former Daimler-Benz Chairman Juergen Schrempp had a vision of creating an auto empire and took over Chrysler to form DaimlerChrysler , which went on to buy stakes in Japan s Mitsubishi Motors and South Korea s Hyundai Motor . Now , all of those ties have effectively been severed . The moral of Schrempp s failure was : Size isn t the formula for success . It s puzzling , then , that Sergio Marchionne , the dynamic chief executive of Italy s Fiat , is treading a similar path . The Italian-Canadian CEO is looking to super-size Fiat by combining with the newly bankrupt Chrysler and GM s German arm , Opel , in the belief that the Italian carmaker needs the resulting industrial efficiency to survive . Toyota s announcement today should be a wake-up call for Mr Marchionne .

Bush . Many Arab and Muslim nations were angered by the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq , harsh interrogation of terrorism suspects at Guantanamo , abuse of prisoners in Iraq and Bush 's initial reluctance to pursue Israeli-Palestinian peace . Obama 's Egypt trip fulfills a promise he made during his presidential campaign to give a major address to Muslims from a Muslim capital during the first few months in office . The Muslim world will be watching to see his approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . Most Muslims believed Bush 's policies toward the region were biased in favor of Israel . White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters on Friday the speech would be delivered in Egypt on June 4 but did not say whether it would be in the Egyptian capital Cairo . The country has been a key partner for Washington in decades of efforts to secure Middle East peace and is one of the biggest recipients of U.S. military and economic aid . But the choice of Egypt , which has a poor human rights record , could potentially overshadow the substance of Obama 's speech , and Gibbs found himself on the defensive over the issue at a White House news conference . `` It is a country that in many ways represents the heart of the Arab world , '' Gibbs said . `` The scope of the speech , the desire for the president to speak -LRB- to the Muslim world -RRB- , is bigger than where the speech was going to be given or who 's the leadership of the country where the speech is going to be given , '' he said . Former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice gave a major policy speech in Egypt in 2005 at a time when U.S. popularity was seriously dented by the Iraq war . Rice 's speech was part of the Bush administration 's `` democracy agenda . '' She urged reforms across the region , specifically targeting her host , which drew anger from Cairo . However , the new U.S. administration has dropped the previous government 's focus on building democracy and Obama 's speech will likely be more conciliatory . The government of President Hosni Mubarak , who is due to visit Washington later this month , has been increasingly bold in targeting its foes in recent years , arresting leftists and Islamists alike . Press freedoms remain limited and protesters have largely been scared off the streets . The Egyptian government released opposition politician Ayman Nour in February , a move seen as trying to win goodwill from the new Obama administration . Nour spent three years in jail on forgery charges he says were fabricated to punish him for challenging Mubarak . Egypt says its courts are fair . Human rights group Amnesty International has raised concerns about what it describes as systematic torture , deaths of prisoners in custody , unfair trials and arrests of people for their political and religious beliefs or for their sexual orientation , The group said it had no problem with Obama 's choice of Egypt but stressed the U.S. leader should use the speech as a platform to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and human rights concerns in the Muslim world . `` I would say speak about his commitment to being fair on the Israeli-Palestinian issue and talk about the importance of free speech and assembly in the Arab and Muslim world , which unfortunately are very low , '' said Zahir Janmohamed , Amnesty 's advocacy director for the Middle East . `` If he does n't address either of them , it will be a disappointment , '' he said . Shortly after his inauguration on January 20 , Obama chose an Arab station , Al Arabiya , to give his first formal TV interview , widely interpreted as a signal that he wanted to improve relations with the Arab and Muslim world . He also called for peace and dialogue with Islam in a speech to Turkey 's parliament on his first presidential visit to the Muslim world in April . Gibbs said on Friday that `` all of this gives the president the opportunity hopefully to extend the hand to those that in many ways are like us but simply have a different religion . '' During the same trip , Obama will also go to the German city of Dresden and the Buchenwald concentration camp complex , which was set up by the Nazis during World War Two , Gibbs said . On June 6 , Obama would travel to Normandy in France to attend events marking the 65th anniversary of the D-Day landings by Allied forces that led to the end of the war .

L -RRB- said soaring loan default rates in recession-hit Hungary would eat into its profits this year , knocking almost a third off the company 's share price . IPF , which offers small loans to consumers in central Europe , Romania and Mexico , risked breaching its debt covenants if loan impairment rates worsened further , an analyst said , but the firm 's CEO denied this would happen . `` It is likely , as a result of the underperformance in Hungary , that the -LRB- profit -RRB- outcome for 2009 will be substantially less than our expectations , '' the company said on Friday . Impairments in the country rose sharply in the first four months of the year , causing it to miss pretax profit targets by 8 million pounds . Hungary 's government expects the economy , which has been hit by falling exports and weakening domestic demand , to contract by up to 6 percent this year , while the forint currency has fallen sharply in the past six months , making it harder for local borrowers to repay loans taken out in hard currencies . Analyst Nitin Arora at Noble said his clients had `` lost faith '' in IPF 's management team , and he believed bad loans as a proportion of the firm 's loan portfolio had risen to 31 percent . `` We estimate that if that ratio goes to 34 percent , they will breach the interest covenants , '' he said . `` Given the deteriorating macro environment and the uncertainty in all the economies in which IPF operates , we would not be surprised to see the 34 percent being hit . '' IPF , which closed its Russian operations at the end of April , said it experienced a sharp downturn in loan collections in Poland , Czech Republic , Slovakia and Hungary , as the global recession hits consumers and unemployment rises . But Chief Executive John Harnett told Reuters he did not expect impairments to rise to 34 percent and the firm would continue to operate within its covenants . He said that , after a lull at the start of the year , collections in its largest markets of Poland and the Czech Republic improved in March and April , a trend that was set to continue for the rest of the year . Rates had stabilised in Hungary , albeit at a low level . `` We 've seen off the worst , '' he said . IPF , which split from UK parent Provident Financial -LRB- PFG .

Health officials have warned that the true number of cases may be underestimated . Although most cases appear to be mild , the new swine flu strain has killed just as seasonal flu does . Another 48 people have died in Mexico and one each in Canada and Costa Rica . Washington state officials said on Saturday a man in his 30s with underlying heart conditions died last week , state governor Chris Gregoire describing his death as `` a sobering reminder that influenza is serious . '' The virus has moved into the southern hemisphere , where influenza season is just beginning , and could mix with circulating seasonal flu viruses or the H5N1 avian influenza virus to create new strains , health officials said . `` One of the big challenges with influenza viruses is the way that they change , the way they combine and their prevalence in a number of species , '' Dr. Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told a news briefing on Saturday . `` This is why it is so important for countries to have a strong capacity to deal with influenza and also why it is very important to understand what happens at the interface between people and animals . '' Before the Washington man 's death was announced , the CDC reported 2,254 confirmed U.S. cases of the virus with 104 people in hospital , up from 1,639 cases previously . `` Today there are almost 3,000 probable and confirmed cases here in the United States , '' Schuchat said . `` The good news is we are not seeing a rise above the epidemic threshold . '' Japan reported four cases , and globally officials reported more than 4,200 people in 30 countries had been ill . Australia reported its first case , a woman who been traveling in the United States but officials said she had made full recovery . `` We think this virus is in most of the United States , '' Schuchat said . `` The individual numbers are likely to be a very great underestimate . '' More Americans are seeing doctors for influenza-like illnesses at a time of year when such visits usually decline . Schuchat said tests showed they do not all have the new H1N1 virus . Many have seasonal flu -- the H1N1 seasonal strain , the H3N2 seasonal strain and influenza B -- and other infections . Seasonal flu kills 250,000 to 500,000 people globally and infects up to a third of the population each year . Health experts have not openly criticized efforts by other countries to stop the virus from getting in -- most notably China and its territory of Hong Kong , which have quarantined travellers in contact with patients . A spokeswoman in Hong Kong said on Saturday that a Mexican traveler confirmed as Hong Kong 's first and only case of the new flu strain had been discharged from hospital . The unidentified man , who unwittingly caused the confinement of almost 300 guests and staff at a Hong Kong hotel where he had stayed , had been in hospital for a week . China put seven people who had been exposed to three Japanese passengers diagnosed with the H1N1 flu in quarantine , the official Xinhua news agency quoted the government as saying . Mexican health ministry spokesman Carlos Olmos said the government was testing thousands of samples to confirm which patients with severe respiratory symptoms were actually infected with the flu . He said more than 5,000 tests had been done on suspected cases and that 1,578 people were ill but were being treated . After the virus was identified on April 23 , Mexico banned public events and shut schools , bars , restaurants and many businesses to prevent people from gathering . Officials say disinfection of public spaces has helped control its spread . Schools in the capital will reopen on Monday . But the state government of Jalisco , home to Mexico 's second-largest city Guadalajara , said schools , nightclubs and theaters there will remain shut for another week after three suspected flu deaths .

The WHO tally tends to lag national reports but is considered more definitive . The U.N. agency said Mexico has reported 1,626 confirmed cases , up from 1,364 on Saturday , and repeated that 45 people have died there from the new flu strain that is a genetic mixture of swine , bird and human viruses . The Mexican government has said the worst is over and eased restrictions on commercial and public activity in the country that has been at the epicentre of the outbreak . The WHO 's latest flu tally increased the number of confirmed infections in the United States to 2,254 from 1,639 reported on Saturday , while the number of reported deaths remained at two . U.S. officials on Saturday said a man died from the new flu in Washington state last week , bringing the toll in the United States to three . WHO increased the number of infections in Canada to 280 , from 242 , and repeated one person had died there . It said one person had also died in Costa Rica , which had eight confirmed cases . European countries with cases confirmed in WHO laboratories include Spain -LRB- 93 -RRB- , Britain -LRB- 39 -RRB- , Germany -LRB- 11 -RRB- , Italy -LRB- 9 -RRB- , France -LRB- 12 -RRB- , Portugal -LRB- 1 -RRB- , Ireland -LRB- 1 -RRB- , Netherlands -LRB- 3 -RRB- , Austria -LRB- 1 -RRB- , Denmark -LRB- 1 -RRB- , Sweden -LRB- 1 -RRB- , Switzerland -LRB- 1 -RRB- and Poland -LRB- 1 -RRB- .

Mexican clubs have stormed out of the South American Libertadores Cup after a row over the H1N1 flu outbreak and the national side will no longer take part at the Copa America . `` The game is over for us , '' said Justino Compean , president of the Mexican Football Federation -LRB- FMF -RRB- . Mexican authorities threw their toys out of the pram after Brazilian champions Sao Paulo and Uruguay 's Nacional declined to travel to the country to face Guadalajara and San Luis respectively in the Libertadores Cup second round . Yet , the weekend 's league matches in both Guadalajara and San Luis were played behind closed doors under the orders of the FMF itself because both are considered to be in regions where there is thought to be a higher risk of the virus . Given the circumstances , it seemed premature , to say the least , to claim that either city would make an appropriate venue for an international sporting fixture . Some commentators , notably David Faitelson writing for the Mexican edition of ESPN 's Web site , have questioned whether any football at all should be played in Mexico in the present circumstances . `` Has anyone asked the players what they think ? '' Most media have reported matches as if almost nothing unusual was going on -- either this weekend , when clubs in some regions were allowed to admit fans under strict conditions , or the previous one , when all games were played behind closed doors . There is also the matter of Mexico 's uncomfortable relationship with the South American confederation . Mexican clubs have been taking part in the Libertadores , the regions 's equivalent of the Champions League , for more than a decade under a special agreement . They also play in the Copa Sudamericana , a sort of UEFA Cup-type contest , and the national team has been a guest at the Copa America since 1993 . But it has never been the happiest of relationships . Mexican officials and media often complain that their teams have received second class treatment at the hands of referees and disciplinary commissions , yet there is also the feeling that the Mexicans only take the Libertadores seriously when it suits them . The Mexicans have repeatedly failed to send their top clubs to the Libertadores , instead organising an `` Interliga '' tournament , involving eight teams and played in the United States , to decide who qualifies . This frequently results in midtable teams representing the country , making a mockery of the Libertadores . Two years ago , Mexican club America fielded a reserve team in their quarter-final tie against Brazil 's Santos because of a clash with local matches , which the FMF refused to re-scheduled . A greater insult to their hosts would have been harder to imagine . Perhaps Mexico s withdrawal will be cheered by much of the continent .

REUTERS\\/Henry Romero Obviously you do n't know anything about soccer . Only Brazilian teams and a couple of teams in Argentina could be considered superior . It is mostly because of the infrastructure of the Mexican Soccer Federation . Without Mexico they have no money , read the news , the Conmebol is asking Mexico to reconsider its position . All the companies that are willing to put money into the Copa libertadores do it because of the Mexican teams . Maybe you do n't agree but it is the truth . They are not doing any favor to Mexico . Libertadores is the most boring tournament in soccer . Mexico , Argentina and Brazil are the only countries with leagues big enough to send more than two competitive teams to the Libertadores . Without Mexico the tournament will be even more boring than usual . As far as Mexican soccer goes , they pay European salaries to mediocre players and Mexican fans are too stupid to realize it . . or they just do n't care . Rome had bread and circuses , Mexico has cheap beer and soccer . Check out the FIFA club rankings and you will see that Mexiaco 's top clubs rarely break the top 35 in the world . Trust me the argentinian and brasilian leagues are the most competives besides if you knew about football , then you \\ 'd realize mexico isnt even supposed to go in the Libertadores cup . there just invited since the other teams are way to damn pathetic to even pass the first round . also Libertadores isn \\ ' t the most boring tournament in football , way better than the MLS and is equaled only by the Champions league in Europe .

They studied 300 mestizos -- people of mixed ethnic heritage -- and found many different genetic variations that pointed to Indian , European and African ancestry . They also compared these sequences to those found among 30 ethnic Indians . `` This study makes clear that Latin Americans with mixed ancestry are different enough from other people worldwide that a full-scale genomic mapping project would be wise both scientifically and economically , '' said Dr. Julio Frenk of the Harvard School of Public Health , a former Mexican minister of health . `` It would allow doctors to analyze fewer genetic markers when diagnosing the risk that a patient will develop a disease that depends on complex factors . '' Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the researchers said they found 89 common gene variations that could not be found in the so-called HapMap Project -- an international collaboration cataloging genetic similarities and differences among human beings . `` This effort will contribute to the design of better strategies aimed at characterizing the genetic factors underlying common complex diseases in Mexicans , '' wrote Gerardo Jimenez-Sanchez and colleagues at Mexico 's National Institute of Genomic Medicine . `` In addition , this information will increase our knowledge of genomic variability in Latino populations . '' The findings apply more broadly than only Mexico , Jimenez-Sanchez and colleagues said . `` More than 560 million people live in Latin American countries , and according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates the Latino population reached 45.5 million in 2007 , representing the largest and fastest-growing minority group in the United States , '' they wrote .

An outbreak of the new strain , known as swine flu , that has killed at least 53 people -- mainly in Mexico -- has prompted some countries to ban pork from countries reporting human cases , even though officials have said there is no risk of spreading the virus by eating pork . However , some pork producers are unsure how the virus could affect their animals . The 22 piglets infected with the new virus showed flu-like symptoms between one and four days after infection and were shedding virus -- meaning they could spread it -- two days after infection , the researchers said . None of the animals , also infected with the less dangerous H3N2 subtype , died , Roongroje Thanawongnuwech and colleagues from Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok reported . `` The results of this study may assist in the prevention and control of swine influenza virus in Thailand , '' the researchers wrote in BioMed Central 's Virology Journal . The new virus is a complex mix of swine viruses with avian and human bits , though nobody knows exactly where the new infection that first emerged in Mexico originated . Influenza viruses mutate constantly and they also swap genetic material with one another promiscuously , especially if an animal or person is infected with two strains at once . The team found that all infected pigs developed respiratory symptoms such as nasal discharge , coughing , sneezing and conjunctivitis . They also developed lung lesions large enough to be seen by the naked eye . The lesions were characterised by dark plum-coloured , areas on the lung and were most severe two days after infection . This was especially the case in the H1N1-infected pigs , where about a third of the lung was covered . `` The results demonstrated that both swine flu subtypes were able to induce flu-like symptoms and lung lesions in weanling pigs . However the severity of the disease with regard to both gross and microscopic lung lesions was greater in the H1N1-infected pigs , '' Thanawongnuwech said in a statement . -LRB- Reporting by Michael Kahn ; Editing by Maggie Fox -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "764", "dct": "2009-05-11", "dates": ["2009-05-11", "2009-05-11", "2009-05-11", "2009-04-01", "1918-01-01", "1957-01-01", "1918-01-01", "1957-01-01", "2009-02-15", "2010-01-12"], "text": "By Maggie Fox , Health and Science Editor WASHINGTON | Mon May 11 , 2009 7:45 pm EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The new strain of H1N1 flu that has killed 56 people in Mexico and has been carried around the world by travelers acts more like a pandemic strain than regular seasonal flu , researchers reported on Monday . They said it was transmitted more easily and affects young adults more often than annual flu strains , justifying the World Health Organization 's stepped-up level of pandemic alert , currently a 5 , one step down from a full pandemic . As many as 23,000 Mexicans were likely infected with the swine flu virus , Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London and colleagues reported in the journal Science . They also found evidence to support the theory that the outbreak originated in the village of La Gloria in the state of Veracruz , which had been the subject of intense speculation . `` The dating -LRB- of the outbreak -RRB- was consistent with that , '' Christophe Fraser of Imperial College London said in a telephone interview . The World Health Organization Rapid Pandemic Assessment Collaboration looked at both the pattern of disease spread and the early genetic analysis of the virus . `` I think the most important thing we found was the rate of spread and the extent of spread is similar to what has been seen in previous pandemics , '' Fraser added . `` Our estimates suggest that 23,000 individuals had been infected in Mexico by late April , giving an estimated case fatality ratio of 0.4 percent based on confirmed and suspect deaths reported to that time , '' they wrote . `` Thus while substantial uncertainty remains , clinical severity appears less than that seen in 1918 but comparable with that seen in 1957 . '' The 1918 pandemic was the worst of the 20th century , killing anywhere between 25 million and 100 million people , depending on estimates . It was the first appearance of the H1N1 virus . The 1957 pandemic of H2N2 killed an estimated 2 million people globally . Seasonal flu kills about 250,000 to 500,000 people annually with a fatality rate of less than 0.1 percent . Looking at the pattern in La Gloria , the researchers said it looked as if the virus was transmitted human to human over 14 to 73 generations -- meaning one person infected another , who infected another , up to 73 times . `` Transmissibility is therefore substantially higher than seasonal flu , '' they wrote . The first case was seen in La Gloria around February 15 , they wrote , citing reports and not hard evidence . But quick genetic analysis suggests the virus may have first infected someone around January 12 . `` As the epidemic spreads further , it is likely that severity will vary from country to country depending on health care resources and the public health measures adopted to mitigate impact , '' they added . Globally , WHO has confirmed 4,694 infections in 30 countries . Sixty deaths have been confirmed , most in Mexico with three in the United States and one in Canada . While it is widespread across the United States , WHO said the new H1N1 virus shows no signs of sustained person-to-person spread outside of North America . -LRB- Editing by Julie Steenhuysen and Will Dunham -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "174", "dct": "2009-05-12", "dates": ["2009-05-12", "2009-05-12", "2009-05-01"], "text": "HONG KONG | Tue May 12 , 2009 7:58 am EDT HONG KONG -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The next time you cough or sneeze , there is good reason to cover your mouth . As many as 20,000 viruses are expelled in an average cough , which may be sufficient to infect many people -- particularly those who are not vaccinated . Julian Tang , a consultant at Singapore 's National University Hospital 's Division of Microbiology , said as many as 3,000 tiny droplets are produced in a standard cough . Using previous research on influenza viral loads in nasal secretions , and assuming that each coughed airborne droplet measures between 1 to 5 micrometers in diameter , that adds up to many , many viruses in a single cough . A micrometer , or micron , is one millionth of a meter , or one thousandth of a millimeter . `` Based on this research and assuming about 3,000 droplets are produced per cough , this range of influenza viruses produced per cough is about 195 to 19,500 , '' Tang told Reuters . He added that this figure of 3,000 droplets refers to those that remain suspended in the air for considerable periods -- long enough to infect people . `` This -LRB- 3,000 -RRB- is also the number of droplets estimated to remain suspended in air for long periods -- so-called droplet nuclei . Larger droplets carrying influenza viruses may also be produced during a cough , but these will fall to the ground relatively quickly and will no longer be considered to be significant in the airborne transmission of influenza , '' he said . With a new H1N1 influenza virus spreading around the world , governments in many countries have revived advertisements entreating people to observe personal hygiene . In Indonesia , a slick TV advertisement features a young woman remonstrating a suitor at a village sing-a-long , telling him to get to a health clinic because `` that 's not a normal cough . '' Aimed at the poorly-educated masses , the adverts are set to a dangdut -LRB- traditional pop music -RRB- theme and feature an easy-to-remember slogan and theme song . However , experts are uncertain as to what constitutes an infective dose when it comes to influenza viruses . But as a guide , previous research has found that it takes just one to 10 organisms to cause viral hemorrhagic fevers , and 10 to 100 organisms to cause viral encephalitis . Tang said an infective dose of flu virus would depend on a variety of factors , such as the constitution of people breathing in these droplets and whether they had been vaccinated . `` It is difficult to give an exact number for the infectious dose -- and this may even differ for the same individual throughout the year . But probably for immune people , the infectious dose will be higher than for non-immune people -- hence , the benefits of vaccination , '' Tang said . `` Those previously vaccinated or naturally infected to the same or similar virus can develop a rapid antibody response and clear the virus in the respiratory tract before the virus can take hold and cause disease . '' '' -LRB- But -RRB- even immune hosts may develop symptoms if the viral load exposure is sufficiently high , '' he added . Doctors say most airborne flu transmissions occur within a one meter range , although it can also be transmitted by direct contact with contaminated objects , like toys . `` Wearing masks may well help to reduce the transmission of these infections , as well as covering the mouth with your hand or a tissue when coughing or sneezing -- simply by using a barrier to prevent dissemination of the virus , '' Tang said .

Full Article ANALYSIS - Egypt 's pig cull fans sectarian tension Egyptian workers struggle to move a household pig into a truck to send it to the main slaughterhouse in the Manshiyat Nasser area in Cairo , May 4 , 2009 . CAIRO | Tue May 12 , 2009 3:16 pm IST CAIRO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Egypt 's decision to ignore U.N. advice and cull its pigs over flu fears has unintentionally fanned sectarian tensions in the mainly Muslim country . Pigs in Egypt are primarily reared by Christian garbage collectors who let their animals scavenge on organic household waste in fly-infested slums . They sell the meat , which Muslims consider unclean , largely to other Christians . `` The Christians are Egypt 's garbage men , and we are not liked , '' said Marzouk Badr Adli after taking part in a recent protest against the cull in Cairo 's Manshiet Nasser shantytown . `` We serve the people and they come and cut off our livelihood . '' Egypt , already hit hard by bird flu , ordered the slaughter of all its 300,000 to 400,000 pigs on April 29 as a precaution against the new H1N1 flu virus , commonly known as swine flu , in a move the United Nations said was `` a real mistake '' . Egypt fears another flu virus could spread quickly in a country where most of the roughly 77 million people live in the densely packed Nile Valley , many in crowded Cairo slums . But the swiftness of Egypt 's decision -- taken without a broad public debate -- has left some Christians feeling bitter , especially as the virus has not yet been detected in the most populous Arab country and has not spread from pigs to people . Such bitterness adds to a list of popular frustrations facing the government in Egypt , where a fifth of the people live in grinding poverty , workers grumble about inflation and a global crisis has reined in economic growth . Christians account for about 10 percent of Egypt 's population , spanning all social classes . Relations with Muslims are usually harmonious although disputes over land , religious buildings or women occasionally erupt into violence . It has not helped that truckloads of security forces now stand guard at the entrance to garbage collector slums to help workers enforce the cull order , or that compensation has been low at just 100 Egyptian pounds -LRB- $ 17.79 -RRB- per adult pig . `` We are starting to get concerned at the strong sectarian tone that is beginning to dominate the public discourse , '' said Hossam Bahgat of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights . `` A discourse that implicates Christians with impurity on the one hand and disease on the other could have alarming consequences , '' he added . A government minister has described Egypt 's pigs as a time bomb , an Islamist parliamentarian appeared at a session in a protective mask , and the Coptic pope has stepped in to assure Muslims that most of his people do n't eat pork . The meat is mainly consumed , he says , by foreign tourists and expatriates . `` This is not happening in a vacuum . It is happening in a context of a polarised society and a high degree of sectarian tension , '' Bahgat said of the cull and response . But the decision to cull , while it does disproportionately affect Christians , was not taken for sectarian motives , most analysts agree . Rather , it was a chance for Egypt to rid urban areas of pigs -- something the government has long wanted . Pigs mingle in Cairo with birds , people and livestock in garbage collector slums , slurping up slop from trash brought in from across the city . Egypt has said swine in these areas pose a general health risk because of the unsanitary conditions . Furthermore , some officials have long expressed concerns that garbage collector areas could create an environment conducive for the more deadly H5N1 bird flu virus , now endemic in Egyptian poultry , to mutate or jump species . `` I do n't think that everything originated just to deal a blow to the Christians under the sectarian umbrella , '' said Youssef Sidhom , editor of a secular Coptic weekly , adding that the government was perhaps overly willing to respond to an H1N1 flu panic in parliament , fed at least partly by Islamists . `` It was irrational and it was foolish and it was rushed , '' he said of the decision . `` I ca n't understand the rush ... So , yes , the government has acted in an insensitive manner . '' Egypt , citing concerns over bird flu , had earlier sought to relocate pigs to a desert satellite city , but had not found the political will to do so before the swine flu crisis hit , even as it saw a surge in bird flu cases this year . Egypt 's main state newspaper initially said the state could pay 1,000 pounds per pig as compensation . But the government ultimately decided to hand the carcasses back to owners for consumption along with the much smaller amount of cash . Christian garbage collectors have since clashed with police in at least one garbage collector area . Meanwhile , some Muslims have expressed fear that an influx of pork from culled pigs could end up in their ground lamb or beef . Analysts note , however , that the tensions were not purely sectarian in nature . The cull had also ignited class resentments as it dealt a huge economic blow to an already marginalised community , with little apparent sympathy from the state . `` Everything becomes politicised into sectarian stuff in Egypt , '' said Laila Iskandar , a consultant who has worked with the garbage collectors . `` This is just one more of those things .

Nikki Shindo , a medical officer with the WHO 's global flu program , said the U.N. agency would soon publish new guidance about how to treat patients with the virus that has caused mainly mild symptoms outside of Mexico . Given most patients can recover with rest and hydration , Shindo said there did not appear to be a need to treat all people infected with the strain with Tamiflu , Relenza , and similar antiviral drugs . Saving such stockpiles for pregnant women and patients with underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes may prove most prudent , she told a news conference . `` We will recommend to consider the use of antivirals for high risk groups , '' Shindo said , while allowing that because little is known about the new strain , it was possible antiviral drug use could be reducing its impact in Europe and elsewhere . `` It could be the reason why we are seeing less severe cases in Europe , '' she said in response to a journalist 's question . But comparisons between regions were difficult due to a lack of control studies . Shindo told reporters that about 10 percent of people known to have been infected with the strain known popularly as `` swine flu '' in Mexico and the United States required to be admitted to hospital -- far more than seen in regular seasonal flu . `` That I think has rightly urged the development and delivery of pandemic influenza vaccine , '' she told a news conference . `` We are also facing the risk of having resistant viruses , '' she said , noting that antiviral drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza have varying effectiveness against flu viruses as they mutate . `` Given that we will have winter in southern American countries and also other parts of the southern hemisphere , there will be a risk of having viruses that will be highly resistant to antivirals , '' Shindo said . -LRB- Reporting by Laura MacInnis and Stephanie Nebehay -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "913", "dct": "2009-05-12", "dates": ["2009-05-12", "2009-05-12", "2009-05-12", "2009-05-12", "1918-01-01", "1968-01-01", "2009-05-11"], "text": "GENEVA | Tue May 12 , 2009 11:35 am EDT GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The new H1N1 flu virus could still mutate into a more virulent form and spark an influenza pandemic that could be expected to circle the globe up to three times , the World Health Organization said on Tuesday . The impact of any pandemic would vary , as a virus that causes only mild illness in countries with strong health systems can become `` devastating '' in those with weak health systems , shortages of drugs and poorly equipped hospitals , it said . The new virus , commonly referred to as swine flu , `` appears to be more contagious than seasonal influenza '' and nearly the world 's whole population lacks immunity to the new disease , the WHO said in a document issued overnight entitled `` Assessing the severity of an influenza pandemic . '' `` It attempts to explain different aspects of severity , not just the pathogenicity of the virus but its impact on health and social systems , '' WHO spokesman Thomas Abraham told Reuters . `` It is in response to questions from the public and media . '' The United Nations agency 's pandemic alert level is at 5 , its second-highest level on a scale of 1 to 6 , he said . This means that the virus shows no signs of sustained person-to-person spread outside North America . Some 5,251 people have been infected in 30 countries , according to WHO 's tally on Tuesday , which includes 61 deaths . Hardest hit are Mexico with 2,059 cases , including 56 deaths , and the United States with 2,600 cases including three deaths . So far , with the exception of the deadly outbreaks in Mexico , the virus has tended to cause very mild illness in otherwise healthy people , it said . But influenza viruses mutate frequently and unpredictably and `` the emergence of an inherently more virulent virus during the course of a pandemic can never be ruled out , '' the WHO said . CIRCLING THE GLOBE IN WAVES `` The overall severity of a pandemic is further influenced by the tendency of pandemics to encircle the globe in at least two , sometimes three , waves , '' the WHO said . `` For many reasons , the severity of subsequent waves can differ dramatically in some or even most countries , '' it said . The 1918 influenza pandemic -- which killed tens of millions of people -- began mild and returned within six months in a much more lethal form , it said . The 1968 pandemic began relatively mild , with sporadic cases prior to the first wave , and remained mild in its second wave in most , but not all countries , it said . The new virus appears to be more easily spread than seasonal flu . Regular seasonal flu kills about 250,000 to 500,000 people annually with a fatality rate of less than 0.1 percent . Seasonal flu has a so-called `` secondary attack rate '' -- the percentage of contacts who catch it from an infected person -- of between 5 and 15 percent , according to the WHO . `` Current estimates of the secondary attack rate of H1N1 range from 22 to 33 percent , '' it said . Outside Mexico , nearly all cases of illness and all deaths have been in people with underlying chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease , asthma and diabetes , according to WHO which has consulted widely with experts in affected countries . In Mexico and the United States -- the two largest and best documented outbreaks to date -- a younger age group has been affected than during seasonal epidemics of influenza , it said . `` Though cases have been confirmed in all age groups , from infants to the elderly , the youth of patients with severe or lethal infections is a striking feature of these early outbreaks , '' it said . WHO acting assistant director-general Keiji Fukuda said on Monday it was not possible to produce a scientific assessment of the severity of the outbreak , on the lines of a hurricane warning , because of the unpredictable nature of the disease and the fact that different people and different countries experience the flu in different ways .

The new virus , which has infected 5,251 people in 30 countries and killed 61 , has displayed great efficiency in spreading among people , said Guan Yi , a microbiologist with the University of Hong Kong . `` This virus has been around only a few months , it is very unstable ... and we know that its presence is dramatically increasing in human population , so the chance of it meeting with H5N1 is actually increased , '' Guan said in an interview on Tuesday . `` Both H1N1 and H5N1 are unstable so the chances of them exchanging genetic material are higher , whereas a stable -LRB- seasonal flu -RRB- virus is less likely to take on genetic material . '' While H1N1 appears to be mild so far with many infected people recovering even without treatment , the H5N1 has a mortality rate of between 60 to 70 percent . Experts are fearful about the emergence of a hybrid which combines the killing power of the H5N1 with the efficient transmissibility of H1N1 . H5N1 is believed to be endemic in countries like China , Indonesia , Vietnam and Egypt . Guan , an expert on both the H5N1 and SARS , has analyzed the genetic sequences of the new virus , which is a triple reassortant containing genetic material from swine , human and bird . He said there was a huge information gap due to a lack of regular surveillance on animal disease . Each one of the eight gene segments in the new virus has been seen in pigs in the past 10 years , but experts have no clue when this new H1N1 virus strain first appeared and in which animal species it had been incubating , Guan said . `` We know when each gene segment appeared , but we do n't know when this strain first appeared , there is an information gap of about five to 10 years , from 1999 to 2009 . If there was regular surveillance , we would know when this virus came about , '' he said . `` We do n't know if this reassortment happened in pigs or human ... It 's likely to have come from pigs because all the segments have been found in pigs , but we ca n't be 100 percent sure . '' Guan backed stringent moves taken by some governments to keep the virus at bay , such as quarantining . `` They are useful because we are now fighting for time to develop vaccines and antivirals , which will then minimize its impact on people -LRB- over the longer term -RRB- , '' he said . `` Already it appears to more virulent than seasonal flu because it is killing younger people and it appears to have higher mortality than seasonal flu , so it does n't make sense to treat this like seasonal flu . '' Seasonal flu kills about 250,000 to 500,000 people annually with a fatality rate of less than 0.1 percent .

An estimated $ 800 billion in fake cigarettes , branded shoes , bags and belts , and pirated movies flowed across the globe in 2007 , Stephen Sayell , vice president of Hong Kong-based Asia Risk group , told Reuters . That figure is expected to rise 20 percent this year . `` As the global financial crisis deepens , the demand for much cheaper consumer goods rises , boosting sales of counterfeiters and movie pirates , '' Sayell said on the sidelines of a three-day anti-terrorism seminar in Manila . Sayell said trade in counterfeit products has exceeded the global narcotics trade , worth more than $ 400 billion a year , citing studies made by his security consultancy group . Proceeds from the sale of counterfeit cigarettes , CDs and DVDs and branded consumer goods could be funding terrorist groups around the world because the activities are considered high profit and low-risk , he added . A former Scotland Yard officer , Sayell cited his experience in dealing with the Irish Republican Army 's counterfeiting operations to raise funds for their campaign against British rule in Northern Ireland . `` The IRA shifted from extorting money from the people to distributing pirated movies because they do n't find anything wrong stealing from Steven Spielberg , '' he added . John Enoch , another Asia Risk executive based in Singapore , warned of the potential spread of fake anti-viral drugs in the face of the global scare of a new deadly strain of flu virus that has killed over 50 people and infected more than 5,000 worldwide . `` We expect a boom in counterfeit medicines and vaccines against flu , '' Enoch said , warning of potential high risk of a public health threat because of the improper use of anti-viral drugs .

Keiji Fukuda , acting WHO assistant director-general , said the United Nations agency was maintaining its pandemic alert at the second-highest notch of 5 despite the virus having caused 6,497 infections in 33 countries . `` If we see changes in the severity we will let the world know about that , '' he told a news conference . `` This is an event that is serious and that requires close monitoring . '' The Phase 5 designation means a pandemic is imminent . Leading vaccine makers including GlaxoSmithKline , Sanofi-Aventis , Novartis and Baxter International are awaiting guidance from the WHO about whether to start manufacturing vaccines for a pandemic instead of seasonal flu . Vaccine experts convened by the WHO on Thursday did not reach a firm conclusion about whether such a switch should take place , or whether the H1N1 strain should be included in the mixture of the seasonal flu jab , Fukuda said . `` There will be additional meetings , '' he said after that teleconference drawing together pharmaceutical representatives and health officials , which he said ended with `` no big decisions , no pronouncements . '' Because seasonal flu kills up to 500,000 people a year , health officials have been calling for the continued production of vaccines for at-risk people including the elderly , pregnant women , and people with other health conditions like asthma . A WHO medical officer told reporters earlier this week that such groups should also have priority in the distribution of antiviral drugs that have been shown to work against the H1N1 strain , which is a mixture of swine , bird and human viruses . But Fukuda stressed on Thursday that the WHO did not plan to alter its guidance on when and whether to prescribe antivirals like Roche 's Tamiflu or GlaxoSmithKline 's Relenza , saying this was at countries ' discretion . `` WHO is not making any changes in its recommendations on antivirals , '' he told the news conference . The United Nations agency has convened an intergovernmental meeting about the sharing of flu virus samples -- which vaccine makers need to formulate the ingredients of jabs -- at its Geneva headquarters on Friday . The flu and global needs for antiviral drugs and pandemic vaccines are also expected to dominate next week 's World Health Assembly , an annual meeting that will draw top health officials from around the world to Geneva . According to the latest WHO tally , 65 people have died from infection with the H1N1 virus , which remains most prevalent in North America . Evidence that the flu is spreading in a sustained way in Europe , Asia or elsewhere would cause the WHO to raise the pandemic alert to the top level of 6 .

Dr. Thomas Frieden , 48 , who has been New York City 's top health official since 2002 , will head the federal agency charged with protecting Americans from illnesses ranging from heart disease to new flu strains .

He will take over as director of an organization that has been central to global efforts to combat the H1N1 flu virus . The illness , also known as swine flu , has killed 65 people , most in Mexico and infected nearly 6,500 people in 33 nations . `` Frieden is an expert in preparedness and response to health emergencies , and has been at the forefront of the fight against heart disease , cancer and obesity , infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and AIDS , '' the White House said in a statement . `` Frieden has been a leader in the fight for health care reform , and his experiences confronting public health challenges in our country and abroad will be essential in this new role , '' it said . In New York he spearheaded the country 's biggest community-based electronic health record project in an effort to improve preventive care . Frieden also worked in India for five years on tuberculosis control and has experience as an epidemiologist , administrator , teacher , researcher , clinician and community organizer . Frieden , who will start his job in June , told a news conference he was `` deeply honored '' by the appointment . The new CDC director brings `` real world experience fighting AIDS '' to the agency , according to The AIDS Healthcare Foundation , the largest HIV\\/AIDS organization in the country . Frieden has pressed for expanding routine testing for AIDS as a first step to controlling a virus that is spreading in the United States among minorities , gay and bisexual men and many women . Jeff Levi of the Trust for America 's Health , an advocacy and study group often critical of U.S. health policy , described Frieden as a bold leader who could reinvigorate the CDC . But he argued that the agency 's director is often a passive diplomat with fewer powers of direct persuasion than a state or city health officer and that the organization must wait to be invited by state authorities or governments to intervene . In evidence of divided reaction to some of Frieden 's decisions in New York , the Center for Consumer Freedom , a coalition supported by restaurants , food companies and consumers , called Frieden an `` over-zealous activist '' . Frieden `` does n't give any consideration to personal responsibility or privacy '' when it comes to health , said Justin Wilson , a research analyst for the center . Frieden will likely follow the lead of former CDC director Dr. Julie Gerberding in becoming a visible spokesperson for the agency . The CDC has been headed by acting director Dr. Richard Besser since Gerberding resigned in January . Besser became the public face of the organization 's fight against H1N1 during daily televised news briefings . He will continue in his role coordinating CDC 's office of terrorism preparedness and emergency response , the statement said . The CDC , based in Atlanta , has a budget of around $ 9 billion and is responsible for tracking diseases across the United States and helping other countries battle outbreaks of diseases ranging from H5N1 avian influenza to Ebola .

'' Even for the Japanese , who wear flu and hay fever masks by the million , sometimes when they 're not even sick , washing hands thoroughly for at least 15 seconds requires extra effort , as not many of us are well-versed in proper thumb-washing techniques . The government also has a `` cough etiquette '' campaign calling on people to cover their mouths with a tissue when in the act , adding the rather obvious need to face away from other people . The guideline says post-cough dirty tissues must be thrown away immediately , although it does n't say where - a slight drawback in a country that is occasionaly trashcan-challenged . Japan reported its first confirmed cases of the new flu recently and now has four patients , detected at Narita international Airport and sent directly to a hospital nearby to limit the spread of H1N1 . The government continues to have health officials board planes from Mexico , the United States and Canada to check passengers , including using portable thermal sensors to find people with fever . A Reuters colleague went through on-board medical checks lasting more than one hour last week . `` In the U.S. , everything was more relaxed , '' she told me the other day . `` Some people were getting irritated by the wait on the plane but no one was angry . As we had to wait for all passengers to be inspected , a flight attendant announced results of the NBA playoffs to take our minds off our frustration . '' Handed a mask to wear when leaving the plane , she got a call a few days later from a local public health center that took down her contact numbers , travel history and health conditions after the flight . Despite these efforts , it seems like it 's just a matter of time before the disease spreads around the country , whether or not we wash our hands and cough correctly .

The H1N1 influenza outbreak which has spread around the world from Mexico and the United States , leading the World Health Organisation to declare a flu pandemic is imminent , has given added urgency to the work of the intergovernmental meeting , set up two years ago by the WHO . The meeting agreed late on Saturday after a good-humored two-day session to forward a framework agreement on sharing influenza viruses and on access to vaccine benefits -- including its gaps to next week 's World Health Assembly -LRB- WHA -RRB- at the WHO . The assembly can then decide how to work further on the agreement , either during its meeting -- truncated because of the swine flu outbreak -- or later . Jane Halton , the top official in Australia 's Health and Aging Department , who chaired the meeting , told delegates they had achieved a significant amount of work . `` Yes , we acknowledge here that there are matters we have not resolved , and yes , they are difficult , but I do think a good body of material has been produced , '' she said . The meeting was set up in 2007 amid a scare about H5N1 influenza , or bird flu , which is often fatal to humans , as part of the WHO 's efforts to prepare for a pandemic . The WHO wanted to ensure that virus samples would be circulated to laboratories and drug firms around the world so that they could produce a vaccine against the disease . Poor countries argued they should have access to the resulting vaccines , especially if the samples came from the developing world . But rich countries led by the United States wanted pharmaceuticals companies to be able to claim the vaccines as intellectual property and earn royalties on them . In 2006 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control -LRB- CDC -RRB- lodged a patent application for a new flu vaccine , and filed it with the World Intellectual Property Organisation in 2007 . The new vaccine incorporated genes from an H5N1 strain isolated from an Indonesian victim of bird flu in 2005 . But in 2007 Indonesia refused to share H5N1 virus samples without guarantees that any vaccines derived from them would be made available to poorer countries at an affordable price . The main sticking point remains the wording of a standard agreement on transferring material , and some intellectual property questions . Developing countries wanted a comprehensive material transfer agreement , while rich countries were against any agreement but eventually settled for a simple one . Abdulsalami Nasidi , a senior Nigerian health ministry official , told reporters the meeting had cleared up many unresolved issues . Delegates virtually agreed to free biological material moving through the WHO network from intellectual property rules , he said . WHO Director-General Margaret Chan has already implemented some things agreed in the meeting 's two years , on traceability of material and benefit-sharing , Halton told reporters . `` The reality is the system can and will happen and in fact the work that 's been done in a number of these areas has been adopted , '' she said . GlaxoSmithKline , Sanofi-Aventis , Novartis , Baxter International and other drug makers are awaiting WHO guidance about whether to start mass-producing vaccines to fight H1N1 , which may force them to cut production of seasonal flu shots .

The city of Kobe is closing some schools for a week after eight people , including the three students , were confirmed as being infected with the disease , also known as swine flu , Kyodo news agency reported . `` We are just watching the developments very carefully , '' acting assistant Director-General Keiji Fukuda told reporters . But Fukuda said it was not clear at this stage whether the outbreak in Japan would cause the WHO to declare a full pandemic , raising its alert level to the top of a 6-point scale . The WHO raised its pandemic alert on April 29 to 5 on the scale , meaning a pandemic is imminent . Proof the disease was spreading in a region outside North America , where it originated , would trigger an increase to 6 . `` If we go to phase 6 the events could happen anywhere , they could happen in Europe , they can happen in South America , they could happen in Asia , '' he said .

The number of countries reporting confirmed cases of H1N1 , has risen to 36 with Ecuador and Peru confirming their first cases , the WHO said in its daily update .

U.S. health officials also expressed concern about who the new swine flu virus is infecting -- mostly children , teens and young adults -- and outbreaks in schools . Ministers and experts began a meeting in Geneva to discuss how to fight the virus with vaccines and drugs , as well as what would trigger the WHO to declare a full pandemic . `` For the first time in humanity , we are seeing , or we may be seeing , pandemic influenza evolving in front of our eyes , '' WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan told her U.N. agency 's World Health Assembly . New York City recorded its first death from the virus and Chile reported two new cases , adding to its first two cases reported on Sunday . Japan also confirmed that 125 people , many of whom had not been abroad , had been infected with the new strain . Tests confirmed the first case in Greece , a Greek man traveling from the United States , the Health Ministry said . Forty countries have confirmed cases of the new strain . Almost all of the 74 dead were in Mexico , but mostly , people have had relatively mild symptoms . Addressing the WHO 's annual congress , Tonga 's health minister said it was lucky the H1N1 strain had spread first to affluent countries such as the United States , Canada , and Japan . `` Somehow , somebody decided to start this epidemic in very rich countries ... This helped all of us , '' said Health Minister Viliami Tangi . Poor countries lack the medical staff , laboratories , drug stockpiles , and vaccine-making capacity to deal with the outbreak in a sophisticated manner , he said . Chan said H1N1 may pose a particular risk if it somehow mixed with the H5N1 avian flu virus , now entrenched in poultry in several countries . `` No one can say how this avian virus will behave when pressured by large numbers of people infected with the new H1N1 virus , '' she said . Egypt 's envoy noted there had been three new human cases of H5N1 in his country in the last week . Dr Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said most of the 200 or so Americans hospitalized with the new swine flu strain were younger -- as opposed to seasonal flu , which hits the elderly the hardest . `` That 's very unusual , to have so many people under 20 to require hospitalization , and some of them in -LRB- intensive care units -RRB- , '' Schuchat told reporters in a telephone briefing . `` We are now experiencing levels of influenza-like illness that are higher than usual for this time of year , '' Schuchat added . `` We are also seeing outbreaks in schools , which is extremely unusual for this time of year . '' New York City health officials said 16 schools were closed there due to outbreaks . Most of Japan 's new infections were among high school students in the western prefectures of Hyogo and Osaka who had not traveled abroad , the Health Ministry said . But Canada lifted travel warnings about Mexico . `` With the H1N1 virus circulating within Canada , travel to Mexico is no longer a heightened risk factor for the spread of the virus , '' Chief Public Health Officer Dr David Butler-Jones told a conference call with reporters . WHO raised its global pandemic alert level last month to 5 on a 6-point scale . WHO has said it is watching the situation in Japan closely , but it was not clear yet whether the outbreak , the largest outside the Americas , would trigger a move to level 6 . Under WHO rules , signs that the disease is spreading in a sustained way in a second region of the world would prompt a declaration that a full pandemic is under way . Other large clusters have been seen in Spain and Britain . A WHO designation of a full pandemic would put countries on even higher alert about the flu strain and give more impetus to pharmaceutical efforts to fight it . Chan and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will meet pharmaceutical executives on Tuesday to discuss their ability to make vaccines to fight the strain . Delegates will seek an agreement on how samples of the virus should be handled and shared with pharmaceutical companies . However , rich and poor countries remain at odds over whether the biological material can be patented . The meeting will also discuss poor countries ' needs for antiviral drugs like Roche and Gilead Sciences Inc 's Tamiflu and GlaxoSmithKline 's Relenza and any vaccines developed to confront the strain .

The H1N1 swine flu virus killed a vice principal at a New York City school over the weekend and has spread to 48 states . While it appears to be mild , it is affecting a disproportionate number of children , teenagers and young adults . This includes people needing hospitalization -- now up to 200 , said Dr. Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . `` That 's very unusual , to have so many people under 20 to require hospitalization , and some of them in -LRB- intensive care units -RRB- , '' Schuchat told reporters in a telephone briefing . `` We are now experiencing levels of influenza-like illness that are higher than usual for this time of year , '' Schuchat added . `` We are also seeing outbreaks in schools , which is extremely unusual for this time of year . '' New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Frieden agreed with Schuchat . `` We 're seeing increasing numbers of people going to emergency departments saying they have fever and flu , particularly young people in the 5 to 17 age group , '' Frieden , who has been named by U.S. President Barack Obama as the new CDC director , told a news conference . About half of all cases of influenza are being diagnosed as the new H1N1 strain , while the rest are influenza B , or the seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 strains . Flu season in the United States is usually almost over by May . CDC officials say around 100,000 people are likely infected with the new flu strain in the United States and Schuchat said the 5,123 confirmed and probable cases and six deaths in the United States were `` the tip of the iceberg . '' `` We are seeing more reports of influenza-like illness from outpatient visits that we monitor than is typical for this time of year , '' Schuchat said . Because doctors usually treat symptoms and only occasionally give flu tests to patients , the CDC must monitor reports of symptoms such as fever , cough and muscle aches to track flu activity . Some centers are doing actual influenza tests to confirm the patterns that are seen . Influenza is a factor in 36,000 deaths a year in the United States and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths globally , the CDC says . `` Unlike the seasonal flu , we are seeing relatively few cases or hospitalizations in people over 65 , '' Schuchat said . Usually flu kills the elderly and people with chronic diseases . There is no evidence that a second , bacterial infection is worsening the H1N1 cases , Schuchat said . When family members are questioned , it seems clear that children and teens are more prone to infection than older adults , Schuchat said . `` People under 18 are more likely to have infections when another person in the family is infected , '' she said . `` One of our working hypotheses is that older adults may have some pre-existing protection against this virus due to their exposure long ago to some virus that may be distantly related , '' Schuchat said . An alternative hypothesis is that it just has not had a chance to make its way into the older population yet . -LRB- Editing by Julie Steenhuysen and Xavier Briand -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "1196", "dct": "2009-05-18", "dates": ["2009-05-18", "2009-05-18", "2009-05-17", "2009-05-16", "2009-05-18"], "text": "NEW YORK | Mon May 18 , 2009 4:02 pm EDT NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A New York City school principal suffering from swine flu died on Sunday , becoming the city 's first death due to H1N1 flu , medical officials said .

CHREY THOM , Cambodia | Mon May 18 , 2009 11:51 am EDT CHREY THOM , Cambodia -LRB- Reuters Life ! -RRB- - Stir-fried or grilled , Vietnamese ca n't seem to get enough of Cambodian rat meat , and the global influenza outbreak as well as recent heavy rains have proven a boon for both consumers and exporters . In Chrey Thom , a Cambodian town on the border with Vietnam , motorbike after motorbike carries wooden cages full of hundreds of the plump , furry , brown rats . The rains in the Mekong Delta area have helped boost the Cambodian trappers ' catch , as more rats rush out from their flooded holes and into waiting cages . `` There were so many rodents we just ca n't eat them all , so we need to export lots more to Vietnam , '' Cambodian rat trader Kang Chanthan told Reuters . `` It 's good business . '' `` If you prepare them well and fry the meat with garlic and put some mint on it , they 're tastier than chickens , '' he added . Worries about swine flu , as the H1N1 influenza virus was first called , may have also spurred demand . The spread of H1N1 flu was not caused by pigs and pork , but many people and governments have reacted to the name . `` Rat meat substitutes well for pork these days , '' said Khe Le , adding that her family exported up to a ton of live rats across the border on good days . Rat meat was eaten in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge regime in the 1970s and for some time afterwards when little else was available . The poor took to rat meat last year when the price of other meat soared , but younger Cambodians tend to avoid it . In Vietnam , rat meat is something of a delicacy . Online Vietnamese newspaper , VietNamNet Bridge , said more than 35 metric tons of rat meat a day was imported from Cambodia . Cambodian officials said they did not keep records of this aspect of bilateral trade but reckoned the figure was realistic . `` The high season for catching rats has returned for the farmers in my district , where I see several thousand kilos of live rats transported every day to Vietnam , '' said Ly Marong , an agriculture official in Koh Thom district on the border . Live rats sold for $ 1 per kilo and dead ones -- used for feeding crocodiles in Vietnam -- went for $ 0.37 , officials said . `` Some rats are as big as piglets , 2 kilos , and that has intrigued the Vietnamese . They see them as wild animals and they find them tasty , '' Marong said . Bun Tuon Simona , a Cambodian official in the southern province of Kandal , said the Vietnamese appetite for rat meat has helped a government campaign to get rid of the rodents that were destroying rice fields . `` Before , we rewarded farmers with milled rice in exchange for a rat 's tail after they killed one . Now it 's not a problem . They catch the rat and can sell it to make some money on top of what they get from farming , '' he said . Cambodian farmer Chan Pakdeiratha , whose family has rather taken to the meat , said the rats gave birth three times a month and had about 15 babies each time . `` If we do n't catch them this year , they 'll destroy our crops next harvest , '' he said .

But as Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou , a leading figure behind that friendship , reaches his first anniversary in office on May 20 , the two sides have shown they 're ready to back away from each other again . Ma 's first year saw what few could have imagined even two years ago , never mind 60 , when Chiang Kai-shek 's Nationalists fled to Taiwan from China after losing the Chinese civil war to Mao Zedong 's Communists . China still claims sovereignty over democratic , self-ruled Taiwan and has threatened to take it by force if necessary . It has said the two sides must ultimately be united . Dropping the hardball that characterised previous Taiwan presidents , Ma 's government has met counterparts from Beijing to work out the first direct flights , a new tourism accord and investment in each other 's markets , all of particular benefit to recession-hit Taiwan . Talks leading to those deals lifted mutual confidence to where China has thundered about fighting problems overseas under Beijing 's ethnic unity banner . China has asked Taiwan , which is 98 percent ethnic Chinese , to help combat the world financial crisis , implying that both were victims of the U.S. economy . More recently it suggested uniting to fight influenza A , which also started overseas . What exactly is China 's grand strategy ? Diplomats , academics and , yes , journalists have spent countless hours , pulled out innumerable hairs and spilled endless ink trying to figure out where the fast-rising power is headed and what it will want when it gets there . But China itself sometimes seems much less sure of its political and economic goals than outside experts believe . Great power can breed great uncertainty about what to do . A vivid illustration of that came in a speech on Friday by Zhou Xiaochuan , China 's central bank governor . Flu bigotry is not a term one usually encounters , but that was the charge hurled at China this week when it quarantined 43 Mexicans , despite none showing symptoms of the H1N1 virus . It was not just an anti-Mexican bias , because China followed up by quarantining 22 Canadian students who were likewise free of symptoms . Many of the Mexicans had at least been on a plane with a person found to have H1N1 ; there was no apparent direct risk for the Canadians , other than their being from a vast country with only one serious flu case . But before accusing China of over-reaction , let alone discrimination , it is worth stepping back to consider the quarantines from Beijing s perspective . Just last week , the World Health Organisation said that a pandemic was imminent . Some have criticised the WHO for panicking , but governments do not have the luxury to second-guess such an authority when it rings the alarm bell . This is all the more true for China . Beijing s laggardly response to SARS in 2003 let the disease spread to the point that authorities had to effectively shut the country down . Excessive caution this time around has been far preferable . The Chinese medical system is still rickety , rural areas lack basic hygiene and buses and trains are overcrowded together combining to make China fertile ground for disease . A week-long quarantine is undoubtedly a deprivation of liberty . Yet if that is what it takes to prevent a global pandemic , surely the precaution is proportionate to the threat .

Nevermind that the World Health Organization has ruled out any risk of infection to humans from eating pork . Police should have brought sandwiches and sodas to the park outside a Taipei hotel where Taiwan negotiators and counterparts from old foe China held talks . Hardly anyone demonstrated against the mid-April meeting . What 's more , over the weekend , as the two sides met more formally in China to sign agreements on trade and finance , Taiwan TV viewers watched news about swine flu in Mexico and the United States or celebrity scandal reruns . Monday morning newspapers ' editorials barely raised the usual spectre of Taiwan sacrificing its democratic self-rule to Communist China in exchange for lucrative trade deals . Many investors and companies are confident that the second part of the bargain will follow that China 's recovery will be just the cure for markets still woozy from the financial battering . Such faith is not yet justified . There is a strong element of farce to covering the North Korea story , which should perhaps come as no surprise considering what an unusual , isolated place it is and how hard verifiable news is to come by . One never knows quite what to believe , with all the strange stories that seep out about Kim Jong-il 's love of pizza , the rants of North Korea 's official KCNA news agency and numerous other bizarre tales , including these two . A proposal to have Chinese `` diving prince '' Tian Liang star as revolutionary model soldier Lei Feng in a television show has prompted an angry response from some of Lei 's former comrades . Lei was idealised by Communist propagandists for his selfless spirit and devotion to the Party and the people , though some historians say his legend has been embellished . As we gathered on bleachers set up about 30 yards from the waiting staircases , the television crews decided to call Chavez over for an inpromptu question-and-answer session . Immediately , the staircases were wheeled away to another spot , more than double the distance from the journalists and certainly well out of earshot . A furious argument ensued , as security guards tried to shove reporters back while maintaining some decorum with the embassy representatives . Chavez descended the stairs , grinning amidst the chaos . At the end of the carpet , he turned and began to talk to reporters , while the Chinese guards tried to edge him towards the cars . A few minutes of talking , with no end in sight , made them more impatient . Amid a new round of pushing , Chavez himself got bumped . North Korea says somewhere up in the sky , a satellite it launched at the weekend is beaming to earth two revolutionary paeans : `` Song of General Kim Il-sung '' for the founder of the reclusive state and `` Song of General Kim Jong-il , '' for the son who succeeded him when he died .

Vaccines are a key weapon to fight any pandemic influenza virus , but the bulk of production is sited in Europe and the United States and health experts and officials in Asia find that worrying . `` Do you actually think that in a really serious pandemic that vaccines will be shipped here -LRB- to Asia -RRB- ? '' said a microbiologist in Hong Kong , who declined to be identified . Even though the new H1N1 appears mild for now , countries like India and Indonesia are keenly aware of their vulnerability and have recently ordered local companies to develop H1N1 vaccines . But Asia lacks sophisticated medical technology , experts say , and while it takes an experienced vaccine maker in the west four to six months to prepare a vaccine , Indonesian drugmaker Bio Farma said last week that it would need two years . Lily Sulistyowati , an official with Indonesia 's Ministry of Health , said that if the country failed to come up with its own vaccine , it would push the WHO to distribute stocks fairly . `` We had the experience with bird flu where we had to line up to buy Tamiflu behind other countries that did n't have any cases . Why should we line up when we have the most cases ? '' `` We hope that wo n't happen again , we should be given priority if we have more cases than other countries , '' she told Reuters . India has invited a number of local drugmakers to submit plans and the government will decide in the coming week which company gets to manufacture the H1N1 vaccine . V.M. Katoch of the Indian Council of Medical Research told Reuters : `` We 'll do our best ... We are very confident , whatever we try to do , we do succeed . '' In Geneva on Saturday , health negotiators from rich and poor countries failed to clinch a full deal on virus sharing to produce vaccines , but said they had closed gaps on some tough political issues . The vast majority of H1N1 cases are in Mexico and the United States but the spread of the disease to at least 39 countries led the WHO to declare a pandemic was imminent at the end of April . Its pandemic alert level is now 5 on a 6-level scale . The WHO , whose data lags national tallies , earlier put the number of confirmed worldwide cases of the flu strain , a mix of swine , human and avian viruses , at 8,480 , with 72 deaths . Ben Cowling , public health expert at the University of Hong Kong , said it would be interesting to see whether governments in Asia forge deals with western vaccine makers . `` Many western countries have agreements with vaccine makers . That 's why phase 6 alert is a big deal because it means we promise to buy vaccines from you , it gives the vaccine producers the assurance that they need -LRB- to go into production -RRB- , '' he said . Nearly all of the world 's flu vaccine factories - which produce 350 million doses annually - are in Europe and the United States . They can ramp up production to 500 million doses , but that 's not enough for a global population of over 6 billion . China , Japan , South Korea and Australia produce seasonal flu vaccines but these are mostly for domestic use and their combined share make up less than 10 percent of the world 's total . `` We are in touch with vaccine makers and have expressed our interest to buy . But there are no details as they have not started production yet , '' a Hong Kong government spokeswoman said . Some countries are relaxed as the virus appears mild so far . Tawee Chotpitayasunondh , head of Thailand 's unit for strategic planning in fighting pandemic flu , said Thailand was `` thinking about vaccine ' but this was not a priority . `` The priority now is how to stop the spread among people to prevent secondary spreading , that is what we are fighting now . '' Major vaccine makers in the west have already obtained the new H1N1 virus samples from the WHO , but the organization has not decided whether manufacturers should shift their production away from seasonal flu vaccines to targetting H1N1 .

Japan confirmed on Monday 125 people -- many who have not been abroad -- had been infected with the new strain of H1N1 flu , after New York saw its first death from the virus and Chile reported its first two cases . GENEVA | Mon May 18 , 2009 2:07 pm EDT GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Humanity may be witnessing an influenza pandemic unfold , the head of the World Health Organization said on Monday , as Japan reported a big jump in infections with the newly-discovered H1N1 virus . Flu fears dominated the start of the WHO 's annual congress in Geneva , where many of the 40 countries touched by the flu strain urged the United Nations agency to rethink its pandemic alert scale that is now at the second-highest notch . WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said the outbreak that began in North America and has stretched to Europe , Asia and South America needed to be tackled with seriousness even though its symptoms appear to be largely mild . `` For the first time in humanity , we are seeing , or we may be seeing , pandemic influenza evolving in front of our eyes , '' Chan told the World Health Assembly meeting in Geneva , where rich and poor governments discussed their drug , vaccine and other needs . `` We are all under pressure to make urgent and far-reaching decisions in an atmosphere of considerable scientific uncertainty , '' Chan told the annual congress , which was shortened in length to allow health ministers to go home earlier and resume their monitoring for flu infections . Several topics including food safety and viral hepatitis were dropped from the agenda while drug-resistant tuberculosis was initially slated to be postponed and then re-added at the last moment with support from China and others . According to the WHO 's latest tally , 74 people have died from H1N1 infection . Most of the other nearly 9,000 patients have suffered mild effects like fever and diarrhea from the bug that is a genetic mix of swine , bird and human viruses . But its rapid spread between people and across countries has caused the WHO to raise the alert and declare a pandemic is `` imminent , '' a designation that reflects views on the way the new virus is spreading and not the seriousness of its effects . Mexico , Britain , China , Egypt , Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates were among those who called at the opening-day session for the WHO to rethink its criteria for declaring a pandemic , which under current rules would occur when the virus is spreading in a sustained way in two regions of the world . British Health Secretary Alan Johnson said the `` mechanistic process '' now in place seems to give the wrong public impression about the seriousness of the flu , which can be treated without drugs in most cases . Chan , who also fought bird flu and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -LRB- SARS -RRB- in her tenure as Hong Kong health director , said she would consider the request that came just as the number of infections in Japan , Britain and Spain approached critical mass . The WHO said its laboratories have confirmed 125 cases in Japan , 103 in Spain and 101 in Britain . Officials from its North American stronghold said the virus was still spreading , albeit in a seemingly less virulent form . Richard Besser , head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , told a high-level session that the H1N1 strain has reached nearly all 50 U.S. states and was likely to circulate worldwide . `` While we are not seeing the seriousness of illness that was initially reported in Mexico , the outbreak is not over , '' he said . Mexico 's Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova said there was a slow but steady fall in the number of cases in his country . If H1N1 flu does reach all corners of the world , the WHO 's Chan said there would be certain communities at particular risk -- including people living in slums and shantytowns , pregnant women , and patients with HIV\\/AIDS and other health problems . Poor countries are seeking international assistance to get drugs , diagnostic tests and medical personnel needed to combat an outbreak which has so far not been identified in Africa or in the world 's most impoverished areas . Developing nations are also negotiating fair access to antiviral drugs like Tamiflu and to any vaccines developed to fight the H1N1 strain . Officials will also seek an agreement on how samples of the virus should be handled and shared with pharmaceutical companies working to develop vaccines to fight the strain . The WHO 's Chan is due to hold meetings on Tuesday with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and top executives from several pharmaceutical companies , which are waiting for a signal about whether to start making H1N1 jabs or to include the strain in the seasonal flu vaccine mix .

GENEVA | Tue May 19 , 2009 2:36 pm EDT GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Vaccine makers could produce 4.9 billion pandemic flu shots per year in the best-case scenario , the head of the World Health Organization said on Tuesday , as rich and poor countries grappled over limited supplies . WHO Director-General Margaret Chan told reporters after her meeting with 30 pharmaceutical companies that `` there are a lot of unanswered questions '' about how many vaccines could be made to protect vulnerable people from the new H1N1 virus . `` That is a very optimistic maximum capacity , '' she said of the 4.9 billion estimate , which would be significantly lower if people need more than one injection to gain immunity against the strain or if seasonal flu vaccine-making continues . Bringing a new pandemic vaccine to market -- if it goes ahead -- is expected to take 4-6 months , according to the WHO . It must be tested first on ferrets and then on humans in clinical trials before regulatory authorities can approve it . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the news briefing that while the newly-discovered virus strain now appears mild , it needs to be closely watched as it spreads around the world and starts to afflict impoverished countries . `` We may be in a grace period with H1N1 but we are still in the danger zone , '' Ban said . Earlier on Tuesday , the United Nations chief said it was essential for drugmakers to work with governments to avert the worst potential impacts of the flu , which has killed 79 people and infected nearly 10,000 . `` Partnerships with the private sector are absolutely vital , '' he told representatives of the WHO 's 193 member governments gathered in Geneva , urging them to think beyond their borders in their response to the H1N1 strain . Though most people infected so far have experienced mild symptoms similar to the common flu , pregnant women and people with HIV\\/AIDS , diabetes and other health problems appear to be vulnerable to more severe effects like pneumonia . Health experts have said weather could affect the continued spread of the virus , with more cases expected as countries in the southern hemisphere move into winter . Flu viruses typically thrive in cold and dry environments . Pharmaceutical executives taking part in Tuesday 's vaccines meeting at the WHO 's Geneva headquarters said they were primed to ramp up production of H1N1 vaccines if needed , and would await more directions about how to balance their output . `` Our companies stand ready to produce H1N1 vaccines when the recommendation comes from the WHO , '' the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations said . Six companies have pledged to make 10 percent of the vaccine they produce available for distribution to poor countries , and eight are in talks about donations , said Gelmer Leibbrandt , general manager of Schering-Plough 's Nobilon . Chan said that vaccine makers have shown `` a very serious commitment '' to help the international community prepare for a pandemic of flu , which could be mild in its effects to start and become more severe as it circles the globe . Questions remain about whether an H1N1-only vaccine is needed in the near-term -- especially if its production cuts the world 's supply of injections for seasonal flu , which kills up to 500,000 people a year and causes severe illness in millions . U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said pharmaceutical companies should ramp up their production of seasonal flu shots and then later switch to pandemic injection making `` if that is necessary . '' `` There is still so much uncertainty about this virus that it is really premature for us to even make a determination about how many people would appropriately be vaccinated , in what order , how many doses will be required , at what point . All those discussions are still very much underway , '' Sebelius said . Ban , in his remarks to the World Health Assembly , called on wealthy nations to help support poorer states fight the flu . But one international official said he expected battles ahead as governments try to secure finite supplies of antiviral drugs and vaccines to protect their populations . `` Enabling poor countries to be able to access the various medical supplies they need is going to be a critical political and technical issue , '' he said . `` This issue will require political attention . '' The WHO has said the world is on the brink of pandemic from the H1N1 virus , which has been most prevalent in North America and begun to infect large numbers in Japan , Britain and Spain .

Mexico is sinking deeper into recession due to plunging demand for its exports from the United States and many analysts expect the economy will contract about 6 percent this year . `` It is a very deep crisis , '' Carstens said , referring to the global recession , which weighs especially heavily on exporting powerhouses like Mexico . Mexico reported on Monday that industrial output fell 6.7 percent in March , in the eighth straight month of contraction . Industrial production accounts for about 40 percent of the economy . `` These are readings that we will continue to see for some more months , '' said Carstens , speaking at an insurance conference . At the same time , economists in the United States , where Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports , have increasingly pointed to signs that the U.S. recession is moderating . `` The sharp economic contraction and the sensation that demand is in freefall are abating , '' Carstens said . `` It is likely that we will start 2010 in a clear recovery , '' he said . A rally in Mexico 's peso currency and in global equity markets are signs that investors are betting on recovery , he said . The peso MXN = MEX01 rose to its strongest level against the U.S. dollar since November on Tuesday and the local stock market . MXX hit its highest level since early October on optimism that the U.S. banking sector may be in recovery . The outbreak in April of the H1N1 influenza virus that forced the temporary shutdown of parts of Mexico 's economy is expected to further compound the economic problems . Carstens reiterated his forecast that the flu outbreak would shave 0.3 percentage point off gross domestic product . Central bank Governor Guillermo Ortiz said on Monday the flu would likely cost 0.5 percent of GDP .

Disposable masks are recommended by the government for those who suspect they have been infected with the new strain of flu . But many members of the public are wearing them in an effort to avoid getting infected themselves , though experts say cheap masks , as opposed to virus-proof types , offer little protection . Senior Liberal Democratic Party official Hiroyuki Hosoda appeared at a news conference in a mask but peeled it off before speaking to reporters . Domestic media showed students on a guided tour of parliament wearing white masks and customers lining up outside stores to stock up on them . Long popular with Japanese who want to avoid passing on a cold or breathing in allergenic pollen , masks have become an essential accessory in the western areas of Osaka and Hyogo prefecture , where more than 150 people have been infected . Some businesses are ordering their employees , especially those who deal face-to-face with clients , to wear masks . `` I pick up passengers from the station , '' one taxi driver told broadcaster TBS . `` It 's a bit frightening in this enclosed space -- they might be infected without having developed a fever yet . '' Another woman told broadcaster NHK she felt safer in a mask . `` A lot of people are wearing them . I think it 's best to have one on as a means of prevention , '' she said . The government is recommending people use masks as a way of reducing the spread of infection via droplets from coughs and sneezes , but puts the onus on those who are already infected . `` If you start to cough or sneeze , please use a mask , '' reads an advice section on the Health Ministry 's website . `` If someone in your family or at your workplace is coughing without a mask on , please urge them to wear one . '' An official at the ministry emphasised the government was only recommending those with symptoms wear masks . `` Unless you are in a very crowded place , masks are not going to help much with prevention , '' he said . `` We are not saying that people should always wear a mask when you go out , although it might help to wear one on a rush-hour train . '' `` We are certainly not saying that you 'll be safe if you just put on a mask .

Making the problem more worrying is the recent H1N1 flu outbreak because the `` super-bug '' pneumonia most commonly appears following an influenza-like illness , Alicia Hidron of the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta reported . Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus -LRB- MRSA -RRB- infections can range from boils to more severe infections of the blood , lungs and the sites of surgery . Such infections can often be treated only with expensive intravenous antibiotics . Most cases are associated with hospitals , nursing homes or other health care facilities but infections acquired in the wider community are increasing , the researcher noted . `` Community-acquired MRSA infections are no longer restricted to certain risk groups or to the geographic areas where outbreaks first occurred , '' they wrote in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases . `` They now occur widely both in the community as well as health care facilities and have been reported on every continent . '' As these superbugs spread in communities , more pneumonia cases are likely -- and the researchers said these may have mortality rates of more than 50 percent . `` However , the overall incidence of community-acquired MRSA pneumonia remains unknown , '' the researchers wrote . In their analysis , Hidron and colleagues looked at two U.S. cases caused by a specific MRSA strain that is a culprit behind many superbug infections in the United States . They reported the pneumonia usually features high fever and low blood pressure with rapid progression to septic shock -- a widespread infection that sends the whole body into a tailspin -- and an urgent need for mechanical ventilation . The researchers said they do not know why community-acquired MRSA pneumonia appears so lethal but noted the bacteria that cause it are more susceptible to antibiotics than hospital-acquired infections . `` The best treatment of this ... disease has not been defined , '' they wrote . -LRB- Reporting by Michael Kahn ; Editing by Maggie Fox and Jon Hemming -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "739", "dct": "2009-05-19", "dates": ["2009-05-15", "2009-04-24", "2009-04-25", "2009-04-24", "2009-05-18", "2009-05-16", "2009-05-16", "2009-05-16"], "text": "News coverage is a daily activity for me , and however I get involved in a story it s not just a job ; it 's also what I enjoy doing . Sometimes I m just an observer behind a camera , but other times I also end up being affected personally . When the new H1N1 flu virus broke out in Mexico there was an additional factor for me ; it was impossible not to suffer the first days of the epidemic as the head of a family . I thought of the photos that I wanted to take , but I couldn t help thinking of my daughter , my wife and my mother . As Colombians living in Mexico City we were all exposed to the unknown virus . Fear and uncertainty dominated my family , friends and the millions of people with whom I share the streets of this metropolis . Very early on Friday , April 24 , I put on rubber gloves and a facemask that I bought from the corner pharmacy . The masks were still easy to find , but a day later their scarcity would become a problem . My daughter celebrated along with countless others of her age the sudden onset of vacation , not yet understanding that the break from school would become a virtual quarantine . It was recommended that children not leave their homes during the emergency . In the early days of the outbreak , the government said that the majority of the victims were young adults , but in normal flu outbreaks children and the elderly are always the most vulnerable . Limited knowledge about the disease and the recommended precautions caused Mexico City residents to avoid physical contact , even between people who a day earlier would greet each other with two kisses , as is the custom in Mexico . Friends and colleagues began to stand at a distance in hopes of preventing the spread of something that we knew little about . But we were learning more about it minute by minute . Early news about dying victims was disconcerting . Before the government declared that the current flu vaccine was useless for this strain , I went to a vaccination clinic where people were begging for the shot . I had hoped to get one for myself to be safe while covering the story , but I was denied as everyone else . People left the clinic with fear in their faces and voices when they asked each other , What do we do now ? Fearful of catching the flu , I climbed into a taxi to continue covering the outbreak . There were fewer people , fewer cars in the city 's normally congested streets . The human landscape changed to one of blue-masked pedestrians . By the end of the first weekend the population was better informed . Most were less frightened in spite of the fact that the virus was among us and spreading . Monday was the beginning of the first full week with the virus in Mexico . The day was hot and strange , without traffic . Then , a few minutes before noon , the earth shook . My taxi tilted from left to right . Electric cables swung back and forth . I grabbed my camera and yelled to the driver , Stop ! I jumped out and the near-empty street was still trembling . I walked to the corner and saw people rushing out from buildings and houses all around me . I could see the fear in their eyes . In front of Aragon Hospital the street filled with doctors and patients . Some couldn t take the crisis and fainted . Dozens of people muttered , ... just what we needed ... At that moment I remembered that my family was alone in our fifth floor apartment . I called my wife but she didn t answer . I called my daughter s cell phone but again , no answer . I kept taking pictures with one hand while calling with the other , and hoping that everything was alright . In the end I confirmed that my family was fine and I felt momentary relief , but then I remembered my mother who had died just two days earlier . Just one day into the flu coverage , Saturday at 5 a.m. , my mother , who also lived with us in Mexico City , passed away for reasons unrelated to the epidemic . In that difficult moment I had called my editors to tell them that I couldn t continue with the coverage plan that day , and I was told to take all the time I needed . I had the choice of not working due to my family emergency amidst the sudden appearance of the new flu virus . But then I realized that the best therapy for me and the best tribute to my mother would be to go out and report the news . Even in the most difficult moments I couldn t stop observing the world and my own life through photography . Muchisimas gracias por tu historia .

Most of the new cases are in the United States , which has seen 5,469 outbreaks of the virus so far , the WHO said as it focuses on the H1N1 virus that has brought the world to the brink of a pandemic . Another 51 cases have also been reported in Japan , bringing the total number of cases there to 210 and potentially making it more likely that the WHO will declare a full pandemic after it raised its pandemic alert last month to 5 on a 6-level scale . Health ministers and experts at this week 's WHO annual assembly have been discussing how to fight the virus with vaccines and drugs as well as what criteria the WHO should consider when deciding whether to raise the alert level . Under WHO rules , signs the disease is spreading in a sustained way in a second region of the world outside its North American epicenter would prompt a declaration that a full pandemic is under way . Ministers have urged the WHO to consider other factors such as the severity of the virus before moving to the highest alert . Forty countries have confirmed cases of the new strain and nearly all of those who have died were in Mexico , but most patients globally have had relatively mild symptoms . -LRB- Reporting by Katie Reid ; Editing by Jonathan Lynn -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "405", "dct": "2009-05-21", "dates": ["2010-04-01", "2009-05-15"], "text": "As the confirmed number of Japanese infected with the H1N1 flu virus rises , the growing question among many is : Where can we buy face masks ?

TOKYO | Thu May 21 , 2009 2:32 pm EDT TOKYO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The spread of the new H1N1 virus in Asia showed no signs of slowing on Thursday as the Philippines recorded its first case and new infections were confirmed in Japan , China and Taiwan . In the United States , authorities reported the country 's ninth death from the virus ; a 13-year-old boy in Arizona . The H1N1 flu strain is a never-before-seen mixture of swine , bird and human viruses that spreads easily between people . It has killed 85 people and infected more than 11,000 in 41 countries , according to the World Health Organization . Most of the deaths have been in Mexico , occurring mostly in people with underlying medical problems . While it has killed nobody so far in Asia , its grip appeared to tighten on a region that has battled the H5N1 bird flu virus and the SARS virus over the past 10 years . The Philippines said a 10-year-old girl , who had returned from a trip to the United States and Canada , had the illness but was recovering . The government was contacting people who were on the same flight and asked the girl 's family to put themselves in quarantine until they are declared free of the virus . `` There is no community level outbreak in the country , and measures are being taken by the government to prevent transmission , '' said Health Secretary Francisco Duque . The number of cases in Japan rose to 272 , including a 16-year-old female high school student in Tokyo who had recently returned from New York . About 4,500 schools , mostly in the western prefectures of Osaka and Hyogo about 400 km -LRB- 250 miles -RRB- from Tokyo , have closed until the end of the week and more schools may follow suit . In China , authorities confirmed its fifth case , a 21-year-old Chinese-Canadian student in Beijing , while there was also a jump in infections in Australia to eight . Taiwan also reported two more cases of the new flu , bringing the number of people with the virus on the island to three . Elsewhere , Chile has become one of the most affected countries in South America . Sixteen children and adults have tested positive for the H1N1 virus . Margaret Chan , head of the World Health Organization , said on Thursday she would raise the global pandemic alert to the top of the six-point scale if the H1N1 flu was spreading globally . `` When I see more signals coming from the virus itself or the spread of the disease , including severity , I would not shy away from making a very difficult decision , '' she said , adding health experts were now monitoring carefully for signs the virus has taken hold in the southern hemisphere . Chan said progress was being made on an agreement on how to share drugs , vaccines and the viruses needed to make them . She said collaboration between governments and drug makers gave hope for conciliation between rich and poor countries . `` We have seen something that we have never seen before : the total commitment to countries affected to transparency , to timely reporting , sharing of information , sequences , viruses , diagnostic kits , laboratory equipment , and the list goes on . '' So far the symptoms of the new virus appear to be mild , but it is starting to cause more severe effects as it spreads . Japanese Health Minister Yoichi Masuzoe said a study on 43 cases in Kobe city suggested it was behaving like seasonal flu , and not everyone affected needed hospitalization . But U.S. federal health researchers said the seasonal flu vaccine provides virtually no protection against the new flu . Their study also supports an intriguing theory that people over the age of 60 have some immunity to the new H1N1 strain , perhaps because it resembles an older version of seasonal flu . They say an unusually high proportion of those being infected and hospitalized with serious disease are young adults , teenagers and older children . Seasonal flu , in contrast , is usually far more severe in very young children , people over the age of 65 and people with chronic disease . Japan is considering winding down strict health checks at international airports at the end of the week , which had been imposed to try to buy time before an outbreak in the country . But for the poorest of countries , there is hardly any protection to speak of . In Afghanistan , a medical center has been set up at Kabul airport to deal with possible cases , but the country can not afford temperature screening equipment and relies on other countries to scan outbound passengers . The WHO has donated $ 500,000 worth of the antiviral drug Tamiflu , still effective in fighting the new virus . That amount , however , covers only 30,360 people -- a mere fraction in a country of 26 million people and where the most basic of medical facilities and drugs are wanting even in the best of times .

The highly contagious strain must be closely monitored in parts of Asia , Africa and South America where the winter season is beginning in case it mixes with seasonal flu and mutates in `` unpredictable ways , '' Chan told the closing session of her United Nations agency 's annual congress . `` In cases where the H1N1 virus is widespread and circulating within the general community , countries must expect to see more cases of severe and fatal infections , '' she said . `` We do not at present expect this to be a sudden and dramatic jump in severe illness and deaths . '' In the WHO 's latest tally , the strain has infected more than 11,000 people in 42 countries and killed 86 . Chan told the end of the week-long World Health Assembly that poorer countries need to quickly improve their monitoring for the new flu , which has caused mainly mild symptoms in most patients but could become more serious as it spreads . `` This is a subtle , sneaky virus , '' she said . `` We have clues , many clues , but very few firm conclusions . '' Another senior WHO official , Keiji Fukuda , later told a news conference the United Nations agency was rethinking its criteria for declaring a full H1N1 pandemic is underway to factor in its severity as well as its geographical spread . `` What we are looking for and what we will be looking for is something , events , which signify a really significant increase in risk of harm to people , '' said Fukuda , acting WHO assistant director-general . The WHO 's global flu alert is currently at level 5 out of 6 , meaning that a pandemic is `` imminent . '' Officials from the WHO 's 193 member states have been pushing this week for an altered definition of a Phase 6 pandemic to reduce the risk of unnecessary public panic . `` The bottom line here is we are trying to walk a very fine line between not raising panic but also not becoming complacent , '' Fukuda said , adding that criteria would be reviewed now that the assembly had ended . The WHO 's current rulebook requires a full pandemic to be declared once the air-borne virus is spreading in a sustained way in two regions of the world . The H1N1 strain has been most prevalent in North America and has also caused growing pockets of infection in Japan , Spain and Britain . Chan said there was little real difference between the WHO 's current pandemic alert level of 5 and the highest of 6 in terms of preparedness measures taken , and she would consult experts before opting to raise it again . `` The decision to declare an influenza pandemic is a responsibility and a duty that I take very , very seriously , '' she said . `` I will consider all the scientific information available . I will be advised by the emergency committee . '' The WHO expects that by the end of May , laboratories will be able to send candidate viruses to drug companies to be tested as vaccine viruses , according to Fukuda . `` We are hopeful that by the end of June , by the beginning of July , this will be the time when commercial companies will be in the position of beginning to , or being able to make H1N1 vaccine , '' he said . While the new flu virus dominated their meeting , officials also passed resolutions on the need to improve treatment of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis and prepare for a surge in diseases including mosquito-borne malaria due to global warming .

Authorities were observing 10 others for symptoms of the virus , Health Secretary Francisco Duque told reporters . Duque said the Filipina had showed signs of the flu a day after arriving from Chicago on May 20 and checked herself into a private hospital . `` She only had mild symptoms which include fever and cough , '' Duque said , adding the family and other close contacts of the woman were also being tested for the deadly virus .

Britain and other countries affected by the newly-discovered H1N1 virus were pushing WHO Director-General Margaret Chan to pause before raising the six-point pandemic scale to its highest notch , as her United Nations agency 's rulebook says she should do once it is spreading in more than one region of the world . Those rules were developed in anticipation of a pandemic from the toxic H5N1 bird flu strain , which kills about half those it infects but so far has not passed easily from person to person . The WHO activated that alert system when it saw the new strain -- which has genetic pieces of swine , bird and human viruses -- was killing people in Mexico , including the young and seemingly healthy . But it caused milder symptoms as it spread worldwide , and health experts now say that many of those infected may not even realize it . So does its global spread still represent a pandemic ? After weeks of trying to explain that its alert scale is based on the way a potentially dangerous virus is spreading , not the severity of its effects at the present time , the WHO capitulated to pressure and changed its guidance . Top official Keiji Fukuda told reporters on Friday that `` what we are looking for and what we will be looking for is something , events , which signify a really substantial increase in risk of harm to people . '' This means that although there are pockets of sustained transmission in Japan , Britain , and Spain , the WHO will not have to issue the top alert unless the virus mutates or reverts to a more dangerous form . While many nations are congratulating Dr. Chan for adding `` flexibility '' to the pandemic rules , others are raising questions about whether the WHO erred in yielding to the pressure from the mainly-rich countries with confirmed flu infections so far , who would be compelled to cough up money , drugs , vaccines , diagnostic tests , and other technology to poor nations if the world was on edge about Phase 6 flu . A less severe threat level means less urgency in addressing those health-system shortcomings that affect not only poor countries ' response to H1N1 , but also other deadly diseases such as tuberculosis , malaria , dengue and cholera . While the WHO has said gaps in the world 's `` pandemic preparedness '' must be addressed as a matter of priority , it is apparent that this particular flu is not seen as enough of a trigger do so . And that could have as much to do with politics as with science . -LRB- Photo : Japanese students wear masks in Tokyo\\/Toru Hanai -RRB- It is n't just `` that this particular flu is not seen as enough of a trigger '' to mend the gaps in worldwide preparedness against a pandemic , it is also such that WHO is trying to avoid unnecessary alarm and public unrest .

Canadian health officials said on May 2 a herd of swine in the western province of Alberta had caught the virus from a carpenter who had traveled to Mexico , the epicenter of the H1N1 flu outbreak that has spread to 46 countries . It is the only reported case of the virus being transmitted from a human to a pig in the world . `` We would not be surprised if we have other cases like this in other countries , '' OIE Director General Bernard Vallat told a news conference at the organization 's general assembly in Paris . `` But it is not a problem because we know pigs are not a big player in the epidemiological spread of the disease .

Vallat reiterated flu viruses easily circulate between species , especially when strains are mixed . The new H1N1 virus , popularly known as `` swine flu , '' has human , bird as well as pig origins . The OIE , an intergovernmental organization of 174 member states , has often stressed there was no proof so far of transmission from pig to human . It was among the biggest opponents against the strain being called `` swine flu .

Avian influenza kills about half the people it infects , but unlike the quickly circulating H1N1 flu virus has not been shown to pass easily between humans to date . The WHO said the candidate virus was developed at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta `` thanks to the ministry of health and population of Egypt , for providing virus specimens , '' `` This recombinant vaccine virus is available for distribution , '' it said in a statement on its website . `` Institutions , companies and others interested in pandemic vaccine development who wish to receive these candidate vaccine viruses should contact either the WHO Global Influenza Program ... or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . '' Pharmaceutical companies including Novartis are already working on vaccines against H5N1 bird flu , which has killed or forced the culling of more than 300 million birds since 2003 as it spread to 61 countries in Asia , the Middle East and Africa . While eclipsed on the headlines by the highly contagious H1N1 strain , which proved deadly in its North American epicenter but has caused mild symptoms as it spread , the WHO stressed it was important to remember the risks posed by avian influenza . The U.N. 's Food and Agriculture Organization reported 250 outbreaks of H5N1 in birds in February alone -- in Bangladesh , China , Egypt , India , Indonesia , Laos , Nepal and Vietnam . Avian influenza has killed 261 people out of 424 infected since 2003 . By contrast , the H1N1 strain , commonly known as swine flu and which has put the world on pandemic alert , has infected more than 13,000 people but killed just 95 , according to WHO figures . Its statement on Thursday said flu experts were continuing to monitor the evolution of avian influenza and other flu viruses and stressed the need for countries to keep providing samples of identified strains . `` Countries are encouraged to share with WHO their specimens and\\/or isolates , both from humans and animals , for their inclusion in the WHO H5N1 vaccine virus development and selection process , in addition to other activities of public health significance , '' it said . Virus sharing is a sensitive topic for developing countries such as Indonesia , who have bristled at the idea of companies using their biological material to manufacture and patent vaccines that are then sold at unaffordable prices . WHO Director-General Margaret Chan , who raised the United Nations agency 's pandemic alert to 5 out of 6 in response to the fast spread of swine flu , is trying to broker an international agreement on the sharing of virus samples by January 2010 . She has called on countries to do all they can to ensure fresh samples of both H5N1 and the new H1N1 strains reach the pharmaceutical community so that their vaccines can offer immunity against the latest forms of the viruses . The WHO 's statement did not include new guidance on the H1N1 virus or vaccines to fight it . WHO officials have said they would offer recommendations `` during the summer '' about how many pandemic vaccines focused on that strain may needed , depending on whether it continues to cause mild effects as its spreads . British scientists have produced a strain of H1N1 flu virus which could be used for large-scale production of a vaccine , should it go ahead . That strain is being made available to the pharmaceutical industry and other flu laboratories , Britain 's Health Protection Agency said on Thursday , describing it as `` a crucial step toward large scale production of a vaccine against swine flu .

Grain traders are anxiously waiting USDA 's weekly crop progress report late Monday as it will tell the story of how U.S. corn was planted this season . As of May 24 , American farmers still had 15 million corn acres of a projected 85 million yet to plant as heavy spring rains in the eastern Corn Belt delayed planting by at least 10 days to two weeks in many areas . Midwest acres seeded after mid-May usually lose more than a bushel a day on yield . `` Analysts are wondering how many of the remaining 15 million acres will be planted to soybeans rather than corn , '' Mike Woolverton , Kansas State University grain economist , said in his weekly newsletter . `` The consensus guess is one million acres if it immediately stops raining in the eastern Corn Belt and Mid-south ; up to two million acres if it stays wet , '' he said . Oil is a multi-billion dollar , multi-million barrel serious business . But OPEC ministers hounded by a ravening press pack can be masters of jocularity when the mood takes them . The relaxed tenor of this week 's OPEC meeting , which could cheerfully roll over existing output targets given the market was intent on rising whatever , was reflected in a high quota of light-hearted brush-offs . Libya 's Shokri Ghanem , renowned for his impishness , told one reporter he was going `` to have a cup of coffee '' when asked on the day of the meeting what his agenda was . It was n't quite the `` keep output steady '' the reporter had been after . Questioned about the oil price , Nigerian Oil Minister Rilwanu Lukman said : `` Could be better , but I ca n't complain . '' He could just as easily have been talking about the weather or his state of health . The most senior minister of them all Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi was in particularly sporting mood as he sped through Viennese hotel lobbies , jogged around the Vienna Ring and declared all was right with the world . `` The price is good , the market is in good shape , recovery is under way . What else could we want ? '' As the oil price climbed above $ 65 a barrel , its highest for more than six months , sceptical reporters asked whether the rally could be sustainable when oil inventories were still very high . But Naimi was confident the great healer would take care of excess supply . `` Time takes care of everything , '' he said and no-one could disagree . Tony Hayward did it at BP in 2007 and Peter Voser , due to step up to the top job at Royal Dutch Shell Plc on July 1 , did it on Wednesday . May 26 , 2009 20:21 UTC OPEC 's president Angola might well be asking himself why he is paying nearly 2 million euros to belong to the oil producers ' club when the World Bank has told the nation it would be better off without it . The Angolan energy minister , who currently holds the group 's rotating presidency , has yet to arrive in Vienna for this Thursday 's meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries , which is expected to keep existing output targets unchanged . Member countries have already agreed to lower production by 4.2 million barrels per day since last September and have been delivering around 80 percent of the promised curbs . Now the oil price has climbed back above $ 60 a barrel , almost double the lows of last December , members like Angola might well sigh with relief and pump even more above their OPEC output target than they are already doing . Last week , the World Bank said Angola 's economy would perform far better this year if the country did not limit production , as OPEC has requested , and that was n't taking account of the OPEC membership fee , which is heard to be the same for all members , whether they are the smallest producer Ecuador or the biggest Saudi Arabia . Oil ministers might have saved a night or two on hotel accommodation , however , as several were expected to arrive later than originally stated and also to disappear immediately after Thursday 's meeting . Delegates predicted it would be short and to the point , provided Angola and others unhappy with output targets did not open a Pandora 's Box of a debate on production goals . The controls are aimed at supporting oil prices as the market is already well-supplied , but some argue a better way to boost OPEC earnings would have been to call the meeting off . It would not be good business for Vienna hotels or struggling airlines , but it would cut the expenses and carbon emissions of the OPEC delegations and the pursuing press pack , as one weary analyst observed . `` We are forced to mention that there is an OPEC meeting this Thursday in Vienna , although there is so little to expect out of it that OPEC could have made a gesture to save its and the media 's carbon footprint by calling it off , '' said Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix . \\* Grain prices , led by soybeans , have been up since March . \\* South America 's crop is expected to be a disappointment .

For example , Cathay Pacific now replaces used pillows , blankets , headset covers and headrest covers , spokeswoman Carolyn Leung said . China Southern Airlines has been disinfecting the cabins of all aircraft . China Eastern Airlines flight attendants are required to wear disposable facial masks , gloves and hats and even disposable overcoats during flights to select destinations . Mexicana Airlines uses high-efficiency filters that can trap small particles that would normally recirculate back into the air , spokesman Adolfo Crespo said . The H1N1 flu virus has been confirmed in 20,000 people in 68 countries , killing at least 126 , according to the World Health Organization . Although it appears mild , experts worry that the disease , which formerly was called `` swine flu , '' could change into a more dangerous form . In the wake of the spread , some countries have intensified health precautions . Singapore saw its first case of the H1N1 flu in late May , after a native student flew from New York to the city-state on a Singapore Airlines flight . Singapore has been thermal-screening everyone coming into the country . The method , which identifies travelers with a fever , did not help authorities spot the sick student , as she had not yet developed a fever . The government quarantined the passenger and about 60 other people on the same flight who were sitting within three rows . `` This wo n't be the last case in Singapore unless we could stop people from traveling , '' Singapore 's Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan said . Singapore Airlines Ltd , the world 's biggest by market value , is giving passengers traveling to the United States health kits that include a thermometer , masks and antiseptic towels . Its cabin and flight crews are getting mandatory temperature checks before flights . In contrast to the measures taken by Asian airlines , U.S. carriers have simply continued safety standards already in place , relying on the advice of authorities such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Atlanta-based CDC has not recommended that airline crews wear face masks or disposable overcoats . `` The issue with H1N1 and airlines is an issue of translocation , not necessarily on-board transmission , '' Shelly Sikes Diaz , a CDC spokeswoman , said in an email . She added that people were no more likely to catch the flu on a two-hour plane flight than they were sitting next to someone for a two-hour movie . `` Therefore , at this time , recommended on-board infection control measures would be similar to community infection control measures '' such as frequent hand-washing , Diaz added . David Castelveter , a spokesman with the Air Transport Association trade group , said U.S. airlines for the most part have made no major changes in the wake of swine flu , but continued standing practices that include looking for passengers with symptoms of flu , measles or other infections . He added that in-flight air filters ensure that aircraft are sanitized . `` We take our guidance from the professionals -LRB- such as the CDC -RRB- who tell us the precautions that are needed to prevent the spread , '' Castelveter said . `` We 're not taking the type of precautions that are unnecessary . '' While Castelveter said media coverage of the flu has boosted awareness of airline safety procedures , Mexicana 's Crespo stressed that carriers still have work to do to change public perceptions that air quality on planes is bad . `` Inside , our aircraft is cleaner than in a hospital , '' Crespo said . Julian Tang , a consultant for the microbiology division at National University Hospital in Singapore , also said hygiene practices such as covering the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing in confined areas may be the best way to limit infection . He said safety measures such as costly air filters may be of limited use for carriers . `` This is because most of the transmission between passengers probably mostly occurs just after the sneeze\\/cough in the immediate vicinity of the passenger rather than after it flows through the ventilation\\/circulation system and back out again , '' he said .

Children in Europe and the Americas have had access to the rotavirus vaccine for three years but it had previously not been tested in and approved for low-income settings where the dehydrating disease is most lethal .

Rotavirus is a leading cause of severe gastroenteritis , including vomiting and diarrhea , in infants and young children . The contagious infection kills an estimated 1,600 children under the age of 5 every day , mostly in Africa and Asia . The first vaccine developed to fight rotavirus , sold by Wyeth , was pulled from the market in 1999 after it was linked to a rare , life-threatening type of bowel obstruction known as intussusception . The Merck and Glaxo vaccines do not have that problem . The WHO said clinical trials in poor communities in South Africa and Malawi showed the new oral vaccines significantly reduced severe diarrhea episodes related to rotavirus . Trials are continuing in Bangladesh , Vietnam , Ghana , Mali and Kenya , but the guidance was issued ahead of those full results `` since available evidence indicates that efficacy data can be extrapolated to populations with similar mortality patterns regardless of geographic location , '' the WHO said . Developing countries wanting help to distribute the rotavirus vaccine can seek assistance from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization -LRB- GAVI -RRB- , a Geneva-based international procurer and WHO partner .

As flames blocked the center 's doorway , employees and neighbors used cars to punch holes through a wall and stumbled over unconscious infants and toddlers as they tried to rescue them , witnesses said . Smoke inhalation killed many children before rescuers could reach them , with the victims ranging in age from a few months old to about 3 years old , authorities said .

The gun battle , near tourist hotels in the Pacific Ocean resort , was a further blow to Mexico 's tourism industry , already reeling from cancellations by foreigners scared away by the swine flu epidemic . Gunmen battled troops from a cartel safe house , throwing hand grenades at soldiers who had surrounded them and spraying gunfire into military vehicles and nearby homes . The shooting began late on Saturday and went on until after midnight . `` There were grenade and rocket explosions , and weapons like AK-47s , '' said an employee of a neighboring hotel . `` The fight lasted almost two hours . '' Sixteen suspected members of the Beltran Leyva drug gang were killed as well as two soldiers , including a captain . Mexican President Felipe Calderon has staked his presidency on crushing drug gangs whose turf wars have killed about 2,300 people this year . Some 45,000 troops and federal police have been deployed across the country . While the clash was several miles away from the main area where foreign tourists stay in high-rise hotels , a resurgence of violence in Acapulco is bad news for the tourism industry . Rival drug gangs fought over territory in Acapulco , home to around a million people , several years ago , but the resort has been relatively free of drug violence in recent years . Tourism , a key industry for Mexico , took a hit in late April and early May when the H1N1 flu virus spread through Mexico and scared off travelers . Violence associated with drugs across Mexico has damaged investor sentiment and the U.S. government is concerned about instability in Mexico , an ally and big oil supplier . President Barack Obama visited Mexico City in April , praised Calderon for tackling the drug gangs and offered more U.S. help in the war . Drug violence has also hurt Mexican beach resorts , like Cancun and Ixtapa . The Beltran Leyva gang , rivals of the powerful Sinaloa cartel , is believed to dominate the drug trade around Acapulco , a popular destination for vacationing U.S. college students . Also on Sunday , the attorney general 's office said police arrested Olga Cristina Lerma , a financial operative in the Sinaloa cartel , which is based in northwest Mexico . Lerma is responsible for bringing $ 22 million from drug sales from the United States into Mexico and will be extradited , the attorney general 's office said in a statement .

Cargo demand may have stabilized , but a pick-up is unlikely until demand recovers in the United States , said the CEO of Korean Air , the world 's top air cargo carrier . `` I think we have hit the bottom , '' Cho Yang Ho told Reuters . European aircraft manufacturer Airbus said it was sticking to its 2009 sales target of 300 gross orders but that it would be more difficult to accomplish . `` It is more of a stretch now , '' Airbus Commercial Director John Leahy told Reuters . `` We see the market improving , and we have negotiations for orders ongoing . '' International Lease Finance Corp -LRB- ILFC -RRB- , the world 's largest plane-leasing company , said it was negotiating for more planes with Airbus and Boeing Co , but `` at the right price . '' The annual meeting of the International Air Transport Association began on a somber note , with last week 's still unexplained crash of an Airbus A330-200 adding to the woes of an industry hurt by the financial crisis and volatile oil prices . But several airline executives were quick to defend the plane . `` It 's a safe plane , it 's a good plane , '' said Chew Choon Seng , the chief executive of Singapore Airlines , which has 16 A330-200s on order . `` We should not jump to conclusions . '' All 228 people on board the Air France plane were killed when it crashed in the Atlantic Ocean , the world 's worst air disaster since 2001 . Airline chiefs saw other concerns ahead , from rising unemployment to a surplus of plane capacity that could hurt profitability . `` I think it 's probably going to get worse , '' Rob Fyfe , chief executive of Air New Zealand , told Reuters on the sidelines of the meeting . The bearish comments contrast with the more positive outlook from some global policymakers and economists about a global recovery in the wake of recent data such as the slowing pace of U.S. job losses . Airlines have cut capacity and jobs in response to a slide in profits , and some have delayed or canceled orders for new aircraft from Boeing and Airbus . The chairman and founder of India 's Jet Airways said the airline may defer its orders for 10 Boeing 787 Dreamliners because of the economic crisis . NareshGoyal told Reuters that no decision had been taken , but that it would depend on economic conditions . But Deutsche Lufthansa 's Chief Executive Wolfgang Mayrhuber said his airline , which has about $ 15.8 billion in orders for new aircraft , had no plans to delay or cancel any of them , although it was difficult to predict the outlook for the industry . `` We have very little visibility , '' he said . More recently , outbreaks of the new H1N1 swine flu virus have added to the gloomy prospects for global air travel and tourism . According to the World Health Organization , the new influenza strain has been found in 64 countries , and remains most prevalent in North America . WHO labs have confirmed nearly 19,000 infections .

The cars and planes are not directly linked to the U.S. war effort . But they are typical of Congress ' penchant for loading bills with unrelated spending in hopes the funds will sail through on the strength of the main legislation . President Barack Obama originally sought $ 83.4 billion for the two wars and more foreign aid for countries like Pakistan . But then he too sought more -- $ 4 billion extra to combat H1N1 swine flu and $ 5 billion to back credit lines to the International Monetary Fund , which is trying to help developing countries weather the global economic downturn . The unrelated provisions have slowed the bill down , especially for the IMF because Republicans have argued the extra items should be vetted through the normal congressional process rather than jammed into an emergency spending bill . Fights have also erupted about add-ons for the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba and an attempt to bar the release of photos of detainee abuse . While Republicans do not have the votes to block the bill , they have said they will oppose it and that forces Democrats to ensure most of their members back it . `` This supplemental was supposed to be about providing funding for our troops , '' one House Republican aide said . Instead , it has become a mish-mashed , taxpayer funded ` Christmas tree ' bill that will propagate bad policies and unnecessary spending . '' Some 51 anti-war House Democrats had opposed the bill but now are under pressure to switch to give Obama a victory . But a House Democratic leadership aide said Republicans will have to answer to constituents for opposing a war funding bill . The House and Senate are working out differences between the two versions of the war funding bill they each approved last month and hope to pass a final , single version this week . Congress was on the verge of giving Pakistan roughly $ 1 billion in the bill , but Obama last week sought another $ 200 million for Islamabad as it fights Taliban militants crossing its border from Afghanistan . And lawmakers are also considering adding money for a plan to spur domestic car sales by offering up to $ 4,500 in vouchers for buyers to trade in their less fuel-efficient vehicles for ones that get better mileage , known as `` cash for clunkers '' . The White House declined to directly address adding in extra provisions , but said officials continue to work with lawmakers `` about the core priorities in the legislation and hope that it can get to the president soon . '' When the House and Senate originally approved their separate versions of the war bill , the White House praised lawmakers for not inserting their own pet projects in the legislation -- though some pet priorities were included . Democratic Representative John Murtha , who heads the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee , managed to get $ 3.1 billion for eight C-17 and 11 C-130 military transport planes included . However , that has been pared back by four C-130s . The Pentagon did not request the aircraft but lawmakers want them to preserve jobs in their home states and Murtha disputes the military 's contention that they are not needed . A senior Democratic House aide said the requests for flu and Pakistan money were appropriate to include in the bill because they were emergency needs Obama cited . The aide also noted that Republicans in the past backed items like the IMF funds . `` This is a dangerous game Republicans are playing by jeopardizing the well-being of our soldiers to score political points , '' the aide said . `` The supplemental will be passed , but they will have to answer for their actions if they oppose it .

As Reuters chief photographer in Asia , I have a lot on my mind . The threat of conflict on the Korean peninsula after Pyongyang s nuclear tests , fighting in Pakistan and Afghanistan , floods in India and Bangladesh , a bogus trial of Suu Kyi in Myanmar , crashing economies , H1N1 , claims and counter-claims of corruption and racism , insecurity in Nepal and Sri Lanka , global warming , the risk of unrest in Tibet and of course , China , where just about anything can happen at any time . With the decline of the traditional news market , however , I sometimes wonder who still cares about news pictures and why should they be paid for . How can you put a value to a news picture ? You can t eat it . A picture doesn t move financial markets , so you can t make money from it like you can on a news story . We hear the news through word of mouth , on the radio or even on the television . Most pictures have a lifespan of no more than 24 hours anyway , and everyone can take them these days -LRB- or so they think -RRB- . Simple answer : when it comes to integrity , honesty and trust , seeing is believing . It is rarely understood that people are smart and should be left to come to their own conclusions . A still picture shot by a Reuters news photographer gives the viewer time to see the truth . Take as an example when Sri Lanka declared that it had beaten the Tamil Tigers and a quarter-century war was over . A counter claim was made : No its not , we are fighting on , said the Tamil Tigers . The government said that rebel leader Vellupillai Prabhakaran was dead . Oh no he s not , countered the Tamil Tigers . A day later Reuters News Pictures get exclusive pictures of Prabhakaran s corpse being carried through a crowd of government soldiers . A close-up image of his face told the indisputable truth Prabhakaran is dead . A colleague , who works in the financial news section of Reuters and was born in Sri Lanka wanted to study the picture for quite some time . His response after a few minutes of close scrutiny was Oh my God ! It s really him . That man has impacted my life for over 20 years and now he is dead . No-one can ever tell my colleague different , it s a fact . The story in a news picture taken by a Reuters photographer is irrefutable , unbiased and will form part of history for others to believe in too . This truth , like integrity , can not be bought but has to be earned and then maintained at all costs once lost it can never be replaced . My fear , at 4.25 am , is that not enough people value this precious commodity maybe I should get back to sleep and not worry . The Reuters Financial colleague who got ` awe struck ' by the picture can not be an official endorser , as the article implies , since even most journalists have not met Prabhakaran in real life . However , since this is the first time an `` open-wound '' picture was published it generates more questions . - The real Prabhakaran have thick straight hair with no receding hairline -LRB- refer to recent hat-less pictures -RRB- . The picture implies him having curls and a receding hairline around forehead - The picture implies that the corpse is clean shaven - There are no trauma in the face from the fatal attack and that could imply that the wound was caused by a post-death -LRB- using a machete -RRB- act . Also there are no blood stains beyond and aorund the wound . Was someone kind enough to clean him up and shave before photographers arrived ? I understand these are theories that 'll go unanswered , unless the real man himself declare his demise or comes alive one day . Major Newspapers , magazines , websites , and many government agencies have proclaimed about Mr. Prabhakaran ! s death by massive ways . Till today , some political bodies says that He is alive . When all well known news , media net work team are not able to say correctly , what happened to him , whether he is alive or died by shooting , or suicide . I think that , in one day or other , we will come to know about his history . I have a habit of seeing these Photographers-Blog Ar , then i came to arrive lot of proper conclusions of happenings in and around the world . These above photos are very touchy and appreciable . Thanks for publishing of these updates . Who sees , view of these photos are debatable topic . As far as i am concerned , i used to see all natural , technical , innovative products , historical monuments , and any latest taken photos from all media networks . Yesterday , night , i discussed about world Top 25 cities photos with my wife and with my known friends . All your pictures are worth to see , worth to comment and worth to save for further brainy works . There was a lot of doubt earlier when loads of media networks started reporting that the terrorist leader was dead . Most people said that he was not dead & that the violance which shook the country will still continue even after the war . However after looking back a long time after the war it is evidant that it is over for good & that the terrorist leader is dead .

Keiji Fukuda , acting WHO assistant director-general , voiced concern at the sustained spread of the new H1N1 strain -- including more than 1,000 cases in Australia -- following major outbreaks in North America , where it emerged in April . Confirmed community spread in a second region beyond North America would trigger moving to phase 6 -- signifying a full-blown pandemic -- from the current phase 5 on the WHO 's 6-level pandemic alert scale . `` The situation has really evolved a lot over the past several days . We are getting really very close to knowing that we are in a pandemic situation , or I think , declaring that we are in a pandemic situation , '' Fukuda told a teleconference . Fukuda said a move to phase 6 would reflect the geographic spread of the new disease . `` It does not mean that the severity of the situation has increased or that people are getting seriously sick at higher numbers or higher rates than they are right now , '' he said . A decision to declare a pandemic involved more than simply making an announcement , he said . The United Nations agency had to ensure that countries were able to deal with the new situation and also handle any public reaction . `` One of the critical issues is that we do not want people to ` over-panic ' if they hear that we are in a pandemic situation . That they understand , for example , that the current assessment of the situation is that this is a moderate level , '' Fukuda said . The WHO and its 193 member states are working hard to prepare for a pandemic , for instance developing vaccines and building up supplies of anti-viral drugs , he said . The disease , which has infected over 26,500 people in 73 countries , with 140 deaths , has been most severe in Mexico , which has reported the highest number of fatalities , more than 100 . These include infections in otherwise healthy young people . A very real danger after declaring a pandemic was that hospitals could be overwhelmed by people seeking help when they did not really need it , while other patients requiring emergency treatment risked being neglected , according to Fukuda . `` In earlier pandemics , in earlier outbreaks , we have often seen that people who are in the category of being worried but who are not particularly sick , have overrun hospitals , '' he said . Since the new flu strain first appeared , many people have stopped eating pork , pigs have been culled in some countries , trade bans on meat imposed , travelers quarantined , and some countries have discussed closing borders . `` These are the kinds of potential adverse effects that you can have if you go out without making sure people understand the situation as well as possible , '' Fukuda said . Combining human , avian and swine viruses , the new strain has been dubbed ` swine flu ' , although scientists say this is misleading and stress there is no risk from eating pig meat . The world is better prepared but also more vulnerable to the adverse effects of a flu pandemic since the last one occurred in 1968 , due to the speed and volume of international travel . An H3N2 virus caused an estimated 1-4 million deaths at the time , and became known as Hong Kong flu . But Fukuda said the WHO would not name the new disease after a country or animal to avoid misleading stigmas . He voiced concern that Canadian Inuits had suffered disproportionately in the current outbreak , often needing hospitalization . It was not clear if this was due to higher levels of underlying chronic disease , genetics or poverty . `` Inuit populations were very severely hit in some of the earlier pandemics . This is why these reports raise such concerns to us , '' he said . -LRB- For a WHO note on its pandemic alert scale go to : An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "521", "dct": "2009-06-09", "dates": ["2009-06-09", "2009-06-09", "2009-06-09", "2009-06-09", "2011-01-01", "2009-06-09", "2000-01-01"], "text": "SINGAPORE , June 9 | Tue Jun 9 , 2009 5:33 am EDT SINGAPORE , June 9 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - GlaxoSmithKlyne -LRB- GSK .

The world 's second biggest drugmaker opened a S$ 600 million -LRB- $ 411 million -RRB- plant in the city-state on Tuesday , its second global site to manufacture the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine after Belgium . GSK would take up to two years to test run the plant before commercial production starts , CEO Andrew Witty said . `` It is going to take a year or two to finally make sure all the production processes are running at the appropriate level of quality , '' Witty told reporters . The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine protects infants and children under age 2 from the bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae , which causes diseases like pneumonia , meningitis , bronchitis , acute sinusitis and inflammation of the inner layer of the heart or endocarditis . Those kill nearly a million children worldwide each year , 90 percent of them in developing countries . The vaccine was introduced in 2000 in the United States and resulted in a sharp drop in pneumococcal disease in children , but is still unavailable in many underdeveloped countries , where it is most urgently needed , because of high costs . Witty said GSK 's new policy on price flexibility would make its vaccines and other drugs more affordable to poor nations . `` Vaccine is particularly important , a potential important product line for the emerging markets and Asia , '' he said . Witty welcomed a World Health Organisation recommendation last week that oral rotavirus vaccines be included in all national immunisation programs , but said they would not make a significant contribution to GSK 's revenues . `` I am excited about that . It 's great news , but that in itself is n't going to be a commercial opportunity , because obviously we are talking about product at much lower price being supplied to the developing world , '' Witty said .

Sanofi-Aventis , GlaxoSmithKline , Novartis and Solvay all said their vaccine teams had obtained the new influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- seed virus within the past fortnight , enabling them to begin the production process . What is still unclear , however , is how much vaccine they will be able to manufacture , since this depends on how easily the new virus strain grows within a commercial production environment . `` It will probably take a couple of weeks to ascertain the yields before we get into large-scale manufacture , '' a Glaxo spokesman said . The World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- said on Tuesday it was on the verge of declaring the first influenza pandemic in more than 40 years .

Recent investment in flu vaccine capacity means companies are in far better shape to meet the challenge of a pandemic than in the past . They are also well advanced in manufacturing supplies of the normal seasonal flu shot , allowing them to switch some capacity to making a pandemic H1N1 vaccine over the coming months . As a result , there could be windfall sales and profits this year for leading suppliers , some of which have already won orders for H1N1 vaccine from governments in Europe and North America . Although the H1N1 flu strain seems mild at present , health officials are worried it might return in a more virulent form in the northern hemisphere winter . The WHO estimates vaccine makers could produce 4.9 billion pandemic flu shots a year in the best-case scenario , though this will still not be enough for the entire world population of more than 6.5 billion , particularly if it turns out that people need more than one injection to gain immunity . The 4.9 billion estimate would be significantly lower if there was no wholesale switch from seasonal to pandemic flu vaccine-making . The H1N1 vaccine now being developed by companies must be tested first on ferrets and then on humans in clinical trials before regulatory authorities can approve it .

Although health officials have been watching for new influenza viruses in humans , animal health regulators have missed the opportunity to check swine , the researchers reported . Britons Andrew Rambaut of the University of Edinburgh and Oliver Pybus of Oxford University , and Yi Guan of the University of Hong Kong examined the genetic sequence of the new H1N1 swine flu virus . Like others who have done the same , they show it is a mixture of other viruses that had been circulating in pigs , one of which was itself a mixture including swine , human and avian-like genetic sequences . `` We show that it was derived from several viruses circulating in swine , and that the initial transmission to humans occurred several months before recognition of the outbreak , '' they wrote . `` Movement of live pigs between Eurasia and North America seems to have facilitated the mixing of diverse swine influenza viruses , leading to the multiple reassortment events associated with the genesis of the -LRB- new H1N1 -RRB- strain , '' they added . `` Yet despite widespread influenza surveillance in humans , the lack of systematic swine surveillance allowed for the undetected persistence and evolution of this potentially pandemic strain for many years . '' They said this new pandemic `` provides further evidence of the role of domestic pigs in the ecosystem of influenza A. '' The new virus , which was first reported in two U.S. children in March , apparently infected people as early as last January in Mexico , health officials have said . The World Health Organization declared it a full pandemic on Thursday , meaning it is circulating globally and can not be stopped . The international team also used a `` molecular clock '' method to compare the current virus to its relatives and estimate its age based on the mutations . This gives a rough idea of when the new virus is likely to have emerged . `` We found that the common ancestor of the -LRB- new H1N1 -RRB- outbreak and the closest related swine viruses existed between 9.2 and 17.2 years ago , depending on the genomic segment , hence the ancestors of the epidemic have been circulating undetected for about a decade , '' they wrote . `` Thus , this genomic structure may have been circulating in pigs for several years before emergence in humans , '' they added . The pork industry has been vociferously protesting use of the term `` swine flu '' to describe the virus . Fears that the pandemic would affect pork prices caused World Health Organization officials to use the generic designation of `` influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- '' -- which also refers to one of the current seasonal flu strains . Last week the U.S. Agriculture Department said it would launch a pilot surveillance project to look for new strains of flu virus in pigs . Also last week , Gerardo Nava of the National Autonomous University of Mexico and colleagues reported that their genetic analysis also pointed to North American swine as a potential source of the new virus . Cooked pork is no threat but live pigs can get influenza as easily as people do and people and pigs can sometimes pass viruses back and forth .

The United Nations agency raised its pandemic flu alert to phase 6 on a six-point scale , indicating the first influenza pandemic since 1968 is under way . `` With today 's announcement , WHO moves from an emergency to a longer-term response . Based on past experience , this pandemic will be with us for some months , if not years , to come , '' WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan said in a letter to staff , a copy of which was obtained by Reuters . People aged 30-50 , pregnant women or people suffering from chronic conditions such as asthma , diabetes or obesity are at highest risk , Chan told a news conference . Countries from Australia to Chile and the United States are reporting the new swine flu virus is `` crowding out '' seasonal flu , becoming the predominant influenza strain , she said . For now the virus was `` pretty stable , '' but Chan warned that it could still change into a more deadly form , perhaps mixing with the H5N1 bird flu virus circulating widely in poultry . `` So it is incumbent on WHO and all members to stay vigilant and alert for the next year or two or even beyond , '' she said . There is also a risk the swine flu could mix with its seasonal H1N1 cousin , which has developed resistance to the main antiviral flu drug Tamiflu , made by Roche AG and Gilead Sciences Inc , Dr. Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told a separate briefing . The United States has been operating on pandemic status for weeks , with hundreds of thousands of cases and at least 1,000 hospitalizations , Schuchat said . The virus disproportionately makes younger people sick . Some 57 percent of U.S. cases were among people aged 5 to 24 , and 41 percent of those hospitalized were in this younger age group . H1N1 is active in all 50 states and there are so many cases now that in some areas , patients with specific flu-like symptoms -- a fever above 104 degrees F -LRB- 40 degrees C -RRB- , cough or other respiratory symptoms -- are presumed to have the new virus . WHO reiterated its advice to its 193 member countries not to close borders or impose travel restrictions to halt the movement of people , goods and services , a call echoed by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon . `` We must guard against rash and discriminatory actions such as travel bans or trade restrictions , '' Ban told a news conference at U.N. headquarters . The move to phase 6 reflects the fact that the disease , widely known as swine flu , is spreading geographically , but does not indicate how virulent it is . Widespread transmission of the virus in Australia , signaling that it is entrenched in another region besides North America , was one of the key triggers for moving to phase 6 . `` We are satisfied that this virus is spreading to a number of countries and it is not stoppable , '' Chan said . `` Moving to pandemic phase 6 level does not imply we will see an increase in the number of deaths or very severe cases . Quite on the contrary . Many people are having mild disease , they recover without medicines in some cases and it is good news , '' she said . `` Although the pandemic appears to have moderate severity in comparatively well-off countries , it is prudent to anticipate a bleaker picture as the virus spreads to areas with limited resources , poor health care , and a high prevalence of underlying medical problems , '' she added . Canadian health officials said they were concerned about reports of more severe symptoms in some aboriginal communities , but said it was too soon to say for sure . `` To make conclusions based on a couple of communities that this is somehow a disease that is worse in a particular ethnic group . It 's much too early to make any of those kinds of conclusions or presumptions , '' said Dr. David Butler-Jones , Canada 's chief public health officer . Chan said WHO would start distributing a further donation of 5.65 million courses of Tamiflu from Roche . WHO recommended drugmakers stay on track to complete production of seasonal influenza vaccine for the Northern Hemisphere 's next winter in the next two weeks . Each year , normal flu kills up to 500,000 people and infects millions . Work on developing an H1N1 vaccine is already under way at leading companies , whose factories will be ready to switch to making a pandemic shot in around two weeks ' time , when normal season flu vaccine production is complete . Seasonal flu affects mainly the elderly and causes severe illness in millions , so a premature switch in vaccine production to cope with the new strain could put many people at risk . `` So our recommendation is they need to finish the seasonal vaccine and then move over , '' Chan said . Chan said the Geneva-based agency would work with regulatory authorities to help fast-track approval of new pandemic vaccines that are safe and effective so that they can be made available as soon as possible . In any case , the first doses would only be available in September , she added . A pandemic could cause enormous disruption to business as workers stay home because they are sick or to look after family members and authorities restrict gatherings of large numbers of people or movement of people or goods . World markets shrugged off the pandemic , as investors focused on possible global economic recovery . The strain , which emerged in April in Mexico and the United States , has spread widely . There have been 28,774 infections confirmed in 74 countries to date , including 144 deaths , according to WHO 's latest tally of laboratory-confirmed cases . -LRB- For the full text of Chan 's remarks at a press conference , go to : here -RRB- -LRB- Additional reporting by Laura MacInnis in Geneva , Michael Kahn in London , and Maggie Fox in Washington ; Editing by Xavier Briand -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "1097", "dct": "2009-06-12", "dates": ["2009-06-15", "2009-04-01", "1918-01-01", "1918-01-01"], "text": "Could you please review your estimated mortality rate for Swine flu -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- . It is wrong to give the impression that the mortality rate is 5-6 % . In the right hands , with access to modern healthcare , the mortality rate is probably similar to normal seasonal flu or a little higher . Its very difficult to make true estimates of mortality as the disease is evolving but 5-6 % is too high . Having a mortality rate similar to normal seasonal flu is not a reason for countries to lower their guard though . This infection seems to have a `` hospitalisation rate '' of around 2 % which is likely to put huge pressures on hospitals as they go into Autumn and Winter seasons . ... and on that note , is the mortality rate of regular seasonal flu really \\* 98 % \\* for those over 65 ? I find that very hard to believe . But if this is really the case then I will certainly recommend that my parents have their annual flu jab from now on ! According to the WHO , laboratory-confirmed cases of new influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- as officially reported to WHO as of 17:00 GMT 15 June 2009 are : ... giving a Mortality Rate of 0.45 % . If the the Lab-confirmed cases are indicative of the spread and impact of infections to date , then the mortality rate of `` 5 % to 6 % '' as reported in the graphic above is overly excessive -LRB- unless , ACTUAL deaths are a lot higher than REPORTED deaths -RRB- . The 5 to 6 % in Mexico would be an initial number based on limited information in April . Currently , Mexico has reported 6241 cases with 108 deaths which is a rate of 1.7 % . However , their testing is not as inclusive as the testing that is occuring in other countries , so it is very likely that there are many more cases . The actual rate is more than likely equivalent to the current global rate of 0.4 % -LRB- 167 deaths , 39620 cases -RRB- . However , this number is greatly influenced by the Mexico numbers . The United States has the next highest number of identified cases . Their approximate rate is 0.2 % -LRB- 44 deaths , 17855 cases -RRB- . Also keep in mind that these rates only account for identified cases . There are many more that have not been tested and are not included in the numbers . How on earth do you have the mortality rate calculated for H1 N1 ? It is nowhere near as high as 5-6 % . I think the chart is very misleading . As to not repeat history , we must be wary of influenza and the characteristics that it posses to survive . Even though this first wave seems innocuous as it did during the 1918 pandemic , we can not let our guard down . Numbers , hospitalizations and current death rates do not encumber all aspects of the seemingly mild influenza season , so that it is ... The next wave of the flu is what we should prepare for . This is the sort of irresponsible rubbish that is fuelling panic over the `` flying pig '' flu . If the mortality rate was over 2 % it would be a the most serious form of pandemic for which the WHO recommends draconian action such as closing national boarders . In publishing this incorrect information , you are saying that `` flying pig '' flu is already much , much worse than 1918 Spanish flu !!!!! As for a 98 % mortality from seasonal flu for those over 65 what utter crap . This whole affair is revealing how scientifically and mathematically challenged journalists actually are . We cant give all the blaim to the reporters , they only report what they are told . There is hardly any concrete investigative reporting these days due to time restraints . We all tend to lean on what is told is the supposedly truth , which is in many cases far from it . Look at how far this global warming issue has gone . Although we all agree that the problem is real , no one truely understands its cause and direction . . There are less deaths from H1 N1 then from the ordinary flu that goes around every year . It is anything but a pandemic . I am not sure why Who has called it a pandemic and it seem the rest of their numbers are off the charts as well . I have ever only had a flu shot once and after I was horribly sick . The only reason I decided to get it was I was working with a large group of people . I am sorry I did get the bloody thing . Other then that I have never had one and have never gotten the flu and if I did it was so mild one would n't even have noticed . The most I have ever really had is a mild cold . Everbody needs to back off with the `` journalists are horrible '' comments and look at the graphs again . The estimated rates are NOT actual rates . These are based upon the latest data and then projected , like any other probability . Also , I totally agree with Judy H. Remember , not every country in the world has a viable , working health surveillance system . It is guaranteed that there are more cases out there that we do n't know about . I would n't be surprised if there was a HIGHER mortality rate in certain populations . Also , p emery is absolutely correct . We have n't seen the full impact of this current outbreak yet .

But overall the report will not show any dramatic upsurge in protectionism as the economic crisis grinds on , rather a `` steady drip '' of trade measures , one source said . The WTO will be putting the finishing touches to its regular trade measures report ahead of the June 23-24 ministerial meeting of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development -LRB- OECD -RRB- in Paris , the sources said . The OECD annual meeting regularly devotes some time to trade , and will be attended by WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy . `` If we can get it finished by then we will , '' said one source , adding that otherwise Lamy would take the details with him to Paris to brief trade ministers . Of 80 countries implementing measures affecting trade since March 1 , 50 did so because of swine flu , the source said . `` We 're going to have a box on swine flu , '' the source said . The World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- declared on Thursday that the outbreak of swine flu , officially known as influenza -LRB- A -RRB- H1N1 , was a pandemic , meaning it would spread all over the world and could not be contained . -LRB- ID : nNLB765857 -RRB- It repeated that it did not recommend any travel or trade restrictions as a result . Many countries banned imports of pork from Mexico , the United States and other countries after the outbreak was detected in April . Lamy has joined the WHO , World Organisation for Animal Health -LRB- OIE -RRB- and U.N. 's Food and Agriculture Organisation in stating that pork is not a source of infection and is safe to eat provided it is prepared properly . But the forthcoming WTO report is likely to limit itself to listing the meat import restrictions and not comment on whether they are justified , for fear of prejudging any trade disputes that arise from them . Non-WTO member Russia is one of the most prominent countries banning pork imports from affected countries , and together with Argentina will again appear as one of the countries most actively restricting imports , the sources said . Other highlights of the report will be the resumption of dairy export subsidies by the United States and the introduction this week of extra tariffs on certain steel products by Brazil . Figures issued this week showed that Brazil is in recession after a smaller-than-expected fall in gross domestic product in the first quarter following a contraction in the fourth quarter . -LRB- ID : nN09366113 -RRB- The WTO report will also examine the impact of financial bailouts , technical barriers to trade , and anti-dumping and safeguards -- measures allowed under WTO rules to tackle unfairly priced imports or destabilising import surges .

Meanwhile , U.S. company Baxter International Inc said it is in full-scale production of an A\\/H1N1 flu pandemic vaccine that could be ready for commercial use as early as next month . The Baxter and Novartis vaccines were both developed using cell-based technology that could allow for much more rapid production and distribution than traditional vaccines produced using chicken eggs . The Novartis vaccine will enter clinical trials next month , the Swiss drugmaker said on Friday , a day after the World Health Organization declared a pandemic and warned governments to prepare for a long battle against the virus . Baxter said it had completed testing and evaluation of the virus and would submit its A\\/H1N1 vaccine for approval upon completion of initial manufacturing runs . European drugmakers Novartis , Sanofi-Aventis , GlaxoSmithKline and Solvay all obtained the influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- seed virus in recent weeks and aim to have a vaccine ready ahead of the northern hemisphere flu season . The WHO has estimated vaccine makers could produce up to 4.9 billion pandemic flu shots a year in a best-case scenario , leaving some of the world 's 6.5 billion population unprotected , particularly if more than one injection was needed to gain immunity . Novartis said first results with the H1N1 wild type strain showed it was quicker to make the vaccine through cell-based rather than through egg-based production , and it had completed its first batch weeks earlier than expected . Its cell-culture vaccine plant in Marburg , Germany had the potential to produce millions of doses per week , but it was difficult to predict output capacity for now . Spokesman Eric Althoff said Novartis should have the vaccine ready in September or October . He was unsure if other companies had completed the first stage of the production process . Glaxo said Friday it would be able to meet advance purchase commitments for 150 to 180 million doses , and the 50 million it donated to the WHO for developing countries . Wayne Pisano , head of vaccines at Sanofi , the world 's largest flu vaccine supplier , said on Thursday his company would `` produce the largest number of doses of vaccine in the shortest time frame , '' though it would be another four months before the first supply of bulk concentrate was ready . Novartis shares closed up 4.4 percent , while Baxter shares were up 3.5 percent . The H1N1 strain has spread widely , with 28,774 infections confirmed in 74 countries to date , including 144 deaths , according to the WHO 's latest tally . Although the strain seems mild at present , health officials are worried it might return in a more virulent form in the northern hemisphere winter . While commercial production of vaccines usually depends on how easily a virus strain grows in chicken eggs , Novartis said its cell-based technology means it can produce a vaccine without having to adapt the virus strain to grow in eggs . `` The cell-based manufacturing puts Novartis at the forefront of supplying pandemic vaccines to governments around the world , '' said Helvea analyst Karl-Heinz Koch . A number of national public health authorities have agreements with Baxter that allow them to place orders for its vaccine now that a pandemic has been declared by WHO , Baxter said . Novartis said more than 30 governments have made requests for vaccine ingredients , combining preexisting pandemic vaccine supply agreements and new requests for vaccines across all production platforms . The H1N1 flu outbreak is the first to be declared a pandemic since 1968 , and WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said on Thursday different regulatory authorities needed to work together to speed registration of a safe vaccine . The question of how the vaccine would be dispensed was still open , Novartis ' Althoff said . `` This will depend on government programs and what health authorities , the WHO and others say on how they want to make it available , '' he said . -LRB- Reporting by Katie Reid ; Additional reporting by Bill Berkrot in New York , Sam Cage in Zurich and Ben Deighton in London ; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter , John Stonestreet ; Editing by Gary Hill -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}, {"uid": "379", "dct": "2009-06-13", "dates": ["2009-01-01", "2009-06-11", "1968-01-01", "2009-06-13", "2009-04-01"], "text": "2009 06 13 00:11 JST GENEVA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The World Health Organization declared an influenza pandemic on Thursday and advised governments to prepare for a long-term battle against an unstoppable new flu virus .

Talks with bondholders started late last year , but hit a number of roadblocks along the way . `` By the bondholders dragging it out with us over the six months , your business takes on more uncertainty , you get more risk factors and you find yourself having to do a bank deal , '' said Chief Executive Mark Shapiro in an interview with Reuters . Shapiro said he hoped the company would emerge from bankruptcy in six months , healthier with significantly less debt . Under an out-of-court plan in March , one class of unsecured creditors was to get an 85 percent stake in the company . In the current plan , that class would get a mere 1 percent . Another class of unsecured creditors would get 7 percent . `` If the bank lenders can get the plan through as currently contemplated , that will be an extraordinary deal for them , '' said CRT Capital Group analyst Joseph Stauff . A spate of interest payments and the H1N1 flu virus were among the factors that constrained Six Flags ' liquidity and drove the company into the arms of the bank lenders , Shapiro said . Six Flags was also facing a $ 300 million payment to preferred stock holders due in August that it said it could not pay . Shapiro said filing in June versus August saved the company between $ 45 million and $ 50 million in interest payments . Six Flags has not posted an annual profit since 1998 , but drew more than $ 1 billion in revenue in 2008 . New York-based Six Flags filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Saturday morning , a move that was widely expected by analysts and industry experts . The filing followed a failed attempt to convert debt to equity . On Saturday , the company said its restructuring plan had been unanimously approved by its steering committee , which includes firms like Silver Point Capital and Eaton Vance Management . But many experts said the bankruptcy proceedings will likely be bumpy , as unsecured creditors try to get a larger piece of the pie . This group includes bondholders represented by the Bank of New York Mellon Corp -LRB- BK . N -RRB- and the Lake County , Illinois Convention and Visitor 's Bureau , which is owed more than $ 180,000 . `` The unsecured holders would get far less recovery than they would have expected , '' said Christopher Snow , an analyst with CreditSights . `` The management team put forth a plan that arguably serves to benefit the management and secured lenders at the expense of the unsecured lenders . '' On Monday , one creditor , Avenue Capital Management LLC filed an objection to , among other things , Six Flags ' use of cash collateral . Shapiro had no comment on the objection . Analysts expect the company 's management to survive the Chapter 11 proceedings . `` Since the bankruptcy is the result of capital structure issues rather than operating issues , it 's likely that the existing management will stay , '' said Mike Simonton , a credit analyst with Fitch . Much of the company 's $ 2.4 billion debt load was amassed from 1998 to 2005 , when the company bought parks and built roller coaster rides . The current management team was installed by Washington Redskins football team owner Daniel Snyder , who will continue as Six Flags ' chairman .

The cases -- approximately 16 to 18 have been reported -- would be the first in more than two decades in Libya of the disease known in medieval times as the Black Death , according to John Jabbour , a Cairo-based emerging diseases specialist at WHO . `` It is reported as bubonic plague , '' Jabbour said , adding WHO still did n't have `` a full picture '' of the situation . `` It is officially reported by Libya ... Tomorrow , WHO is deploying a mission to Libya to investigate the whole situation , to see how many of the cases are confirmed , or not confirmed . '' He said preliminary information from Libyan authorities showed 16 to 18 reported cases including one death , and that Tripoli had asked for assistance from the global health body . Bubonic plague , noticeable by black bumps that sometimes develop on victims ' bodies , causes severe vomiting and fever and still kills around 100 to 200 people annually worldwide . It can kill within days if not treated with antibiotics . A plague epidemic of 1347 to 1351 was one of the deadliest recorded in human history , killing about 75 million people , according to some estimates , including more than a third of Europe 's population . That pandemic was thought to have begun in Asia , then spread into the Middle East , Africa and Europe . Tubruq , where the new cases were reported , is approximately 125 km from the Egyptian border and was the scene of previous plague cases decades ago , Jabbour said . Egypt , already fighting to contain an outbreak of the H1N1 flu virus , said it had no reported cases of plague . Rodents carry plague , which is virtually impossible to wipe out and moves through the animal world as a constant threat to humans . Globally the World Health Organization reports about 1,000 to 3,000 plague cases each year , with most in the last five years occurring in Madagascar , Tanzania , Mozambique , Malawi , Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo .

An unusually cool late spring may be helping keep the infection going in the U.S. Northeast , especially densely populated areas in New York and Massachusetts , the officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said . And infections among healthcare workers suggest that people are showing up at work sick -- meaning that workplace policies may be contributing to its spread , the CDC officials said . The new strain of swine flu is officially a pandemic now , according to the World Health Organization . So far the virus is causing mild to moderate disease , but it has killed at least 167 people and been confirmed in nearly 40,000 globally . The United States has been hardest hit , with upward of 100,000 likely cases and probably far more , with 44 deaths and 1,600 hospitalized . `` The fact that we are seeing ongoing transmission now indicates that we are seeing something different , '' the CDC 's Dr. Daniel Jernigan told a news briefing . `` And we believe that that may have to do with the complete lack of immunity to this particular virus among those that are most likely affected . And those are children , '' Jernigan added . `` The areas of the country that are most affected , some of them have very high population densities , like Boston and New York . So that may be a contributor as well . Plus the temperature in that part of the country is cooler , and we know that influenza appears to like the cooler times of the year for making transmission for effective . '' Jernigan said in areas that are the most affected up to 7 percent of the population has influenza-like illness . `` The United States will likely continue to see influenza activity through the summer , and at this point we 're anticipating that we will see the novel H1N1 continue with activity probably all the way into our flu season in the fall and winter . The amount of activity we expect to be low , and then pick up later . '' One worrying pattern : healthcare workers are being infected , and most reported they did little or nothing to protect themselves , the CDC 's Dr. Mike Bell said . People coming into emergency departments or clinics need to be checked right away for flu symptoms and anyone working with such a patient needs to wear a mask , gloves and eyewear , Bell said . `` We 're beginning to see a pattern of healthcare personnel-to-healthcare personnel transmission in some of the clusters , which is also concerning , because it gets to the issue of people showing up to work sick , '' Bell said . Doctors , nurses and technicians who have flu can spread it to vulnerable patients , Bell noted . As of May 13 , the CDC said it had received 48 reports of healthcare workers infected with swine flu . Detailed case reports on 26 showed that 13 were infected in a healthcare setting such as a clinic or hospital and 12 caught it from infected patients , the CDC said in its weekly report on death and disease .

Governments are pledging billions for the vaccine -- the United States has set aside $ 1 billion , the Netherlands ordered 34 million doses and Australia has ordered 10 million doses as the World Health Organization declared a pandemic . Yet no one is sure yet whether even to give the vaccine to anyone and if so , who should get it . Usually the guidelines for influenza vaccination are clear -- give it to the oldest , the youngest and the sickest . In an average year , influenza is a factor in 250,000 to 500,000 deaths , and in developed countries , 90 percent are the elderly . But the new H1N1 swine flu virus is not behaving typically . It has dragged the Northern Hemisphere 's flu season well into June , although influenza usually dies way down by April . `` The fact that we are seeing ongoing transmission now indicates that we are seeing something different , '' Dr. Daniel Jernigan of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters this week . Most cases are in people aged 5 to 24 -- usually the last group to get seriously ill from flu and the last group vaccinated during a normal flu season . There have been few serious H1N1 cases among the elderly , perhaps because they have some pre-existing immunity to a similar H1N1 that circulated in the past , or maybe because their immune system response is different -- flu experts do not know yet . To decide what to do , WHO officials will have to watch and see what this new strain does . As WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan said at the beginning of the pandemic last month , the world is watching it unfold in real time -- and much of humanity is taking part in a real-time experiment . If the virus continues to affect mostly older children and young adults , the strategy should be clear -- vaccinate those groups . And at least one study supports this idea for other reasons . This week a team at Britain 's University of Warwick said computer models suggest that vaccinating children aged 6 months to 18 years may be the best way of using limited supplies to control the pandemic . Because schools can be epicenters for spreading flu infection , including the new H1N1 , this might make more sense than trying more general approaches . Vaccinating schoolchildren would prevent them from spreading it to two more vulnerable groups -- the elderly and the very young . It may also protect those clearly more at risk from both H1N1 and seasonal flu -- people with asthma , diabetes and heart disease , suppressed immune systems and pregnant women . By Friday , WHO had confirmed 44,287 cases of the new flu and 180 deaths , with Laos , Oman , Papua New Guinea , South Africa all reporting their first cases . The United States alone has more than 21,000 cases with officials saying there are likely at least 10 times that many , and 87 deaths . WHO estimates vaccine makers could produce up to 4.9 billion pandemic flu shots a year at most . That would depend on how many doses people needed and whether vaccine boosters called adjuvants could be used to stretch out the doses . Even this best-case scenario would leave more than a billion people unvaccinated . Vaccine maker Sanofi-Aventis , which says it makes 40 percent of the world 's supply of flu vaccine , says at full capacity its two Pennsylvania factories can make 150 million doses of seasonal influenza vaccine a year . Its French plant can make 120 million doses per year . This would triple for H1N1 , as the seasonal vaccine is a cocktail of three different viruses .

But when the next flood hits , and it will because Jakarta sees frequent floods in the rainy season , bin Juri may have a modicum of protection thanks to a low-cost insurance policy that he purchased this month . He is among millions of the world 's poor who are covered for natural disasters by cheap insurance , or microinsurance , as commercial firms recognize that insuring the poor is not just good public relations but also profitable . `` Interest in microinsurance has been exploding throughout the world , '' said Craig Thorburn , a senior insurance specialist at the World Bank who has developed microinsurance programs and who advises countries on insurance market development . `` New projects and proposals are being developed in more and more countries . Government policy-makers are reviewing their regulations and the microinsurance sector does not appear to have been slowed by the crisis . '' Microinsurance began as a form of charity in the 1990s , when the International Labor Organization began experimenting with super-cheap insurance policies , said Michael McCord , president of the U.S.-based MicroInsurance Center who recently discussed the topic with officials at Indonesia 's central bank . In 1995 , McCord said he developed an entirely commercial microinsurance product backed by insurer AIG , with a view to selling it through a microfinance institute in Uganda . `` This example showed that commercial microinsurance is possible and became the demonstration model that helped other commercial insurers recognize the low-income market as viable , '' he said . Within a decade , AIG 's Ugandan business covered about 1.6 million lives , and microinsurance premiums accounted for nearly 17 percent of its Ugandan unit 's profits . Today , a $ 1,000 life insurance policy sells for just $ 1 a year in Uganda , McCord said , making it affordable to the poor . He estimates that about 135 million low-income people worldwide are now covered by cheap insurance , up from 78 million two years ago . Investors are seeing potential in what could be a multi-billion dollar industry . The Leapfrog Financial Inclusion Fund announced last week that it had raised $ 44 million for what it said was the world 's first microinsurance fund . `` The world desperately needs market-based solutions to poverty that draw in major financial investors by offering fair but competitive returns , '' said Dr. Andrew Kuper , President and Founder of LeapFrog , a Luxembourg-based fund . `` Microinsurance is both profitable and scalable , '' he was quoted as saying on the fund 's website . The fund will invest in India , Pakistan , South Africa , Ghana and Kenya , it added . Some governments have taken a more active role in promoting such insurance schemes to the poor . For example in India , it is compulsory for insurer firms to offer a microinsurance product , though the results have been mixed . In practice , only about a third of India 's insurance firms offer such products , said Rupalee Ruchismita , founder of the Center for Insurance and Risk Management in India , which works with insurers and microfinance firms to develop livestock , health , weather , and catastrophe insurance plans . `` Most insurance firms are doing it simply to meet targets or to be in the good books of the regulators , and their argument is that it is very difficult to reach the intended audience , '' she said . Insurance experts , including Ruchismita and McCord , said such microinsurance schemes tend to be more successful when a community-based organization works in partnership with a private insurer , as both have strengths in different areas . For insurers , the sheer number of potential customers in the low-income bracket makes this an attractive market . `` About 80 percent of the world population live in emerging markets but they account for only 22 percent of global GDP and 9 percent of global premiums , '' said Kua Ka Hin , Munich Re 's chief executive for Singapore and Southeast Asia . `` These emerging markets still offer huge potential ; they have got the large numbers which underline the principle of insurance . '' Kua says Munich Re is looking at microinsurance products in Asia covering earthquakes , typhoons and even loss of income for businesses forced to close because of a flu , or H1N1 , pandemic . Last month , Munich Re began a trial of the world 's first flood microinsurance policy in flood-prone central Jakarta . Residents in Manggarai district pay 50,000 rupiah -LRB- $ 4.88 -RRB- for a flood `` cash card '' that can be cashed in for 250,000 rupiah if floodwater levels rise to or above 9.5 meters at the Manggarai Water Gate , which is 2 meters above normal levels . So far only 50 policies have been sold , partly because the insurance only covers the very worst floods , not the recurrent knee-high flooding that can still ruin homes and possessions . `` People say 950 cm is too high and it 's unlikely to happen . Also , the payout , they said , is too small , '' said Francis Purwanta , a spokesman for Munich Re 's local partner , Asuransi Wahana Tata , which sells the policies , pays out claims , and is then reimbursed by Munich Re . `` So we try to explain that it has happened before , at least three times in five years , '' said Purwanta . The idea of making a profit off the very poorest members of society is also controversial . Yet supporters say it is necessary if insurance companies are to back such policies . `` Companies can and should make profits of the low-income market . This is the only way we will get commercial insurers in the market , '' said McCord , who adds that non-profit organizations working alone rarely have the technical expertise to calculate the risks and then design an effective insurance program . `` A commercial approach is what 's needed here , across the board . But what helps a lot is using institutions that people trust to deliver the product . '' However , some critics , such as Wardah Hafidz , from the Indonesian non-government organization Urban Poor Consortium , suggest that governments are evading their responsibilities by expecting poor people to take out private insurance policies . `` The government should be giving protection from disasters to these people instead of assisting private business to target poor people to sell them their products , '' she said . The argument is less philosophical for flood victims such as Bin Juri who knows what it 's like to see his precious possessions washed away and is well aware that the 250,000 rupiah insurance policy he holds would be inadequate to cover his losses if another flood struck his home . `` That alone cost 90,000 rupiah , '' he said , pointing to a large cooking pot at his feet . `` But it 's some money at least .

It was also loaded up with extras like $ 7.7 billion to address the H1N1 flu pandemic , and $ 1.4 billion in foreign aid for Pakistan , which is fighting Taliban militants spilling over the border from Afghanistan . The measure was nearly derailed by Obama 's request for money to close the controversial U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , as well as for $ 108 billion in credit lines to back the International Monetary Fund as it helps countries weather the global economic downturn . The legislation did not include $ 80 million Obama wanted for closing Guantanamo and bans releasing any detainees into the United States through September 30 . But it allows detainees to be brought to U.S. soil for trial . Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers demanded the White House produce a detailed plan before closing the Guantanamo prison camp . Before the legislation passed , the administration rushed to release or transfer more than a dozen detainees . Despite fierce Republican opposition , Obama ultimately prevailed to include in the legislation provisions to extend a $ 100 billion credit line to the IMF and expand the U.S. contribution to the multilateral lender by $ 8 billion .

The new H1N1 influenza virus that has triggered a global pandemic is infecting people in the United States well beyond the normal period for influenza season , Dr. Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters in a telephone briefing . `` The key point is this new infectious disease is not going away , '' Schuchat said . `` In the U.S. , we 're still experiencing a steady increase in the number of reported cases , with 6,000 new cases reported just this week . '' That represents the largest number of cases to be reported in a one-week span since the beginning of the outbreak in April . The World Health Organization is now reporting more than 67,000 confirmed cases of H1N1 flu and some 300 deaths worldwide . In the United States , there have been 27,717 laboratory-confirmed cases , including more than 3,000 hospitalizations and 127 deaths . `` We are estimating about a million people in the U.S. or more have gotten this virus at a time of year when people really are n't continuing to get the seasonal influenza viruses , '' Schuchat said . `` A big question that everybody really has is what kind of illness , hospitalization and deaths will we see when our winter flu season begins ? '' Schuchat said vaccine makers are developing H1N1 vaccine that will be tested in clinical trials over the summer . She said the CDC has not yet decided if it will recommend people get the new shots when flu season in arrives in North America in the fall . But Schuchat said the CDC is asking state and local health departments to draw up plans for how to handle distribution of the vaccines . `` We want states to be ready to offer and administer this novel vaccine , '' she said , focusing especially on how to reach younger people , pregnant women and people with underlying health conditions like asthma and diabetes that put them at higher risk . At a three-day meeting in Atlanta of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices , which advises the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , CDC researchers said one vaccination scenario could include as many as 600 million doses . That could place a heavy burden on cash-strapped health departments , which would likely have to distribute two doses of the new vaccine , which might be required for full immunity , in addition to the regular seasonal flu vaccination program . Schuchat said the CDC continues to watch for changes in the virus in the Southern Hemisphere , where flu season is now in full swing . `` We have not seen any changes in the virus that are important at this point , '' she said . In the United States , the new flu continues to spread , with 12 states reporting widespread flu activity , something Schuchat said was `` very unusual for this time of year . '' `` That is just one feature that helps us to see that what we are seeing is quite different , '' she said . She said flu infections are even affecting children attending camps in the Northern Hemisphere summer , with outbreaks in 34 camps in 16 states . `` Some have actually closed for the summer .

It was expected that the strain would at some point show resistance to Tamiflu , Denmark 's State Serum Institute said . The patient was now well and no further infection with the resistant virus had been detected . `` It does not constitute a risk to public health and does not cause changes to the recommendations for the use of oseltamivir -LRB- Tamiflu -RRB- , '' the institute said in a statement . The World Health Organization declared an influenza pandemic earlier this month and advised governments to prepare for a long-term battle against an unstoppable new flu virus . The WHO had no immediate comment on the case of Tamiflu resistance . The United Nations agency has raised its pandemic flu alert to its highest alert level of 6 , indicating the first influenza pandemic since 1968 is underway . Flu viruses mutate regularly and can develop resistance to drugs at any time . The seasonal strain of H1N1 is a distant cousin of the swine flu and was widely resistant to Tamiflu this year . Common seasonal flu can resist Tamiflu and David Reddy , Roche 's pandemic taskforce leader , said a case of resistance in H1N1 -- also know as swine flu -- was not unexpected . Roche had been working on strategies to counter such a development , Reddy said . NO THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH The WHO has said Tamiflu was working against strains of the new H1N1 flu but some analysts have expressed concern it might be less effective than Relenza , GlaxoSmithKline 's inhaled drug , since there have been widespread reports of resistance by seasonal H1N1 flu . Roche stock closed up 1.4 percent at 149 Swiss francs , outperforming a 0.7 percent firmer DJ Stoxx European drugs index . Surveillance for antiviral resistance in the new strain is continuing , though the isolated case in Denmark does not pose a threat to public health or reason to change recommendations for use of Tamiflu , said David Daigle , a spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Preventiom . `` It is well known and expected that influenza virus can mutate spontaneously . The resistance has not changed the capability of the virus to transmit or cause disease , and the assessment is still that this is a relatively mild influenza , '' Daigle said in an email .

L -RRB- said its Asia-Pacific sales could double in five years as growing prosperity boosts demand for better healthcare and as it cuts prices in some Asian countries . GSK Asia Pacific chief Christophe Weber said on Monday the company aimed to boost sales in countries such as China , Indonesia and the Philippines by selling drugs and vaccines for less than it typically charged in developed countries . `` Clearly there will be a very high demand in the future because the economic development of the countries in the region and people want more healthcare , '' Weber told Reuters on the sidelines of a regional media workshop in Singapore . GSK Asia Pacific last year chalked up 1.18 billion pounds -LRB- $ 2 billion -RRB- in sales last year , accounting for just under 5 percent of the company 's total sales . GSK estimates its Asia-Pacific pharmaceutical market share at 5.3 percent , making it the region 's fourth largest player . Highlighting the region 's potential , GSK said Asia Pacific had twice the number of newborns compared with North America or Western Europe , but mortality rates for mothers were 12 times higher than in Europe . For children under five , the mortality rate was 3 times higher than in the Americas . A lot of the deaths in children in the region could have been prevented by vaccination had they been more accessible and affordable , Weber said . `` Price is one dimension , but it is a vital one . You need to have an affordable vaccine , that 's one of the strategies we are accelerating , '' he said . GSK opened a $ 411 million plant in Singapore this month , its second site producing vaccine against pneumonia-causing bacteria . It will take up to two years to test the new plant before commercial production starts . The other site is in Belgium . Since the H1N1 outbreak began in April , the governments of Australia , New Zealand , Taiwan and Singapore have bought GSK 's Relenza flu treatment , Weber said . GSK said it has advised governments to buy and stock more of Relenza , which is used to treat flus such as the H1N1 virus that is spreading across the globe , for a more effective response in dealing with a viral outbreak . `` There have been some publications showing that there is some level of resistance developed for Tamiflu , '' Weber said of the product made by competitor Roche -LRB- ROG . `` In case there will be more resistance to Tamiflu , Relenza will be a good alternative .

Swine flu followed route map By Maggie Fox , Health and Science Editor WASHINGTON | Tue Jun 30 , 2009 4:18 am IST WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Health experts are fond of saying any new disease is just a flight away from anywhere , and a report published on Monday shows the new strain of H1N1 flu followed the airline route map as it spread around the globe . The swine flu virus spread first and quickest in March and April in the United States and Canada -- where 80 percent of airline passengers traveled in March and April of 2008 , researchers at St. Michael 's Hospital in Toronto found . Dr. Kamram Khan of St. Michael 's and colleagues used International Air Transport Association data for their study . They said travel patterns were also similar in 2007 and therefore likely to be similar in 2009 . `` This work provides the world with a potent early warning system for emerging infectious diseases , '' Dr. Michael Gardam of the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion said in a statement . `` Our analysis showed that in March and April 2008 , a total of 2.35 million passengers flew from Mexico to 1,018 cities in 164 countries , '' Khan and colleagues wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine and published at h1n1 . Los Angeles had the most travelers , with 221,494 passengers arriving from Mexico in March and April of 2008 . New York followed with 126,345 . The first non-U.S. city was Toronto , No. 12 , with 44,854 passengers arriving from Mexico . The World Health Organization has confirmed 70,893 cases of the new H1N1 swine flu pandemic , with 311 deaths . However , U.S. health officials last week said there were likely at least 1 million cases there alone . Iraq , Lithuania , Monaco and Nepal all confirmed their first cases on Monday . The first cases were detected in two California children in April , but tests showed the first known infections were in Mexico . By the time they had identified a new virus , U.S. officials said it had spread too far and too fast to try to stop it . Other countries tried measures to slow its spread , but WHO declared a pandemic -- a global epidemic -- this month . `` For the first time , we can quickly integrate information about worldwide air traffic patterns with information about global infectious disease threats , '' Khan said . `` What this means is that cities and countries around the world can now respond to news of a threat earlier and more intelligently than ever before . '' The researchers said the United States receives more than 76 million international visitors from around the world every year and the United States and Canada together generate and receive about one-sixth of the global volume of international air traffic .

The United Nations agency has declared a global pandemic is underway from the virus known as swine flu which has so far been treatable with Tamiflu , made by Roche . WHO spokesman Dick Thompson said that the discovery of a patient in Denmark whose infection did not respond to the drug , revealed by the Swiss company and Danish officials on Monday , did not amplify the severity of the virus . `` This is an isolated case . At this time , there is no public health implication . But we must remain alert as the virus can change at any time and we must not be complacent , '' he told Reuters . Officials say the patient is now well and no further contagion with the resistant virus was detected . Resistance to Tamiflu has been previously documented in the deadly bird flu virus H5N1 and seasonal H1N1 flu , Thompson said . `` We need to monitor the virus -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- continuously , '' he said , adding that the WHO 's global influenza surveillance network linking laboratories in 97 countries would keep monitoring it . `` WHO is not changing its recommendations for the use of antivirals , '' Thompson added , referring to the global body 's advice to its 193 member states . The WHO has previously said that the H1N1 virus is sensitive to a class of antiviral drugs which includes Tamiflu , known generically as oseltamivir , and Relenza by GlaxoSmithKline , known generically as zanamivir . Denmark 's State Serum Institute said , when making the announcement on Monday , that it was expected that the strain would at some point show resistance to Tamiflu . It said that while the patient was found to be infected with a virus strain that had mutated to a form resistant to Tamiflu , the alternative drug Relenza , which is inhaled , remained an effective treatment . The WHO on June 11 raised its pandemic flu alert to its highest level of 6 , signifying that the first influenza pandemic since 1968 was under way -LRB- ID : nLC321991 -RRB- Flu viruses mutate regularly and can develop resistance to drugs at any time .

At least 20 companies make flu vaccines , including Novartis , Sanofi-Aventis , GlaxoSmithKline , Baxter International , Solvay , Australia 's CSL and nasal spray maker MedImmune , now part of AstraZeneca . French drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis , which has estimated it makes 40 percent of the world 's supply of flu vaccine , said this month that it had begun large-scale production of a H1N1 vaccine through its Sanofi-Pasteur unit . Novartis has said it expects a vaccine to be available by autumn and Baxter International has said it is in full-scale production of a vaccine that could be ready for commercial use as early as July .

DADHKAI , India | Tue Jun 30 , 2009 9:33 am EDT DADHKAI , India -LRB- Reuters Life ! -RRB- - Silence reigns in the sleepy village of Dadhkai , nestled high up in the Himalayan mountains in northern India and where the majority of residents are either deaf or mute . Each of the 47 families in this village in Jammu and Kashmir state have a least one member who can neither hear nor speak . The first reported case dates back to 1931 and now the numbers have swelled to 82 . `` The birth of a child is a very happy occasion , meant to be celebrated . But here the birth of a child leads to harassment not only for the parents but for the entire village , '' said Hashmiddin , a village elder who only goes by one name . `` A deaf and mute child only aggravates problems and increases miseries , '' he told Reuters Television . The village with a picture-postcard setting stands in isolation from the rest of the region , as there are no roads , and no transport connecting it to the outside world . A river cuts it from the neighboring region . Three years ago , a team of scientists and doctors came from an Indian health institute to study the village 's case , but no conclusive findings have been made public so far . Some villagers blame it on pollution in the water or air , while others believe they could be cursed , as adjoining villages have not reported any similar disorders . But an age-old custom of marrying within the community , coupled with lack of access to medical facilities and immunization , probably led to the large number of deaf and mute cases , says Jan Mohammed , an instructor for the deaf . `` I think it is because of a genetic problem , '' Mohammed said . `` Close relatives marry here . In the past there was no immunization given and also there is a lack of iodine and salt . '' Lack of education , and hearing aids , has left many locals disillusioned about the future . `` These days it is so difficult to find matches for well educated normal girls , how will I get my deaf and dumb daughters married , '' says Lal Hussain , who has two daughters . But there have been a lucky few . Bano Begum , who is not hearing impaired , was married to a deaf and mute man and said their relationship was initially a huge struggle as they could not communicated with each other . But the couple gave birth to three normal children and learned to communicate with each other through sign language . Some experts say the locals should be forced to marry outside their village , which the community rejects . India 's Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad recently said another health team would be sent to the village soon . -LRB- Editing by Bappa Majumdar and Miral Fahmy -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform "}]
