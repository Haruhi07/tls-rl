Miss Universe Dayana Mendoza said Guant namo was ' a loooot of fun ' . Photograph : Susana Gonzalez\\/Reuters Pageant officials are calling the post by the beauty queen , Dayana Mendoza from Venezuela , a misunderstanding . During a tour of the dentention center with Miss USA , Crystle Stewart , Mendoza wrote that the facility was `` a loooot of fun '' and the prison had an `` unbelievable '' beach in the bay . `` We visited the detainees ' camps and we saw the jails , where they shower , how the -LRB- y -RRB- recreate themselves with movies , classes of art , books . It was very interesting , '' she said . A statement from the president of the Miss Universe organization , Paula Shugart , has replaced the posting . Shugart wrote that Mendoza was referring to `` the hospitality she received while meeting the members of the US military and their families '' . Greg Gutfeld , host of the Fox News program Red Eye , has apologised to Canada for comments that were made about the country 's military during a show on 17 March . On one segment of the show , a panel talked about Canadian lieutenant general Andrew Leslie 's assertion that the military would need a one-year break from fighting in Afghanistan after Canada 's commitment ends in 2011 . Gutfield laughed at Leslie 's suggestion saying : `` The Canadian military wants to take a breather to do some yoga , paint landscapes , run on the beach in gorgeous white capri pants . '' `` Is n't this the perfect time to invade this ridiculous country ? They have no army , '' he added . Canada 's defense minister Peter MacKay demanded an apology from the presenter before attending a repatriation ceremony for Canadian troops who were killed in Afghanistan last Friday . In a statement issued to Fox News today , Gutfeld said his comments `` may have been misunderstood '' and that he did n't intend to disrespect `` the brave men , women and families of the Canadian military '' . 116 Canadian soldiers have died in Afghanistan . On Monday , Venezuela 's president Hugo Ch vez announced halting a program that provided free heating oil to low-income US citizens . The leftist leader had reportedly heralded the initiative as a clear sign of his generosity toward America 's poor . However , the recent steep drop in the price of oil , Venezuela 's chief export , forced the nation 's government to cut spending and the program was scrapped in the process . But yesterday , Ch vez backtracked and announced that the program was reinstated . And of course , such a quick reversal did not come without criticism . According to McClatchy newspapers , Dennis Jett , former US ambassador to Peru , believes Chavez is trying to `` save face '' and mask his nation 's financial problems . Maybe , maybe not .

The virus , which may be responsible for a further 48 deaths in Mexico , has thrown the country into confusion . There are a total of 1,004 cases and eight have been detected over the border in Texas and California . Today , people in Mexico City were being ordered not to kiss or shake hands , football matches went ahead without spectators , theaters , shops and museums closed , staff were inside locked schools scrubbing classrooms with disinfectant and health workers patrolled buses , ordering sickly-looking people home .

Evolving when different flu viruses infect a pig , a person or a bird , mingling their genetic material , the hybrid could spread quickly because people would have no natural defences . `` We are seeing a range of severity of the disease , from mild to severe and of course death , '' said Chan . `` The eight cases in the US have been mild in terms of severity and it is too premature to calculate the mortality rate of this disease .

Mexico 's health secretary Jose Angel Cordova said : `` We are very , very concerned . '' Any doubts over of the extent of the emergency were dispelled today by the sight of soldiers handing out blue surgical masks to pedestrians and motorists along Mexico City 's central Reforma boulevard . With TV and radio calling on the population to seek medical advice for any flu-like symptoms , queues sprouted at health clinics and hospitals across the city . President Felipe Calder n said his government learned only on Thursday night what kind of virus Mexico was facing after tests by specialist laboratories in Canada confirmed the outbreak as a type labeled A\\/H1N1 not previously seen in pigs or humans . Few cases have had any contact with live pigs . The WHO said the virus appeared to be able to spread from human to human and contained human virus , avian virus and pig viruses from North America , Europe and Asia . It might be completely new or has only now been detected . Given how quickly flu can spread , there might be cases incubating around the world already , said Dr Michael Osterholm at the University of Minnesota : `` Hundreds and thousands of travellers come in and out -LRB- of Mexico -RRB- every day . You 'd have to believe there 's been more unrecognised transmission that 's occurred . '' It was unclear how much protection current vaccines might offer . A `` seed stock '' genetically matched to the new virus has already been created by the US Centers for Disease Control . If the US government decides vaccine production is necessary , it would be used by manufacturers to get started . At Mexico City 's international airport , passengers were questioned to try to prevent anyone with flu symptoms from boarding aeroplanes and spreading the disease . Britain 's Foreign Office issued a warning to travellers about the outbreak but stopped short of recommending people did not visit Mexico . US health officials did the same , urging visitors to wash their hands frequently . In Asia , which has fought hard to contain the H5N1 bird flu virus , which has killed at least 257 people worldwide since late 2003 , tighter enforcements were being made . Passengers and pork products from Mexico were being checked at many airports . Health authorities in Thailand and Hong Kong said they were closely monitoring the situation . At Tokyo 's Narita airport among the world 's busiest with more than 96,000 people using it daily officials installed a device at the arrival gate for flights from Mexico to measure the temperatures of passengers . ` We are increasing health surveillance following the outbreak of swine flu , '' said Akira Yukitoki , an official at the Japanese airport 's quarantine station . He said 160 passengers arriving from Mexico yesterday were screened . The airport also plans to put up signs urging tourists to `` wear masks , wash hands and gargle '' , Yukitoki said . In the Philippines , the government was also tightening monitoring at all ports to prevent the entry of any pigs or pork from Mexico and the US . `` We 've seen swine influenza in humans over the past several years , and in most cases , it 's come from direct pig contact . This seems to be different , '' said Dr Arnold Monto , a flu expert with the University of Michigan . `` I think we need to be careful and not apprehensive , but certainly paying attention to new developments as they proceed . '' While the fear is palpable among Mexico City 's 20 million residents , confusion mixed with traditional mistrust of official statements means widespread suspicion that the government is not telling the whole truth about the disease . The government had claimed until late on Thursday that there was nothing unusual about the flu cases and the sudden turnaround that saw schools closed across the capital on Friday angered many Mexicans . Government workers were ordered to wear masks , and authorities urged residents to stay home from work if they felt ill . What seems almost certain is that the doors of all nurseries , kindergartens , schools and universities in the vast metropolis of 20 million people will remain closed this week . With the authorities urging people to avoid crowds , the atmosphere inside the metro and crowded buses is notably tense . Health secretary Cordova , a devout Catholic , stopped short of urging Mexicans not to go to mass tomorrow , but he did emphasise that a nod of the head was better than a handshake when it came to greeting friends .

It is one of a number of viruses that cause illness among people and animals , causing respiratory problems , fever and fatigue . Avian flu - which has previously been the subject of pandemic fears after humans began contracting it - is another deadly strain . According to the Health Protection Agency , outbreaks of swine flu - a disease caused by type A influenza - regularly affect pigs . People who are around pigs are most likely to suffer from the H1N1 virus but it is also possible for the virus to spread from person to person . Evoking memories of the fears associated with bird flu , the latest perceived threat of a pandemic was brought to public attention after cases of human swine flu were reported in Mexico and parts of California and Texas in the US . There have been no cases identified in the UK for at least 10 years . Scientists found this virus is contagious and spreading from human to human although they do not know how easily the virus spreads between people , the HPA said . The symptoms of swine influenza in people are similar to the symptoms of regular human seasonal flu and include fever , fatigue , lack of appetite , coughing and sore throat . Some people have also reported vomiting and diarrhoea . Testing has shown that the human swine influenza H1N1 can be treated with the antivirals oseltamavir -LRB- Tamiflu -RRB- and zanamivir -LRB- Relenza -RRB- . Seasonal flu is caused by viruses that are adapted to spread in humans , who have some natural immunity to common strains and can boost it by immunisation with a vaccine . Avian flu is caused by influenza viruses adapted for infection in birds while swine flu is caused by influenza viruses adapted for infection in pigs . Potentially major problems can arise when human and animal flu viruses mix and lead to the development of new viruses which are resistant to immunity and can spread through the population , sparking a pandemic . The HPA said it was too early to say whether the cases in Mexico and the US would lead to a larger outbreak or could represent the appearance of a potential pandemic strain of influenza virus . There is currently insufficient evidence to understand the extent to which the cases are firmly linked .

Photograph : Centers for Disease Control\\/Reuters It is a contagious respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza viruses . Pigs are hit by regular outbreaks . There are many different types of swine flu and the current cases involve the H1N1 strain of type A influenza virus . How do humans catch it ? While people do not normally catch it , humans can contract the virus , usually if they have been in close contact with pigs . It is also possible for the constantly changing infection to spread from person to person , which has happened in the latest outbreak . Experts believe it spreads in the same way as seasonal flu - through coughing and sneezing . The symptoms of swine influenza in people are similar to the symptoms of regular human seasonal influenza infection and include fever , fatigue , lack of appetite , coughing and sore throat . Some people with swine flu have also reported vomiting and diarrhoea . What is the difference between swine flu , avian flu and the flu commonly seen in the UK during the winter ? Influenza viruses are commonly circulating in the human and animal environment , with different strains causing illness in humans , bird and pigs . Seasonal influenza is caused by viruses that are adapted to spread in humans . Humans have some natural immunity to the strains that are in common circulation , and this immunity can be boosted by immunisation with a vaccine . Avian influenza is caused by influenza viruses adapted for infection in birds . Similarly , swine influenza is caused by influenza viruses adapted for infection in pigs . These illnesses all cause the same respiratory symptoms in sufferers and can be passed between one another . More than 80 people have died and thousands made ill , in Mexico in particular , although cases have also been reported in the US and New Zealand . However , testing has shown that the antiviral drugs oseltamavir -LRB- Tamiflu -RRB- and zanamivir -LRB- Relenza -RRB- appear to be effective against the human swine influenza H1N1 strain , Why should we be worried about it ? The World Health Organisation warned the outbreak had `` pandemic potential '' and countries were advised to step up surveillance and preparation in case the infection spreads rapidly . Flu viruses have the ability to change and mutate , making it difficult for drugs manufacturers to ensure effective vaccines are available . The new version of the H1N1 virus is a mix of different animal and human versions of the disease . Mixing can lead to the development of changed viruses to which humans have little immunity . If the flu spreads over a wide geographic area and affects a large proportion of the population it goes beyond an epidemic and becomes a pandemic . According to the Health Protection Agency , an influenza pandemic is defined as a new or novel influenza virus that spreads easily between humans . When new influenza viruses are introduced into the environment , humans do not have any natural immunity to protect against them . Therefore , there is a risk that that new influenza viruses could develop into a pandemic if the virus passes easily from human-to-human . Will it spread to the UK ? It is too early to say whether the cases reported so far will lead to a larger outbreak , the HPA said . No cases have been reported in the UK although experts are monitoring the situation closely . Anyone who has recently returned from affected countries should consult a doctor if they notice flu-like symptoms . What is being done in the UK to prevent the infection ? The HPA said it is working with the UK government to review the current incident and any threat it poses to UK public health . It advised people to follow general infection control practices and good hygiene to reduce transmission of all viruses . This includes covering their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing , disposing of dirty tissues promptly and carefully , washing hands frequently with soap and water and cleaning surfaces which are regularly touched .

The flu virus is notorious for its ability to mutate and evolve new features that allows it to escape the immune defense systems of its victims . The appearance of new flu strains is therefore a perennial problem for doctors and scientists . And experts warned last night that it may be too late to contain the new outbreak , given how widespread the known cases are . If the confirmed deaths are the first signs of a pandemic , then cases are probably incubating around the world by now , said Dr Michael Osterholm , a flu expert at the University of Minnesota . In New York City , health officials say about 75 students at a Queens high school have fallen ill with flu-like symptoms and testing is under way to rule out that is the same strain of swine flu found in Mexico . No vaccine specifically protects against swine flu and it is unclear how much protection current generic vaccines might offer . A version genetically matched to the new swine flu virus has been created by the US Centres for Disease Control , said Dr Richard Besser , the agency 's acting director . However , it could take months to create enough supplies for mass vaccination programs - if governments decide vaccine production is necessary . Two drugs , Tamiflu and Relenza , seem effective against the new strain . Roche , the maker of Tamiflu , said it was prepared to immediately deploy a stockpile of the drug if requested .

Health experts say it has the potential to become a global pandemic . The BA steward was undergoing tests in a London hospital for the swine flu virus after arriving on a flight from Mexico City . It is the first suspected case of the new flu strain to be reported in Europe , prompting fears it may have spread across the Atlantic from Mexico . The World Health Organisation says the swine flu strain - a unique mix of human , pig and bird viruses - constituted a public health emergency of international concern . Twenty people are known to have died in Mexico so far out of a total of 1,004 reported cases , and 48 more deaths are thought to be attributable to the outbreak . At least nine swine flu cases have been reported in California and Texas . The most recently reported California case , the seventh there , was a 35-year-old woman who was treated in hospital but recovered . The woman , whose illness began in early April , had no known contact with the other cases . At least two more cases have been confirmed in Kansas , bringing the US total to 11 . State health officials said yesterday they had confirmed swine flu in a married couple living in the central part of the state after the husband visited Mexico . They have not been hospitalised , and the state described their illnesses as mild . Dr Jason Eberhart-Phillips , Kansas 's state health officer , said : `` Fortunately , the man and woman understand the gravity of the situation and are very willing to isolate themselves . '' Additionally , at least eight students at a New York high school were last night also believed to have a form of human swine flu , but authorities are not yet certain if it is the same strain that has killed people in Mexico . The 38-year-old BA steward is being kept in Northwick Park hospital in north-west London , which has a specialist ward for patients with suspected tropical and infectious diseases , while doctors carry out swabs and blood tests . A Health Protection Agency spokeswoman said : `` We are aware of a patient admitted to a London hospital with reported travel history to Mexico . As a precautionary measure the patient is being tested for a range of respiratory and other illnesses ...

He had been suffering from high temperature , aches and dizziness the night before the return flight but was allowed through health controls at Mexico City airport to report for duty . He collapsed around two hours into the flight , and was isolated from the other passengers . None of the other crew members or passengers reported similar symptoms . A BA spokeswoman said : `` We can confirm one of our cabin crew felt unwell during the flight from Mexico and was taken to hospital on arrival at Heathrow .

The group , from New Zealand 's largest high school , returned to the northern city of Auckland yesterday on a flight from Los Angeles . Eight students at a school in the Queens area of New York are `` likely '' to have contracted the virus , according to the New York Times . In London , tests showed that a member of cabin crew on a British Airways flight from Mexico City did not have swine flu . The man , who has not been named , was taken to hospital yesterday with `` flu-like symptoms '' after landing at Heathrow . A hospital spokesman said : `` I can confirm he does not have swine flu . All the tests have come back negative . '' The UK Health Protection Agency said it was keeping a close eye on the situation involving human cases of swine influenza in case of any threat to people in this country . An HPA spokesman said : `` No cases of swine flu have been identified in the UK or anywhere in Europe . '' Mexican authorities ordered the closure of schools in the capital and the states of Mexico and San Luis Potosi until 6 May . Soldiers and health workers patrolled airports and bus stations , looking for people showing symptoms , which include a fever of more than 100 degrees and coughing . Twenty people are known to have died in Mexico so far out of a total of 1,324 reported cases , and 48 more deaths are thought to be attributable to the outbreak . At least nine swine flu cases have been reported in California and Texas . The most recently reported California case , the seventh there , was a 35-year-old woman who was treated in hospital but recovered . The woman , whose illness began in early April , had no known contact with the other cases . At least two more cases have been confirmed in Kansas . State health officials said yesterday they had confirmed swine flu in a married couple living in the central part of the state after the husband visited Mexico . They have not been hospitalised , and the state described their illnesses as mild . Dr Jason Eberhart-Phillips , Kansas 's state health officer , said : `` Fortunately , the man and woman understand the gravity of the situation and are very willing to isolate themselves . '' The Mexican government yesterday authorised President Felipe Calder n to invoke powers allowing the country 's health department to isolate patients and inspect homes , travellers and baggage . Mexico 's health secretary , Jos Angel C rdova , said : `` We are very , very concerned . '' Yesterday , people in Mexico City were being ordered not to kiss or shake hands . Football matches went ahead without spectators , theaters , shops and museums were closed , staff were inside locked schools scrubbing classrooms with disinfectant , and health workers patrolled buses , ordering sickly looking people home . Scientists have long feared that a new flu virus could launch a worldwide pandemic . Evolving when different flu viruses infect a pig , a person or a bird , mingling their genetic material , a hybrid could spread quickly because humans would have no natural defences . The director general of the WHO said : `` We are seeing a range of severity of the disease , from mild to severe , and of course death . The eight cases in the US have been mild in terms of severity and it is too premature to calculate the mortality rate of this disease . '' Any doubts over the extent of the emergency were dispelled last night by the sight of soldiers handing out blue surgical masks to pedestrians and motorists along Mexico City 's central boulevard , Paseo de la Reforma . With TV and radio calling on the population to seek medical advice for any flu-like symptoms , queues grew at clinics and hospitals across the city . Calder n said his government learned only on Thursday night what kind of virus Mexico was facing after tests by specialist laboratories in Canada confirmed the outbreak as a type - labeled A\\/H1N1 - not previously seen in pigs or humans . Few of the cases appear to have had any contact with live pigs . The WHO said the virus appeared to be able to spread from human to human and contained human virus , avian virus and pig viruses from North America , Europe and Asia . Given how quickly flu can spread , there might be cases incubating around the world already , said Dr Michael Osterholm at the University of Minnesota : `` Hundreds and thousands of travellers come in and out -LRB- of Mexico -RRB- every day . '' It was unclear how much protection current vaccines might offer . A `` seed stock '' genetically matched to the new virus has already been created by the US Centres for Disease Control . If the US government decides vaccine production is necessary , it would be used by manufacturers to get started . At Mexico City 's international airport , passengers were questioned to try to prevent anyone with flu symptoms from boarding aircraft and spreading the disease . The Foreign Office issued a warning to UK travellers about the outbreak , but stopped short of recommending people did not visit Mexico . US health officials took a similar line , urging visitors to wash their hands frequently .

The initial outbreaks across North America reveal an infection already traveling at higher velocity than did the last official pandemic strain , the 1968 Hong Kong flu . Stealing the limelight from our officially appointed assassin , H5N1 , this porcine virus is a threat of unknown magnitude . It seems less lethal than Sars in 2003 , but as an influenza it may be more durable than Sars . Given that domesticated seasonal type-A influenzas kill as many one million people a year , even a modest increment of virulence , especially if combined with high incidence , could produce carnage equivalent to a major war . Meanwhile , one of its first victims has been the consoling faith , long preached by the World Health Organisation , that pandemics can be contained by the rapid responses of medical bureaucracies , independent of the quality of local public health . Since the initial H5N1 deaths in Hong Kong in 1997 , the WHO , with the support of most national health services , has promoted a strategy focused on the identification and isolation of a pandemic strain within its local radius of outbreak , followed by a thorough dousing of the population with antivirals and -LRB- if available -RRB- vaccine . An army of sceptics has contested this viral counter-insurgency approach , pointing out that microbes can now fly around the world -LRB- quite literally in the case of avian flu -RRB- faster than WHO or local officials can react to the original outbreak . They also pointed to the primitive , often non-existent surveillance of the interface between human and animal diseases . But the mythology of bold , preemptive -LRB- and cheap -RRB- intervention against avian flu has been invaluable to the cause of rich countries , like the US and UK , who prefer to invest in their own biological Maginot lines rather than dramatically increasing aid to epidemic frontlines overseas , as well as to big pharma , which has battled developing-world demands for the generic , public manufacture of critical antivirals like Roche 's Tamiflu . The swine flu may prove that the WHO\\/Centres for Disease Control version of pandemic preparedness without massive new investment in surveillance , scientific and regulatory infrastructure , basic public health , and global access to lifeline drugs belongs to the same class of Ponzified risk management as Madoff securities . It is not so much that the pandemic warning system has failed as it simply does n't exist , even in North America and the EU . Perhaps it is not surprising that Mexico lacks both capacity and political will to monitor livestock diseases , but the situation is hardly better north of the border , where surveillance is a failed patchwork of state jurisdictions , and corporate livestock producers treat health regulations with the same contempt with which they deal with workers and animals . Similarly , a decade of urgent warnings by scientists has failed to ensure the transfer of sophisticated viral assay technology to the countries in the direct path of likely pandemics . Mexico has world-famous disease experts , but it had to send swabs to a Winnipeg lab in order to ID the strain 's genome . Almost a week was lost as a consequence . But no one was less alert than the disease controllers in Atlanta . According to the Washington Post , the CDC did not learn about the outbreak until six days after Mexico had begun to impose emergency measures . There should be no excuses . The paradox of this swine flu panic is that , while totally unexpected , it was accurately predicted . Six years ago , Science dedicated a major story to evidence that `` after years of stability , the North American swine flu virus has jumped onto an evolutionary fasttrack '' . Since its identification during the Great Depression , H1N1 swine flu had only drifted slightly from its original genome . Then in 1998 a highly pathogenic strain began to decimate sows on a farm in North Carolina and new , more virulent versions began to appear almost yearly , including a variant of H1N1 that contained the internal genes of H3N2 -LRB- the other type-A flu circulating among humans -RRB- . Researchers interviewed by Science worried that one of these hybrids might become a human flu -LRB- both the 1957 and 1968 pandemics are believed to have originated from the mixing of bird and human viruses inside pigs -RRB- , and urged the creation of an official surveillance system for swine flu : an admonition , of course , that went unheeded in a Washington prepared to throw away billions on bioterrorism fantasies . But what caused this acceleration of swine flu evolution ? Virologists have long believed that the intensive agricultural system of southern China is the principal engine of influenza mutation : both seasonal `` drift '' and episodic genomic `` shift '' . But the corporate industrialisation of livestock production has broken China 's natural monopoly on influenza evolution . Animal husbandry in recent decades has been transformed into something that more closely resembles the petrochemical industry than the happy family farm depicted in school readers . In 1965 , for instance , there were 53m US hogs on more than 1m farms ; today , 65m hogs are concentrated in 65,000 facilities . This has been a transition from old-fashioned pig pens to vast excremental hells , containing tens of thousands of animals with weakened immune systems suffocating in heat and manure while exchanging pathogens at blinding velocity with their fellow inmates . Last year a commission convened by the Pew Research Center issued a report on `` industrial farm animal production '' that underscored the acute danger that `` the continual cycling of viruses in large herds or flocks -LRB- will -RRB- increase opportunities for the generation of novel virus through mutation or recombinant events that could result in more efficient human to human transmission . '' The commission also warned that promiscuous antibiotic use in hog factories -LRB- cheaper than humane environments -RRB- was sponsoring the rise of resistant staph infections , while sewage spills were producing outbreaks of E coli and pfiesteria -LRB- the protozoan that has killed 1bn fish in Carolina estuaries and made ill dozens of fishermen -RRB- . Any amelioration of this new pathogen ecology would have to confront the monstrous power of livestock conglomerates such as Smithfield Farms -LRB- pork and beef -RRB- and Tyson -LRB- chickens -RRB- . The commission reported systemic obstruction of their investigation by corporations , including blatant threats to withhold funding from cooperative researchers . This is a highly globalised industry with global political clout . Just as Bangkok-based chicken giant Charoen Pokphand was able to suppress enquiries into its role in the spread of bird flu in southeast Asia , so it is likely that the forensic epidemiology of the swine flu outbreak will pound its head against the corporate stonewall of the pork industry . This is not to say that a smoking gun will never be found : there is already gossip in the Mexican press about an influenza epicentre around a huge Smithfield subsidiary in Veracruz state . But what matters more -LRB- especially given the continued threat of H5N1 -RRB- is the larger configuration : the WHO 's failed pandemic strategy , the further decline of world public health , the stranglehold of big pharma over lifeline medicines , and the planetary catastrophe of industrialised and ecologically unhinged livestock production .

Swine influenza is a highly contagious disease that causes respiratory illness in pigs . Most outbreaks happen on farms in late autumn and winter , when the virus kills around 1 % to 4 % of the animals it infects . The disease is caused by a type A influenza virus , and the new strain belongs to the most common subtype , known as H1N1 . Experts are particularly anxious about flu viruses that spread from pigs to humans , because the animals can harbor several flu viruses at once , which can swap genes around and become more virulent . Influenza viruses are made up of only eight genes . The new strain has six genes from a swine flu virus known to be circulating in North America , but this virus is itself a mixture of human , pig and avian flu viruses . The other two genes come from a swine virus found in European and Asian pigs . How do humans catch it ? Swine flu spreads to people in two ways . They contract the virus after being in contact with infected pigs or areas where the pigs have been , or they catch it from an infected person . The disease spreads in the same way as human flu , through coughs and sneezes , or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching the nose or mouth . The latest outbreak appears to have started in Mexico City . Swine flu viruses rarely infect humans , but there have been sporadic cases in the past . In most cases , the infection makes people unwell but is not life-threatening . In 1976 , a swine flu outbreak in New Jersey made more than 200 people seriously ill and killed one . The virus is thought to have circulated for a month before disappearing . In 1988 , a pregnant 32-year-old woman in Wisconsin died in hospital after becoming infected . Between 2005 and January 2009 , there were 12 human cases of swine flu in America , but none were fatal . The infection can not be spread by eating pork or pork products . The symptoms of swine flu are similar to normal flu , and include fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue . Some patients have also reported diarrhoea and vomiting . In very young children , the warning signs include fast or troubled breathing , a bluish skin tone , a failure to interact with others , and being highly irritable . As with seasonal flu , swine flu varies in severity , with the worst cases leading to fatal pneumonia and respiratory failure . The new strain seems to be more lethal to those in the 25 to 45 age range - an ominous sign , as this was a hallmark of the Spanish 1918 flu pandemic that killed tens of millions worldwide . Younger people were probably hit harder by the 1918 flu virus because their immune systems over-reacted . Why is it spreading so fast ? This is a key question the World Health Organisation needs to answer . So far , the virus is not well enough understood to know why it is so transmissible and virulent . Over the next few days , epidemiologists will use information from the outbreak to work out if a global pandemic is likely . Further tests are needed to confirm whether the fatalities in Mexico were caused by the same virus that is causing more mild illness in America and other countries . What steps are being taken to contain the outbreak ? Most experts think it is impossible to contain the virus now it has spread from Mexico to the US and New Zealand and probably other countries . In Mexico , officials have banned the traditional greetings of handshakes and kisses on the cheek , barred spectators from football matches , closed museums and advised churchgoers to stay at home in an attempt to halt the spread of the disease . Other countries have begun screening air travellers for the disease and have set up quarantines for people who might be infected . In Britain , health officials have stepped up surveillance for the infection . The chief medical officer , Liam Donaldson , issued an alert to hospitals outlining the symptoms to look for , and what tests should be done if doctors suspect they have an infected patient . If the virus arrives in Britain , doctors will use the government 's # 500m stockpile of tamiflu anti-viral drugs to treat patients and protect frontline hospital staff . Is there a vaccine for swine flu ? The seasonal flu jab given to the elderly over the winter months works well against human flu viruses , but swine flu is so different , the vaccine is unlikely to be effective . Any decision to produce fresh vaccine for the swine flu virus will be made by the World Health Organisation . Making enough for Britain alone could take four to six months , an expert at the Health Protection Agency said . South Park nails it .

But it does n't mean we are safe For the first time since 1976 , a strain of influenza virus - apparently related to the 1918-19 pandemic - has infected the public . More than 1,000 cases have been reported in Mexico , with over 80 deaths . And the disease has now spread to several areas within the United States and to New Zealand . The virus has been identified by the American Centres for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- as type H1N1 , containing a mixture of swine , avian and human genetic material . This outbreak of influenza is viewed with alarm by public health workers . First , because the earlier pandemic was so deadly ; second , because this is the first clear demonstration of human-to-human spread of the infection ; and third , because it apparently started its spread after the normal '' flu season '' in the northern hemisphere . However , the world may be much better prepared to cope with this outbreak than before . One reason is that an earlier swine flu outbreak in the US , in 1976 , found both the political and medical\\/public health worlds unprepared to cope with what appeared to be a serious threat of pandemic spread . Fortunately , the outbreak never came , but many of the lessons of that era were well learned - especially by the public health community . Thus , when avian flu seemed to threaten the world in recent years , both national public health bureaus around the world and the World Health Organisation organised themselves for action and began to stockpile anti-flu drugs and to ramp up the facilities for vaccine formation . These efforts have facilitated the early response measures for the current swine flu threat . Both the CDC and the WHO have mobilised to assist the Mexicans , and health offices across the world are becoming active . It is clear from the above that public health workers are better prepared to deal with this threat . Science is also better prepared than it was earlier - the genome of the virus was quickly analyzed and seed stocks for vaccine production isolated -LRB- although it will take many months to prepare enough doses to immunise large populations against the prevalent strain of virus -RRB- . Medicine is also better prepared , since it can distribute the already stockpiled antiviral drugs , and has far better treatments for the pneumonias and other secondary problems that threaten life . This is not to say that a pandemic , if it does indeed come , will not be serious . The illness of large numbers of people , even when the infection itself is not directly life-threatening , is often accompanied by severe social disruptions . Schools close , normal pursuits suffer , and emergency rooms and the entire healthcare system become seriously overloaded . History demonstrates that the greatest threat from even a mild disease that affects large numbers of individuals simultaneously may come from the accompanying social disruption and lack of nursing care available to the sick . Thus , while the professionals may be better prepared to deal with a threatened pandemic , it is not yet clear that the politicians around the world have learned the same lessons . Governments might have to nationalise their healthcare systems in order to cope , just as they have had to do recently with their financial systems - something that might be far more difficult in the US than in Britain and elsewhere . cents Dr Arthur Silverstein , a professional immunologist and professor emeritus at Johns Hopkins University medical school , is author of Pure Politics and Impure Science : The Swine Flu Affair Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Arthur Silverstein : Taking on the strain This article appeared on p28 of the Main section section of the Guardian on 00.01 BST on Monday 27 April 2009 .

Testing has shown that the human swine influenza H1N1 can be treated with the antivirals oseltamavir -LRB- Tamiflu -RRB- and zanamivir -LRB- Relenza -RRB- , according to the UK 's Health Protection Agency . The health secretary , Alan Johnson , said yesterday that Tamiflu had proved effective on patients in Mexico . Demand has historically been greatest for Tamiflu , which comes in tablet form , while Relenza must be inhaled . What do antiviral treatments do ? Drugs relieve some of the symptoms , reduce the potential for serious complications like pneumonia and cut the length of the illness by around a day . Crucially , they also reduce transmission of the virus from person to person . The government estimates that up to 750,000 people could die in the UK during a pandemic without antivirals . How much of these drugs do we have ? The NHS signed contracts earlier this year with pharmaceutical companies Roche , which makes Tamiflu , and GlaxoSmithKline , which makes Relenza , to double its store of antiviral drugs , bringing our total capacity to 33.5 million treatment courses . The government 's store would cover 50 % of the population everyone predicted to fall ill in the event of a pandemic . It says the UK is already widely recognized as one of the best prepared countries in the world . Previous flu pandemics have infected between 25 % and 35 % of the population . Scientists are working on developing a vaccine against the new strain . But reporters at a European commission briefing in Luxembourg were told that although the industry was working as fast as possible and new measures meant it could be on the market much quicker than a normal vaccine , the process could still take up to half a year .

Richard Phillips , the captain of the Maersk Alabama who was held hostage by Somali pirates , did n't realize he was being rescued by the US navy until he heard an American accent . `` I did n't know what happened , '' Phillips said in an interview with NBC 's Matt Lauer . `` I can tell you what I thought happened . But I did n't think it had anything to do with military I thought it was a disagreement . '' `` For me it felt like five minutes . It was probably seven , eight seconds . I have no idea . Time was fractured for me . So it felt very long for me . It probably indeed was n't , '' Phillips said . The captain also reiterated the pirates never gained control of the Maersk Alabama and praised his crew : `` There were acts of heroism on the part of the crew . They got one of the pirates into some darkened space , stabbed him in the hand and overpowered him . Chief mate Shane Murphy was integral to them never getting control of the ship . '' Phillips talked about the days he was stuck on on the lifeboat : `` It was very , very hot on that lifeboat . You are soaked in sweat . When the sun came up , I sort of dreaded the sun because of the heat , and it would be up then for the next 12 to 13 hours . I looked forward to the sun going down . I am from Vermont . I like the cold weather . '' After the rescue , Phillips said he still could n't comprehend what had transpired : `` I was in elation and I was in limbo , away from the lifeboat -LRB- and -RRB- coming up next to the navy ship with some military people in the boat . I was still trying to get over what happened . '' The captain commended the commandos who rescued him : `` These Seals and the navy did an impossible job . They 're unbelievable people . We really owe it to the military for what they do day in and day out that we never even hear about . '' Phillips 's revealing interview came as Richard E Hicks , chief cook of the Maersk Alabama , filed a lawsuit against the companies that own the ship and provide the crew . Hicks alleges the businesses ignored requests to improve safety measures for vessels sailing along the Somali coast . As members of the media argue over the effectiveness of Barack Obama 's first 100 days in office , there 's one issue they probably all agree on . The president is a terrible gift giver . During Gordon Brown 's visit to Washington , Obama presented the PM with a box set of 25 DVDs . Michelle Obama also committed a gaffe when she gave the Brown children , Fraser and John , two toy models of Marine One after Sarah Brown carefully picked out Top Shop dresses and books by British authors for the Obama daughters . When the president made a trip to the UK for the G20 summit , he gave the Queen an iPod . And now we learn the Obamas have resorted to giving magazines to the school his daughters are attending . MSNBC is reporting the only items the Obamas gave to Sidwell Friends school for a fundraiser are a signed copy of a Rolling Stone magazine featuring the president and the January edition of Vogue with the first lady 's signature . Members of the school are disappointed with the gift and recall Bill Clinton 's donation when daughter Chelsea attended : a round of golf with the then president that brought in nearly $ 100,000 . As the milestone of Barack Obama 's first 100 days approaches on Wednesday , we are asking readers to send a message to the president by uploading a photo to our Flickr group . Following Obama 's historic election , readers have sent over 1,000 images to the group with messages ranging from the humorous ...

Trouble began yesterday when a health minister in Israel raised an objection to '' swine flu '' on the grounds of Jewish and Muslim sensitivities over pork . Yakov Litzman , a member of an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community , came up with his own alternative : `` Mexican flu . '' That had the advantage of sparing Jews and Muslims discomfort . It had the disadvantage , however , of causing Mexicans even greater discomfort . Mexico 's ambassador to Israel , Frederico Salas , was duly dispatched to register an official complaint over the suggestion . The move prompted a hurried retraction from the Israeli government , which insisted it had no intention of changing the name . If the virus is not , after all , to mutate into `` Mexican flu '' , what then is it to be called ? Swine flu looks likely to hold for the time being , though as it changes and spreads its connection to pigs will become increasingly tenuous . The European commission is calling it the `` novel flu virus '' , which as a description is accurate but will also become redundant as time passes . Which leaves the medical nomenclature as the certain front-runner to become the household reference to the new virus . `` Influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- virus , human '' . The label may well catch on . It 's snappy , has a ring to it , and most importantly offends precisely no one . Governments debate ` swine flu ' versus ` Mexican flu ' This article was published on guardian .

The apparently new strain of the H1N1 flu , which seemingly originated in Mexico , has now been confirmed in seven countries , including the UK , New Zealand and Israel , with suspected outbreaks investigated in a number of others . It has shown an apparent ability to transfer from person to person , making its rapid global threat `` a very serious possibility '' , said the WHO 's deputy head , Keiji Fukuda . `` Countries should take the opportunity to prepare for a pandemic , '' Fukuda told reporters in Geneva , while stressing that a pandemic was not yet inevitable . Special efforts should be made towards less rich nations which `` really get hit disproportionately hard '' by pandemics , he said . Patrick Wintour on UK preparations for swine flu outbreak Link to this audio Fukuda confirmed the WHO was investigating whether human-to-human transmission had been identified in a group of New York City school students who are believed to have passed the virus among themselves after returning from a trip to Mexico . Such apparent cross-infection was the reason why the organization 's emergency committee last night raised its pandemic threat level to phase four out of a possible six , meaning a pandemic was possible , Fukuda said . `` We think that the virus showed the ability to transfer from person to person - this was an important step , '' Fukuda said . Any evidence of `` sustained human-to-human transmission in a number of different countries '' would see the alert raised to five , he said . The vast majority of about 2,000 cases have been identified in Mexico , with 51 in the US and 15 combined in the UK , Canada , New Zealand , Spain and Israel . Eight more countries , including France , Germany and Denmark and South Korea , are investigating possible outbreaks . A Scottish couple , who had been on honeymoon in Canc n , Mexico , remain in hospital but their condition is improving , the Scottish health secretary , Nicola Sturgeon , said . `` I am pleased to say they are continuing to improve . They 're doing well , '' she said . All the 150-plus deaths from the swine flu have been recorded in Mexico , with patients in other countries experiencing far less severe symptoms . Fukuda , however , cautioned against the idea that the outbreak could be a `` mild pandemic '' , noting that the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak which killed tens of millions of people worldwide came in a series of increasingly lethal waves . `` I think we have to be mindful and respectful of the fact that influenza moves in ways we can not predict , '' he said . Dr Alan McNally of Nottingham Trent University on the spread and science of swine flu Link to this audio In the UK , the Foreign Office advised against all but essential travel to Mexico as major tour operators including Thomas Cook and Airtours canceled flights to the country and sent out empty planes to repatriate holidaymakers . A spokesman for NHS Direct said the advice line had received almost 1,400 calls about suspected swine flu cases . In the past 24 hours , it has referred 238 callers who had traveled to infected areas and were showing potential symptoms of the virus to their GPs . The Wiltshire primary care trust said seven people from the county were being tested for suspected swine flu at a Health Protection Agency facility in Bristol , with results expected later today . Gordon Brown , who later today will join a meeting of the government 's Cobra emergency committee , chaired by the health secretary , Alan Johnson , called for concerted global action to combat the virus . `` Swine flu is an international problem now . It is across two continents , '' the prime minister said during a visit to Poland . The European commission is to hold a meeting with representatives from the pharmaceutical industry tomorrow to discuss how a vaccine might be produced , the EU health commissioner , Androulla Vasiliou , said in Brussels . It could take between four and six months to produce a vaccine , although anti-flu drugs already available appear to be at least partly effective in treating symptoms . The 11 cases in New Zealand , among students and teachers from a single school who reported fevers and other flu symptoms on return from a visit to Mexico , are the first in the Asia-Pacific region . South Korea is also investigating a probable case . Spain , meanwhile , confirmed a second case . Officials in China , where some cases of bird flu and another virulent respiratory infection , Sars , were initially covered up in recent years , say the country has not yet confirmed any cases but have promised full transparency . Two people were also confirmed as having contracted the virus in Israel , a 26-year-old who has recovered fully and a 47-year-old man who returned from Mexico two days ago . Health officials in Ireland said six people in the country were now being tested for possible exposure to the virus , which is a combination of pig , bird and human flu strains to which humans may have no natural immunity . Symptoms include a high fever and headache , coughing , joint ache and , in some cases , vomiting and diarrhoea . The deaths in Mexico have tended to be among people in their 30s or 40s rather than the very young or old , as is the case with usual flu strains . UK ministers say the country is well prepared for a possible pandemic , with Johnson telling MPs the country had a stock of 33m courses of anti-flu drugs . If the situation deteriorates , plans are in place for the government to warn the entire population to set up a support network of friends and relatives so they can be quickly quarantined at home if they are thought to have symptoms . The friends would collect medicine on their behalf . In Mexico , where officials in the capital , Mexico City , today ordered all restaurants to close , the country 's health secretary , Jos Angel C rdova , has said he expects more people to die . C rdova admitted that the health authorities lacked the staff to check on all suspected cases . Some foreign health officials fear such difficulties may be contributing to the disease 's spread . He stressed it was not confirmed the outbreak had begun in Mexico and indicated it could have first emerged in the US , where health officials believe the virus was spotted in late March . Peru and Guatemala reported the first suspected infections in other parts of Latin America , where health officials fear swine flu has already spread but has so far gone undetected .

Mike Davis , professor of history at the University of California , Irvine , and the author of The Monster at Our Door : The Global Threat of Avian Flu , questions WHO 's claims that it is well prepared for a pandemic . Writing on Comment is free , he says : The swine flu may prove that the WHO\\/Centres for Disease Control version of pandemic preparedness without massive new investment in surveillance , scientific and regulatory infrastructure , basic public health , and global access to lifeline drugs belongs to the same class of Ponzified risk management as Madoff securities . It is not so much that the pandemic warning system has failed as it simply does n't exist , even in North America and the EU . The US state department is to issue a warning about traveling to Mexico , according to BBC News . `` There will be a travel warning urging Americans to avoid all nonessential travel to Mexico because of the swine flu , '' said US official told Reuters . `` Front-page photographs of people in surgical masks , praying to the Virgin of Guadalupe for deliverance from a terrifying disease sweeping through their community , is the very last thing Mexican tourism needed , '' Joanna Moorhead reports on the impact swine flu on Mexico 's tourist industry . The World Health Organisation says the number of confirmed cases in the US has doubled to 40 , according to AP . Gregory Hartl , a spokesman for the WHO is giving a teleconference .

Alan Johnson , health secretary , has started his statement to the Commons . Three patients are in isolation wards in the UK after traveling to Mexico , he said . He said there had been 25 reports of suspected cases in the UK . It 's too early to say if there will be a pandemic , he said . It 's important to note that , apart from in Mexico , all people with symptoms have recovered , Johnson said . The UK has been preparing for a flu pandemic for five years , Johnson said . It has 33 million treatments of antivirals . Should the virus start spreading we will use antiviral stockpiles , the health secretary added . The scientific evidence does not suggest that wearing facemasks is necessary , but the government is looking into increasing supplies of masks , he said . A swine flu information line is being set up for the public . Johnson said we can all take precautions against flu , by covering the mouth when sneezing and coughing and washing hands , and staying away from work if you have flu-like symptoms . There is understandable concern across the world and the UK , Johnson said . He claimed that the UK and France are the best prepared countries in the world , for dealing with a possible pandemic .

Health officials in Guatemala and Peru are investigating possible cases of swine flu in recent travellers to Mexico . Peruvian Health Minister Oscar Ugarte told Peruvian radio an airline passenger arrived in Lima from Mexico with a high fever and other `` suspicious symptoms '' , Reuters reported . In Guatemala City , a hospital director told local radio that a 29-year old who had recently been to Mexico had symptoms similar to those reported in swine flu cases there . Authorities in both countries are checking airline passengers arriving from Mexico for swine flu symptoms . Elsewhere in central and South America , Colombia has reported a suspected case . Michael Tomasky blogs , via the Nation , that Republicans in the US congress stripped $ 900m in pandemic research funding from the fiscal stimulus package during debate in January and February . The US Centers for Disease Control offers some guidance on which flu drugs it deems most effective at this point . Good news : antiviral drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir seem to be working . On the benefits of the drugs , the agency says : Treatment : If you get sick , antiviral drugs can make your illness milder and make you feel better faster . They may also prevent serious influenza complications . For treatment , antiviral drugs work best if started as soon after getting sick as possible , and might not work if started more than 48 hours after illness starts . Prevention : Influenza antiviral drugs also can be used to prevent influenza when they are given to a person who is not ill , but who has been or may be near a person with swine influenza . When used to prevent the flu , antiviral drugs are about 70 % to 90 % effective . When used for prevention , the number of days that they should be used will vary depending on a person 's particular situation . US customs agents are now checking travelers arriving at airports , seaports and land border crossings for signs of illness , the Associated Press reports . The agents will refer travelers who say they are not feeling well CDC officials for further screening , US customs and border protection spokesman Lloyd Easterling tells AP . Mexican health and education officials just announced they are shutting all schools in the country until Wednesday May 6 . Officials said they are now investigating 149 possible deaths from the swine flu , and warned more cases are likely to surface . Mexican health secretary Jos ngel C rdova said at a news conference that 1,995 people have turned up at hospitals with suspected swine flu symptoms , with about 53 % of those , or 1,070 , discharged . `` This is the high point of this epidemic , and the number of cases will likely increase , '' C rdova said , according to a CNN translation . Mexican education minister Alonso Lujambio said the government is unhappy at having to close schools , `` but there 's nothing more important than Mexicans ' health . '' He said the time will give health officials room to investigate the outbreak and devise preventative measures . CDC acting director Richard Besser said the US has confirmed 40 total cases in five US states , but says the only change from yesterday is an additional 20 cases at a New York City private school . He said the additional cases represent increased testing , rather than the spread of the virus . In a press conference happening now in Washington , Besser said that of the 40 cases , only a single patient was hospitalised . Others who were infected and sickened have since recovered . He notes the US has n't seen the severity that Mexico has suffered . Besser said the US state department would issue a travel advisory `` out of an abundance of caution '' , warning against non-essential travel to Mexico . Besser said businesses , schools , parents and religious institutions should formulate plans in case a worker , student or parishioner takes ill . Noting the disparity between the severity of Mexico cases and those in the US , Besser said Americans should not think the country has for some reason been spared . `` I would n't rest on the fact that we have only seen cases in this country that are less severe , '' he said . He said many factors could explain the discrepancy , and said that as health officials monitoring the US discover more cases , the range of severity is likely to `` broaden '' . Besser said he does not recommend widespread use of the surgical masks that were ubiquitous during the SARS outbreak in China and are even now in Mexico City . `` The evidence of their value outside of healthcare settings ... is not very strong , '' he said . Besser said people should not kiss one another in greeting -LRB- though he did not specifically proscribe more romantic smooches -RRB- , and advised people to wash their hands frequently and cover their mouths and noses when they cough and sneeze . US secretary of state Hillary Clinton is urging `` caution '' to people planning to travel to Mexico , and pointed people to the US state department website . Heading into a meeting with Singaporean foreign minister George Yeo Yong Boon about two hours ago , she told reporters : We do believe that our efforts are developed and prepared to confront this wherever it might occur inside our own country , and enhanced cooperation across boundaries will be very important . And we obviously have offered help and assistance to the Government of Mexico to make sure that they have the resources and the technical expertise that they might need if they so request . Scottish health secretary Nicola Sturgeon said authorities have confirmed two cases of swine flu in Scotland , the first confirmed cases in Britain . At a press conference in Edinburgh , Sturgeon said the two patients at Monklands Hospital in Airdrie , Lanarkshire , are `` recovering well '' . New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg today said that health officials believe more than 100 people at the St Francis Preparatory School had been sickened , with 28 cases confirmed . At a city hall press conference , the mayor threw a positive spin on the news , noting that four or five days after the initial outbreak `` we are still dealing with a single cluster of swine flu cases '' . The New York Times ' City Room blog has a thorough write-up here . The Guardian 's Polly Curtis and Jessica Shepherd report that UK school officials are telling schools to re-familiarise themselves with flu pandemic guidelines , in preparation for the possible spread of the virus through the country . US homeland security secretary Janet Napolitano said travel warnings to Mexico will continue until the flu abates , and nixed talk of closing America 's southern border . `` People could be coming in now , under passive surveillance , who actually have the flu , '' she warned . The WHO just said it was raising its pandemic alert to phase four from three , which assistant director general Keiji Fukuda said is `` a significant step towards pandemic influenza , '' but that `` we are not there yet '' . The highest is phase six , indicating a severe global pandemic . Read the latest news piece from myself and Guardian journalists Chris McGreal here in Washington , Jo Tuckman in Mexico City and Rachel Williams in London here . Yes , the swine flu could mutate and become more dangerous . It could spread farther and further . What 's more worrisome is the corrosive and contagious quality of the fear , not the flu . And frankly the economic impact of this outbreak has the potential to be even more painful and long-lasting for all of us . Yet the panicky atmosphere in Mexico City is palpably toxic . So I 'm heading out of town for a few days - before they really do shut down the metro . School is canceled and most ` fun ' things are closed .

I am not belittling the plight of those who have the illness in Mexico and have seen relatives die . But we have to remember this is a very small number so far . The illness has spread to others in a less virulent form and there have been no deaths outside the country . There must be many more diseases in Mexico that claim more victims . For Brits to start talking about not traveling there or even suspending travel plans to the US is bonkers . The data shows that the risk of dying from swine flu is minuscule .

And yet as a society we are prepared to tolerate thousands of road deaths without making any fuss at all and even resisting the lowering of the speed limit or the introduction of speed cameras which reduce that risk .

The Guardian 's political editor , Patrick Wintour , explains how Britain is preparing for an outbreak of swine flu . `` Prepared for the Apocalypse '' , the Independent thunders this morning describing Mexico as a `` quasi-apocalyptic vision of anonymous faces shrouded in government-issued surgical masks '' . The Express offers a double page spread on `` Pandemic Pandemonium '' . `` It destroyed the Roman Empire , wiped out most of the New World and killed millions in Europe . How disease - not just Mexico 's swine fever - has shaped the planet .

The Telegraph reports , somewhat alarmingly , that online demand for Tamiflu is up 1000 % , with pharmacists warning that their stocks may not last . The Mail leads its story by saying that Britain can not hope to escape a `` global pandemic of swine flu '' , citing the UK 's chief medical officer saying cases here were inevitable . The Mirror , by comparison , places the ugliest picture of a pig it can find on its front page announcing `` SWINE FLU IS HERE '' focusing on the two cases of the disease confirmed in Scotland but again goes for the full throttle on its leader page : `` Sore throat at breakfast ... dead by teatime ... how the last flu pandemic killed 40 million . '' Back to the real world , and an important point noted in a few of the papers today : all those who have shown symptoms of swine flu outside Mexico so far have recovered . Things could change at any moment . But more worrisome is the corrosive and contagious quality of the fear , not the flu . And frankly the economic impact of this outbreak has the potential to be even more painful and long-lasting for all of us . Yet the panicky atmosphere in Mexico City is palpably toxic . So I 'm heading out of town for a few days -- before they really do shut down the metro . School is canceled and most ` fun ' things are closed . South Korea has announced its first probable case of swine flu . Final tests are still necessary to confirm whether a 51-year-old woman has contracted the disease , the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement , AP reported . The woman has remained quarantined since returning from a trip to Mexico on Sunday . MacDoctor is worried about the prospect of a pandemic as the southern hemisphere enters its flu season . We are about to go into our busiest time of year with health services normally being pushed to the max by respiratory illnesses . Add all the possible swine flu sufferers and you have a recipe for a completely overwhelmed health service . Add everyone with cold and flu symptoms -LRB- understandably -RRB- panicking and trying to access the heath system to find out whether they have the disease or not and we have all the makings of utter chaos . Why is swine flu causing death in Mexico but not elsewhere ? The Mexican paper La Jornada says the answer is simple : `` The inevitable contrast between the deaths in Mexico and the cases caused by the virus in the United States , which seem to be much more benign , has an equally inevitable explanation : poverty . '' My Spanish-speaking colleague , Robert White , says the paper castigates successive governments for pursuing neoliberal policies of `` trimming the state '' . La Jornada says this ensured that the long-awaited announcement of such a flu outbreak was always `` bound to be disastrous '' and fatal for many of those infected . At a press conference in Poland , Gordon Brown said he would be attending a meeting of the civil emergencies committee known as Cobra to discuss the swine flu crisis when he returned to London later this morning . Brown also said that one of the patients in a Scottish hospital with swine flu was expected to go home today . `` I understand the very real concern that people across Britain , across Europe and across the world have about this outbreak of swine flu disease , '' he said . British holiday tour companies Thomson and First Choice have suspended their operations to Mexico today . Gregory Hartl , a spokesman for the WHO , told a news conference in Geneva that the WHO emergency committee will not be meeting today . Yesterday the committee recommended raising the pandemic threat level . Hartl said the WHO does not recommend travel restrictions or border closures due to swine flu . A journalist complains that it has been impossible to reach WHO officials . Hartl admits that he has 2,800 unanswered calls . On reports of new suspected cases in China , Hartl said : `` We have rumors all the time . It 's important that we hear rumors , they may turn out to be unfounded . '' As Hartl spoke , Reuters reported confirmed cases in New Zealand and Israel . `` We do n't understand why the disease has been more severe in Mexico , '' Hartl said . `` Mexico has large supplies of Tamiflu . People at the beginning of an outbreak are always more vulnerable . '' A Health Protection Agency spokesman said the passenger who reported feeling unwell on a flight from Cancun which landed at Manchester airport had been sent home . Robert White has translated some more from Spanish-language media . Writing in the Mexican paper El Universal , Ricardo Rocha says swine flu is a `` fourth plague , after the financial , economic and social crises we are still suffering ... an epidemic with devastating effects - above all , for the poorest . The truth is , this country has been ill for a long time . '' Under the headline , Sick Mexico , he says poverty , structural weaknesses and bad government , are `` killing Mexicans in ever greater areas of the country , and there is no one who can stop it . '' NHS Direct are due to release details of yesterday 's call volume soon , my colleague James Strucke reports . NHS Direct said : `` We started receiving calls about swine flu at around 3.30 pm on Sunday . By 11.30 pm that night we had had 88 swine flu calls . In 15 cases there were symptoms of the flu and the details were passed on to our on-call out of hours staff . Clearly we are expecting number to have risen yesterday . '' `` The plane touched down and the captain made an announcement which at any other time would have been banal . ' Welcome to Mexico ' , '' writes the Guardian 's South America correspondent , Rory Carroll , after flying in last night . `` Mexico City 's airport is the busiest in Latin America but last night it was quiet , like the city outside . Muzzled taxi drivers whisked arrivals through gloomy , ghostly neighborhoods , '' he adds . EU health commissioner , Androulla Vassiliou , said there are reports of suspected cases in Denmark , Sweden , Greece , the Czech Republic , Germany , Italy and Ireland . Speaking at a press conference in Brussels , she said other cases , including one in Belgium , had been ruled out . She said she could not give the exact number of suspected cases . Vassiliou also requested a meeting with pharmaceutical companies on the development of a vaccine . An EU meeting will discuss possible travel restrictions on Thursday , she added . Ireland 's Department of Health will release swine flu test results later today on four Irish people who have returned from abroad . NHS Wiltshire has confirm that seven people are being tested for possible swine flu in the county , according to the INS news agency . A new Guardian video features fears from New York mayor , Michael Bloomberg , that 100 people may have contracted the virus in the city . Phil , a farmer and blogger from Utah , is taking no chances . He has put together a pandemic preparedness kit containing : 5 masks , 25 pairs of disposable vinyl gloves , alcohol-based hand sanitiser and alcohol-based wipes . `` My impression is that Mexicans in general - and chilangos -LRB- those from Mexico City -RRB- are no exception - are often apathetic with regard to matters of common interest . This -LRB- swine flu -RRB- touches on every sphere , from the frivolous use of cars , to the waste of water , to facilitating organised crime by buying illegal products , to throwing rubbish in the street ... etc. `` Now , faced with swine flu , we all have to rethink these sorts of attitudes . My opinion is that the government has played its part well ... now the ball is in the court of the public . '' New York Times : interactive map What 's in a name ? The term swine flu is misleading , the EU health commissioner Androulla Vassiliou and should be renamed `` novel flu '' to avoid damaging the pork industry . The respected ProMed-mail is going for the long-winded `` Influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- virus , human '' because it is not being spread by pigs . An Israeli minister suggested that swine flu is not kosher and is calling it Mexico flu , to the concern of officials in Mexico . Others suggest `` media flu '' would be a better term . NHS Direct has received more than 200 potential cases of swine flu in the past 24 hours , James Sturcke reports . He writes : `` The national health information and referral service released figures showing that it received 1,378 swine flu related calls yesterday . In 238 cases , the caller displayed symptoms of the disease and had recently traveled to an infected area , and was referred to a GP . '' On the A very public sociologist blog Phil BC offers scathing criticism of the media response to swine flu : Sensationalist reporting is likely to see tamiflu wiped off Britain 's shelves and encourage an influx of needlessly worried people into doctors ' surgeries - wasting time and resources already rationed thanks to the marketisation imposed on the NHS by the government . But whatever happens the media barons will wash their hands of the consequences . However , he does admit the situation is `` potentially serious '' in his polemic , which ends with a call for newspapers to be removed from private ownership . `` Most consumers think pandemic means something like the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1919 , which is said to have killed between 20 million to 100 million people . Something like that is unlikely to happen today , however . Nearly a century ago , the standards of living and medical care , for humans and animals , were vastly different . The country was recovering from World War I , with widespread poverty , hunger and unsanitary living conditions , coupled with no available antibiotics or flu medications or modern medical care . '' Szwarc also suggests the deaths in Mexico may not be attributable to it being afflicted by a more virulent strain , but rather extreme poverty . Providing fuel for the conspiracy theorists , the US independent investigative reporter , Wayne Madsen , suggests in this video that some scientists have said swine flu is `` not naturally occurring '' . `` There is always some flu around and flu is always killing some people . Even when a raw mutant flu manages to kill off more people than a shooting-war , flu has never ravaged whole cities as cholera or the Black Death can do . As awful pandemics go , flu is like the snotty-nosed little sister of awful pandemics . '' Time has examined the lessons to be learned from 1976 , when a nationwide vaccination program in the US , instigated after an outbreak of swine flu , was held responsible for a number of deaths : `` Vaccines carry risks of complications , leading to agonizing ethical dilemmas . In 1976 , Ford offered indemnity to the vaccine manufacturers . But according to reports , President George W. Bush decided in 2002 not to administer a nationwide smallpox vaccination program despite Vice President Dick Cheney 's belief that doing so was a prudent counterterrorism step because it could have resulted in dozens of deaths .

The New York Times doorstepped Esti Lamonaca , a New York teenager , who went to Mexico with friends for their spring break . They are now suspected of bringing swine flu to New York : '' ` No one can prove it , ' said Ms. Lamonaca , who came to the door of her family 's house in Forest Hills , Queens , on Monday , in a gray tank top , athletic shorts and a surgical mask . Her parents , she said , had ordered her not to take off the mask until her symptoms went away . They made a ` quarantine ' sign to hang on the doorknob of her bedroom , she added . '' The Scottish health secretary Nicola Sturgeon is speaking in Edinburgh . She says no decision has been taken on the discharge of the couple with swine flu and nine people in contact with them have `` mild symptoms '' . There are 14 more people in Scotland showing potential symptoms , although not confirmed as having swine flu . Those 14 people being investigated all have travel links to the US and\\/or Mexico , says Sturgeon . She adds it 's `` cause for encouragement '' that everyone outside Mexico who has contracted swine flu is suffering only `` mild symptoms '' . While many are blaming the media for creating fear , Deborah Hargreaves , the Guardian 's head of business writes : '' The public panic about swine flu is completely out of proportion to the threat involved . People do n't seem to understand the concept of risk any more - either that or we have become so risk-averse as a society that we are not prepared to stomach even the slightest threat to our health .

In a Twitter update today , Goldacre says he is `` genuinely fascinated by how many people are contacting me to say ` is swine flu just nonsense ? ' , media now utterly mistrusted on health . '' The WHO assistant director-general , Keiji Fukuda , says there have only been seven laboratory-confirmed deaths from swine flu in Mexico . There are 79 infections worldwide , he said . Fukuda said `` it was not inevitable '' that the outbreak would turn into a pandemic . Speaking at a teleconference , he added there are no plans to rename the virus . The total number of confirmed US swine flu cases has reached 64 , says the CDC . The latest cases are in states where the virus has previously been found , with New York confirming 17 additional cases . Daniel Nasaw in Washington , taking over . Thanks Matthew and Haroon .

The Los Angeles coronor is investigating two deaths that could have been caused by swine flu , the Los Angeles Times reported , and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency . If these are confirmed they would be the first deaths outside of Mexico . Coroner 's spokesman Craig Harvey said Bellflower Medical Center reported the death of a 33-year Long Beach resident Monday afternoon from symptoms resembling swine flu . `` It 's that diagnosis that needs to be confirmed , '' Harvey said . `` An autopsy will be performed to establish the cause of death . '' The man was taken to the hospital Saturday , complaining of shortness of breath and lymphoma . Doctors later diagnosed the patient with pneumonia , Harvey said . The second case involves a 45-year-old man from La Mirada , whose death was reported Monday to the coroner 's office . The man died April 22 at Coast Plaza Doctor 's Hospital in Norwalk . The Obama administration just trotted out three top officials to assure the world that US pork exports are safe to eat and to warn trading partners against banning the products . US Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack , who was joined by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and US Trade Representative Ron Kirk , said US authorities have seen no infections among US swine . In any case , he said , `` this is not a food-borne illness . You can not contract it from consuming pork . The importation of American pork and pork products is safe . '' Having established his particular area of concern , Vilsack adds `` It is not correct to call this swine flu '' . Kirk said he wanted to ensure US trading partners do not `` take advantage '' of the outbreak to enact trade barriers . Acting Centres for Disease Control Director Richard Besser said `` I fully expect we will see deaths from this infection . '' He said five people in the US have been hospitalised , up from one yesterday . That 's three in California and two in Texas . He said the incubation period of the disease seems to be two to seven days . Canadian health officials have confirmed 13 cases of swine flu in that country , with new cases turning up in Alberta , Ontario and British Columbia . The patients seem to be recovering , the Globe and Mail reported . Dr Keiji Fukuda of the World Health Organisation just told CNN that `` the situation is evolving quite rapidly '' but that the group does not deem the swine flu a pandemic . `` We are hoping to see that this will just slow down and disappear but it does n't show any signs of doing that so far , '' he said . `` I would say we are quite quite concerned about it . '' He reiterated that the WHO does not recommend travel restrictions or border closures . Guardian journalists Chris McGreal here in Washington and Rory Carroll in Mexico City have an updated news story on the global outbreak . The US Senate just confirmed Obama 's nomination of -LRB- now former -RRB- Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius as health and human services director . Washington has seen some mild handwriging in the past few days over the fact that the government agency charged with responding to the swine flu crisis lacked a chief . But in Washington , it is often the top layers of career officials , rather than the political appointees , who do most of the heavy day-to-day work , and I have had no sense that the US was worse off . The senate confirmed Sebelius 65-31 , over Republican objections about her record supporting abortion rights .

The World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- is now calling the virus , which has infected an estimated 1,000 people and killed around 150 in Mexico , an `` international public health emergency '' that could reach global pandemic levels . But as Dr Michael Greger , director of Public Health and Animal Agriculture at the Humane Society of the United States , has pointed out , this is not the first time a triple hybrid human\\/bird\\/pig flu virus has been uncovered . The first was found in a North Carolina industrial pig farm in 1998 , and within a year it had spread across the United States . Dr Greger has highlighted how some experts blamed the emergence of the original 1998 virus on intensive farming practices in the US , where pigs and poultry are raised in extremely cramped conditions , in adjacent sheds and tended to by the same staff . North Carolina has the densest pig population in North America , with around twice as many swine mega-factories as any other state . In 1998 , North Carolina 's pig population had hit ten million , up from two million just six years before . Yet the number of hog farms was decreasing , with more and more animals being crammed into fewer and fewer farms . Since the primary route of swine flu transmission is thought to be the same as human flu , the increased potential for the spread of disease in such conditions is clear . More research is urgently needed to explore the potential link between industrialised animal farming , and the spread of disease . Some elements of the Mexican media are already pointing to the potential role of intensive pig farming in Mexico , which has grown substantially in recent years , with some giant operations raising tens of thousands of pigs at a time . Since news of the epidemic broke , reports in Mexico City daily La Jornada and Veracruz-based paper La Marcha have detailed how a number of community residents in the affected areas have expressed concerns over the operations of Smithfield Foods , the world 's largest pork packer and hog producer . According to these reports , in Veracruz where the outbreak originated , a Smithfield subsidiary called Granjas Carrol raises 950,000 hogs per year in intensive conditions . Smithfield has released a statement denying any link between the outbreak and Granjas Carrol 's operations in Mexico . It said the company routinely administers influenza virus vaccinations to its herds and conducts monthly tests for the presence of swine influenza . It said it had found no clinical signs or symptoms of swine influenza on its farms . This is not the first time intensive , industrialised agriculture has been accused of spreading disease . Recent avian flu outbreaks , for example , have shown the extent to which the export-oriented corporate model of poultry production may have spread strains such as H5N1 . In my report Avian flu : time to shut the intensive poultry flu factories ? of 2006 , I outlined how bird flu has been endemic in wild birds in much of the world without leaping the species barrier and causing people any harm . But in damp and cramped conditions , a series of mutations can occur resulting in a highly pathogenic form . Within crowded chicken factory farms , the mild virus can evolve rapidly towards more dangerous and highly transmissible forms , capable of jumping species and spreading back into wild birds , which are defenceless against the new strain . Experts are increasingly warning that the practices of intensive farming must be reviewed and regulated . While it will be difficult to reach any firm conclusions about this current outbreak of swine flu until more details emerge , it is crucial that the authorities undertake an urgent inquiry , in order to better understand the development and spread of animal-based epidemics which can be lethal to humans . cents Caroline Lucas is Green party MEP for the south-east of England Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : This article was published on guardian .

The Guardian columnist Simon Jenkins complained today of `` demented '' coverage of the swine flu outbreak and the need to put this in perspective . Many of those commenting on this blog yesterday felt that minute-by-minute treatment of the outbreak was an example of yet more media hysteria . We 've been trying to avoid panicky reporting - please keep letting us know when you think we are getting too excited . What we are trying to do here is stick to the important developments in what is a fast-moving story , and also report on how the outbreak is being covered and talked about . The head of the US Centres for Disease Control , Richard Besser , said the virus is almost certain to claim lives in America . `` I fully expect we will see deaths from this infection , '' he said . Germany 's national disease control center says it has confirmed three swine flu cases , making it the third country in Europe where the disease has surfaced . Several colleagues say they saw people wearing masks in London today . Twitter users have also spotted masks in the capital . `` First sighting of a commuter wearing a face mask on the Northern Line . Looks very out of place , '' tweets Gary Gale . It has n't been easy to find those who know people who have died from the new strain of flu or who have relatives suffering from them , which is n't helped by the fact the the Mexican authorities are refusing to publish a list of the dead . I did find people affected by the illness of course -LRB- hey - come on - I 'm a snoop -RRB- but , well , given that the swine flu has been labeled a pandemic , there 's no panic in the streets , no riots in the hospitals , and no over-supply of sufferers of their families to speak to . Another Mexico-based blogger , Burro Hall , has some wry words on the subject of panic . We heartily endorse panic - not because we think there 's more to fear than fear itself , but because panic , particularly on the part of the state 's public officials , tends to get results . It added that new tests on samples from the area are expected by the end of the week . Facebook has been tracking the rise of swine flu discussions on wall posts . It has also recorded the percentage of Facebook users discussing swine flu by US state . Facebook : The percentage of Facebook users in each US state discussing swine flu on wall posts . A new Guardian video shows how swine flu fears have spread across the world . Richard Besser , acting director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention , has confirmed that 23-month-old child has died of swine flu in Texas . Gordon Brown has confirmed that the government has ordered several million facemasks for NHS staff . Speaking at prime minister 's questions , he added that Tamiflu would only be given out when symptoms are discovered . For more follow Andrew Sparrow 's live coverage of PMQs . `` Mexico City is a ghost town , it 's weird '' , Rory Carroll reports from the Mexican capital . Three more cases of swine flu have been confirmed in the UK , Gordon Brown said today , bringing the total number to five . The prime minister told the Commons that a 12-year-old girl from Torbay was among the victims , and her school , Paignton Community College , had been temporally closed and all other pupils offered anti-viral medicines . Brown said the other two new cases were adults , one from Birmingham and one from London . All three had recently traveled to Mexico and had shown mild symptoms and were responding well to treatment . Egypt is considering a cull of pigs as `` precautionary measure '' , according to Reuters . The agency suggests that the move is motivated more by desire to quell panic rather than a serious attempt to stop the spread of the disease - which is not spread by pigs . Ben Goldacre , GP and author of the Guardian 's Bad Science column , is looking for examples of swine flu scaremongering and misrepresentation -LRB- do n't all send him this blog -RRB- . Health secretary Alan Johnson said the infected pupil in Torbay has been in close contact with 50 fellow pupils . They and 150 others have been given antiviral drugs . Facemasks ca n't stop the disease spreading , Johnson said , but it can be a help for NHS staff he says . He also sets out steps that people can take to stop the spread of the disease . `` Catch it , bin it , kill it '' is the theme . There will also be TV and newspaper adverts , Johnson said at a Department of Health press conference . Chief medical officer Liam Donaldson pointed out that all those affected had traveled to Mexico . The 12-year-old girl in Torbay was on the same flight from Mexico as the newlywed couple from Scotland who have also tested positive for the virus , Johnson said . Antivirals can help prevent people catching the virus , Donaldson said . But he said it was not sensible to issue everyone with antivirals . Ed Balls , the children 's secretary , said that the school in Devon Paignton Community and Sports College , will be closed for seven days . Airlines will be asked to keep the records of passenger on flights from affected areas , Johnson said . Facemasks are of very little value and give a false sense of security , Donaldson said . Keeping you hands clean is more important , he said . We have 33 million dose of antiviral treatment , Johnson said . Front line NHS workers will get priority . The government aims to get 50 million doses , he said . Donaldson said that a vaccine will be developed when a `` proper profile '' of the virus has been established . We are now up to 25 suspected cases in the UK , Johnson said . But he added this is a `` fast-moving situation '' . An official then tells him that it is up to 78 cases now . The BBC is reporting that seven of the nine people who were in contact with Iain and Dawn Askham , the newly weds who were the first Britons known to contract the virus , have tested negative for swine flu .

Wendy Orent , author of Plague : The Mysterious Past and Terrifying Future of the World 's Most Dangerous Disease , has written an article for the LA Times in which she says categorically we are not facing a pandemic : `` Only packed conditions allowing deathly sick hosts to pass disease repeatedly to the well can produce highly virulent strains of flu -- for animals or for people . The usual sort of human crowding will not do it . Even massive , densely populated Mexico City , with more than 20 million inhabitants , wo n't produce the kind of lethal strains that the Western Front did in World War I. People died in Mexico because they were close to the epicenter of the disease , to the probable emergence of lethal strains from crowded pig breeding . But natural selection 's corrective action is swift and predictable : The strains spreading across the world are milder . '' The child died on Monday night , according to AP . Mexico City 's mayor Marcelo Ebrard says the swine flu outbreak seems to be stabilising . He said there was one more death to report . Ebrard said if the death toll keeps tapering off , he says he will consider easing the restrictions on public gatherings in the city . Scottish health secretary Nicolas Sturgeon has given the Scottish parliament an update on the health of Iain and Dawn Askham . A second couple who became ill after returning from a Mexico honeymoon remained in quarantine in their home , according to PA. . Pete and Jenny Marshall said they had been told to stay in their house in Edinburgh , along with friend Gemma O'Brien , as they wait to find out if they have contracted the virus . The WHO is also holding a news conference on the outbreak . Sebelius said antivirals are effective against the virus . `` We expect to see more cases and unfortunately more deaths , '' she said . Richard Besser , the acting director of the US CDC , said the situation is uncertain and changing quickly . We know from seasonal flu that 36,000 people die each year from flu . He said there are now 91 confirmed cases of swine flu in 10 US states . Five of these cases have resulted in people going to hospital . But he warned that the information is probably already out of date because the situation is changing so fast . `` We call this a pre-pandemic situation , '' Besser said . `` Unfortunately we will see more deaths . '' The WHO said it is moving closer to increasing its pandemic alert level . An official from the US Food and Drug Administration -LRB- whose name I did n't catch on the teleconference -RRB- said vaccine trials could start within two months . He explained why the disease is a concern : `` We have not seen this virus before . There is no background immunity in the population and spreading from human to human . '' Spain has detected its first case of swine flu in a person who has not recently visited Mexico , health minister Trinidad Jimenez said , Reuters reports . The CDC has confirmed the locations of the 91 US cases . The sun never sets on the Guardian 's swine flu coverage . Daniel Nasaw here , from the Washington bureau . Thanks Matthew and Haroon .

So why all the frenzy ? A spokeswoman for BA says : We 're keeping the situation under review . We revised our booking policy -LRB- allowing people to reroute or defer travel -RRB- when the FCO changed its advisory on Monday , and we would review our policy again following any EC directives . But people still want to fly to Mexico . There were several dozen people on our flight out there this morning . There are people who want to fly out to help their families in Mexico and people who want to come home from Mexico . And the WHO said that there was no point in stopping travel . Our staff are briefed to help people with their questions . We have n't had time to consider France 's request to suspend flights , but we are still operating 12 flights a week to Mexico City and people are still flying . A high school in San Jose , California , is closed today until May 6 after a student tested positive for swine flu . The Santa Clara County , California health department sent parents a note that opens : `` Dear Parents : On April 23 , 2009 your child may have been exposed to swine flu '' . The note says officials closed the school on the advice of the Centres for Disease Control . Dr Keiji Fukuda of the WHO just told reporters the swine flu virus is clearly spreading and that officials have seen no evidence its spread is slowing . Fukuda said the organization is moving closer to declaring phase 5 on its pandemic alert . He said there is clear evidence now of human-to-human transmission . We 're currently at phase 4 out of 6 , with 6 indicating a pandemic . Phase 5 is characterized by human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region . While most countries will not be affected at this stage , the declaration of Phase 5 is a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent and that the time to finalize the organization , communication , and implementation of the planned mitigation measures is short . The Guardian 's Chris McGreal describes a father 's terrifying ordeal . A California man says his 16-year old son narrowly escaped death from the swine flu : I could n't even touch my son he was so hot . I could n't pick him up . His muscles were seizing up on him . He could n't move . He had a fever of 102 . He was throwing up , and diarrhoea . He screamed out when I touched him . My wife was freaking out . I thought I was going to lose my son . It 's the hardest thing in the world . The Guardian 's Scotland correspondent Severin Carrell reports some good news : 13 suspected cases there tested negative for swine flu . He writes that Scottish health secretary Nicola Sturgeon said tests on eight of the nine people who had been in contact with the first Britons to catch swine flu had shown they were not suffering from swine flu . Five others were also negative . Potential Swine Flu , huh ? Best stay at home , batten down the hatches and play some computer games ! What should we play first !? Resi Evil 5 !? Severin Carrell reports that the three British swine flu victims were all aboard a Thomson Airways First Choice flight from Canc n to Birmingham on April 21 . That was number TOM 578 . The airline said it would send a special flight for British holidaymakers who want to leave tomorrow morning , flying to Manchester and London Gatwick . The American Libertarian Party advises Obama to close the US border with Mexico , despite a WHO determination that the move would do little to stem the spread of the virus that has now spread to more than 30 countries . Communications director Donny Ferguson said in a statement : The proper response is simple . The government should use its rightful authority over the border to control entry into our country of foreign nationals who pose a threat to our health by spreading the virus into areas where it does not exist . America 's doctors , hospitals and health care professionals the best in the world should then take the lead on eradicating the virus where it already exists . Ferguson notes the only US death from swine flu was a Mexican toddler who traveled to Houston on holiday with his family . The Obama administration has ruled out the move . On Comment is free , Ben Goldacre defends the coverage : `` For so many people , their very first assumption on the story is that the media are lying '' . In La Glorida , Mexico , The Guardian 's Jo Tuckman writes about the search for swine flu ground zero . Meanwhile , in Paignton , Devon , The Guardian 's Steven Morris says parents at a school shuttered by authorities are concerned and angry after learning a 12-year old tested positive for swine flu . In Mexico City , The Guardian 's Latin America correspondent Rory Carroll writes that the city 's denizens are furious at an edict shutting its 30,000 restaurants . Not even after the 1985 earthquake was it like this , '' said Juan Perez , 44 , scrubbing the front of Julia 's , a shuttered taco joint on Avenida Cuauhtemoc . `` This is a disaster . '' On the other hand , he notes : Crime rates have fallen , air quality has greatly improved and birds are audible on what once were thronged thouroughfares . Reuters just reported that the WHO is likely to increase the flu alert phase to 5 because `` things are moving fast '' . The report quotes `` one well-informed source '' . The United States Marine Corps has confirmed a marine at a base in Twentynine Palms , California tested positive for swine flu . He and his roommate are being kept in isolation . The stricken marine showed up at an on-base medical clinic over the weekend complaining of flu-like symptoms , and has since largely recovered , the Marine Corps said . The Guardian 's Chris McGreal says South African health officials are investigating the first suspected cases of swine flu in Africa . South Africa 's National Institute for Communicable Diseases is testing a woman from the Western Cape who returned from Mexico on April 24 , and a woman from Gauteng who also recently returned from Mexico . Both are not seriously ill . The Southern hemisphere is just entering the annual flu season . US Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano reiterates the Obama administration has no plans to close the border with Mexico . Also , she said border agents have stopped 49 people showing suspected signs of swine flu . All but eight were subsquently cleared , and those were still under observation , she said . WHO Director General Dr Margaret Chan just announced the organization is raising its flu pandemic alert level to phase 5 out of 6 . `` All countries should immediately now activate their pandemic preparedness plans , '' she said . Phase 5 indicates `` pandemic is imminent '' , according to the WHO . WHO 's Chan was asked about countries ' freedom to break Roche 's patent on Tamiflu , an antiviral drug that has proven effective in treating the H1N1 swine flu , in order to manufacture it locally and , presumably , more cheaply . Chan left the door open : `` When and what the country is going to decide , it is their decision .

Two Britons are or were -LRB- not very -RRB- ill from flu . `` This could really explode , '' intones a reporter for BBC News . `` London warned : it 's here , '' cries the Evening Standard . Fear is said to be spreading `` like a Mexican wave '' . It `` could affect '' three-quarters of a million Britons . It `` could cost '' three trillion dollars . The `` danger '' , according to the radio , is that workers who are not ill will be `` worried '' -LRB- perhaps by the reporter -RRB- and fail to turn up at power stations and hospitals . Appropriately panicked , on Monday ministers plunged into their Cobra bunker beneath Whitehall to prepare for the worst . Had Tony Blair been about they would have worn germ warfare suits . British government is barking mad . What is swine flu ? It is flu , a mutation of the H1N1 virus of the sort that often occurs . It is not a pandemic , despite the media prefix , not yet . The BBC calls it a `` potentially terrible virus '' , but any viral infection is potentially terrible . Flu makes you feel ill . You should take medicine and rest . You will then get well again , unless you are very unlucky or have some complicating condition . It is best to avoid close contact with other people , as applies to a common cold . In Mexico , 2,000 people have been diagnosed as suffering swine flu . Some 150 of them have died , though there is said to be no pathological indication of all these deaths being linked to the new flu strain . People die all the time after catching flu , especially if not medicated . Nobody anywhere else in the world has died from this infection and only a handful have the new strain confirmed , most in America and almost all after returning from Mexico . A couple from Airdrie who caught the flu on holiday in Cancun are getting better . That tends to happen to people who get flu , however much it may disappoint editors . We appear to have lost all ability to judge risk . The cause may lie in the national curriculum , the decline of `` news '' or the rise of blogs and concomitant , unmediated hysteria , but people seem helpless in navigating the gulf that separates public information from their daily round . They can not set a statistic in context . They can not relate bad news from Mexico to the risk that inevitably surrounds their lives . The risk of catching swine flu must be millions to one . Health scares are like terrorist ones . Someone somewhere has an interest in it . We depend on others with specialist knowledge to advise and warn us and assume they offer advice on a dispassionate basis , using their expertise to assess danger and communicating it in measured English . Words such as possibly , potentially , could or might should be avoided . They are unspecific qualifiers and open to exaggeration . The World Health Organisation , always eager to push itself into the spotlight , loves to talk of the world being `` ready '' for a flu pandemic , apparently on the grounds that none has occurred for some time . There is no obvious justification for this scaremongering . I suppose the world is `` ready '' for another atomic explosion or another 9\\/11 . Professional expertise is now overwhelmed by professional log-rolling . Risk aversion has trounced risk judgment . An obligation on public officials not to scare people or lead them to needless expense is overridden by the yearning for a higher budget or more profit . Health scares enable media-hungry doctors , public health officials and drugs companies to benefit by manipulating fright . On Monday the EU health commissioner , Androulla Vassiliou , advised travellers not to go to north or central America `` unless it 's very urgent '' . The British Foreign Office warned against `` all but essential '' travel to Mexico because of the danger of catching flu . It would make more sense to proffer such a warning against the American crime rate . Yet such health-and-safety hysteria wiped millions from travel company shares . During the BSE scare of 1995-7 , grown men with medical degrees predicted doom , terrifying ministers into mad politician disease . The scientists ' hysteria , that BSE `` has the potential to infect up to 10 million Britons '' , led to tens of thousands of cattle being fed into power stations and # 5bn spent on farmers ' compensation . A year later , the scientists tried to maintain that BSE `` might '' spread to sheep because , according to one government scientist , `` the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence '' . The meat industry was wrecked and an absurd ongoing cost was imposed on stock farmers with the closure and concentration of abattoirs . This science-based insanity was repeated during the Sars outbreak of 2003 , asserted by Dr Patrick Dixon , formerly of the London Business School , to have `` a 25 % chance of killing tens of millions '' . The press duly headlined a plague `` worse than Aids '' . Not one Briton died . The same lunacy occurred in 2006 with avian flu , erupting after a scientist named John Oxford declared that `` it will be the first pandemic of the 21st century '' . The WHO issued a statement that `` one in four Britons could die '' . Epidemiologists love the word `` could '' because it can always assure them of a headline . During the avian flu mania , Canada geese were treated like Goering 's bombers . RSPB workers were issued with protective headgear . The media went berserk , with interviewers asking why the government did not close all schools `` to prevent up to 50,000 deaths '' . The Today program 's John Humphrys became frantic when a dead goose flopped down on an isolated Scottish beach and a hapless local official refused to confirm the BBC 's hysteria . The bird might pose no threat to Scotland , but how dare he deny London journalists a good panic ? Meanwhile a real pestilence , MRSA and C difficile , was taking hold in hospitals . It was suppressed by the medical profession because it appeared that they themselves might be to blame . These diseases have played a role in thousands of deaths in British hospitals - the former a reported 1,652 and the latter 8,324 in 2007 alone . Like deaths from alcoholism , we have come to regard hospital-induced infection as an accident of life , a hazard to which we have subconsciously adjusted . MRSA and C difficile are not like swine flu , an opportunity for public figures to scare and posture and spend money . They are diseases for which the government is to blame . They claim no headlines and no Cobra priority . Their sufferers must crawl away and die in silence .

All three new British victims are said to have mild symptoms and to be responding to treatment at home . The Health Protection Agency said 230 possible other cases were under investigation in the UK . In Scotland , the health secretary , Nicola Sturgeon , said it was `` probable '' that one of the people in contact with honeymooners Iain and Dawn Askham had contracted the disease . If so , he would be the first person to be diagnosed who had not traveled to Mexico recently . Sturgeon said : `` If this case was confirmed it would be the first case in Scotland of onward transmission , but I stress it 's not confirmed at this stage . '' She said the person , a male , had tested positive for type A flu and was having further tests to determine whether it was H1N1 . The new victim from the north-east , who had recently returned from Mexico , shares a house with two Newcastle University students living off-campus , the university said today . It said it had spoken to the Health Protection Agency and had decided not to shut down . In a statement , the university said : `` Neither of the students concerned has so far displayed any flu-like symptoms . Both students have received the anti-viral Tamiflu , and they and the university have been advised by the Health Protection Agency that there is no need for the students to isolate themselves from the community unless they show symptoms . '' Ireland also reported its first probable case of swine flu this afternoon , a man who has recently returned from Mexico . The chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said tests had shown the man had Influenza A , and he was now being tested for H1N1 . Pat Wall , professor of public health at University College Dublin , said the case was `` likely to be positive '' . The latest cases came as the UK 's chief medical officer , Sir Liam Donaldson , said today he was `` concerned but not alarmed '' after the World Health Organisation raised its swine flu global epidemic threat level to phase five , the second highest . He said the UK would see `` many more cases '' of swine flu but most people would make a good recovery . From next Tuesday , all UK households will receive an information leaflet on swine flu outlining the Department of Health 's to encourage people to use tissues when they sneeze . The first Britons confirmed with swine flu have left hospital and are `` very well '' , Scotland 's first minister , Alex Salmond , said today . The Askhams had been treated in an isolation ward after falling ill after their honeymoon in Mexico . A second newlywed couple who feared they had contracted swine flu in Mexico were among those given the all-clear . Pete and Jenny Marshall had been on honeymoon in Canc n , the same resort as the Askhams , and reported flu-like symptoms and other illnesses . After the three British cases of swine flu confirmed yesterday the Department of Health stepped up its emergency response with plans to purchase additional stocks of antiviral drugs and face masks . Those three Britons a 12-year-old girl from Paignton , Devon ; a 41-year-old woman from Redditch , Worcestershire ; and a 22-year-old man from north-west London had recently returned from Mexico . The child was on the same flight into Birmingham as the Askhams . Her school , Paignton community college , has been closed for a week . All 267 pupils in her school year and all teachers who might have come into contact with her have been given the antiviral drug Tamiflu , the college principal , Jane English , told a press conference today . English said the girl attended school on Wednesday to Friday last week after returning from holiday but had not been in since . Dr Sarah Harrison , a public health consultant for Torbay Care trust , said of the afflicted pupil : `` She is suffering from flu , so she 's not feeling very well , but she 's improving . '' She said 340 courses of Tamiflu had been given out in Devon and dozens of people were being monitored for the virus in the area . Chemists in Torbay were selling out of face masks , nasal sprays and hand washes today . A spokesman for Crossways pharmacy , also in Paignton , said : `` Our customers are very keen to take precautionary measures against swine flu . So far we have sold out of medicated hand gels and completely sold out of face masks . We sold out within hours of the first case in Torbay being announced .

Four years ago , Sir Liam Donaldson predicted that a new pandemic was `` inevitable '' . `` It 's happened before , in 1918 , 1958 and 1969 , '' the chief medical officer informed Andrew Marr on the BBC 's Sunday AM program . `` These things come in natural cycles , once every 10 to 40 years . '' It will be little comfort to Donaldson that he is on the brink of being proven right and right on cue . The Mexican strain of swine flu now sweeping the world is a pandemic in all but name we are only awaiting the formal declaration from the WHO . As someone who has spent the last five years studying mutating strains of influenza first in the field as a correspondent for the Observer and the Guardian , latterly as a historian based at the Wellcome Trust , I take no pleasure in being proven similarly prescient . If history teaches us anything it is that the past is not necessarily a guide to the future . But based on the events of the last few days , the parallels with 1918 the last great pandemic may be unavoidable . Mexican swine flu is a H1N1 hybrid consisting of pig , human and avian genes . The 1918 pandemic virus was also a H1N1 hybrid containing a mix of avian and non-avian genes . It now appears that an unusual cluster of influenza-like illnesses which have been the index cases of Mexican swine flu erupted in La Gloria in Veracruz in early April , a highly unusual time of year for an outbreak of influenza in the northern hemisphere . In 1918 , the earliest reports of what would prove to be the pandemic strain also came from the Americas , from Haskell County , Kansas , where doughboys at a US army base were being fattened on chickens and pork grown on local farms before crossing the Atlantic to reinforce the allied lines . And in 1918 as now there were also reports of young adults , men and women in their early 20s and 30s , falling prey to unusual pneumonias . So what should we make of the reports of the growing morbidity and morality from Mexico , and should we be worried ? In recent days , I have found myself being asked this continually in interviews with CNN , the BBC and Sky . I do not have a good answer yet . Three thousand children die of malaria every day in Africa , I want to say . But that 's no good because malaria is hardly a disease that is likely to bite you in Britain . But once again HIV , rightly or wrongly , is only perceived as a threat to `` high risk '' groups . The point is that influenza is an aerosol infection , as ubiquitous as air and as hard to avoid as breathing itself . But we need to and must keep things in perspective . Some 10,000 people die of influenza every year in Britain during the normal winter flu season . So far the Mexican flu has killed a grand total of just 160 people worldwide . Even if Mexican swine flu does prove to be a so-called Armageddon strain and , as I write , that is still a very big if there is every reason to believe we will cope , as long as we learn from and can avoid the mistakes of 1918 . In 1918 , Britain did not have a national health service , nor was there a ministry of health to coordinate the national response to the Spanish influenza so-called because Spain , not being party to the war , saw no need to censor news of the spreading depredation -LRB- by contrast , British newspapers , perhaps for the sake of national morale , treated the `` Spanish Lady '' as something of a joke -RRB- . Nor in 1918 did we possess antiviral drugs , antibiotics or a vaccine hardly surprising given that in 1918 the scientific consensus was that influenza was caused by a bacteria , not a virus . We did , however , possess a highly militarised economy , one that , should the authorities have so desired , could have been drilled to take the threat more seriously . But there was a war to win and the government did not wish to panic the populace . Instead , Britain 's then chief medical officer , Sir Arthur Newsholme , decreed that national circumstances dictated that Britons should `` carry on '' a message that the Times and other establishment organs were happy to iterate . Today , of course , we live in a very different world . Thanks to the internet and 24\\/7 rolling news channels , information about epidemic diseases travels far faster than a virus can ever hope to , and competition between papers means that hysterical , unscientific claims are ubiquitous . The result is a sort of media-induced collective dread a sickness of the soul far in excess of the actual threat to our bodies . So , to the return to the question that Simon Mayo posed to me on Radio 5 Live on Tuesday : what should we do ? Well , for starters , we could do worse than to follow Newsholme 's advice in 1918 to stay calm and to `` carry on '' . Secondly , for all our sophisticated drugs and medical technology , we may find that some of the most effective measures are the simplest . In 1918 , when the LGB was finally girded into action late on in the pandemic , Newsholme advised people to avoid sneezing and coughing in public , and to keep plenty of fresh handkerchiefs on hand -LRB- the handkerchief to be `` boiled , or burned if of paper '' -RRB- . Other simple hygiene measures included washing one 's hands and gargling with a disinfectant mouthwash . I have yet to see Donaldson or Alan Johnson issue the last item of advice , but in every other respect they have repeated Newsholme 's formulations to the letter . Now , the Department of Health is also taking a leaf from the book of an even more heroic 1918 figure . In June of that awful year , while the majority of his countrymen were doing their best to ignore the threat from Spain , James Niven , the medical officer of health for Manchester , had 35,000 handbills printed and distributed throughout the city spelling out in clear and easy-to-understand English the dangers of influenza and giving strict instructions for the isolation of the sick . In November , when the second deadly wave of the pandemic swept through Britain , he went a stage further , printing more handbills and posting warnings throughout the city urging people to avoid trams and unventilated assembly halls . Niven 's proactive measures delayed the onset of influenza in Manchester , buying the city valuable time . The result was that when the virus returned as Niven knew it would just 1,700 Mancunians lost their lives . By contrast , in London , where some boroughs closed their schools and others prevaricated , some 10,000 people died . There is no reason , as yet , to believe that we are on the brink of a similar disaster . Having said that if the Department of Health 's `` Catch it , bin it , kill it '' campaign launched today can prevent even one unnecessary death , then the further ratcheting up of public anxieties will surely be a price worth paying . Time for a ban .

Not only have the public lost all faith in the media ; not only do so many people assume , now , that they are being misled ; but more than that , the media themselves have lost all confidence in their own ability to give us the facts . Goldacre also discusses the media 's coverage of swine flu on the Guardian Daily podcast . The government has set up a swine flu information line . You can call it on 08001513513 or listen here . It says : `` Because it -LRB- swine flu -RRB- is a new virus no one will have immunity to it and everyone could be at risk of catching it . This includes healthy adults . '' If swine flu spreads , you need to keep informed so that you know what else you can do to protect yourself and your family . As the situation changes , you should keep up to date by watching TV , listening to the radio , checking the internet and looking out for announcements in the press . The Department of Health TV advert has also been released . features a man sneezing in a lift . Cobra , the government 's emergency committee , is to meet at 11am today to discuss swine flu . EU health ministers will also hold emergency talks today in Luxembourg to coordinate national efforts in preventing the spread of the virus . Dr Sarah Harrison , consultant in public health for Torbay Care Trust , has provided an update on the health of the 12-year-old girl who contracted the virus on a trip to Mexico . `` She is suffering from flu , so she 's not feeling very well , but she is recovering . '' The mayor of Torbay , Nick Bye , said the resort is still open for business . `` I do n't want to be the mayor in Jaws , '' he said after discussing the attractions of `` the bay '' . Harrison said she could not say how many people were being tested in Devon - it is more like a dozen than hundreds , she said . She revealed that 340 courses of the antiviral Tamiflu had been given out . Jane English , principal of Paignton College which the affected girl attends , said she had not been given the drug because she was not deemed to be at risk . She said she was `` confident '' that all the people the pupil had been in contact with have been traced .

Iain and Dawn Askham , the first Britons confirmed with swine flu have been released from hospital . They doing `` very well '' , Scotland First Minister Alex Salmond said . Biden 's spokeswoman , Elizabeth Alexander , later tried to play down the comments : The advice he is giving family members is the same advice the administration is giving to all Americans : that they should avoid unnecessary air travel to and from Mexico . If they are sick , they should avoid airplanes and other confined public spaces , such as subways . This is the advice the vice president has given family members who are traveling by commercial airline this week . The only disease that needs stamping out is mad journalism . At a time like this the media should shut up , report facts and tell people what they can do , not create statistically inflated hypotheticals and fantastical scenarios . Conspiracy theories about swine flu are spreading faster than the virus . `` It 's bioterrorism attack '' according to a posting on Prison Planet , home of shock-jock and conspiracy theory magnet Alex Jones . Wizbang Blue rounds up some of the other theories including the Mexican drug cartel angle and the al-Qaida connection . A diplomatic row is brewing between Germany and Spain after the German health minister , Ulla Schmidt , suggested that people should not go to the Spanish Grand Prix . Daniel Nasaw here in Washington , taking over . Thanks again Matthew and Haroon . Three more people in the UK have been diagnosed with swine flu , the Department of Health has announced . A total of eight people in Britain have now been confirmed with the disease . A departmental spokesman said : `` There have been three more confirmed cases of swine flu in the UK - two in London and one in the North East . `` There are now eight confirmed cases in the UK - six in England , and two in Scotland . `` The preparations we have in place and are continuing to make will help to ensure we respond well in the event of a pandemic . '' The Guardian 's Simon Tisdall writes that the media 's fixation on the swine flu has detracted from attention to the widespread misery and violence in other parts of the world : The sudden surge in first world swine fever has also overshadowed the plight of millions in the Horn of Africa , principally in Somalia where a reconfigured government is struggling to survive . Random violence , suicide attacks , kidnapping and armed robbery are daily problems facing the 3 million people currently dependent on food aid . Over 1 million Somalis are displaced , many living in insanitary tent cities . For them , flu is not a big issue . Egyptian health ministers said today that the cull of 250,000 pigs was not in fact an anti-flu measure , but a more general santitation effort . An Egyptian health ministry official tells AFP : The authorities took advantage of the situation to resolve the question of disorderly pig rearing in Egypt . Mexican President Felipe Calderon effectively shut down the country 's economy today , asking that only essential businesses like supermarkets , pharmacies , and gas stations remain open until Tuesday . Only critical government functions like police and the army will remain on the job . `` Stay in your house with your family , '' Calderon said in a televised address . `` There is no safer place to avoid contact with the influenza virus than your own home . '' The World Health Organisation says it has confirmed 236 cases , up from 148 yesterday . Dr Keiji Fukuda said the organization has begun distributing stocks of anti-flu drugs to vulnerable countries , but he did not specify which . Fukuda said the group is particularly concerned about southern hemisphere nations . The seasonal influenza virus is just beginning to kick in , and the swine flu could dangerously aggravate that disease . Acting CDC Director Richard Besser said the agency has confirmed 109 cases in the US , up from 91 yesterday . Besser said the cases are now in 11 states , up from 10 yesterday . He said the most recent onset of the virus in the confirmed cases was Sunday April 26 . That was just as the world was becoming aware of the disease 's spread . `` There are many more states that have suspect cases , '' he said . `` I do expect that there will be more deaths . '' The Guardian 's breaking swine flu news team reports that two students at Newcastle University have been exposed to the virus . The students live with confirmed patient who had just visited Mexico . Newcastle University fine arts student , Claire Coldwell , 21 , said she was more worried about exams than swine flu : `` This is the place where you can most easily pick up any sort of virus . '' Some updates from our hard working global newsgathering and comment team : Former middle east editor Brian Whitaker , now an editor on Comment is free , says the pig cull ordered by the Egyptian government `` is likely to be interpreted by Christians as yet another assault on their community '' . The World Bank says a Washington-based employee has been `` preliminarily diagnosed '' with the swine flu -LRB- or the H1N1 flu , as politically correct types are saying here -RRB- . The infection is believed to have resulted from exposure while on business travel in Mexico between April 14-18 , before Mexican health authorities and the WHO recognized and announced the epidemic . The final diagnosis has to be confirmed by a second test performed by the Center for Disease Control , a process which is underway . Health officials in the state of Delware have confirmed four cases of swine flu there , Reuters is reporting . Also , EU health ministers have ruled out a Mexico travel ban proposed by France . Public Health Minister Dawn Primarolo backed the vast majority in warning it was too late to try to isolate the virus following the World Health Organisation 's decision to raise its status to that of an imminent pandemic . Instead the ministers today concentrated their efforts on agreeing -LRB- on -RRB- the closest possible cross-border co-operation to keep track of the spread of emerging cases of what the European Commission was calling the `` novel '' flu virus . Reuters reports that EU health ministers agreed that individual member states should decide on travel restrictions aimed at stemming the virus . The WHO and the US have several times ruled out travel bans or restrictions , saying they would do little to slow the spread of the virus . The British government next week will post an information leaflet to all households offering advice on how to stay clear of the swine flu . AP is reporting that US public health officials are intercepting migrant seasonal workers entering the country from Mexico and handing them information on swine-flu symptoms and prevention tips . Health officials worry the migrant workers , who provide essential labor for industries like seafood and meat packing , construction and landscaping , may bring the swine flu virus into the states with them and spread it . The WHO is now referring to the bug as influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- , not swine flu , probably out of deference to the global pork industry and to avoid giving the impression that the disease can be caught from pigs . President Barack Obama last night used that term . The White House has just announced that a member of the group that traveled with President Obama to Mexico April 16 and 17 came down with flu-like symptoms . Members of his family have since tested `` probable '' for the swine flu . The individual was part of Energy Secretary Steven Chu 's advance security detail , and never got within six feet of the president , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters . Mexican health secretary Jos ngel C rdova says the number of new swine flu cases in the country is stabilising . He says Mexico has 260 confirmed swine flu cases , including 12 deaths . But he says he 'll stop updating his count of suspected cases and deaths , which had stood at about 2,500 and 168 . `` Swine flu '' or `` H1N1 '' ? As we 've reported , the US government and the WHO have dropped the former name , out of deference to the pigs -LRB- and their breeders and sellers -RRB- .

Eight days ago , Graeme Pacitti and friends from his amateur football team gathered to welcome the newly married man back from his honeymoon in Mexico . As Pacitti and the others sat around Iain Askham , they noticed he seemed tired . That was put down to jetlag but 48 hours later , Askham and his wife , Dawn , were swept into an isolation ward at Monklands hospital , 20 miles away in Airdrie , the first two British cases of swine flu . Today , Pacitti , the goalkeeper for their six-a-side team FC Mallard and a clerical worker at Falkirk Royal Infirmary , was confirmed as the first person to catch swine flu within the UK . The result left him feeling `` really disappointed '' , he said . `` Today I started to feel better than I have done all week . I 'm quite gutted . '' Confined at home with his mother Lesley , her boyfriend , and his younger brother Alan , he has been taking the anti-viral drug Tamiflu and nursing an aching head and throat . `` It started last Saturday when I started to feel like I had an upset stomach . From then my throat began to get sore , '' he said . `` The worst was when I started to get headaches and feel quite feverish . '' Yet earlier this week , Pacitti assumed he had avoided catching the virus . He had initially been cleared after he and two other members of that group out drinking with Askham and his best man , Neil Gardner , 26 , developed mild cold-like symptoms . But earlier this week , after Pacitti started to feel unwell , further tests confirmed he was carrying the influenza A-type virus the group which includes swine flu , known to the experts at H1N1 . But that kind of flu virus is rare in late spring . That immediately made it likely that Pacitti was the first case of onward transmission in Britain . It has already happened in the US , Canada , Spain and Germany .

Farmers in Egypt clashed yesterday with officials who had come to destroy their pigs . They blocked the roads and some hurled stones at trucks and bulldozers sent by the health ministry . The trouble broke out after the government ordered the slaughter of all pigs in Egypt amid a wave of hysteria about `` swine '' flu . The Mubarak regime 's record in matters of public health and safety is a dismal one : more than 1,000 dead in a ferry disaster , more than 370 dead in a train fire , 50 dead in a theater fire , plus treacherous roads , and buildings that fall down regularly on top of their occupants . Egypt also continues to have cases of bird flu 26 people have died there since 2006 , making it the worst-affected country outside Asia , where the disease originated . This time , though , the regime has acted with uncharacteristic haste even before there is a single suspected case of the H1N1 virus in the country , either among humans or even pigs . But its decision to kill 300,000-400 ,000 pigs is not just costly . It is also pointless . As the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation 's chief veterinary officer put it yesterday , the cull is `` a real mistake '' . `` There is no reason to do that . It 's not a swine influenza , it 's a human influenza , '' he said . Time magazine has more , explaining why we should n't blame pigs . Not wishing to let science stand in the way of a rousing speech , members of the Egyptian parliament -LRB- whose upper house was carelessly wrecked by fire not so long ago -RRB- have been railing against the enemy within , and calling for pigs to be exterminated or removed from centres of population . IslamOnline , the Egyptian-based website supervised for doctrinal correctness by Yusuf al-Qaradawi , also joined in . According to an article in its health and science section , `` Egypt has pig breeding farms located in heavily populated areas inside the capital Cairo . This means that in case of a swine flu epidemic , the flu will be rapidly transmitted to people living near the pig farms , then to others . '' The website also has a discussion forum where readers air their prejudices against pigs . There may or may not be an unspoken sub-text to all this but , as everyone in Egypt knows , pig-keeping is associated with the Christian minority who probably account for about 10 % of the country 's population -LRB- the actual figure is a state secret -RRB- . For that reason , the response to swine flu ought to have been handled with care and sensitivity . Even if it was not intentional , the over-dramatic and obviously ill-planning decision to cull all pigs is likely to be interpreted by Christians as yet another assault on their community . It is not even clear if pig-keepers are to be properly compensated . Some have reportedly been paid $ 180 per pig after complaining . If repeated across the country , that would cost the government tens of millions of dollars which could be far better spent on other things . There are also hints , though , that the government may try to wriggle out of paying compensation on the grounds that the dead pigs can be sold for human consumption . If that turns out to be the official line it could seriously damage community relations . Many of Egypt 's pigs are kept in shacks in cities , in close proximity with humans -LRB- see picture here -RRB- . Moving them away from centres of population may be a sensible public health policy regardless of the current flu outbreak but that will also destroy the livelihoods of many urban poor who survive by collecting waste to feed the pigs . If it is to be done , though , it will need care and planning to find alternative sources of income for those affected . Otherwise , as so often in Egypt , it is likely to make matters worse rather than better .

The authorities have ordered a five-day shutdown to halt further spread of the H1N1 flu virus . Photograph : Joe Raedle\\/Getty Images It was the silence more than anything . No rumble of traffic . No voices in the street . Nothing to betray the existence of 20m people . The cacophony of noise and life that breaks with the dawn missed its cue in Mexico Citytoday . The sun rose higher but it made no difference . The avenues stayed empty . It was a day of firsts : the first of May . The first of a five day nationwide shutdown . The first time an epidemic had stilled one of the world 's great cities . A first time to do lots of things : sit in the middle of Paseo de la Reforma and not get run over ; stroll through the woods of Bosque de Chapultepec and not see another soul ; have the No 18 bus there was the occasional bus all to yourself . For Adriana Mendez , 25 , a tamale seller on Bajio street , it was the first time she was so bereft of customers that she curled up and slept at her stall in the middle of the day . `` God , it 's quiet , '' she said , waking up and rubbing her eyes . Further up the street there was another glimpse of life : three policeman at a junction waiting for traffic to direct . `` I 'm supposed to be training these two cadets but how can I do that if there are no cars ? '' said Reyes Alguilar , 62 , a veteran of the force . He was cleaning his own car with a red cloth . `` Might as well do something useful , right ? '' Smog had cleared , revealing an azure sky , but the city felt heavy , expectant . The authorities said the H1N1 flu epidemic seemed to be easing and that the five-day lockdown would help snuff out the threat . But what if it did n't ? What if restaurants , offices , factories , schools , museums would have to remain shut ? What if economic pain turned to agony ? An opinion poll said that 90 % of Mexicans believe the federal government has responded well or very well to the epidemic but that could swiftly change if the crisis continues . Even before the epidemic Mexico had been hit by plunging exports and oil revenues , shrinking the economy by 7 % in the first quarter . Tourism , on which many jobs depend , has disappeared . `` Its logical that it would be that way and there is not much we can do about it at the moment , '' said the tourism minister , Rodolfo Elisondo . It may not help much that there is a t-shirt for sale which bears the image of a pig and the slogan : `` I went to Mexico City and all I got was swine flu . '' For the few out on the streets , there was an immediate question : what if the person approaching me is infected ? In a pew at the cathedral one worshipper looked in horror at the runny nose of the man beside him and fled . Billboard advertising offered mocking reminders of normality . The action film Wolverine was supposed to open last week but the premiere was canceled . All the cinemas are shut . Mexico City resembled a film set for an apocalyptic tale . I Am Legend , perhaps , or 28 Days Later , but there were no zombies , just ordinary people making the best of a grim situation . On Thursday , as lockdown approached , the only queues were outside DVD shops . The most popular rentals were cartoons , said a Blockbuster employee . Today was supposed to be workers ' day . Normally tens of thousands of flag-wavers would congregate in the Zocalo , a magnifient plaza . Fabiano Lopez , a 73-year-old Marxist in a yellow shirt , stood in the empty square holding a red flag . It was the only one . Capitalism had orchestrated the epidemic , he said . `` I 'm not worried . My comrades will come later . You 'll see .

Photograph : AP A Scottish hospital worker has been confirmed as the first person to catch swine flu from within the UK , after contracting it in a pub from newlyweds who had traveled to Mexico , according to health officials . Graeme Pacitti , a clerical worker at the Falkirk Royal hospital , is thought to have caught the virus during a night out with Iain Askham , who contracted it on his honeymoon in Mexico . Tonight the Department of Health announced that there were two new cases in the south west and south east . The case in the south west is thought to have been a human-to-human transfer within the UK . Sir Liam Donaldson , chief medical advisor , said : `` The first non-imported cases of swine flu have been confirmed in England and Scotland . The infection appears to have been acquired by person to person spread within the United Kingdom . Until now cases were confined to people who had themselves recently come back from Mexico . The person in the south west is being treated with Tamiflu . '' Tonight 's announcement brought the total number of confirmed cases in the UK to 13 . Earlier today , a year seven pupil in Gloucestershire , and a woman from Merseyside were also confirmed as suffering from the virus . Pacitti , 24 , has been confined to his home in Falkirk under voluntarily quarantine with his mother , Lesley , her partner and his younger brother , Alan , 18 , and has been taking the antiviral drug Tamiflu since becoming ill earlier this week . He was given the results from the Health Protection Agency by telephone this afternoon . Minutes after getting the results , Pacitti said he was really disappointed . `` I 'm gutted really . I just found out , '' he said . `` I saw Iain last Thursday , he was n't showing any symptoms then . My friends thought he looked a bit tired but we thought it was just jetlag . `` I 've been feeling a lot better today than I have all week . I 've still got an upset stomach and a sore throat . Earlier in the week I was having headaches and feeling feverish . '' The Scottish health secretary , Nicola Sturgeon , said that authorities believed the virus was still being contained . She said : `` This is of course significant because it represents the first case in the UK of person-to-person transmission of this virus . The person we 're confirming as positive today had n't been in Mexico or any other affected area . He had been in contact with someone who had . `` I want to stress , however , that it does n't mean that there is more reason to worry . We 're working hard to try to disrupt this infection and stop it spreading . '' Sturgeon said that Pacitti 's condition was not causing any medical concern . `` I 'm told that his symptoms , as with the other cases , in the context of flu are mild symptoms . He is not unwell in a way which would cause clinical concern , as was the case with the other two cases . '' This confirmation came as Iain and Dawn Askham , from the small town of Polmont , outside Falkirk , said they believed they caught the virus on the flight home from Mexico from five other men who were clearly ill . The five men , who sat in the neighbouring rows of seats to the couple , were coughing and feverish throughout the nine-hour flight from the Mexican resort of Cancun . `` I actually said to Dawn : ' I think we 're going to be getting off this plane with the plague ' , '' Askham told the Daily Record , adding the couple were now `` 99 % sure '' they contracted the virus on the flight . One other passenger on the flight , a 12-year-old girl from Torbay , in Devon , has since been diagnosed with swine flu . Askham said at one point on the flight , two other passengers sitting near the five British Asian men moved seats because of the disturbance from their coughing . `` We were on the flight back for nine hours and it would have been impossible not to have breathed in their germs , which will have been getting circulated around the plane , '' he said . `` They were really ill , especially the guy sat directly behind us . He had a really bad fever . We did n't ask to get moved because we 'd have felt a bit rude asking for an upgrade even if it was our honeymoon . '' The HPA tried to dampen fears that these five men were at large in the community with swine flu . A spokeswoman told the Guardian today that nearly all the passengers within 1 metre of the couple particularly sitting in seats immediately behind and in front of the Askhams had been identified . Most had responded to phone calls and emails , and been ruled out as swine flu carriers . Some , however , had not yet replied . `` Contact tracing has already been done , '' an HPA spokeswoman said . `` I ca n't tell you about individual cases because of patient confidentiality . `` What I can tell you is that everybody who was in close contact , the 1-metre area for more than an hour obviously anyone near them on a long-haul flight either has been or is being traced . That has been going on since the cases were identified as a positive . '' Meanwhile , the German health ministry confirmed a nurse as the country 's first case of human-to-human swine flu transmission . The World Health Organisation has increased its tally of confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus around the world from 257 to 331 .

This is the point at which the virus could , theoretically , start to spread exponentially through the population . But it has been taken into account already by officials ; because the new H1N1 virus has already jumped the species barrier into humans , scientists knew the bug would become transmissible between humans at some stage . Dr Mark Fielder , a medical microbiologist at Kingston University , says it should not be a major cause for concern . `` It 's a fairly mild disease really . Its ability to spread between people , while there , is not enormous . '' He adds that maintaining good standards of hygiene and following the Health Protection Agency 's advice about regular handwashing and sneezing into tissues would halt the ability of the virus to spread quickly . `` The one thing to recognize is that we have n't had that many deaths yet . We 've had far more deaths from other diseases going on in the world than we have had from this form of influenza . I really do n't see it becoming a major mortality event . I see a number of people getting ill , but I 'll hazard it will be no greater than normal seasonal flu . '' Have the deaths in Mexico been hyped ? Robert Booy , head of clinical research at the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance based at the University of Sydney , believes there is a simple explanation for the concentration of more than 100 deaths in Mexico . `` It 's likely that this outbreak has been running for not one month or even six weeks , but more than eight weeks -LRB- in Mexico -RRB- . Influenza tends to , on average , infect two people for every one case . The doubling then occurs every three days , which is the serial interval . This means that from day one to day 30 you go to about 1,000 cases , but in the next month , you go to a million . '' This means that , if there have been hundreds of thousands of cases already in Mexico , then about 100 deaths gives a mortality rate of 0.1 % . `` So the disease may not be nearly as severe as people thought , '' says Booy . `` If the disease has been around for two months and infected so many people , many of them must be mildly infected and we have n't heard about them . '' Again , this shows that H1N1 is , at the moment , not as lethal as most people might think . What are scientists doing now ? Samples of the H1N1 virus arrived at the National Institute for Medical Research in north London this week and scientists there will now grow the virus structure and see how it might evolve . Working with the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta , Georgia , the research will help develop a vaccine for the virus in the coming months .

Photograph : PA Two Britons have now contracted swine flu within the UK , it was confirmed yesterday , as the total number of cases rose to 13 . Graeme Pacitti , a clerical worker at Falkirk Royal Infirmary , became the first person confirmed with the disease who had not visited Mexico . He is thought to have become infected after a night out with Iain Askham , a football team-mate who contracted the virus on his honeymoon in Canc n , Mexico . Late last night the Health Protection Agency confirmed that a 42-year-old from south Gloucestershire who had not visited Mexico had become infected in England . Sir Liam Donaldson , the government 's chief medical adviser , said : `` The first non-imported cases of swine flu have been confirmed in England and Scotland . The infection appears to have been acquired by person-to-person spread within the United Kingdom . `` Until now cases were confined to people who had recently come back from Mexico . The person in the south-west is being treated with Tamiflu . '' A 12-year-old girl was also among five new cases , prompting the immediate closure of her school in south Gloucestershire . The girl , a pupil at Downend School , was on the same flight as Askham and his wife , Dawn . Government scientists who are studying the virus said early analysis showed it was likely to cause only a mild epidemic , probably no worse than anything seen in a normal flu season . Biologists at the National Institute for Medical Research in London said that antiviral medicines such as Tamiflu would probably control the spread of the disease . Pacitti , 24 , was the 10th confirmed case of swine flu in the UK , while earlier yesterday a Merseyside woman who had recently returned from Mexico was confirmed as the ninth . Referring to Pacitti , the Scottish health secretary , Nicola Sturgeon , said : `` This is significant as it represents the first case in the UK of person-to - person transmission of this virus . The person had n't been in Mexico or any other affected area . He had been in contact with someone who had . `` I want to stress , however , that it does n't mean that there is more reason to worry . We 're working hard to try to disrupt this infection and stop it spreading . '' The Health Protection Agency said : `` We are working to ensure that any close contacts of patients who test positive for swine influenza are offered antivirals as a precautionary measure . At this stage close contacts who should be offered antivirals -LRB- are those -RRB- who have been exposed to a probable or confirmed case within the previous seven days for longer than one hour and within a distance of one metre . '' The agency advised people returning from affected areas in Mexico who become unwell within seven days of their return to stay at home and contact their GP by phone or ring NHS Direct . The agency said it was aware of head teachers and governors considering temporary closure of schools as a precaution when suspected cases of infection were still under investigation but had yet to be confirmed . But it advised these measures only when a case is strongly suspected or confirmed within a school . Earlier yesterday Gordon Brown offered reassurance that Britain was well-placed to deal with the outbreak . On a visit to an NHS Direct call center in Beckenham , south-east London , he said the advice line was coping well with demand . The government was increasing the number of face masks available to the NHS and looking at different vaccines , while stressing that the Tamiflu antiviral drug would deal with the disease . Brown added : `` This is happening in every country of the world , but we are better prepared . If people have the symptoms they should ask for advice as quickly as possible . `` We are finding with NHS Direct that they can both reassure people and give people advice about where to go . This is a system that 's working , it 's calm , it 's ordered , it 's giving people the right information . '' Brown said all the cases in the UK were mild . The Netherlands , France and Switzerland confirmed their first cases of swine flu yesterday , bringing the total number of countries affected to 12 . There have been 248 deaths linked to the virus in Mexico , with 12 confirmed . The other countries affected are the United States , Canada , New Zealand , Germany , Spain , Israel and Austria .

Photograph : Christopher Furlong\\/Getty Images In modern disaster management theory , when any large system experiences a major shock or failure , you assess the risk , activate an ordered emergency response , and manage the after-effects . In the world of real people hit directly by the real shock , you look for someone to blame . For ordinary Mexicans this week , who faced the shutdown of their country by swine flu and an unknown number of deaths , it was a culprit that was needed . The Fred Goodwin of the epidemic was easy to identify in their eyes . Just five miles from the town of La Gloria , which appears to be the epicentre of the flu outbreak , is a giant industrial pig complex jointly owned by the world 's largest pig processor , Smithfield Foods . Smithfield is adamant that the swine flu is not of its making and has no connection to its factory farms in Mexico or in any of the countries where it has established its powerful presence . By the end of the week , the company had , like a besieged banker , gone into shutdown mode and declined to give interviews , but it issued a statement : `` We have found no evidence of the presence of influenza virus in any of our pig herds or any of our employees at any of our worldwide operations . All our herds are tested regularly for disease including influenza . We routinely administer flu vaccines to protect them and conduct monthly tests to examine the presence and identity of different flu strains . '' When a young boy from La Gloria who had been ill in March became the earliest confirmed case of the current swine flu outbreak , following new tests by the US Centre for Disease Control -LRB- CDC -RRB- on previously cleared samples from Mexico , Smithfield said it too was re-examining its herds . It was confident that it could reassure people who have been `` bombarded by unfounded opinions , non-scientific statements and unrestrained internet rumor and speculation '' that it was not the source . It declined to answer the Guardian 's detailed questions on its tests . The results were not due till this weekend . Like the rest of the world watching a pandemic unfold as though in a slow-motion car crash , Smithfield could do little but wait to see how hard or soft the landing would be . Smithfield 's predicament has not been helped by the fact that , like Sir Fred , it has made itself somewhat conspicuous with its habits . It operates on a grand scale . The volume of its pig waste is extravagant . But just as RBS did not alone cause the financial crisis but merely conformed to the latest banking type , so it is the very nature of today 's globalised meat industry that is at the heart of this emerging swine flu pandemic . The factory unit near La Gloria fattens nearly a million pigs a year . Globally Smithfield slaughtered 26 million pigs in 2006 , generating sales of $ 11.4 bn -LRB- # 7.6 bn -RRB- and profits of $ 421m . It already controls over a quarter of the total US processed pork market and it has expanded by acquisition in Europe . Like the banking sector , the global food system has seen the emergence of unprecedentedly large players that are dominant at every stage of production from pig breeding to bacon slicing . The modern food system has a sophistication and global interdependence to match the financial system , too . It looks too big to fail . But like that sector , it is also extraordinarily fragile and vulnerable to shock . Many of the shocks are likely to be of its own making . Smithfield 's intensive factories of densely packed hogs , like those of the rest of the large-scale industry , produce vast lagoons of foul-smelling discharges . In many of the areas where it has sited its factory farms or slaughtering and processing complexes , activists and locals have campaigned against it , accusing it of environmental pollution , labor rights abuses and in some places operating without proper permits . The people of La Gloria have had long run-ins with the company 's nearby subsidiary Granjas Carroll . When 60 % of the town 's population became ill in March with flu-like symptoms , they quickly blamed the pigs . Swine flu is currently being passed from human to human , and it is possible that this particular strain of swine flu was created without ever seeing a pig directly , as UN 's Food and Agriculture Organisation 's -LRB- FAO -RRB- experts on animal health point out . The FAO has , however , dispatched a surveillance mission to help the Mexicans check their pig herds . But the focus on Smithfield is not surprising given its history . It won notoriety a decade ago when two of its US subsidiaries were given the largest ever environmental fines by the government 's Environmental Protection Agency , having to pay $ 12.6 m for illegally discharging pollutants from its operations in to the Pagan river in Virginia . It had committed more than 5,000 violations of permit levels for discharging faecal coli forms , phosphorus , ammonia , cyanide and oil from its pig factories over more than five years , destroying fish stocks and polluting water tables . Even more troublingly , it was also found guilty of falsifying documents and destroying records . And as expert labs continued their forensic work through the week , the ancestry of this latest strain of flu and its connection with modern intensive pig farming in general if not with any farm in particular was established . By Wednesday night the reason why scientists had pressed the full flu alert button even though only a few hundred cases outside Mexico , almost all mild at that point , had appeared , also became clearer . At CDC the head of virology had completed the genetic fingerprinting of the swine flu and was able to say that it has arisen from a strain first identified on industrial pig units in North Carolina in the late 1990s . It is no coincidence that this threat to global human health should have emerged from that particular state , as Michael Greger , director of public health at the US Humane Society and leading author on the history of bird and animal flu explains : `` North Carolina has the densest pig population in North America and boasts more than twice as many corporate swine mega-factories as any other state . With massive concentrations of farm animals within which to mutate , these new swine flu viruses in North America seem to be on an evolutionary fast track , jumping and reassorting between species at an unprecedented rate . '' Novel human disease is the toxic debt of today 's industrial livestock farming . The influenza virus has eight genetic segments . If two different types of flu infect the same cell at the same time , the genes from both viruses mix , swapping segments to form totally new hybrids . In Mexico as in many poorer countries , industrial pig and poultry farms are increasingly sited close to crowded urban populations , making simultaneous infection by different flu strains more likely . The 1918 flu pandemic was an H1N1 strain and was a kind of bird flu new to humans so they had no immunity to it . It killed at least 50 million people as it raged around the world in less than a year . The 1918 H1N1 strain passed from humans to pigs , and became the dominant form of flu among pigs , albeit one that evolved into a fairly mild strain . But then in 1998 there was an explosive new outbreak of swine flu in a factory farm in North Carolina that made thousands of pigs ill . The virus had evolved into a triple hybrid that had never been seen before , containing gene segments from bird , human and swine flu . It had found the ideal breeding ground . Pigs , whose immune systems were suppressed by the stress of crowding and fast feeding , and kept confined indoors , were perfect disease incubators for flu whose preferred method of transmission is virus-infected aerosol droplets , expelled by the million in the hog 's famous barking cough . Thanks to the modern practice of transporting live animals , the new virus spread rapidly through pig herds around the country . Six of the eight genetic segments of today 's swine flu outbreak isolated by CDC experts can be traced back to the triple hybrid from North Carolina . Factory animal farming has developed as a giant ecological credit bubble . It has delivered enormous growth in global meat production over the last three decades . Consumers have happily bought its cheap products just as they gobbled up the freely-offered loans of the financial boom without asking too closely how such consumption could be sustained or what the eventual consequences might be . Swine flu should make us question that complacency . Jan Slingenbergh , a senior animal health officer at the FAO believes the precise final evolution of the current virus may never be found . `` We do n't know , but what is most likely is that a human was infected by a common flu virus and at the same time with a second virus which had elements probably from pigs and they mixed to form a new virus . The last bit of human mixing probably took place around mid-March in Mexico . '' Slingenbergh is sceptical that a link will be found to the Granjas Carroll factory . The current virus may now progress as a mild strain and die down or it may mutate and evolve further to become more virulent . The reason experts have invested so much effort in preparing for a flu pandemic and are taking this one so seriously , is that these rapidly evolving strains that mix bird , pig and human forms could throw up a particularly deadly variety . Health experts have warned for years about the danger of intensive livestock farming creating new and rampant human disease . If these new viruses are the toxic debt of the food system , the genetically improved pig is its highly engineered and artificial derivative . Pumped up like a bodybuilder , dependent on antibiotics and vaccines to keep it going , it has disproportionately large back legs to meet a market that likes hams more than shoulder of pork ; it has tiny ears and no tail to limit the scars from the aggressive behavior distressed conditions produce ; and it is bred without hair for ease of slaughter . When herds of 5,000 of these genetically identical modern animals catch flu , it rips through them . Large-scale producers pride themselves on their economic efficiency , but if the true costs of such polluting and disease-harbouring methods were internalised rather than externalised as environmental debts , they would be anything but good value . The cost of the flu pandemic will be unquantifiably large , but it is not the industry that will pay . Instead , the damage will affect the poorest disproportionately . It is ordinary Mexicans who are most affected now , just as the sub-prime mortgage crisis has made those at the bottom of the ladder homeless . Where the next shocks to the food system will come from is unpredictable . As well as outbreaks of disease , climate change may produce a sudden dislocation in supplies . A coincidence of drought in two or more grain producing countries could , for example , lead to price spikes and shortages . An energy crisis could expose how dependent our food system has become on an uninterrupted flow of oil and transport - earlier this year , after just two days of snow , there were worries that London might not be able to maintain its food supplies , according to Rosie Boycott , chairman of the mayor 's London Food board . Official government figures show that there has been a steady erosion of any slack in the system . In the UK , stocks of all food are typically down to 11 days of supply . The UK now carries just eight days ' worth of stocks of frozen foods , and 10 days of perishable goods . Globally , grain stocks are down to 50 days . Tim Lang , professor of food policy at City University and a member of the government 's Sustainable Development Commission , warns that the whole British food network has become taut . `` In that last 30-40 years there has been enormous investment in what is called efficiency , '' he says . `` That means there is no spare . The food system is like a fully stretched rubber band . If it breaks , there would be a sharp rebound . I do n't think a systemic failure is imminent but it is very vulnerable to shocks . They could be technical shocks , ecological shocks or human disease shocks . We do n't have a sustainable UK agriculture base at the moment and we need one . '' But instead of addressing these wider issues , the response to the flu pandemic in terms of food production is `` carry on as normal '' . Urged to spend our way out of ecological recession , we are exhorted to keep eating pork products . Keen to protect the economic interests of its meat industry , the US government took to calling this swine flu `` H1N1 flu '' a couple of days ago , in order not to put people off their chops . The World Health Organisation , which depends on the US for a large part of its budget and has been bullied by it before , has now followed suit , rebranding the flu influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- . But simply saying `` as you were '' is no more an adequate response to the cause of this current crisis than it is to the banking collapse . If we carry on as before , the pigs may yet have their revenge . And if not the pigs , the chickens . cents Felicity Lawrence 's Eat Your Heart Out : Why the Food Business is Bad for the Planet and Your Health is published by Penguin Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Felicity Lawrence : Intensive farming of animals is at the heart of swine flu pandemic This article appeared on p30 of the Main section section of the Guardian on 00.01 BST on Saturday 2 May 2009 .

Photograph : Ben Birchall\\/PA Ministers are facing a dilemma over their battle to combat swine flu . They will have to decide if Britain should cut back production of seasonal flu vaccines in order to allow pharmaceutical companies to concentrate on making a vaccine against the new virus . Such a move could have severe consequences . For the past eight years , seasonal vaccines have helped limit flu deaths , mostly among the elderly , to around 10,000 a year . But a switch to a new vaccine would force companies to stop making the seasonal vaccine . This could leave the country underprepared for outbreaks of standard flu later in the year and deaths could rise significantly . However , the alternative - a decision not to make a vaccine against swine flu - would put Britain at risk of a second wave of the new virus returning in a lethal form this winter . In the past , second waves of flu infections have caused widespread deaths after a first , relatively harmless wave has passed through the country . To date , only 15 non-lethal infections have been reported in Britain . `` Deciding to give priority for a new vaccine will be a judgment call , based on evidence we are now gathering about the swine flu virus 's behavior , '' said Professor David Salisbury , head of immunisation at the Department of Health . `` Pharmaceutical companies have only got a limited manufacturing capacity . So we will have to decide soon which way to go . At the moment , it looks likely that we will go ahead with a new vaccine . That means that this winter we will have some seasonal flu vaccine supplies and would also be ready should a second wave of swine flu appear . '' British scientists are studying virus samples sent to them by the US Centres for Disease Control on Thursday in the hope of understanding how it might behave in future . Early tests have suggested that the H1N1 virus passes fairly easily from person to person but has a low fatality rate . In particular , it lacks proteins - possessed by some strains - that would allow it to infect cells outside the body 's respiratory system , making it more dangerous . At the National Institute for Biological Standards Control -LRB- NIBSC -RRB- , in north London , researchers are also developing a candidate virus to form a vaccine against swine flu . `` We have injected viruses into hen 's eggs , where they will grow for two or three days before being extracted , '' said Dr James Robertson , a virologist . Then the virus will be broken open and its eight genes extracted and mixed with harmless laboratory flu strains to create a range of hybrid viruses . Researchers will then select one that possesses the right features for a future vaccine : a harmless virus that stimulates immune responses when injected into humans . Constructing this candidate virus vaccine will take around four weeks . Then scientists will pass it to pharmaceutical companies such as GlaxoSmithKline , which will manufacture the vaccine from it . The virus will be grown in hen 's eggs and then extracted . Proteins on their surfaces will be removed , mixed with chemical preservatives and a swine flu vaccine created . `` Coat proteins raise antibodies in the blood so that a person , coming across the real live virus , will be prepared to launch an immune attack against it , '' added Robertson . Creating supplies of the new vaccine will take an estimated four to six months . This would give time for UK ministers , acting under advice from Salisbury and colleagues , to give the go-ahead for vaccine production in three or four weeks ' time , allowing sufficient supplies to be ready by winter . In addition , the government faces the issue of deciding who would be treated as vaccine priorities . `` At the moment , we really do n't know who should get it first , '' said Dr Alan Hay , director of the World Influenza Centre , in north London . `` Normally we would propose giving it to the elderly . But in the case of the Mexican outbreak of this virus , those who succumbed were typically aged between 10 and 50 . '' Professor Salisbury told the Observer that the current advice of the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation was that health workers would still target the elderly , their carers , health service staff and those suffering from clinical conditions such as diabetes or heart disease . `` However , we will be ready to change those priorities rapidly if we have to , '' he added . He warned that health service staff would have to improve their attitude to flu vaccines in the event of a second outbreak of swine flu later this year . `` Only about 20 % take up offers of immunisation , compared with the elderly , who have a 70 to 75 % uptake . We can not allow that to continue . We are going to need to have all our doctors , nurses , ambulance drivers and other carers at work if there is a second serious outbreak later in the year and not at home in bed , sick . That means they will have to change their attitude to the vaccine . '' In fact , the best protection against the virus is available now , added Professor Peter Openshaw , director of the center for respiratory infection at Imperial College London . `` The virus is relatively harmless at present and the best possible protection against future , possibly more dangerous , infections would be an infection now . Just how you get that is a different matter .

Initial reports that 176 people had died from swine flu in Mexico were only suspected cases . The bodies would have been tested for the virus , which was not confirmed in all cases . Of the 101 suspected deaths from the virus in Mexico , 19 have been confirmed . Hospitals in the country have also noted a drop in patients appearing with fevers as officials think public health messages such as washing hands regularly must be getting through . There are 18 confirmed cases in the UK but health officials are certain this figure will rise in the coming days as further tests are completed on suspected cases . In the US , the second hardest-hit nation , 226 cases have been confirmed across 30 states . The World Health Organisation yesterday confirmed 787 H1N1 infections in 17 countries . The number of cases has been small but no one yet knows how far the H1N1 virus will spread , how it will mutate and how many people will be caught up in this first wave of infection . By raising its global alert status to level 5 , the WHO thinks that a pandemic is imminent . In that eventuality , the alert will be raised to level 6 , meaning the disease is spreading between people in a sustained way in more than two regions of the world . A pandemic is used by health officials to describe the geographical spread of a disease rather than its severity so , even if H1N1 became a pandemic , the number of cases could still be low . Should we worry about Tamiflu resistance ? All flu viruses mutate so , theoretically , a new version of H1N1 could become resistant to the UK 's frontline defense of Tamiflu . Doctors have been encouraged to prescribe Tamiflu only if absolutely necessary and patients will have to ensure they finish their courses . Will there be a winter wave of infections ? Though the number of cases outside Mexico has been relatively low , it could be because the flu season in the northern hemisphere is coming to an end as the weather warms up . The flu season in the southern hemisphere , however , is due to begin in a few months so if the H1N1 virus reaches countries there , it might circulate for several months , build up a number of infections , and then reappear in the northern hemisphere later in the year . Previous pandemics have behaved in this way , such as the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic , with a second or third wave returning months later to infect many more people than the milder first wave .

Photograph : Eitan Abramovich\\/AFP\\/Getty For Mexico 's Catholic church it is a tricky dilemma : how do you reach out to the faithful in a time of crisis if you are not supposed to touch them ? The flu epidemic has tapped the country 's deep religious sentiment , but to avoid spreading infection the church has had to suspend masses and discourage large gatherings of worshippers . `` It pains us a lot not to have mass on Sunday , but we have taken this decision in solidarity with the health authorities . They asked us to avoid having multitudes of people , '' said Diego Monroy Ponce , rector of Mexico City 's Basilica of Guadaloupe . In previous centuries , before science explained the transmission of germs , plagues had the one virtue from a clerical viewpoint of filling pews and coffers . Now , instead of harnessing anxiety for religious devotion and boosting its influence the church risks being sidelined . `` On weekends we would normally get 200,000 people here , '' lamented Monroy Ponce , gesturing to a basilica deserted save for a dozen priests on the altar singing hymns through surgical masks . On Friday , Mexicans were heartened by figures that showed the number of deaths and new infections stabilising . Fewer people wore masks , and children virtually invisible during the past week 's lockdown reappeared in some neighborhoods . But late yesterday the health minister , Jose Angel Cordova , dented optimism by saying 11 people were suspected to have died within 24 hours . The Catholic hierarchy , frustrated that it can not convoke large gatherings , has come up with several tactics to remain relevant . Cardinal Norbeto Rivera has written a prayer , which people can recite at home , asking for divine deliverance from swine flu . He urged people to follow religious services on radio and television . Pope Benedict XVI , speaking in Spanish to pilgrims at St Peter 's Square in Rome , urged Mexicans and others to keep praying for God to help them overcome their difficulties . The church 's ace , however , is a 17th-century statue , Jesus of Health . The six-foot replica of a bloodied messiah nailed to a cross is credited with banishing medieval plagues . Last week , for the first time in three centuries , it was removed from its chapel in Mexico City 's metropolitan cathedral and carried in procession around Zocalo Square . `` We took it out to ask for intercession in the epidemic , '' said Felipe Sanchez , a priest and cathedral spokesman . `` If things do not get better and it 's necessary to take it out for another procession , we will do it . '' Each day a few dozen people have defied warnings to stay indoors to see the statue . It has been placed just inside the cathedral entrance where there is plenty of ventilation . `` All Mexicans have to commend themselves to the Christ of Health because he helped us during plagues and epidemics in earlier eras , '' said Maria Granados Martinez , 59 , a widow . `` Those of us that have faith believe he could deliver us from that evil again .

It is important to make this clear because -LRB- otherwise -RRB- when we announce level six it will cause unnecessary panic , '' she told Spain 's El Pa s newspaper . Officials from the United Nations and the WHO later insisted that there were no imminent plans to raise the alert level . But they agreed that going to the highest level could be an eventuality . Raising the alert level to six would mean that a global pandemic was in full effect . However , the officials emphasised that a pandemic did not necessarily mean the disease was particularly deadly . And in a video link with the UN , Chan appeared to attempt to allay fears , adding : `` We are not there yet . '' The Financial Times also reported that Chan , who recently raised the threat of a pandemic to level five , had suggested a move to level six was likely . She warned that the real blow might come if a second wave of cases swept across the globe at the start of the winter flu season . `` If it 's going to happen , it would be the biggest of all outbreaks the world has faced in the 21st century , '' she said .

It was a Wednesday , and I was calmly designing the uniforms for my proposed global Reich on a computer , but the mouse would n't work properly , so I stood up and repeatedly smacked it against the wall like a tiny plastic coconut , screaming insults at God , decrying his intolerable insubordination and telling him he was fired . And a shard of shattered mouse hit me in the eye and set me blinking uncontrollably . I did n't like that . I do n't like `` uncontrollably '' . Lack of control is the core unifying characteristic of all the things I 'm afraid of . Air travel spooks me . Because I 'm not in control of the aircraft . Yes , cars are more dangerous , but if I imagine a car crash , at the back of my mind I can also picture myself opening the passenger door and leaping out , or grabbing the wheel at the last minute . It may be unrealistic , but it 's not entirely outside the realms of possibility . What can I do on a stalling plane ? Wish all the atoms in the ground away ? My long-standing phobias stem from a lack of control . My jitter-inducing emetophobia - fear of vomiting , thanks - stems from a terror of the stomach suddenly going freelance and ejecting its contents while I 'm trying to impress someone over dinner . Arachnophobia - well , spiders run in crazy patterns , do n't they ? And you ca n't tell what they 're thinking because their faces are so small . Thus they 're unpredictable . Thus , to my mind , dangerous . I have a niggling fear of heights , or more specifically , a niggling fear of hurling myself off one . A paranoid voice whispers that , hey , you might inexplicably go crazy and lob yourself over the ledge for a short-lived maniacal chuckle . Lack of control , once again , is the bogeyman . Recently I 've been away from this column because my arm started doing things beyond my control . It tingled up and down , as though de-materialising in an old episode of Star Trek . Some of its fingers went numb . Naturally I Googled these symptoms and discovered that , as far as Doctor Internet was concerned , I was nine seconds from death . I grew dizzy with fear . No control over my fate , see . Turns out it 's a herniated disc in my neck pressing against a nerve . It 'll heal slowly but surely . And if it gets worse , well , there 's stuff they can do . The continual discomfort is infuriating , but not the end of the world . Anyway , as part of the diagnostic process , I underwent several exotic tests - partly to rule out more sinister conditions , but mainly to gather more info on what was happening . One was a nerve conduction study , which basically involves passing an electric current through sections of your arm , hands , and wrist to measure what happens . It does n't hurt , but it 's super-creepy , because your fingers start doing things beyond your control . As a sort of finale , the doctor made my entire arm jump around of its own accord , like a wet fish flapping on a deck . No pain at all , but boy did it give me an existential shudder . Because I , like every one of us , in this push-button , automated world of instant results and comfort , have grown accustomed to the illusion of total control . And here was that control stripped clean away from me . Sadly , our magic controllable world is an illusion bearing little relation to the one we actually inhabit , where bad things sometimes occur for no reason . But rather than come to terms with it , we stubbornly refuse to accept the entire concept of risk , hence our neurotic hunt for the nearest scapegoat the moment anything goes wrong - or even looks as if it might . Having just finished a TV series that spent most of its time debunking news broadcasts , I 've been swamped with emails and Tweets saying , `` Ha ha - the news is really overdoing it on this whole swine flu thing , eh ? '' There 's a slightly hopeful tone to the queries , as though I 'm going to tell them everything 's going to be OK . But it 's not that simple . Yes , we 've seen bold headlines and chest-thumping graphics , but pandemic flu could turn out to be a serious threat , even if the symptoms seem mild at the time of writing . Sars and bird flu may have failed -LRB- so far -RRB- to become pandemics , but only because health professionals took the threat seriously . This here swine flu might mutate . It might grow fangs for all I know . It 's beyond our control . Blind fear is counter-productive , but so is blind denial . As with anything potentially risky , it 's best to know what to do in advance , in case swine flu turns nasty - just as it 's prudent to memorise the number 999 in case someone breaks into your house in the dead of night . There are aspects of any outbreak we can influence , if not entirely control . Chortle about growing trotters and a curly tail all you like , Captain Irony , but it might be a good idea to , y ' know , actually follow the medical advice by carrying tissues and developing a fairly studious hand-washing routine . Oh , and that 's proper 20-second hot-water-and-soap hand-washing , not that feeble imitation 99 % of people in public toilets perform , where they run a tap and waggle their hands vaguely near it for three seconds . You can catch this virus by touching , say , an infected doorhandle , then absent-mindedly wiping your eye five minutes later . Did you get the puking bug last year ? That 's probably how you caught that too . An inch more vigilance would n't hurt , Bobby Chuckles . That 's all for today . Now wash your hands . cents This week Charlie enjoyed some daylight for the first time in six weeks : `` I 'd rather taken daylight for granted . It 's a free resource - a jolly good thing .

Photograph : AP Nine new cases of swine flu were confirmed in the UK today , leading to the closure of another London school . All but two had caught the infection in this country . Apart from one adult in the West Midlands , the other sufferers are all from London . The update brings the overall tally of confirmed cases in the UK to 27 , with more than 1,000 people infected worldwide . The latest school to be shut down is Alleyn 's , in Dulwich . A pupil at the fee-paying school who visited the US during the Easter holidays had already been diagnosed with swine flu . Now five more pupils , off sick on Friday , have been confirmed as having contracted the virus . The Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- said the school would be closed for at least seven days . `` Those who are still unwell are receiving antiviral treatment and are recovering at home , '' a spokesman said . The school has arranged for all pupils and staff to be offered antiviral treatment tonight or tomorrow morning . A statement posted today on the school 's website by the headmaster , Colin Diggory , said he was aware the closure would cause `` particular concern '' to students due to take exams this week . Some of the tests may be rescheduled . Alleyn 's is the fourth UK school to be closed as a result of swine flu . Yesterday health officials announced that South Hampstead high school would be closed until Thursday on advice from the HPA . The infected pupil , a 14-year-old from Barnet , had come into contact with someone recently returned from Mexico . North of the border , the Scottish health secretary , Nicola Sturgeon , said that another `` probable '' swine flu case had emerged . A woman from Fife is thought to have contracted the H1N1 virus in Las Vegas before flying home on 30 April , and is now under voluntary quarantine and taking antiviral drugs . A close relative of the first Britons to catch the virus has been flown home from a North Sea oil rig as a precaution . The oil industry is distributing treatment kits , including antiviral drugs , to North Sea installations in case of an outbreak on a platform . In New York the UN secretary general , Ban Ki-moon , insisted that the World Health Organisation did not plan to raise its pandemic alert to the highest level , six , if the current outbreak of a deadly new strain of flu continued at its present level . Addressing an informal session of the UN General Assembly , Ban said the World Health Organisation chief , Margaret Chan , had told him that `` if the situation remains as it is , WHO has no plan to raise the alert level to six at this moment '' . Chan , addressing the conference by videolink from Geneva , said the number of confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza reported to the WHO had risen to 1,003 from 20 countries . But she said there was `` no indication that we are facing a situation similar to that in 1918 '' , when a flu pandemic killed tens of millions . Six is the highest level on the WHO 's scale for the spread of a pandemic . Earlier the environment secretary , Hilary Benn , had said that swine flu appears to be `` relatively small and relatively mild '' and responds well to treatment . Urging the health authorities to remain vigilant , he remarked : `` It 's best to play safe . We are still not absolutely sure what it is that we are dealing with . '' The biggest worry was that the H1N1 virus could mutate , Benn said , and that a second wave of infections in the autumn could be more severe . Alan Johnson , the health secretary , said the spread of the H1N1 virus had largely been contained in the UK , though this might only last until the autumn . `` Our evidence from all previous pandemics is that you get two phases , '' he said . `` You get a first wave that is often very mild and then you get a much more serious wave that comes along in the autumn and the winter . '' There are 331 people currently undergoing tests for the virus across the UK . The officially confirmed global death toll deaths remain low at 26 . It includes include 25 in Mexico and one , a 21-month-old boy , in Texas . Hong Kong , criticised for delaying quarantine measures during the outbreak of Sars in 2003 , has sealed the central Metropark hotel , quarantining 350 guests and employees , after a Mexican tourist fell ill . The 25-year-old man had arrived in the territory on Thursday afternoon after a stopover in Shanghai and was said to be in a stable condition yesterday . Staff inside hung pieces of cloth in lobby windows , covering the pieces of paper reporters had stuck to the glass outside urging those inside to call them . Thomas Tsang , controller of Hong Kong 's center for health protection , said all those at the hotel were healthy . A British couple , Eddie and Terry Sweeney , who are quarantined inside the building , had only planned to stay in Hong Kong for two nights on the return journey from a visit to see their daughter , Sharon , who is a teacher in New Zealand . The couple , who have been married for 38 years , are stuck in their room for most of the day although they are allowed downstairs to collect meals . `` It could be a test of the marriage , '' joked Mr Sweeney , 62 , a retired Metropolitan Police officer from Hazlemere , Buckinghamshire . `` When you look out of the window and see the weather which is fantastic you think you should be on a beach .

Five schools and a nursery have now closed after children were diagnosed with the H1N1 virus and some have had to urgently reschedule practical tests for art and music GCSEs scheduled for this week . There are now fears for the Sats tests , due to be taken by 600,000 11-year olds next week , and the GCSE and A-level exams , which are scheduled to run through to the end of June . John Dunford , general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said : `` Schools are extremely worried about the exams , GCSEs , AS and A-levels . They need to know what to do if one of the pupils or staff is ill . They want to know what the contingency plans are for external examinations . '' One further person , an adult living in the south-east who has returned from Mexico , was confirmed to have swine flu by the Health Protection Agency today , bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the UK to 28 , with 333 still under investigation . Knight said exam boards were considering new contingency plans but urged schools not to panic and rush to close unless they had received specific advice from the HPA . It comes after one school , Dolphin school in Battersea , south London and its nursery , closed without taking advice from the HPA . Knight said : `` I would be surprised if schools were to unilaterally decide to close without consulting the Health Protection Agency , who are experts in this matter . `` I do n't advocate schools doing anything without reference to the HPA . The HPA has been thorough and professional in advice to schools on swine flu . Heads have a legal responsibility to make sure their children and staff are safe at school . I would encourage schools to take advice from the HPA before they make the decision to close . '' He revealed that the exam boards were looking at expanding the system of giving `` special consideration '' to pupils who are sick at the time of their exams . Under the system , GCSEs , A-levels and other qualifications can be awarded on the basis of coursework grades and marks from modules already sat . Knight said : `` There are already procedures in place if candidates ca n't sit their exams and are given special consideration . That can be put into action if things get worse . In contingency terms all these things are being discussed by exam boards . '' Other options include looking at how pupils can sit exams in isolation even if a school is closed . The exams watchdog , Ofqual , said : `` We are looking again at contingency plans to take coordinated action for the exam season if needed . '' The exam boards are due to meet on Thursday to discuss the situation as it unfolds . Private schools have been issued with guidance advising them to expand their medical facilities to `` quarantine '' any infected pupils . The HPA said it was not advising the same to all schools . It does not advise schools to close automatically as soon as a pupil is diagnosed with swine flu , but recommends a risk assessment to see if is is possible to limit the disruption to other children 's education . Most schools affrected have called in the local authority 's health protection unit to help them decide whether to shut their doors . `` All the schools that have closed did close on the advice of the health protection unit , apart from the Dolphin schools , where the board of governors made the decision to do so , '' the HPA said . Though cases of swine flu have so far been mild in the UK , the HPA says it must be treated differently from seasonal flu . `` Although it would be unusual to close a school in response to a single case of flu , in the light of evidence emerging that swine influenza can spread rapidly in the school setting , it is recommended that , if a probable or confirmed case of swine flu occurs in a school setting , consideration should be given to closing the school temporarily -LRB- initially for a period of seven days -RRB- , '' the HPA guidance says . Key to the decision to close is how easily the flu could spread . Staff should consider how long any sick child has been in school , for instance , and whether classes or year groups intermingle and all eat together . No such precautions are recommended for offices and workplaces . The HPA said schools were a special case because children play together and are frequently in close physical contact . If an office worker gets swine flu , public health officials will trace his or her close contacts , who will include work colleagues . Only those who have been working within one metre of the affected person for an hour or more are considered sufficiently at risk to be given antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu , which can prevent them falling sick . Tonight one flu expert warned that the UK 's much-lauded drug stockpile might not be enough if people in contact with flu are given drugs , as children in UK schools have been . Dr John McConnell , editor of the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal , said in an online comment in the Lancet that 16 times as much antiviral medicine is needed to prevent illness as to treat people . `` By this measure , the UK has stockpiles of oseltamivir -LRB- Tamiflu -RRB- sufficient to treat 30 million people -LRB- about half the population -RRB- but to prevent infection in only 1.9 million , '' he said .

Five schools in England are now closed after pupils fell ill with the virus . Three of them are private schools and all but one are secondary schools . Alleyn 's school in Dulwich , south-east London , closed when six pupils were confirmed with having the H1N1 virus yesterday . The school expects to be closed until at least Sunday . A statement on the school 's website said teachers were drawing up contingency plans for exams this week when students were due to sit A-level art exams and language oral tests . All parents and staff were given a one-to-one medical consultation with GPs and nurses and offered the antiviral medication Tamiflu for their children . Paignton community and sports college in Devon was one of the first to close after a 12-year-old girl contracted the virus after a holiday in Mexico . The school said it was asking exam boards to give its GCSE and A-level pupils `` special consideration '' because of the loss of six and a half days of lessons and `` the anxiety and stress our pupils are under '' . Downend school , in south Gloucestershire , will be closed this week after a 12-year-old was confirmed to have the virus . The school said it would be making arrangements for a `` deep clean '' and hoped to open again next week . Tamryn Savage , the school 's headteacher , said : `` We are working closely with the awarding bodies to make alternative arrangements . '' South Hampstead high school in north-west London shut after a 14-year-old was diagnosed with swine flu . It will re-open on Thursday and has offered all year 9 pupils medication . Jenny Stephen , the school 's headteacher , said : `` Unfortunately large school events need to be canceled , but special arrangements are being made to accommodate GCSE and A-level exams . The important message is that any students who have any symptoms of a flu-like illness must not attend school and will be turned away . '' Two pupils who are siblings at the Dolphin school in Battersea , south London , fell ill with the virus leading the school to close . More than 1,200 private schools have been told to consider setting up `` quarantine rooms '' for pupils suspected of having the virus . The Independent Schools Council 's lawyers , Veale Wasbrough , also told the schools that they did not have to refund fees if a school was affected . The Joint Council for Qualifications , the umbrella group for exam boards , said examiners would take into consideration pupils who did not sit exams because of the swine flu . Mock exam papers may be used if a student had completed under half of their assessments for A-levels and under 35 % for GCSE . But `` the awarding body would need more than just the mark achieved by the student in the examination , '' the JCQ said . `` It would need to have the candidate 's scripts and a copy of the examination paper . Senior examiners would evaluate the adherence of the mock examination paper to the specification requirements . If the mock examination paper meets the demands of the specification and its assessment objectives , then the marks can be taken into consideration .

On 1 May , Mexico began an unprecedented nationwide shutdown in a bid to contain the spread of the virus and Mexicans were told to stay at home for five days . Today , President Felipe Calderon announced a return to `` normalcy '' , with people going back to work tomorrow , cafes and restaurants reopening , and universities and schools opening their doors on Thursday . Cases grew to at least 279 in 36 states , and on Tuesday 28 April , California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced a widespread state of emergency in response to the H1N1 `` swine flu '' outbreak . His official proclamation mentions `` conditions of extreme peril to the safety of person and property '' . However , California has ostensibly been going about its business as usual . Asia is reacting vigorously to the new global threat , following the outbreak of SARS in 2003 , which killed 800 people . China suspended flights from Mexico on 2 May ; the day after the first confirmed case of swine flu in Asia was found in Hong Kong .

Photograph : Tim Ireland\\/PA The swine flu virus could turn out to be less severe than previously feared , the US government said today , as one more new case of the outbreak was confirmed in the UK . Kathleen Sebelius , making her first speech as the US health secretary , said : `` We are cautiously optimistic that what we are seeing right now is presenting itself as a much milder virus than the initial cases that presented themselves in Mexico . '' There are 403 confirmed cases of swine flu in the US , and so far one death . The British government 's chief medical officer , Sir Liam Donaldson , today warned it would be `` premature '' to assume the virus was a mild infection . His comments came as the World Health Organisation said it had started to distribute 2.4 m treatments of antiviral drugs to 72 countries `` most in need '' . It declined to name the countries but confirmed that they included Mexico , which has been hardest hit by the outbreak with 590 laboratory-confirmed cases and 25 deaths , according to WHO figures . Donaldson predicted that a second , larger wave of infections could be expected during the usual flu season in the autumn and winter . Health officials today announced one more confirmed case of swine flu in Britain , taking the national total to 28 . The unnamed patient , from south-east England , had traveled to Mexico . Every household in the UK has been sent a leaflet advising how to prevent the spread of the virus , in what is the biggest public health campaign since the 1980s . The leaflets suggest ways in which people can reduce their chances of catching swine flu and gives advice on what they should do if they develop symptoms . Donaldson said officials were closely monitoring the progress of swine flu in southern hemisphere countries such as Australia and New Zealand , which are in winter . This week , five year seven pupils at Alleyn 's school in Dulwich , south-east London , tested positive for the virus . The school will close for a week on Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- advice . The five had come into contact with a pupil who had recently returned from the US and was diagnosed with the virus at the weekend . All of the new patients are recovering well at home . `` Our advice is : please do n't panic , '' said Antony Faccinello , the senior deputy head at the school . `` Parents should keep reading our website for advice , and stick to that advice . We want them to come in to the school to collect their child 's preventative dose of Tamiflu . '' Alleyn 's shares facilities , including buses , with at least two other schools , James Allen 's girls ' school and Dulwich College . The HPA said about 1,200 people , including Alleyn 's pupils and staff , would be offered the antiviral treatment . A course of Tamiflu involves a pill a day for 10 days , but younger children will be given smaller amounts . Donaldson said there was no need for the public to stock up on antiviral drugs . Asked on BBC Radio 4 's Today program whether people should buy Tamiflu over the internet , he said : `` No , they should not . We have a very large stockpile of antiviral drugs the largest in the world . '' Commenting on accounts from some swine flu victims who had suggested the virus was no more severe than a cold , he said : `` At the moment we do n't know enough about this virus to draw any conclusions about its severity . There have been deaths in Mexico it is premature to conclude that is a mild infection . '' In addition to the five Alleyn 's cases , two further children siblings who came into contact with a separate confirmed case in London were confirmed as being infected . Yesterday their school , the Dolphin school in Battersea , south-west London , said it would be closed for a few days as a precautionary measure . Over the weekend independent schools were issued with advice about what to do in the case of a pandemic , mirroring that already supplied to state schools . They are advised to set up text message systems to inform parents of school closures , and web access for pupils to work from home if necessary . The advice , drawn up by lawyers for the Independent Schools Council , says : `` Consider whether extra space will be required for effective quarantine of suspected victims . '' Melvyn Roffe , chairman of the Boarding Schools ' Association , said the organization had been in daily contact with government officials monitoring the potential for an outbreak among boarding pupils . `` We are stocking up on cleaning equipment and making contingency plans , '' he said . Later this week the exams watchdog , Ofqual , and the Qualification and Curriculum Authority will meet exam boards and representatives from the Department for Children , Schools and Families -LRB- DCSF -RRB- and the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly to discuss this year 's exams . Next week 's Sats tests are expected to go ahead as planned in primary schools . A-level and GCSE exams are scheduled from now into June . Another suspected case of H1N1 came to light in Scotland , the fifth in eight days . A traveller from Fife , thought to have contracted the virus in Las Vegas , is under voluntary quarantine . Scottish officials were investigating another probable case involving a 21-year-old woman from Grampian who recently traveled to New York . Nicola Sturgeon , the Scottish health secretary , said further cases were still likely but said the virus appeared to be far less virulent than first feared . `` I remain optimistic that our containment strategy at this stage has proved successful , '' she said today . Sturgeon also criticised a decision by the Russian government to ban pork imports because of the outbreak . `` There 's absolutely not a shred of evidence whatsoever that pork products are n't entirely safe , '' she said . `` We 've been operating on the precautionary principle but also in a way which is proportionate , and I would n't think that action was proportionate . '' Scotland 's chief medical officer , Dr Harry Burns , said the UK 's veterinary authorities were clear that flu in pigs was mild and `` self-limiting '' and was not a cause for human concern . H1N1 had come from a combination of swine , avian and human strains . `` There 's absolutely no evidence you can contract influenza from infected pigs , '' he said . Health authorities issued an alert for passengers on board a FlyBe short-haul flight from Birmingham to Glasgow on 30 April after a man from Ayrshire and Arran fell ill . The man tested positive for swine flu and is being treated at home . A relative of the first Britons to catch the virus , Iain and Dawn Askham , from Polmont , near Edinburgh , has been flown home from a North Sea oil rig as a precaution . He is not showing any symptoms , and is not among the 19 other `` possible '' cases in Scotland . According to the WHO , 21 countries had officially reported 1,085 cases of H1N1 infection . China has forced dozens of Mexican nationals in quarantine , with a plane being sent to take them home , while Chinese nationals prepared to leave Mexico .

And that was before swine flu . The white pig , a resident of Kabul Zoo , and believed to be the only such animal in a country where pork and pig-related products are illegal for religious reasons , has been placed in quarantine over fears it could spread the virus . The animal , the sole survivor of a pair of pigs donated by China in 2002 , normally grazes alongside deer and goats at the rundown zoo . But at the weekend it was removed and put in solitary confinement after visitors became alarmed . `` For now the pig is under quarantine . We built it a room because of swine influenza , '' Aziz Gul Saqib , the director of the zoo , told Reuters . `` We 've done this because people are worried about getting the flu . '' While there is speculation that the new strain of the H1N1 virus could have originated on industrial pig farms before spreading to humans , there would appear to be little risk from a solitary pig , particularly in a country with no direct flight connections with Mexico , where the majority of the 1,000 or so worldwide swine flu cases have been identified so far . Saqib conceded that there was no real public health argument for locking the pig away : `` We understand that , but most people do n't have enough knowledge . When they see the pig in the cage they get worried and think that they could get ill . '' The pig arrived as part of a consignment of animals despatched by China to restock a zoo that had become a symbol of Afghanistan 's descent into chaos during the country 's civil war and the rule of the Taliban . Rebel fighters ate the zoo 's deer and rabbits and shot dead its elephant . One militant climbed into the pen of the resident lion , Marjan , and was promptly killed and eaten . The man 's brother responded by throwing a grenade into the enclosure , leaving Marjan blind and lame . China 's planeload of animals included a pair of lions to replace Marjan , who died in early 2002 . Lonely though Kabul zoo 's pig might be , it has actually escaped lightly by the standards of its peers in some other countries . At the weekend health officials in Baghdad said three wild boars at the city 's zoo had been destroyed because of fears about flu . Egypt , meanwhile , has ordered the slaughter of the estimated 250,000 pigs inside the country , eaten by the country 's Christian minority , even though the World Health Organisation stresses that the virus can not be passed on through properly cooked meat .

The child is a pupil at one of the five schools that have already been closed due to the outbreak . Johnson said there was no evidence of `` sustained '' person to person transmission of the virus in Britain . But he warned in a Commons statement : `` This does remain a serious situation which could rapidly escalate . '' The new cases bring the UK total to 34 .

GCSE exams began across the UK today with a design and technology practical test , under the OCR board . It was not known whether pupils at any of the affected schools were sitting this exam . Schools hit by the illness are rescheduling exams or asking for special consideration for GCSE and A-level pupils . A Department for Children , Schools and Families spokeswoman confirmed that officials were working with Ofqual and the exam boards to put in place contingency plans . She said : `` Arrangements will be made on a case by case basis , so that all students are fairly treated . Basing final results on other evidence , like coursework or modules already completed -LRB- also known as special consideration -RRB- , is just one contingency arrangement , and would only happen in specific circumstances where a student was unable to take a particular exam . `` This is a tried and tested system that exam boards use to award students grades if they are unable to take an exam for a given reason . '' Alleyn 's school , which closed after five year seven pupils were diagnosed with swine flu on Monday , said it was rescheduling A-level exams in art , biology and foreign languages for next week . The government today pledged # 6m in aid to help poor countries in the global fight against swine flu . The money from the Department for International Development will be given to the World Health Organisation and the UN for drugs , logistics and training to assist efforts to stop the spread of the virus and to prepare countries for a pandemic .

The World Health Organisation concurred , saying that if unchecked , swine flu could affect almost a third of the population 2 billion people . Although currently it is only mild , the attack rate of the strain now affecting 23 countries is around 25-30 % , Donaldson said , although he added that it was possible people over the age of 50 might have some immunity to the virus . In the UK , the Health Protection Agency says that only those who have been within one metre of an infected person for more than an hour are considered to be at risk . `` I think it will be more transmissible than that when it gets going , '' said Donaldson . `` We may need to look at that advice . '' Anybody with flu-like symptoms is already being told to stay at home to avoid infecting other people . He said that if flu spreads and becomes more severe , particularly in the winter months , there will be concerns about people working at close quarters in offices and traveling together on tubes , trains and buses . Donaldson , giving a joint briefing in London with Alan Johnson , the health secretary , said the top laboratories in the world were still analyzing the flu strain now said to have killed 42 people in Mexico , which also has 1,112 confirmed cases . `` We have to wait another few weeks for characterisation of the virus , '' he said . Last night five swine flu cases were confirmed in Brazil and Argentina . Brazilian Health Minister Jose Gomes Temporao said four young adults contracted the flu outside the country - three in Mexico , and one in Florida . Prior to Thursday , Colombia was the only South American nation to confirm swine flu with its borders . In Mexico and in the USA which Donaldson said was about a month behind Mexico in the progress of its flu outbreak the picture looks different to here , with many more cases apparently transmitted from one human to another . Only 10 of the 34 cases confirmed in the UK were actually acquired here . On the possibility that people over the age of 50 might have some immunity to the virus , which is of the H1N1 strain , Donaldson said : `` H1N1 has been around a long time . It was a sub-type of the Spanish flu and is in our current seasonal flu vaccine . The optimistic interpretation is that the immune systems of the over-50s might have some memory of the H1N1 of this kind . '' He and Johnson defended their handling of the flu outbreak against critics who say it should be treated just like a mild seasonal flu , without school closures or the handout of antiviral drugs to contacts of those who are sick . `` We do n't know enough about the illness at this stage . It is very reassuring that cases so far are not worse . We do n't want a situation where a child is admitted to hospital because of the complications of flu . As far as children are concerned , I 'm very , very cautious . Simply to allow people to be exposed to it and develop antibodies I do n't think is the right approach . '' Johnson said he would rather have egg on his face than deaths on his hands . `` I 'd rather be accused of over-hyping something and exaggerating than not be prepared for a general pandemic that seriously affected our citizens , '' he said . The current strategy of containment justified using `` precious antiviral drugs '' , he said . If it became widespread or more severe , the strategy would change to reduce the numbers of people given drugs on a preventive basis . Patients and their family members would receive drugs , but not others who might have been in contact . School closures , on the advice of the Health Protection Agency , were a necessary part of the containment strategy . Johnson said the public response to the flu threat had been good , but `` now the danger is complacency '' . The government has ordered 227 million face masks and 34 respirators for health workers and has spent between # 400m and # 500m on its stockpile of flu drugs , which is being expanded to cover 80 % of the population from 50 % now ; # 100 million has been committed in contracts to drug companies Baxter and GlaxoSmithKline to produce a vaccine once the strain is understood .

Five new cases were diagnosed in the UK today four schoolchildren and an adult linked to Alleyn 's School in Dulwich , south London , which has been closed all week after six pupils were diagnosed with the illness . There are now 39 confirmed cases in the UK . Mexico remains the worst affected country , with more than 1,100 laboratory-confirmed human cases of H1N1 virus influenza , including 42 deaths . The United States has reported nearly 900 laboratory-confirmed human cases , including two deaths . Another 22 countries have confirmed cases but no deaths . The latest figures came as the health secretary , Alan Johnson , said the Health Protection Agency , which monitors infectious diseases , had fully mapped the genetic code of the virus . He said this would help scientists to understand how the virus operates and to identify the parts that can be used to manufacture a vaccine . On a visit to a laboratory in Hertfordshire , he was told that researchers hope European manufacturers will be able to take delivery of prototypes in the coming months to enable mass production of a vaccine to begin . Johnson said : `` A significant step towards protecting the world 's health against swine flu has been taken . We now look to the vaccine industry to produce the required quantities of vaccine as quickly as possible . '' The entire genetic fingerprint and sequence of the swine flu virus will now be analyzed to learn how the virus behaves as it infects individuals . At a meeting of Asian health ministers in Bangkok today , the WHO director general , Dr Margaret Chan , said the world was `` better prepared for an influenza pandemic than at any time in history '' , largely because of precautions taken over the threat of bird flu . She said : `` Years of alert and expectation mean that most countries now have preparedness plans . Vaccine manufacturing capacity has increased sharply . Large stocks of antiviral drugs have been produced and procured . `` Right now , treatment courses from the WHO stockpile are being shipped to more than 70 countries in the developing world . '' Mexico 's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva said he would raise concerns at the WHO annual meeting later this month about `` discriminatory '' measures imposed against the country , its people , and its exports because of the flu . China has placed dozens of Mexicans in forced quarantine as a protective measure against the spread of the virus . Around the world , public opinion seems to be shifting from fear of a pandemic to scepticism as to whether the virus poses a significant threat . Half of 2,000 Britons surveyed yesterday said they believe the government over-hyped the threat of swine flu , and are now less worried about it spreading . The research by online polling center Toluna found two-thirds of respondents thought the government had coped well with the outbreak , while more than half -LRB- 54 % -RRB- thought the NHS was well prepared to cope with a possible pandemic . The report noted a decline in public worry about the virus spreading , with 40 % worried about the virus , compared with 50 % last week . Public health officials around the world acknowledge their worst fears about the new virus have yet to materialise . But many experts worry that people will become too complacent and fail to heed warnings if the virus returns in a more dangerous form in the autumn . `` People are taking a sigh of relief too soon , '' said Dr Richard Besser , acting director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention . `` The measures we 've been talking about the importance of hand-washing , the importance of covering coughs , the real responsibility for staying home when you 're sick and keeping your children home when you 're sick I 'm afraid that people are going to say , ` Ah , we 've dodged a bullet . We do n't need to do that , ' '' he said .

But today , as 296 guests and employees were finally allowed to leave Hong Kong 's Metropark hotel , it emerged that the enforced quarantine had provided the setting for all-night drinking sessions and blossoming romance . At least two couples formed lasting relationships during their week-long incarceration , according to the South China Morning Post . One week after they were confined to the hotel where Asia 's first swine flu case was traced , the guests emerged clapping and cheering , discarding their face masks . A Korean businessman broke into song and hugged a policeman . `` I 'm happy ! I love Hong Kong people , '' he said . `` It 's nice to smell fresh air , '' added a British man who identified himself only as Matt . It was a marked contrast to the serious mood a week ago when the hotel was locked down after it emerged that a 25-year-old Mexican man who had contracted the H1N1 virus had stayed there . The man , who spent the week confined to hospital , was discharged last night . The decision to quarantine the hotel contributed to a diplomatic dispute between China and Mexico over Beijing 's handling of the virus . The Mexican president , Felipe Calder n , complained of a backlash against Mexicans abroad . Chinese authorities countered that their experience of the Sars outbreak had taught them to be cautious . Guests initially complained of being trapped . But they soon accepted their fate , and after fears about the severity of the virus subsided , spirits in the hotel began to lift . On Tuesday a birthday party for a French guest carried on into the small hours . `` They ended the night quite drunk , '' said Kevin Ireland , a businessman from New Delhi who wrote a daily blog of life inside the hotel . He claimed that the bill for wining and dining the guests for a week would be `` astronomical '' . After being released from the hotel , he said : `` We were treated very well . '' It was n't all fun and games . At least one woman caught in the quarantine was a prostitute who was forced to spend the entire week with her client after the management refused to give her a separate room , it was reported . The hotel is in Hong Kong 's Wanchai district , the setting of The World of Suzie Wong , a 1960 film about prostitution in the city , and the area is still said to be popular with visiting sailors . Hong Kong officials were keen to placate the hotel guests , who were given tickets to Hong Kong 's Disneyland , restaurant vouchers and film tickets . A picture posted on the Metropark 's Facebook page showed guests slipping notes into a tip box for the hotel staff . Hong Kong 's health minister , York Chow , was grateful to the guests . `` I want to thank them on behalf of all Hong Kong people for helping us ensure that Hong Kong is safe . '' Thomas Tsang , head of Hong Kong 's Centre for Health Protection , said officials would be reviewing their quarantine procedures .

The 30-year-old patient , who has been named only as Bao , tested positive for the type-A H1N1 virus . Up to 130 passengers who shared flights with the infected man are in isolation , the state news agency Xinhua reported , with authorities sending text messages to mobile phones nationwide asking those who had been on board the flights to report to the disease prevention bureau . Bao arrived in Beijing on Friday having traveled home from America via Tokyo . He developed symptoms on a domestic flight from Beijing to Chengdu , in Sichuan , the health ministry said . He went to hospital and was transferred to the city 's infectious disease hospital after being found `` weakly positive '' for swine flu . The country 's only previous confirmed case was a Mexican man who had traveled to Hong Kong . Visa agents and the official Chinese visa service in the UK said people who had just visited Canada , Spain , Mexico or the US would have to wait seven days before applying for a Chinese visa . But a foreign ministry press officer in Beijing said he was unaware of such a policy , and that any such change in procedure would have been announced . Deng Haihua , a health ministry spokesman , told reporters that of the 233 people on board the flight from Tokyo , 106 were foreigners ; roughly a quarter of them were Japanese . All but one of the passengers on the Beijing-Chengdu flight were from mainland China , Deng said . `` The local health authorities are doing their utmost now to try to track down these passengers , '' he said . China has been accused in the past of not acting quickly enough to combat the spread of diseases , especially during the 2003 global outbreak of Sars . The Chinese authorities , chastened by that experience , have been accused of overreactingn to swine flu . China 's response has drawn complaints from Mexico that its citizens were quarantined on the basis of their nationality alone . The World Health Organisation today confirmed that the virus has infected a total of 4,379 people across the world . Its official tally , which tends to lag behind national reports but is also held to be more secure , includes 45 deaths in the disease epicentre , Mexico , two deaths in the US , and one each in Canada and Costa Rica .

In what the journal Science described as the `` first quick and dirty analysis '' of swine flu , a study by researchers at Imperial College London predicted the virus was likely to cause an epidemic in the northern hemisphere in the autumn . One of the authors , the epidemiologist and disease modeller Neil Ferguson , who sits on the World Health Organisation 's emergency committee for the outbreak , said the virus had `` full pandemic potential '' . Speaking on BBC Radio 4 's Today program , he said : `` It is likely to spread around the world in the next six to nine months , and when it does so , it will affect about one-third of the world 's population . `` To put that into context , normal seasonal flu probably affects around 10 % of the world 's population every year , so we are heading for a flu season which is perhaps three times worse than usual not allowing for whether this virus is more severe than normal seasonal flu viruses . '' The Health Protection Agency announced three more confirmed cases of the virus in the UK , bringing the total to 68 . The three patients two children and one adult from London all had close contact with previously confirmed cases . Today 's study estimated the contagiousness of the disease by analyzing the number of people traveling to Mexico who became infected , and comparing that with a study of a Mexican village where the disease has spread . The research also examined how the virus was mutating . It estimated that swine flu had killed between 0.4 % and 1.4 % of its victims in Mexico . The report 's lead author , Christophe Fraser , said it was too early to predict what the death rate was likely to be outside Mexico . `` My hunch is that the death rate will be lower elsewhere Mexico has underlying issues with respiratory disease , '' he said . The researchers said this H1N1 virus appeared to be about equal in severity to the flu of 1957 , and less severe than the deadly 1918 version . `` At the moment the virus is not spreading fast in the northern hemisphere because we are outside the normal flu season , but come the autumn it is likely to cause a really major epidemic , '' Ferguson said . He declined to put an estimate on the number of deaths that may occur . `` We have some assessment , but the uncertainty is still quite broad , '' he said . `` We can say it is not going to be as catastrophic as the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 , it is milder than that . But it is still possible it could be -LRB- like -RRB- 1957 where about three to four out of 1,000 people who were infected died and overall about 3 million to 4 million people died that year because of the pandemic worldwide or it could be even milder than that , like the 1968 pandemic which was barely worse than a normal seasonal flu year . `` I am not predicting three million to four million -LRB- deaths -RRB- . That was what happened in 1957 . The world is a very different place today . There are more people in the world , but there is also a much better healthcare system . We have drugs and vaccines , particularly in developed countries , which should markedly reduce the burdens of the disease . '' Ferguson said the findings of the study confirmed that decisions must be taken swiftly on vaccine production . `` One of the key decisions which has to be made this week by the world community is how much do we switch over current vaccine production for seasonal flu to make a vaccine against this particular virus . '' Today Cuba and Thailand confirmed their first case of the virus . The patient in Cuba is a Mexican student at a medical school . Fidel Castro accused Mexico of failing to disclose the spread of swine flu until after Barack Obama , the US president , had visited the country on 16 April . In a newspaper column , the former Cuban leader wrote : `` Mexican authorities did not inform the world of the presence -LRB- of swine flu -RRB- , while they waited for Obama 's visit .

In Mexico , where 75 swine flu deaths have occurred , the health authorities said no one had been taken to hospital with respiratory infections in the past three days . There have been no confirmed swine flu cases since May 14 . `` We are seeing a 96 % drop in cases and that 's why we are dropping the alert level to green today , '' the Mexico City health secretary , Armando Ahued , said . Since the outbreak was declared on 23 April , Mexico City has spent 4.5 bn pesos -LRB- # 217m -RRB- on medicine and antibacterial gel and to provide incentives for businesses to shut their doors and to clean public spaces . A total of 4,008 people have been infected in Mexico . The country 's confirmed toll has been rising as scientists test a backlog of samples from patients . Ebrard urged Mexicans to remain vigilant , to maintain sanitary conditions in places where crowds gather such as the metro system and schools , and to support a `` culture of health '' . `` The big lesson is that we understand what the scientists have been saying for a decade : that we have to be prepared for any possible virus that can appear , '' the mayor said . Nearly 80 % of those who died were between 20 and 54 , according to the health department . However , many suffered from underlying medical conditions . Almost 30 % were obese or had other metabolical problems , and 13 % had cardiovascular problems . New test results from the US Centres of Disease Control show that people in their 60s and older have signs of greater immunity to the new swine flu virus .

The school is closed this week for half term and expected to open for all pupils who are feeling well next week . Before the holidays began , the headteacher informed the HPA there had been an unusually high number of absences owing to illness . At least 100 children had been off sick , according to local reports . As a result of the first confirmed case , all parents and staff were told either to attend the school over the weekend to collect antiviral medication or to receive medical attention at home . A joint statement issued by the school and the HPA , posted on the school 's website , says that it is undergoing a `` deep clean '' of the premises during the holiday before it reopens . The headteacher , Chris Smith , was unavailable for comment yesterday . The HPA said that all confirmed cases are being treated at home with antivirals and are responding well to treatment . HPA officers contacted every parent of children in the school as well as teachers to find out if they have symptoms . A spokeswoman for the HPA said that they had not yet identified the source of the outbreak . `` The initial case is still under investigation . The vast majority of cases have been in people recently returning from an infected country or who have been in close contact with someone who has just returned . This is one of a very small number of cases where there is n't that history , '' she said .

The school has 420 pupils and 60 in its nursery unit . Almost 50 countries have now confirmed cases of swine flu and about 13,000 people around the world have been diagnosed with the virus . The death toll from the virus in Mexico stands at 83 , while 12 people have died in the United States and two have died in Canada . Of four cases confirmed on Monday in the UK , one was yesterday revealed to be a two-year-old boy from Oxford . A DoH spokesman said : `` The localized cases of swine flu found in the UK have so far been mild , and we have not seen evidence of widespread community transmission . Our strategy of containing the spread with anti-virals appears to have been effective in reducing symptoms and preventing further spread of infection . `` But we must not be complacent it is right to prepare for the possibility of a global pandemic .

The Berkshire school was told yesterday that a 13-year-old boy had tested positive for the H1N1 virus and was advised by health authorities to shut until 7 June . The Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- today announced a further 17 cases of the disease , bringing the total to 203 . The new cases include 13 children and an adult at Welford primary school in Handsworth , Birmingham , which has already been linked to 50 cases of the virus . A spokesman for Eton said : `` The boy has a mild illness and is now recovering at home . The school is currently closed for half-term and had been due to reopen on Sunday May 31 . `` The Health Protection Agency has strongly advised that the school should close in line with national guidance . Following discussion with the HPA , the school plans to remain closed until June 7 , and boys who are due to sit public examinations will be allowed to return under controlled conditions . '' He said the HPA was checking on pupils who had been in contact with the boy , adding : `` The objective is to minimize the risk of spread of infection , while allowing boys to take their public examinations . '' Another cluster of cases continues to grow in Glasgow , where it emerged that a primary school child living next door to the man critically ill in hospital was being treated as a probable case . The child 's school , Annette Street primary , has been closed and the child 's classmates given the antiviral drug Tamiflu as a precaution . Two other pupils at the school who have already been identified as confirmed cases are children of the 37-year-old man , who has other health problems and is now in an isolation ward at Victoria infirmary in Glasgow . His wife and their third child also have the virus . A Department of Health spokesman said these cases had so far been mild , with no evidence of widespread transmission in the community . `` Our strategy to slow the spread of the disease appears to have been effective , and the UK 's arrangements continue to ensure that we are well-placed to deal with this new infection , '' he said . Nicola Sturgeon , the Scottish health secretary , added : `` We will continue to see incidents of H1N1 across the country and the lessons learned from each of these will help us in our ongoing efforts to disrupt the spread of the virus .

Scientists at the HPA 's research lab near Potters Bar in Hertfordshire , one of a World Health Organisation network of laboratories involved in the research , have produced a hybrid flu strain by combining parts of the H1N1 virus with a laboratory strain .

European health officials confirmed that as of this morning , 456 people had caught the H1N1 virus across 21 EU member states , with almost half of those infected living in the UK . More concerning is that the virus appears to be spreading more quickly from person to person in Britain than elsewhere , raising questions over public health measures to contain it . Most European cases of swine flu are people who have flown home after picking up the infection in Mexico or the US . Britain is the only member state where more people have caught the disease at home than abroad . Figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control show that of 203 confirmed cases of swine flu in Britain , 146 people caught the virus without leaving the country . In Spain , which has 143 confirmed cases , only 43 people caught the infection at home . Sheila Bird , professor of biostatistics at Cambridge University , criticised Britain 's Health Protection Agency for failing to publish the information , which emerged only in a European report on the epidemic . `` When you see a big difference in the rate of person-to-person transmissions between the UK and other countries , the immediate questions are is this due to better surveillance in the UK , or is it due to poorer public health measures ? '' `` It 's not just scientists who need to know this information . In the prevention of a new infectious disease , part of the work is done by the public , and they need to know what to be alert to , '' she added . A spokeswoman for the Health Protection Agency said outbreaks at schools in London and Birmingham had contributed `` significantly '' to the spread of the disease within Britain . Yesterday , the Department of Health reported 12 new cases in England , bringing the UK total to 215 . The new cases include 10 children from Welford Primary School in Handsworth , Birmingham , where 60 cases have already been confirmed . The other two cases include a child in London and an adult in the north-west , who caught the infection from an unknown source . On Thursday , a seriously ill 37-year-old man was admitted to the Victoria Infirmary in Glasgow with the infection . Eton College in Berkshire was closed for a week from yesterday after a 13-year-old pupil was diagnosed with swine flu .

Photograph : David Moir\\/Reuters The formal declaration of a global flu pandemic is bound to trigger anxiety and possibly panic . It 's one thing to say Britain is having outbreaks of swine flu but quite another to talk of being in the grip of a fully fledged , officially designated worldwide pandemic . But public health officials in the UK are already trying to talk down the implications of the World Health Organisation moving the alert status from level 5 to level 6 , the highest . Swine flu in most countries has been mild and there have been no signs of it becoming more deadly . The pandemic tag is to do with geography , public health experts say , and not severity . Swine flu has to be officially designated a pandemic because it is spreading easily in two distinct regions , the Americas and now Australia . In England , the Health Protection Agency , which is notified of every case , says there is no sustained transmission and containment of the virus is still the policy . `` We still have cases that have been linked to an outbreak , such as in schools , or linked to other cases , '' said a spokeswoman . `` The big change would be if we had sporadic cases . '' Scotland is taking a different tack . The Scottish health secretary , Nicola Sturgeon , told the parliament this morning that hospital cases in Scotland were at similar rates to the United States . There are 311 confirmed cases of H1N1 in Scotland , more than a third of the UK 's total , with cases heavily concentrated in the Glasgow area . By yesterday , 18 people had been admitted to hospital , with five in intensive care or high-dependency units . Fifteen schools and nurseries are either entirely or partly closed . Sturgeon says containment has failed , so the strategy in Scotland is to mitigate the spread . Doctors in the worst-affected areas Glasgow , Dunoon and Paisley will be allowed to make a swine flu diagnosis in their surgeries rather than wait for specialist or laboratory tests . Only the closest contacts of infected people will be given the antiviral drug Tamiflu . `` We have seen a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases in Scotland over the past 10 days , '' Sturgeon told parliament . `` Based on this experience , Health Protection Scotland has expressed the view that sustained community transmission appears to be taking place . '' In England , the containment strategy continues for now . Every case is reported and close contacts are given Tamiflu , which reduces the flu 's duration and severity . Where schoolchildren have fallen ill , every pupil has been given the drug and most schools involved though not all have been closed . The aim is to stop swine flu spreading . If containment fails , that policy will end , and stocks of Tamiflu will be preserved for those most at risk of severe illness . There will be no more mass dosing of schoolchildren . Little else will change with the official pandemic announcement . The government is rolling out its anti-pandemic strategy as fast as it can because there is every possibility that swine flu could do a lot more damage once the winter flu season starts . Plans involve sending antiviral drugs and antibiotics to all GPs , and advertising campaigns telling people to wash their hands and if they fall ill , to stay at home , call the flu line and get a friend to collect their drugs .

The decision was made after a meeting of experts in Geneva today and comes as infections have climbed in Europe , the US , Australia , South America and elsewhere . The WHO chief , Dr Margaret Chan , yesterday examined data from eight countries with large numbers of swine flu cases . `` The world is moving into the early days of its first influenza pandemic in the 21st century , '' Chan told reporters tonight , advising that countries should prepare for a second wave of cases . `` The -LRB- swine flu -RRB- virus is now unstoppable . '' Raising the alert level reflects that the virus is more widespread , but not necessarily more dangerous although there are fears that infections could overwhelm hospitals and health authorities , especially in poorer countries . Another 25 cases of swine flu have been confirmed in England and 26 more in Scotland , taking the UK total to 848 . Speaking to health service managers in Liverpool at a conference of NHS trusts , the UK 's new health secretary , Andy Burnham , said : `` It 's not a cause for alarm . It does n't change our plans . '' Sarah Boseley : ` The only deaths are in Mexico , USA and Canada ' Link to this audio Swine flu originated in Mexico in April and has spread to 74 countries , infecting more than 27,700 people and killing 140 . Most cases have been mild , although employers are being warned to prepare for absences through illness . The WHO said pharmaceutical companies should start making swine flu vaccine . One manufacturer , GlaxoSmithKline PLC , said it could start large-scale production by July but large quantities would not be available for several months . Despite the WHO 's hopes , the announcement of a pandemic will almost certainly spark panic in some countries . Fear has already gripped Argentina , where thousands of people worried about swine flu flooded into hospitals this week , bringing to near-collapse the emergency health services in the capital , Buenos Aires . `` People might imagine a virus is now going to rush in and kill everyone , '' said John Oxford , a professor of virology at St Bart 's and Royal London hospital . `` That 's not going to happen . '' There are 337 cases in Scotland and health officials in Edinburgh said 30 % of them were in young adults aged 15-24 . The Scottish health secretary , Nicola Sturgeon , said public health tactics had changed after it emerged the virus was spreading uncontrolled . Sturgeon told the Scottish parliament this morning that hospitalisation rates were similar to those in the US . She indicated that attempts to contain the virus had failed and the strategy would be to limit its spread . Doctors in the most-affected areas Glasgow , Dunoon and Paisley would be allowed to make a swine flu diagnosis in their surgeries rather than wait for specialist or laboratory tests . England 's chief medical officer , Sir Liam Donaldson , said health officials were expecting to see more and more cases this autumn and winter with the return of the traditional flu season , and the virus might yet change and become more severe . There were `` very strong '' plans in place to deal with the flu and so far the government 's approach , including closing schools where necessary , appeared to have worked well , he said . At the NHS Confederation conference , senior health service managers held an early-morning session to refine their emergency plans . Contingency arrangements are being drawn up to allow for hospitals and health centres to continue operating when as many as 40 % of staff are off sick . Steve Barnett , the chief executive of the NHS Confederation , which represents most health and ambulance trusts , said : `` The confirmation of a level 6 global pandemic reinforces the need for the NHS to ensure all the flu plans already in place at local level are as comprehensive as possible and thoroughly tested . `` We need to avoid complacency in dealing with a virus that is an unknown and seems to be spreading quickly . '' The last such pandemic was the Hong Kong flu of 1968 that killed about a million people . Ordinary flu kills about 250,000 to 500,000 people each year .

With the number of recorded cases of swine flu in Australia , Canada and Mexico hitting four figures ; in the UK doubling in a week to more than 750 ; and in the US passing 13,000 , the move has been inevitable . It is about six weeks since the WHO raised the status to phase five , the first indication that a pandemic was imminent . It has been interesting to observe different sectors of society have reacted . For the media , the move to phase five was quite rightly a big story which was , equally appropriately , given a good deal of coverage . So far , however , there has been only a handful of cases to report , and these people appear to have suffered little more than a bad cold , leaving the public -LRB- and even some journalists -RRB- slightly baffled at what all the fuss is about or even if we should be making a fuss at all . For the government , the health sector and emergency planners across the UK and indeed the world it has been a different story . Largely behind the scenes , plans that were drawn up , tested , exercised and refined over more than a decade have begun to swing into place , just as the WHO intended : its definition of phase five includes the warning that a pandemic `` is imminent and that the time to finalize the organization , communication and implementation of the planned mitigation measures is short '' . Most visible among this activity has been the government 's printing and distribution of the leaflet Important Information About Swine Flu -LRB- pdf -RRB- , the activation of the information helpline and the accompanying media campaign . Note exactly what this means : the public now has the information it needs to mitigate the effects of an outbreak as much as it can . The phoneline organisers will have had time to call in the additional operators needed , to ensure they are well-trained and comfortable with the queries they will receive and to iron out bugs in the system while the number of calls it has been receiving is small . This picture is mirrored across the country , which is why the WHO considers the UK to be one of the two best - prepared countries in the world . Over the last six weeks , anyone with a direct role in responding to a pandemic has been quietly but efficiently gearing up for it . Hospitals have been preparing to deal with extra patients , scientists have been working to develop a vaccine to this specific strain and local health authorities have been planning how these vaccines will be distributed and administered . It is also important to remember that we are extremely lucky that the type of flu we are now facing , Influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- , is a less deadly strain than might have mutated from the H5N1 bird flu many scientists expected . This means that the pandemic we are facing will affect only the quantity of victims , not the quality of their illness ; if you catch swine flu you have no more chance of dying from it than if you catch any other type of flu , but you do have more chance of catching it . The doomsday predictions of 750,000 UK dead are , thankfully , unlikely to be realized . But this does not make it all a fuss about nothing . The very old , the very ill and people with compromised immune systems , such as diabetics and those with Aids , often do die from flu and this year more of them will catch it . Hospitals will have to cope with an increased number of admissions , possibly while their staff is depleted by illness . This will become more acute as we head into the winter months , as Australia has seen , though the heads-up we have been given means that with luck we may by then have a vaccine . We should be proud that swine flu seems to be a bit of a fuss about nothing . That the public does not , by and large , feel frightened and is not panicking is a measure of the success with which the UK has prepared for this outbreak and has dealt with it so far . From national flu pandemic exercises such as 2007 's Winter Willow , to countless smaller exercises that take place across the UK every month , to the pages of information that can be found on NHS and government websites , the UK is as well prepared as it can be to deal with the effects of the global flu pandemic we now face .

But yesterday the World Health Organisation 's Margaret Chan achieved just that by declaring the first influenza pandemic in 40 years . Never mind that to date H1N1 swine flu has killed just 144 people worldwide . With 1,300 cases now being reported in Australia , and simultaneous community outbreaks in Chile , Japan and the United States , Chan said scientists had concluded that transmission was `` unstoppable '' hence the decision to declare a maximum pandemic alert at level six . The subtext of Chan 's message was that this was no time for complacency : with the winter flu season in Australia now well underway , hospital admissions in Melbourne have quadrupled in recent weeks . If the virus maintains its present level of virulence then experts are predicting that a third of the British population could be infected this autumn and as many as 36,000 could die about three times as many as in a normal flu season . But `` could '' is not the same as `` will '' , and looking round the world you will find many more mortal and , arguably , more present threats to global health . Take HIV\\/Aids , for instance , a disease that has been pandemic , or at least has been spreading at epidemic levels in Africa , for 30 years . In 2007 , the latest year for which figures are available , Aids-related illness killed 2 million people worldwide , including 270,000 children . But because two-thirds of the 33 million people annually infected with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa and the remainder belong , by and large , to discrete `` high-risk '' groups such as intravenous drug users , HIV no longer blips on our radar screens . I have just returned from western Cambodia , where scientists are now reporting the first signs of parasite resistance to the world 's current frontline anti-malarial , artemisinin . Malaria , along with diarrhoeal diseases and pneumonia , is one of the leading causes of infant mortality in Cambodia . And in Uganda and other high malaria transmission countries in Africa , it is also a major killer of pregnant women -LRB- the WHO estimates that some 3,000 people a day die from malaria in sub-Saharan Africa every day , the majority of them women and children -RRB- . Unlike influenza , as yet we have no vaccine against malaria . Indeed , artemisinin is currently the best , and in some parts of the world , the only effective treatment against the deadliest strains of the parasitical disease . In other words , if resistance to artemisinin spreads worldwide as occurred with choloroquine in the 1960s then we have nothing else in the locker . This may not matter to you now : but it could well matter to you if you travel to Kenya and the prophylactic your GP has prescribed fails , or if your child is hospitalized with falciparum malaria during his or her gap-year travels . Yet as with HIV , malaria strains our empathy . `` When one has fought a war , one hardly knows what a dead person is , '' wrote Albert Camus in The Plague . `` And if a dead man has no significance unless one has seen him dead , a hundred million bodies spread through history are just a mist drifting through the imagination . '' Or as a taxi driver in York put it en route to York University 's biology department where scientists are currently breeding high-yielding strains of Artemisia Annua , the plant from which artemisinin is derived , to produce sufficient quantities of the drug for Cambodia `` Unless it affects someone in my family , why should I care ? '' H1N1 of course could affect that taxi driver 's family and the families of millions of Britons like him . Unlike seasonal strains of influenza , which are usually only dangerous to infants and the over-65s , H1N1 swine flu like the 1918 H1N1 `` Spanish '' influenza virus appears to be hitting the under-25s hardest , hence the importance of WHO 's declaration yesterday and the stepping-up of vaccine production before the autumn -LRB- at present , experts predict there will only be enough vaccine to inoculate half the British population -RRB- . Yet , for all the concern about an influenza pandemic , we should keep in mind that WHO 's announcement was first and foremost an exercise in risk assessment : a signal to governments who have yet to activate their pandemic plans to pull their fingers out . Its use of the term is also the reflection of changing definitions . In the past , WHO defined an influenza pandemic as causing `` enormous numbers of deaths and illness '' . By contrast , the current definition requires only `` community-level outbreaks '' in two continents at the same time a test that was actually met several weeks ago . That WHO has delayed announcing the inevitable until now is an indication of how worried United Nations member states have become of fuelling panic at a time when the world economy is just beginning to shown faltering signs of recovery from the credit crunch . But while Chan recognized there was a danger of people overreacting , she argued that the greater danger was `` complacency '' . She also warned that while a level six pandemic alert did not mean the virus was becoming more dangerous or that we should expect to see an increase in mortality in developed nations , there was no telling how H1N1 would behave `` under conditions typically found in the developing world '' . If panicking about an influenza pandemic can help us empathise with the plight of the invisible victims of infectious diseases and make those global health connections , so much the better . Like the HIV virus and drug-resistant malaria parasites , H1N1 is no respecter of borders . And whether we drive a taxi in York or live in a mud hut in Yemen , we can be bitten at any time .

But do n't worry ... not yet , anyway Out of 30,000 global cases , only 145 deaths have been reported and development of a vaccine is well under way . But scientists will not relax : the virus could mutate and grow stronger over the summer - and what happens if it mixes with bird flu ? It was the final surge in numbers that forced the World Health Organisation to act . With confirmation last week that swine flu cases had risen above 1,000 in Australia , it was clear the disease was now spreading freely around the world . Thousands of cases had already been reported in the United States , Mexico and Chile . Officials at the World Health Organisation simply had no choice . On Thursday , they announced swine flu had achieved pandemic status , the first strain of influenza to reach this mark for 41 years . It seems an alarming prospect . Are we again set to face a disease that can kill millions as happened with the pandemics of 1918 , 1957 and 1968 ? Margaret Chan , the World Health Organisation 's director general , was confident , however . The disease is only a `` moderately severe '' risk , she announced . Out of 30,000 cases worldwide , only 145 deaths have been reported . Development of a vaccine - the world 's main anti-flu weapon - is already under way while stockpiles of anti-viral drugs such as Tamiflu are also available , at least for developed nations . It would be premature to assume complete security , however . Before the world vanquishes swine flu , many hurdles will have to be cleared . In particular , every stage of the development of a swine flu vaccine , our key hope of fighting the disease , could be disrupted , scientists warned last week . `` We must be prepared for something that is more severe than is currently observed , '' said Dr Alan Hay , director of the World Influenza Centre , in London . `` We can not be complacent . '' For a start , swine flu vaccine production is still at a very early stage . Indeed , the artificial strain that will form the core of a vaccine has only just been created , with researchers in Britain , Australia and the US having produced almost identical versions . These have only just been passed to pharmaceutical firms to see if they can quickly produce the vaccine on a mass scale . The British version of the vaccine strain - known as RG121 - was created two weeks ago at the National Institute for Biological Standards Control near London . Like its US and Australian counterparts , it is made of bits of several flu viruses but specifically stimulates immunity against swine flu . Unlike swine flu , however , it can be grown easily in hens ' eggs . Eggs are used throughout the drugs industry as incubators in which viruses - the basic components of vaccines - are grown . `` Hens ' eggs remain the bulwark for vaccine production , '' said Professor Peter Dunnill , of the Centre for Biochemical Engineering at University College London . `` It is a pretty ponderous business , however . Each egg has to be looked after carefully and you have to beware lest infections kill them off . '' This point was backed by Dr James Robertson , leader of the team that created the RG121 strain . `` Different strains behave differently in eggs and produce varying amounts of virus particles . In the case of our swine flu vaccine strain , we simply do not know yet how much virus you will get from each egg , At present , pharmaceutical companies ' estimates of the amounts of virus particles they will get from their eggs are optimistic . This could be a mistake , warn scientists , and companies could find they get less than a third or a quarter as many viral particles as they hoped for , a reduction that would , in turn , limit the number of vaccine doses available to the public . Once viruses are extracted from eggs they are broken into pieces including bits of their protein coats . These protein pieces are important because they stimulate immune responses in humans and can be used to make a vaccine . `` Coat proteins raise antibodies in the blood so that a person , coming across the real live virus , will be prepared to launch an immune attack against it , '' said Robertson . But sometimes , it takes more than one dose of a vaccine to stimulate full protection . The current seasonal flu vaccine requires only a single shot but other vaccines require two inoculations , a point stressed by Dr Hay . `` It may require two doses to provide significant immunity against swine flu , '' he told the Observer . And if a swine flu vaccine requires a double dose , this would also limit numbers of doses available to provide full protection as quickly as possible . Even if viral production in eggs goes to plan , manufacturers such as GlaxoSmithKline will be stretched to meet demands and have decided to add chemicals known as adjuvants to their vaccines . Adjuvants stimulate immune systems and so reduce amounts of vaccine needed to create antibody protection in an individual . `` We will be using adjuvants in our vaccines , '' said Stephen Rae of GlaxoSmithKline . `` This will be the first time we have used them for a flu vaccine but we are confident they will work . '' However , Professor Dunnill again warned that care should be taken with such predictions . `` It remains to be seen if pharmaceuticals can rely on using adjuvants and still produce a single dose vaccine against swine flu , '' he said . And then there is the issue of timing . At present , only a limited number of people have succumbed to swine flu in the UK with the Health Protection Agency putting the figure at 1,121 confirmed cases yesterday . But most scientists now predict a second wave of the disease is likely to strike later in the year . Exactly when and how it hits will have profound consequences for Britain , as Hay explained . `` The key issue is how the virus mutates in the southern hemisphere over the next few months during the winter there . That is far more important than its behavior in the northern hemisphere during our spring and summer . '' The virus is more likely to spread through populations during the southern hemisphere in winter and the more it does so , the more it is likely to mutate , possibly into a new , more virulent form . There is also the issue of the timing of that return . If a reinvigorated , more virulent forms appears late in the year , health and pharmaceutical workers could have enough time to prepare reasonable supplies of vaccine . `` However , if it returns earlier in the year , in September , say , there is not much chance we will have enough vaccine ready by then , '' Dr Hay warned . `` It is undoubtedly a problem . Certainly , there is no doubt the big issue here is time . '' Should vaccine supplies be low when the second wave strikes , health workers will then face a problem of deciding which members of the public should be rated as priority targets . Health and utility workers , police and security staff , will be obvious choices . But selecting the elderly - a key choice for seasonal flu vaccine - as priorities for swine flu vaccines would be a mistake , Hay said . `` Around 75 per cent of people who have succumbed to swine flu have been under age of 30 and very few have been over 60 . It is very likely that people of 60 and above may well have some immunity . '' Intriguingly swine flu is of the same basic type , called H1N1 , as the virus that caused the 1918 pandemic , the world 's worst outbreak of flu which killed up to 100 million people across the globe . `` That basic strain circulated round the world for another four decades until 1957 when it was replaced by a new type , known as H2N2 , which was responsible for the Asian flu epidemic of that year , '' Hay said . In other words , people who were children or young adults before 1957 may well be carrying immune protection to an old virus that is a distant descendant of the 1918 flu strain and which is giving them protection against swine flu . Hence the relatively robust response of those over 60 to the current pandemic - though these individuals will still need protection from standard seasonal flu with vaccines that are now being stockpiled by pharmaceutical firms . Vaccines are not our only protection against flu , of course . Anti-viral drugs - in particular , Tamiflu - block the spread of the flu virus between cells in the body and offer another line of defense against the disease . `` Vaccines are our real hope but there is no doubt Tamiflu will help , '' said Dunnill . `` But we should note resistance to the drug is spreading . The normal seasonal flu virus has acquired Tamiflu resistance over the past year and we will have to monitor , very carefully , how swine flu behaves . We can not take the drug for granted , that is certain . '' And finally scientists point to the disturbing scenario in which swine flu spreads to countries such as Indonesia and infects animals or humans who are already affected by bird flu . The latter disease is difficult to acquire but is highly virulent if caught . By contrast , swine flu is easy to pass on although , at present , it rarely produces serious symptoms . In a person who becomes infected by both strains , however , it is possible that there will be an exchange of genetic material resulting in the creation of an easily transmissible but highly virulent virus . `` It is a nightmare vision which , fortunately , remains only a remote prospect at present , '' said Dunnill . All these issues make it difficult for doctors and scientists to be certain how they will cope if swine flu , as expected , returns to Britain with renewed vigor later this year . Or it may return in a relatively non-virulent form and pharmaceutical companies may suffer no vaccine production problems . Alternatively , things could go wrong . `` We can anticipate many things and that , in the end , is all we can do , '' said Hay . `` We must prepare as best we can for all these scenarios and then deal with the ones that unfold . It will probably be a long battle , however . '' But do n't worry ... not yet , anyway This article appeared on p22 of the Main section section of the Observer on 00.01 BST on Sunday 14 June 2009 .

Photograph : David Moir\\/Reuters The family of the first British swine flu patient to die said today they were `` absolutely devastated '' as health experts tried to allay public fears about the virulence of the virus . Jacqui Fleming , 38 , from Carnwadric in south Glasgow , was named today as the first person outside the Americas to have died since the H1N1 virus first emerged in Mexico more than three months ago . Fleming had underlying health problems , and died in intensive care at the Royal Alexandra hospital in Paisley on Sunday , two weeks after giving birth prematurely to her third child . The birth was induced nearly three months early because of her critical condition . NHS Greater Glasgow said tonight that her son , named Jack , also died today . An NHS spokesman said the baby did not die from swine flu . A statement issued on behalf of Ms Fleming 's partner William McCann , said : `` My beautiful son was born on 1st June 2009 , 11 weeks early . `` He suffered from a number of complications and despite his brave fight he passed away earlier this evening at the Special Care Baby Unit at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley . `` Coming so soon after the death of his mum , this is an extremely distressing and difficult time for our family and I would ask the media to respect our privacy as we try to cope with the loss of Jacqueline and Jack . '' A statement from NHS Greater Glasgow said : `` Earlier this evening , baby Jack , the son of Jacqueline Fleming and her partner William McCann , tragically passed away . '' She leaves two other children , one boy aged 18 and another at primary school . Her family said : `` Our whole family is absolutely devastated and we are doing everything we can to support Jacqueline 's two sons and her partner . `` Jacqueline has been ill in hospital for a number of weeks but nothing can prepare you for such shattering news . '' Alex Salmond , the Scottish secretary , and Nicola Sturgeon , the Scottish health secretary , were joined by Ed Balls , the UK government 's children , schools and families secretary , in sending the family condolences . A family friend said the death was a tragedy . `` I think they are taking it really badly , '' she said . `` They hoped she was going to pull through and it was a shock when she died . She was a really nice lady , really kind , a quiet woman , just a family person really . '' Fleming was one of 10 people in hospital with swine flu in Scotland , where hospitalisation rates are the same as in the United States , the second worst affected country . The total UK figure jumped to 1,320 today , with a further 59 cases in England , chiefly in the West Midlands . However , Sir Liam Donaldson , the chief medical officer for England and Wales , said the virus was causing very few illnesses compared with normal seasonal flu viruses , although a `` large surge '' in numbers was likely this autumn . With more than 30,000 people affected worldwide , the World Health Organisation reported last Friday that only 145 had died . Pregnant women were more vulnerable to this particular virus , Donaldson added . `` If we look at the pattern of this illness worldwide , generally for most people it has n't been a severe illness , '' he said . `` In a bad seasonal flu winter we would get between 400,000 to 500,000 people falling ill with flu . '' Professor Hugh Pennington , a bacteriologist at Aberdeen University , said that swine flu deaths were not unexpected . `` It does not point to the virus getting nastier . All the evidence to date suggests the virus is not changing at all , '' he said . `` This is a flu virus , it is in no way different from an ordinary winter flu virus , so if there are enough cases some people will have to be admitted to hospital and some will die .

Vets and scientists have apparently demonstrated in an experiment at a UK research center that the H1N1 virus responsible for the global pandemic in people readily transfers to the animals . Animal and public health specialists remain cautious about the consequences of their findings , which they describe as `` preliminary '' , saying firm conclusions can not be drawn . Despite its name , there are no known cases of people infected in the present swine flu crisis catching the illness from pigs or other animals , but there has been a case in Canada where pigs are thought to have caught the flu from a carpenter returning from Mexico . However , swine flu is caused by a virus that usually infects pigs , and the animals are among those generally considered most likely to act as mixing vessels for different strains of flu that could turn into highly contagious diseases . The experiment , a cross-EU venture conducted at the government 's veterinary labs in Weybridge , Surrey , involved infecting a group of pigs with a virus strain from an infected person in North America . Early analysis of the experiment suggests not only that the pigs are susceptible to the virus but that it transmits to other pigs , the team reports in a letter to the Veterinary Record journal . Defra , the government department responsible for the agricultural monitoring against swine flu in pigs , said : `` These findings reinforce existing guidance to pig keepers -LRB- or anyone else coming into contact with pigs -RRB- that they should stay out of contact with pigs if they have flu-like symptoms and should continue to practice high levels of hygiene . `` There is no evidence that this strain of influenza virus is -LRB- otherwise -RRB- present in pigs in this country . We continue to take the situation very seriously and will maintain our surveillance effort , keeping the public and industry informed of any developments .

Scottish ministers announced last week that GPs were to be allowed to diagnose the virus at their surgeries , rather than rely on lab tests . The number of cases soared to 498 by the weekend , followed on Sunday by the first death of someone with swine flu outside the Americas . The victim , Jacqui Fleming , 38 , from Carnwadric , Glasgow , also had underlying health problems . After doctors reported 351 cases in Glasgow and Paisley yesterday a dramatic increase on previous daily results doubts emerged about the accuracy of their diagnoses . This evening , the Scottish government confirmed that further analysis of these results suggested a large majority of these were wrong . As a result , every suspected case of H1N1 swine flu will now be checked by laboratories before being announced . The reverse in policy will be studied carefully by health officials in Birmingham . They said today that efforts to control swine flu in the city the worst affected in England were failing . Giving GPs the authority to diagnose the virus at their surgeries was one option being considered . Nicola Sturgeon , the Scottish health secretary , said : `` It is important that we have accurate figures to give us a true picture of how the virus is spreading . That is why we have resumed laboratory testing for all cases in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area . `` Clinical diagnosis has not proven to be as effective as originally thought . Further assessment is being carried out to assess the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis process . '' The official number of swine flu cases in Scotland increased by 22 to 530 today , and there were 110 new cases in England , taking the UK total to 1,604 . "}]
