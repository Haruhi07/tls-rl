It later sank with the presumed loss of 11 lives . Photograph : Gerald Herbert\\/AP Underwater robots dived to the ocean floor yesterday in a new effort to staunch the 42,000 gallons of oil a day being pumped into the Gulf of Mexico in America 's worst offshore oil rig spill in 40 years . The robots will attempt to activate a blowout preventer , a 450-tonne valve on the ocean floor that offers the only timely option for stemming the flow . With the oil now coating 1,800 square miles of water , BP officials acknowledge it could take months to entirely contain two separate leaks from the wrecked oil rig . The US coastguard discovered the leaks on Saturday , two days after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig leased by BP sank off the coast of Louisiana . The rig was destroyed in an explosion last Tuesday , with 11 workers missing and presumed dead . What initially seemed a manageable spill is now rated by the US coastguard as a serious environmental problem , with 1,000 barrels of oil a day being pumped into the Gulf of Mexico , an area rich with dolphins , whales and other marine life . Three sperm whales have been sighted in the area of the slick , officials said yesterday . The spill , which occurred just as senators were preparing to roll out energy and climate proposals , has deepened debate about America 's energy policies . In an effort to win support for the proposals , Barack Obama had come out in favor of more oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico . High winds and big waves forced clean-up vessels , which have been trying to skim the oil from the surface of the water before it washes up on shore , to remain in port at the weekend . But Mary Landry , the coast guard commander , insisted the four states that lie in the path of the slick would have ample warning to protect fragile wetlands . Forecasts suggest the oil will make landfall on Thursday . The plan put into operation yesterday called for four underwater robots to dive 1,500 metres -LRB- 5,000 ft -RRB- below the surface of the water to try to activate the gargantuan system of pipes and valves that sits next to the well on the ocean floor . BP said it was the first time such an operation had been mounted at this depth . `` It is a slow process , '' said Ron Rybarczyk , a spokesman at the command center in Louisiana . `` If you can visualise it , it 's like robotic arms doing something outside the space station . It is operating something with a mechanical claw on it that grasps things and turns things and adjusts equipment way down at the floor of the ocean . '' BP also admits that the robots may not be successful . Doug Suttles , the chief operating officer of BP 's exploration unit , said activating the blowout preventer was a highly complex task in part because it remains unclear whether the valve is working . The valve should have stopped the leak at the outset . `` The issue we have is that we do n't know the condition inside that blowout valve , '' he said . The laborious effort is by far the quickest means available for capping the leak . Another option being pursued would be to lower a giant , upside-down funnel to the ocean floor , which would collect the escaping oil and divert it to a barge or a pipeline . That too would be a first the method has only been deployed in shallow waters and it would take time . Rybarczyk noted the device would have to be custom-built , though he did not give an estimate of how long that would take . BP is also pursuing a more traditional fix , which would involve drilling relief wells nearby . Suttles said the first rig was due to arrive in the Gulf last night . The last spill from an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico of similar magnitude took more than 10 months to contain , said Dagmar Schmidt Etkin , president of Environmental Research Consulting . But that was more than 40 years ago , and technology has advanced since then . But she warned cleaning up after this accident would also prove challenging , especially if there continue to be stormy seas . Collecting such thin surface deposits is an inefficient process . `` Even under the best circumstances you might get 10 % -25 % at most and that is when the weather is co-operative , '' she said . `` That is really pushing it . '' As of yesterday morning , the crews have retrieved about 1,152 barrels of an oil-and-water mix , BP said . Louisiana , which is in the most immediate path of the slick as it moves north , has been putting in place containment booms to try to keep the oil away from fisheries and wetlands . `` With this kind of concentration coming in one particular location like that you could have some localized toxic impacts on fish and fish eggs , '' said Etkins . So long as the oil stays offshore , the greatest threat is to fish and fish eggs , which could affect future populations . But if it hits the coast , it could damage wildlife and commercial shrimp and crab operations .

The energy giant reported profits of $ 5.6 bn -LRB- # 3.6 bn -RRB- in the first three months of 2010 , up from $ 2.4 bn a year ago . Analysts had expected a figure of around $ 4.8 bn on a replacement cost profit basis , which strips out fluctuations in the value of oil inventories . The unexpectedly large jump in earnings was mainly thanks to BP 's exploration and production arm , which benefited from oil prices of up to $ 84 a barrel during the quarter . In early 2009 the oil price fell below $ 33 a barrel . The rally over the last year has helped oil producers , but hurt motorists who are now facing record petrol prices at the pumps .

The spillage could create an even bigger environmental disaster than the 1989 Exxon Valdez tanker spill . Photograph : Gerald Herbert\\/AP Shares in BP plunged 7 % today as investors panicked about speculation that the blowout on a rig in the Gulf of Mexico could create an even bigger environmental disaster than the Exxon Valdez tanker spill . Fund managers and analysts in the City said they were deeply worried about the financial cost to BP of the kind of legal action that could be taken in the US by those damaged by the accident . Over # 13bn has so far been knocked off the oil company 's stock market value since the Transocean Deepwater Horizon rig caught fire and the latest dive in value came after it acknowledged the amount of oil leaking from sub-sea wells could be 5,000 barrels a day five times more than previously thought . The City of London was alive with rumors that the spill could even reach 10,000 barrels , according to one oil analyst who asked not to be named : `` We have also heard that the state of Louisiana is threatening to sue the company , '' he added . A spokesman at BP headquarters in London said the share price fall was `` related to the US incident '' but it denied any knowledge of any legal cases being prepared at this time or that 10,000 barrels could be pouring from the stricken well . `` There is no way of accurately measuring how much oil is coming out because all the equipment was destroyed on the rig but the 5,000 figure is coming from the NOAA -LRB- the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -RRB- , '' he added . The incident is particularly damaging for BP because the British group is still recovering from the reputational damage wreaked on it by the Texas City fire , pipeline fractures in Alaska and a previous rig accident in the Gulf . The financial damage to BP this time round will depend on how quickly it can cap the Macondo well and clean up the spill before it reaches the beaches of the US mainland . BP is hoping a plan to cover the well with a steel cap and capture the leaking oil might avert an environmental disaster . However , this will take four weeks to put in place , by which stage over 150,000 barrels could have been spilt . If the steel cap does not work , BP will have to rely on stemming the flow by drilling a relief well , which would take two to three months . By that stage , the spill could be over 300,000 barrels larger than the 258,000 barrels leaked in 1989 by the Exxon Valdez in the US 's worst oil spill to date . However , a BP spokesman said the environmental damage from and cost of tackling the leak from the Macondo well would not be in the same range as the Exxon Valdez tragedy , which happened close to shore in the narrow Prince William Sound in Alaska . Exxon spent $ 3.5 bn cleaning up the Valdez spill and had hundreds of millions of dollars in damages awarded against it .

Coastguard Rear Admiral Mary Landry said National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration -LRB- NOAA -RRB- experts now estimate that 5,000 barrels a day of oil are spilling into the gulf far more than the previous estimate of 1,000 barrels a day . Robot submarines have so far failed to shut off the flow , 1,500 m -LRB- 5,000 ft -RRB- below the surface , but the coastguard said a test burn on an isolated area of the spill was successful . The revision came after a new leak was discovered and strong winds were forecast which NOAA said would push the oil towards the US shoreline . However Doug Suttle , chief operating officer for BP , disputed the new estimates yesterday , pointing to a diagram that plotted the leaks and saying he did not believe the amount of oil spilling into the water was higher than earlier approximations . Landry stuck to the NOAA estimate and said it was based on aerial surveys , study of the trajectory of the oil slick and other factors . Landry added that the US president , Barack Obama , had been briefed on the revised estimate , and said the government had offered to have the defense department help contain the spill and protect the US shoreline and wildlife . Both Landry and BP said the first test burn had been successful , although neither gave any indication as to when further burns were planned . Crews had planned to use a 150m fire-resistant boom to collect several thousand gallons of the thickest oil on the surface , tow it to a remote area , set it on fire , and allow it to burn for about an hour . When the flames go out hardened tar is left in the water , which can be removed using nets or skimmers . The oil spill response team had recovered 16,311 barrels -LRB- 2.5 m litres -RRB- of an oil-water mix , and 69 response vessels were being used , the company added . `` We are attacking this spill on all fronts , bringing into play all and any resources and advanced technologies we believe can help , '' said Tony Hayward , BP chief executive . `` Our action plan is safety-focused , multi-layered and has the full resources of the BP Group behind it . '' He added : `` The scale of the surface response is truly unprecedented , both for BP and for the oil industry . '' BP said it had begun preparations to drill a relief well , approximately half a mile from the main well , however NOAA said this would not be complete for several months . NOAA said workers had finished fabricating the containment chamber of a `` collection dome '' which would be used to collect oil as it escaped from the well . `` Work will now begin on the piping system that brings the oil to the surface for collection ; this method has never been tried at this depth before , '' the organization said . It said evaluations were under way to assess the damage caused by the oil to fish , marine mammals and sensitive resources , and warned the spill was on the move . `` Winds are forecast to become strong -LRB- 20 + knots -RRB- and blow from the south-east starting tomorrow and continuing through the weekend , which will continue to push surface oil towards shore , '' NOAA said . BP said costs for containing the spill were running at $ 6m -LRB- # 3.9 m -RRB- a day , and it would spend a further $ 100m drilling the relief well . Industry officials say replacing the Deepwater Horizon , which was owned by Transocean Ltd but operated by BP , would cost up to $ 700m .

Ed Pilkington in Empire , Louisiana reports Oil spill now threatening wildlife along Louisiana 's fragile islands and barrier marshes . Photograph : AP When Tom Reddoch was growing up in southern Louisiana , on a pencil-thin strip of land flanked on one side by the Mississippi and on the other by a marshy inland waterway , he and his friends used to brag to each other that this was the greatest place on Earth . Children had different expectations back in the 1950s : what they meant was that they would never go hungry . `` The one thing we could be certain of is that we would never starve down here . In those days , this was one great protein factory . '' Fishing and oyster harvesting was easy , as the nutrient-rich swirl of the freshwater Mississippi and the sea spawned wildlife in endless abundance . But over the course of his lifetime , Reddoch has seen about 70 % of that extraordinary biodiversity fade away through the combined onslaught of overfishing , the laying of oil pipelines and man-made diversions to the Mississippi . Now the region which includes nearly half of America 's wetlands faces its greatest threat of all , one which , Reddoch fears , could kill off what little environmental riches are left . `` This could be the coup de grace . It could be the last blow , '' he says . All along this levee-lined spit of land that stretches from just south of New Orleans down to Venice a fishing and oil town which , as the name implies , stands on the seafront people are bracing themselves for the arrival of what could become the worst environmental disaster the US has ever seen . About 50 miles offshore from Venice is the site of Deepwater Horizon , the oil drilling rig operated by BP that exploded on 20 April , leading to the disappearance and presumed death of 11 workers and the spewing of up to 5,000 barrels of oil a day into the sea . Unless BP succeeds in plugging three leaks some 5,000 ft -LRB- 1,500 metres -RRB- undersea , the disaster will within a matter of weeks exceed even the 1989 Exxon Valdez catastrophe off the coast of Alaska . With the oil being pushed into fragile marshland around Venice by strong winds this morning , Louisiana declared a state of emergency and the Obama administration declared it a spill of `` national significance '' . For the residents of Empire , a small fishing town about two-thirds of the way down the spit , this is a spill of personal significance . `` I 'll show you what this means for us , '' says Clark Fontaine , the owner of a wooden seafood shack on the side of the main road that has a dilapidated hoarding outside advertising `` L VE CRAWF H '' . `` Look at these guys ! '' He holds up a handful of plump shrimp , about four inches in length . The creatures are gray in color , and several have an orange stripe along their backs . `` That 's the eggs they will lay in the marshes that will produce our next crop in August . If we lose these shrimp , then we lose our living for the rest of the year . '' Mark Franobich has already lost his main income . He works as a diver mechanic in the oilfields in the Gulf of Mexico , and has just been told that all operations have been shut down until further notice in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon explosion . He now relies on selling timber for firewood from his backyard . `` It was just a matter of time before something like this happened . Everyone around here is dependent on fishing : generations upon generations of them . It 's all they know . '' Nobody knows precisely when the oil slick will strike them hard . Surface deposits have already been spotted being driven into the grassy marshes along the coast , but how quickly it will move up the Mississippi and spread through the inland waterway is unclear . In the docks at Empire a row of oyster boats sit idle , unable to go to sea because of the high winds that are whipping up 8ft waves , thus hampering the oil clean-up . A Mexican crew is doing odd jobs on board the Lady Marija . `` We do n't know when the oil is going to arrive , '' says Silvestre Frias , speaking in Spanish . `` What we do know is that when it does , it will shut down everything . '' The Lady Marija brings in about $ 10,000 -LRB- # 6,500 -RRB- worth of oysters a week , supporting the five crew and the ship 's owner . `` Yes , we 're scared . There will be no work for any of us , '' he says . Reddoch estimates the oil will reach disaster levels as far up the spit as Empire by Sunday at the latest . And that , he says , will have huge consequences for himself and the wider community . Reddoch 's small business , Down South Services , has two main contracts . The first is to do maintenance work on a nearby fish factory called Menhadden Fisheries , where he employs about 50 workers through the summer . The factory processes small sardines known locally as Menhadden , which produce some of the highest-grade fish oil in the world . The oil finds its way into Omega-3 vitamin supplements , paint , cosmetics , and even lubricant for the space shuttle . The plant opened its doors just last week for the 2010 season , and receives up to eight boats a day , each laden with sardine catches worth up to $ 1m . `` Think about that for a second when it 's cooking , that 's a lot of business ; and all of that will be lost , '' Reddoch says . Down South Services ' other main contract is , fortuitously enough , to provide labor in cases of oil spillages . He is laying on men to work the booms that are being used to try to prevent the oil coming on land , and once it does his employees will be cleaning up the beaches , marshes and ships . So what he 's lost with one hand , he 's gained with the other . `` That 's what you call diversification , '' he says , adding that it gives him no pleasure to make money out of the final destruction of his childhood paradise .

Photograph : Liz Condo\\/AP Soon after taking over in 2007 , BP 's newly appointed chief executive told an audience of business students at Stanford University that he thought too many people at the company were `` trying to save the world '' . Tony Hayward 's comments were intended to set the tone for his tenure at the helm of Britain 's third largest company , but those words have returned to haunt him this week as BP struggles to contain one of the darkest chapters in its history . His speech went down well . Hayward 's focus on core values on oil and gas as the only credible source of long-term profit was a welcome relief to industry observers . His predecessor had made worrying statements about BP becoming an `` energy company '' , able to exploit the anticipated growth in clean technology to deliver a business model suited to a carbon-constrained world . An attractive green logo had been unveiled , the words `` Beyond petroleum '' inserted elegantly beneath . Fast forward to 2010 , and BP 's alternative energy division has been left to wither on the vine . The solar business is a distant memory and this year the company has allocated less than a billion dollars to its entire low carbon portfolio , now mainly comprised of biofuels . In contrast , the company is planning to spend 20 times this amount extracting oil and gas from increasingly unconventional sources including the tar sands of Canada . The success of this strategy relies on acquiescence by political leaders in the countries in which BP operates . Under George Bush the need for lobbying muscle was minimal , but since the arrival of a new president in the White House , BP has poured millions into Washington , mainly through third-party lobby groups . Organisations such as the American Petroleum Institute , funded in part by BP , have done the company 's dirty work for them . Supposedly spontaneous citizen demonstrations against climate legislation have sprung up around the US , before journalists revealed they were actually populated by employees of the oil companies themselves . The climate bill that had , until recently , a sliver of Republican support paid a heavy price for this cross-party endorsement in terms of funding for a series of environmentally dubious projects . The most controversial concession now looks almost certain to be reconsidered the opening up of America 's coastal waters to offshore drilling . As officials in Louisiana begin to face the reality of the spill that has now reached their fragile coastline , many will be asking if BP did everything in its power to prevent this kind of accident . Reports this week suggest that last year a senior BP executive lobbied against mandatory safety codes for offshore drilling , arguing that the regulation would be too onerous and would slow down the construction of new rigs . Industry pressure had the desired effect , but it will be up to accident investigators to decide if a code could have helped avoid the initial explosion last week . What BP will never admit , among their glossy corporate brochures and extensive environmental assessments , is that its entire business model is predicated on an ever increasing demand for oil , decades into the future . These growth predictions rely on a world in which there is no collective action to tackle global emissions , no concerted effort to transfer clean technology to the developing world , and almost no chance of maintaining anything like a stable climate . As more oil drifts towards the critical wetlands of the Mississippi delta , we must hope that the more thoughtful members of BP 's board will now feel obliged to question the wisdom of a strategy that is , at its core , unchanged since the opening decades of the 20th century . Time for a ban .

As several coastal states declared a state of emergency and dispatched clean-up crews , BP was desperately trying to stem the flow of crude from its damaged offshore platform and to snuff out a growing political storm that has wiped billions of pounds off its share price . President Barack Obama tonight sent officials from the US department of justice to monitor the company 's handling of the crisis , while lawyers acting for victims of two earlier BP disasters in the US called for criminal charges and a ban on its activities there . Fadel Gheit , an oil analyst at Oppenheimer & Co in New York , said the ultimate costs of dealing with the slick could rival that of the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska , which led to $ 3.5 bn in clean-up costs and $ 5bn in legal and financial settlements . `` This is a real pickle it 's a really challenging one . It 's going to be difficult to choke off this spew of oil . Any solution is going to take time and I really think the cost here is going to be in the billions of dollars , '' he said . Eleven offshore workers are missing , presumed dead , after the initial explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig last week , and BP was also severely reprimanded by safety authorities for a pipeline leak in Alaska and fatal refinery explosion . The scale of the legal backlash facing BP was outlined by Brent Coon & Associates , an American law firm that played a large role in bringing cases against BP for the Texas City refinery fire in 2005 . Today it filed a lawsuit on behalf of a rig worker injured in last week 's blast , and argued that criminal charges should be brought against the company for its repeated failure to act after a series of industrial accidents in the US . `` They do n't learn their lessons , they are the most arrogant bunch of bastards I 've ever dealt with , '' said lawyer Brent Coon . `` It 's like they just do n't care . At some point , we are going to have to put some of these executives in jail and withdraw their right to exploit our natural resources . '' The chief executive of BP , Tony Hayward , said the firm , which has seen # 12bn wiped off its share price since the accident , would do all it could to clean up and pay compensation . `` We are taking full responsibility for the spill and we will clean it up and where people can present legitimate claims for damages we will honor them . We are going to be very , very aggressive on all of that , '' he said . A BP spokesman said it was too early to say what had gone wrong or if anyone was responsible until investigations had been completed . He pointedly referred to Transocean , the owner of the stricken rig , as having responsibility for many aspects of the drilling and declined to comment on any criminal or other legal claims . The British oil company had outperformed its peers on the stock market last year , with a 24 % increase in valuation on the back of a recovery plan implemented by Hayward . He had been forced to introduce what was thought to be much tighter controls of operations in the aftermath of accidents such as the Texas City fire in which 15 died and 180 were injured which led to the premature departure of his predecessor , John Browne . Some believe BP had not been forgiven by some US politicians for lightning takeover raids in the 1990s that saw Lord Browne seize control of key US companies such as Amoco and Arco in quick succession . But the Texas City fire gave the political establishment strong grounds for criticism after regulators damned the company for poor safety practices . Gheit said the Deepwater spill was a `` gamechanger '' for BP . `` It took five years for Exxon shares to shrug off the effect of the Exxon Valdez and only seabirds and otters lost their lives in that incident . With the Deepwater Horizon we are talking about eleven workers missing and after Texas City , Alaskan pipeline fractures and other incidents people are going to say there is something systematic here , '' he argued . Shrimp fishermen in Louisiana are also reported to have filed a class action against BP and others involved in the Gulf drilling accident , although a company spokesman said he could not confirm this . The gathering political storm was evident when David Axelrod , a senior adviser to Barack Obama , said BP would pay for the clean-up , adding that no new oil drilling would be authorised unless proper safeguards were proven to be in place . Tonight Alabama governor Bob Riley declared a state of emergency , saying the oil spill posed `` a serious threat to our environment and economy '' . His declaration followed similar actions taken by the governors of Louisiana and Florida . Meanwhile , Louisiana coastguard officials said an oil drilling rig on its way to a scrapyard had overturned in an inland waterway , but that no injuries or fuel leaks had been reported .

The British oil and gas group , still bitterly remembered for the 2005 Texas City refinery explosion that killed 15 and for environmentally damaging pipeline leaks in Alaska , is reaching out to Louisiana communities , establishing town hall meetings and places for volunteers to enrol . It is also working with the local shipping community to make sure as many vessels as possible are available to help with the response effort . BP 's chief operations officer , Doug Suttles , denied that the company was not doing enough , insisting the response effort was `` the largest ever mobilised '' . Meanwhile , BP America 's chairman , Lamar McKay , told ABC News that the accident was caused by failed equipment , adding : `` We do n't know why it failed yet . '' The cost to BP is $ 6m -LRB- # 4m -RRB- a day , including attempts to cap the well , activate the cut-off valves known as the `` blowout protector '' , and to disperse the expanding slick . Independent estimates have put the final bill at between $ 3bn and $ 12bn . McKay said that efforts to trigger the blowout preventer were like carrying out `` open heart surgery at 5,000 feet in the dark with robot-controlled submarines '' . Tony Hayward , BP chief executive , has stressed BP accepts its role as `` responsible party '' for the clean-up and has pledged to cover all `` legitimate and objectively verifiable '' losses caused by the disaster . Yet BP is privately seeking to draw a distinction between the Texas City tragedy , where it was found directly responsible , and the Deepwater disaster , where Swiss firm Transocean was drilling on its behalf . While the cause of the leak remains unclear , speculation centres on two areas : the `` cementing '' process to secure the well walls work that contractor Halliburton insists was completed 20 hours before the accident and the `` blowout protector '' . The equipment , supplied by US firm Cameron International , `` is the ultimate failsafe mechanism '' , Hayward said . `` And for whatever reason , it failed to operate .

An exploration plan and environmental impact analysis for the well , produced by the company in 2009 , concluded that it was virtually impossible for there to be a giant crude oil spill from it . Now City experts say that the accident could cost the company up to $ 8bn -LRB- # 5.23 bn -RRB- to clear up the slick . The US Coast Guard has estimated that 6m litres of oil has already spilled into the waters of the Gulf of Mexico since an explosion destroyed the rig on 20 April , killing 11 workers . A further 800,000 litres is thought to be pouring from the stricken well every day , threatening to turn the accident into the worst US oil disaster since the Exxon Valdez in Alaska in 1989 . Yesterday , a slick 130 miles long and 70 miles wide was being swept towards the ecologically vulnerable coastlines of Louisiana and Mississippi . Yet BP 's plan for the Deepwater Horizon well , filed with the federal Minerals Management Service , repeatedly said that it was `` unlikely that an accidental surface or subsurface oil spill would occur from the proposed activities '' . The company conceded that a spill would have an impact on beaches , wildlife refuges and wilderness areas , but argued that `` due to the distance to shore -LRB- 48 miles -RRB- and the response capabilities that would be implemented , no significant adverse impacts are expected '' . The revelation that BP had apparently underestimated the dangers posed by the rig brought outraged responses from local activists . `` If you 're going to be drilling in 5,000 ft of water for oil , you should have the ability to control what you 're doing , '' said Robert Wiygul , an Ocean Springs , Mississippi-based environmental lawyer . This point was backed by Chris Frid , professor of marine biology at Liverpool University . `` The way to deal with an accident like this is to hit the oil with dispersants as soon as it starts bubbling up to the surface , '' he said . `` Once it has been in the sea for a few days , it becomes more difficult to break up into small particles that can then be degraded by bacteria . `` But that has not happened . Either insufficient dispersants were available or there was a lack of co-ordination among those dealing with the spillage . Either way , there has been a ludicrous delay . '' For its part , BP has claimed that the events leading to the rig 's destruction had no parallel . `` The sort of occurrence a blowout at this depth is clearly unprecedented , '' said a spokesman . Crews have struggled for days without success to activate the well 's underwater shut-off valve using remotely operated vehicles . They also are drilling a relief well in hopes of injecting mud and concrete to seal off the leak , but that could take three months . The prospect of oil pouring into the gulf for such a period could have horrifying effects on wildlife , added Frid . `` That part of the gulf 's coastline consists of a sedimentary shore with lots of muddy inlets . The oil will penetrate into the mud , and because it contains no oxygen the oil will not biodegrade . For generations , any disturbance of the sediment will bring oil back to the surface and that will happen over a very large area . '' Similar fears were also stressed by Jane Lubchenco , head of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , after she took part in a conference call with the governors of the gulf states on Friday . `` There is very deep concern about what is happening , '' she added . To date , most efforts to deal with the growing slick have failed . Rough seas and strong winds have blocked efforts to burn off the oil or hold it in check with inflatable booms strung along the coast . Louisiana officials have opened gates in the Mississippi river in the hope that a flood of fresh water would drive oil away from the coast , but the high winds also thwarted that plan . Meanwhile the Pentagon has deployed two C-130 cargo planes to spray chemicals on the oil , while the Louisiana National Guard has been deployed to help local communities . The cost of dealing with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill could reach up to $ 12.5 bn , according to City analysts , with BP 's share totalling $ 8bn . Neil McMahon of Bernstein Research estimated a total of $ 7.5 bn for the clean-up and subsequent damages , with another $ 5bn for losses suffered by the fishing and tourist industries in the area . BP owns 65 % of the licence , so would pay the bulk of this figure . BP is currently spending $ 6m a day on the clean-up but this is likely to rise to at least $ 10m a day , according to Bank of America\\/Merrill Lynch analysts , and could go on for six months . On top of that , the company is drilling two intervention wells at a total cost of about $ 300m .

Its 2009 revenues of $ 239bn are enough to rank BP as the third-largest corporation in the country . It spends aggressively to influence US policy and regulatory oversight . In 2009 , the company spent nearly $ 16m on lobbying the federal government , ranking it among the 20 highest spenders that year , and shattering its own previous record of $ 10.4 m set in 2008 . In 2008 , it also spent more than $ 530,000 on federal elections , placing it among the oil industry 's top 10 political spenders . This money has bought BP great access and , many would argue , leniency . `` I personally believe that BP , with its corporate culture of greed over profits , murdered my parents , '' Eva Rowe testified before Congress in 2007 . The Congress was investigating the worst workplace accident in the US in more than 15 years , a massive explosion at BP 's Texas City Refinery in March 2005 that killed 15 workers , including Rowe 's parents , and injured 180 . The US Chemical Safety Board , an independent federal agency , investigated the blast and released a devastating indictment of BP . `` The Texas City disaster was caused by organisational and safety deficiencies at all levels of the BP corporation , '' the 2007 report found . `` The combination of cost-cutting , production pressures and failure to invest caused a progressive deterioration of safety at the refinery . '' While experiencing its highest profits in its corporate history , BP implemented budget cuts of 25 % in 1999 and 2005 at each of its five US refineries . The safety board found a pervasive `` complacency towards serious safety risks '' at all of them . When the next great explosion at a US oil workplace occurred , it was of little surprise to learn that it was , again , BP at fault . It also came as little surprise that the location was the deep offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico . BP and the entire oil industry have lobbied aggressively to open new US waters to offshore drilling and expand the access they already had . For decades , the vast majority of drilling from the US Gulf took place on simple scaffolds in 30ft to 200ft of water . In the past 10 years , the number of rigs drilling in depths of greater than 1,000 ft -LRB- deep wells -RRB- has risen dramatically , as have ultra-deep wells , those greater than 5,000 ft. . The trend is problematic for many reasons , including that drilling of water depths greater than 500ft releases methane , a greenhouse gas 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide in the contribution to global warming . Many of the shallower fields have dried up , and the industry has become ever more flush with cash -LRB- in 2009 , for the first time in history , seven of the 10 largest corporations in the world were oil companies -RRB- and more desperate for oil . As a result , the companies led by BP , the largest producer of oil in the US Gulf are breaking all records , pushing ever deeper and well past the point of technological know-how and safety . In September 2009 , BP drilled the deepest well ever at its Tiber field in the US Gulf at a depth of more than 35,000 ft -LRB- farther down than Mount Everest is up -RRB- . When it exploded , BP 's Deepwater Horizon Drilling rig was drilling at just over 18,000 ft deep . Anyone in the business will tell you that drilling at such depths is incredibly risky , even with the most conscientious oversight . As the Chevron Corporation writes on its website , `` Navigating uncertain weather conditions , freezing water and crushing pressure , deepwater drilling is one of the most technologically challenging ways of finding and extracting oil . '' In the words of Micky Driver , a Chevron spokesman : `` It 's lots of money , it 's lots of equipment , and it 's a total crapshoot . '' The entire oil industry , will continue to use its vast wealth unequalled by any global industry to escape regulation , restriction , oversight and enforcement . BP , now the source of the last two great deadly US oil industry explosions , has shown us that this simply can not be permitted . cents This article was amended on 8 May 2010 to correct the figure given for BP 's total revenues in 2009 from $ 327bn to $ 239bn .

Photograph : John Edwards\\/EPA Barack Obama will fly to Louisiana today to assess the threat to large stretches of the Gulf of Mexico from millions of gallons of crude oil that has spilled from the remains of a sunken offshore rig . One expert said that the slick had tripled in size in a day . Satellite images found the surface area of the spill from the Deepwater Horizon rig , which exploded on 20 April with the loss of 11 lives , had increased from about 1,150 sq miles on Thursday to around 3,850 sq miles by the end of Friday . `` The spill and the spreading is getting so much faster and expanding much quicker than estimated , '' said Hans Graber from Miami University , which analyzed the images . Sea currents could suck the sheen up the eastern coast , another expert said . But the head of an assessment team for oil spills cautioned that the imagery may be deceptive as satellites could not measure the thickness of the sheen . Efforts to stem the flow from the sea floor and remove oil from the surface by skimming it , burning it or by dispersing it with chemicals continued with little success . Adding to the gloomy outlook were warnings from experts that an uncontrolled gusher could create a nightmare scenario if the Gulf Stream current carries it toward the Atlantic . The Deepwater Horizon well is at the end of one branch of the Gulf Stream , the famed warm-water current that flows from the Gulf of Mexico to the north Atlantic . Several experts said that if the oil entered the stream , it would flow around the southern tip of Florida and up the eastern seaboard . `` It will be on the east coast of Florida in almost no time , '' Graber said . `` I do n't think we can prevent that . It 's more of a question of when rather than if . '' There is growing criticism that the government and BP should have done more to stave off the disaster , which cast a pall over the fragile environment and the region 's economy , still recovering from the devastation of 2005 's Hurricane Katrina . The coastguard conceded yesterday that it was nearly impossible to know how much oil has gushed since the explosion , after saying earlier it was at least 1.6 m gallons -LRB- 6m litres -RRB- equivalent to about 2 Olympic-sized swimming pools . Even at that rate , the spill should eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez incident as the worst US oil disaster in history in a matter of weeks . Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer for exploration and production , said the company and federal officials were preparing for the worst-case scenario . He was reluctant to describe what , exactly , a worst-case scenario would look like but if the oil gets into the Gulf Stream and is carried to the beaches of Florida , it stands to be an environmental and economic disaster of epic proportions . From land , the scope of the crisis was difficult to see . As of Saturday afternoon , only a light sheen of oil had washed ashore in some places . The real threat lurked offshore in a swelling , churning slick of dense , rust-coloured oil the size of Puerto Rico . From the endless salt marshes of Louisiana to the white-sand beaches of Florida , there is uncertainty and frustration over how the crisis got to this point and what will unfold in the coming days , weeks and months . BP has not said how much oil is beneath the Gulf seabed Deepwater Horizon was tapping , but a company official speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed reports that it was tens of millions of barrels .

Photograph : Mark Ralston\\/AFP\\/Getty Images Efforts to stem the oil leak have focused on a standard piece of drilling kit called a blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- . The BOP acts as an emergency cut-off that should prevent oil gushing from an open well head , as depicted in numerous films when prospectors strike it rich . The recent explosion caused a spill because the BOP failed to engage fully . It is proving so hard to fix because the BOP , and so the source of the leak , lies beneath more than a mile of water . Simon Boxall of the National Oceanography Centre said : `` Oil extraction from the deep sea is new and the technology used is at the cutting edge . Well head incidents on land or in the shallow North Sea are relatively easy to cap and the methods are tried and tested . At 1,500 metres the head is as easy to get to as if it were on the moon . The water pressures are huge and the logistics very complex . '' He added : '' BP are in the unfortunate position of having to pioneer ways of dealing with it which are new and untested and this will take weeks if not months . Many have asked why is n't there some form of safety valve or stopcock to turn the oil off . There was , and it is this that has gone . It is like the mains stopcock in the street for your house . If a water leak occurs in the house or in the driveway then you just turn off the mains stopcock while you deal with the problem . But what do you do when the mains stopcock breaks ? '' BP has used robot submarines to try to trigger the BOP , but their efforts seem to be failing . It could try to install a second BOP on top of the first , and to prepare , engineers are set to measure the pressure of the escaping oil . One drawback is that tampering with the faulty mechanism might increase oil flow . While oil continues to pour out , containment is the best strategy . BP has rushed to produce giant domes called cofferdams that it intends to place over the leaking well head , to isolate the oil from the surrounding sea . The plan would then be to pump the trapped oil and water mix into storage barges on the surface . It will take at least a week to fit these domes , and engineers are uncertain how they will perform at deep sea pressures . In the long term , the threat will only be removed by giving the pressurized oil in the tapped reservoir another escape route . BP has plans to drill another two wells , probably into the reservoir itself , to divert the oil from the leak . Experts say this could take months . In the meantime , oil that reaches the surface is being tackled with floating booms , burnt and treated with chemicals though much of this effort may be better for the television cameras than the environment . Martin Preston , senior lecturer in marine pollution at the University of Liverpool , said : `` I am not convinced that burning the oil is the right strategy to adopt because it can leave a very persistent residue that can be more resistant to natural breakdown and is also impossible to treat in other ways . Continuing to use chemical dispersants would be a better option .

Tony Hayward spent today on a charm offensive , meeting officials from the Obama administration and using US news networks to explain how the company is hoping to stem the flow of 5,000 barrels of oil a day that have been pumping unchecked into the sea since the rig exploded two weeks ago . But the case against the company is mounting . Questions have been raised about whether BP should have installed a secondary cut-off valve and why the company had not installed a so-called `` acoustic switch '' on the blowout preventer , which is on the seabed and designed to stop pressure from the oil well damaging the drilling rig , so it could be activated remotely . Fishermen , who are watching their livelihoods destroyed by the spreading oil slick , have been asking why the retaining booms that are supposed to hold back the oil were deployed so late and in too widely spread an area , while some environmental campaigners have complained that they are being kept away from the coastline as BP picks its own contractors to deal with the oil as it washes ashore . The choppy weather in the Gulf of Mexico has been pushing a mixture of oil and seawater over the hundreds of thousands of feet of floating booms which have been deployed over the past few days in an attempt to corral the oil so it can be contained and burnt . The weather forecast for later this week is fairer and the hope is that some of the oil could be burnt off towards the weekend , but by then thousands of gallons will have hit the shoreline . BP today started drilling or `` spudding '' a new relief well half a mile away from the site of the Deepwater Horizon . It will run its new well alongside the Deepwater 's excavations , down to 18,000 ft , in the hope that it can intercept the flow of oil and relieve pressure on the damaged wellhead . But it will take two to three months to get down to the right depth . In that time , half a million barrels of oil could have escaped 19m gallons or almost twice the amount that ravaged the coastline of Alaska 21 years ago when the Exxon Valdez ran aground . To stem the flow BP is hoping to lower a series of large tanks over the leaking well and the pipe that used to connect it with the now sunken rig . As part of its PR attempt , BP will tomorrow show the tanks it has been building in Port Fourchon , Louisiana , to local press before they are shipped out to the site , lowered , installed and then tested . They should be in place by the end of this weekend , though there is no certainty that they will work . Angry local residents argue they should never have been needed and are asking why BP did not fit the blowout preventer and acoustic switch . They are mandatory on wells offshore in Norway and Brazil and can be used to activate the sub-sea lock on the well , if the systems on the rig itself fail . A spokesman for BP said the US authorities mandate the ready availability of remote submarines in order to switch on the blowout preventer if it does not come into action automatically and they have had their subs working on trying to activate the device for the past 10 days . He added that an acoustic switch would not have helped because the blowout preventer itself was broken . `` This -LRB- acoustic switch -RRB- is a red herring , '' he said . `` In the US we have to have the ROVs -LRB- remote operated vehicles -RRB- , in other places like Norway they specify the acoustic switches ... there is a lot of noise around which we should have had but neither of them would have worked , we have now discovered , having done the days and days of ROV activity . '' There have also been questions raised as to why BP did not install emergency shutdown valves -LRB- ESVs -RRB- , which were ordered across the North Sea after the Piper Alpha disaster 22 years ago and are designed to stop the flow of oil and gas . Again , a spokesman for BP denied that they were appropriate . `` ESVs are something you would put down a producing well , one that was in production but that is not appropriate in this case because it is a discovery well , '' he said . `` That is what the blow-up preventer is designed to do , to stop any surge of pressure from the well while you are drilling . If it was a producing well , you would have a different version of that in some form . You can not install it -LRB- an ESV -RRB- while you are actually drilling . `` They -LRB- wells -RRB- are highly complex things , not just holes in the ground , and what you need for a discovery or exploration well is going to be very different from something that is going to be producing from a platform above it . '' As the oil washes ashore it is causing catastrophic environmental damage , yet local press along the Louisiana and Florida coasts report that some wildlife campaigners are being kept at bay as BP picks its own environmental clean-up providers . BP 's spokesman denied that . `` We have got freephone numbers for volunteers , '' he said . `` We have been signing up fishing boats , more than 700 , to help out . There has been a huge and very supportive response from the local community . Everyone is welcome .

Photograph : Sean Gardner\\/Reuters Shares in BP fell nearly 5 % this morning after the company warned that the cost of tackling the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico now exceeds $ 6m -LRB- # 4m -RRB- per day , and will keep rising as it intensifies its efforts to deal with the accident . The British energy giant told the stock market that it has begun drilling a ` relief well ' to try to isolate the original well which is still spewing 5,000 barrels of oil into the sea each day . This involves digging 13,000 feet below the seabed , and BP estimated today that this could take around three months . The company also said in a statement that , contrary to some reports , it has not managed to slow the flow of oil from the MC252 well . BP shares dropped to a low of 546p when trading in London began as City investors took their first opportunity to offload BP shares following the long weekend . This knocked more than # 5bn off last Friday 's market capitalization taking it to around # 102.5 bn . At the start of last week , the company was valued at # 122bn . With chief executive Tony Hayward due to meet US politicians and regulators in Washington later today , the company is attempting new ways to deal with the disaster . The latest idea is to inject dispersants directly into the oil flow close to the main leak : The technique is intended to efficiently mix the oil and dispersant , breaking up and dispersing accumulations of oil and allowing it to degrade naturally and reduce surface impact . The suggestion for this innovative technique came from the companies across the oil industry that BP approached last week for further ideas and expertise to help BP control the well and tackle the spill . BP also hopes to erect a steel canopy over the leak point , allowing it to corall the oil and then pump it to the surface . Depending on the weather , it may try to install a `` coffer dam '' in the middle of next week . It also continues to operate eight submersible robots in an effort to activate the blowout protector , which is meant to seal a well and stop oil leaking out . BP , which hired the Deepwater Horizon rig that caught fire and sank two weeks ago , said it continues to cover the cost of these various efforts , and warned shareholders that it does not know what the final bill will be : Whilst difficult to accurately estimate , the cost to the MC252 owners of the efforts to contain the spill and secure the well is currently estimated to be more than $ 6m per day . This figure is rising as activity increases . It is too early to quantify other potential costs and liabilities associated with the incident . Until BP can stop the oil leak , it will be impossible to estimate quite how badly this drama will play out . On a financial level , independent estimates have put the final bill at anywhere between $ 3bn and $ 12bn -LRB- # 2bn - # 7.8 bn -RRB- . In other City news this morning ...

The move came on a day when BP registered its first success in plugging one of the leaks from a well that is spewing 5,000 barrels a day -LRB- 795,000 litres or 175,000 imperial gallons -RRB- into the Gulf of Mexico . The action could help BP in its efforts to staunch the flow of oil before it hits the shore , but the potential for political fallout continues to loom large . `` Gulf : learn from Alaska 's lesson w\\/foreign oil co 's : do n't naively trust - VERIFY , '' Sarah Palin wrote on her Twitter page today . BP and the US government are under fire for failing to take adequate measures to prevent the 20 April explosion that caused the leak , or for anticipating the ensuing environmental catastrophe . The US coastguard had initially claimed there was no sign of leaking oil from the rig . A day after the Deepwater Horizon went down , Rear Admiral Mary Landry said : `` We have been able to determine that there is nothing emanating from the wellhead . '' Today , however , a coastguard spokesman said that Landry had been operating according to information supplied by BP , which had sent submersible robots down to the ocean floor . `` That was the information that was received by her , '' said David Moseley . `` We do n't have the capability to dive 5,000 feet -LRB- 1,500 metres -RRB- below the surface to do a survey . That type of equipment has to be brought in by BP or a responsible party to do a survey . '' The White House is acutely conscious of the potential political costs posed by the chaos . The Bush administration took a blow to its credibility in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , when officials were seen to be lackadaisical in their response . The timeline since the rig went down is the focus of investigations into the spill by Congress committees as well as the federal government . `` BP has been in control of all of this information and ultimately when the investigation is complete we will have to ask what did BP know and when did they know it , '' Ed Markey , who is leading the house committee on global warming and climate change , told MSNBC yesterday . Since the spill , environmental organizations have accused BP of repeated violations of safety and environmental regulations , and of using money power to try to avoid more stringent regulation . The Washington Post reported that the interior department did not carry out the routine environmental review on BP 's Deepwater Horizon operation after receiving assurances from the company that there was little risk of a cataclysmic spill . `` We have found in many , many instances over the years that the spiller initially says there is no spill or only a small spill , '' said Richard Chandler , a scientific adviser to Defenders of Wildlife . `` I have never seen a spill where estimates were not consistently revised upwards . '' BP said that robot submarines had managed for the first time to block one of the leaks from the well . The leak the smallest of at least three in some 1,500 metres of crumpled pipe lying on the ocean floor was sealed with a valve overnight yesterday . Officials say success will not reduce the gush of oil , but it could make it easier to maneuver equipment tomorrow aimed at encasing the oil and channelling it to a tanker . `` It does n't change the amount that is leaking but it allows BP to focus on two leaks instead of three , '' Moseley said . The website for the command center said that the device , a 100-tonne concrete-and-steel box contraption , could collect up to 85 % of the oil spewing from the ocean floor . It was loaded onto a barge today so it could begin its journey to the leak site about 50 miles off the Louisiana coast .

Illustration : Eric Gay\\/AP -LRB- This caption was amended on 6 May 2010 . The original caption sited Chandeleur Sound ` near Los Angeles ' . -RRB- Chemicals used to break up the Deepwater Horizon oil spill before it reaches shore could do lasting damage to the waters of the Gulf of Mexico , environmental scientists say . By BP 's own account , it has mobilised a third of the world 's supply of dispersant , so far pouring about 140,000 gallons -LRB- 637,000 litres -RRB- of the cocktail into the Gulf as of today . Some of the dispersant has been injected directly into the source of the spill on the ocean floor , a technique never deployed before , deepening concerns about further damage to the environment . The dispersants are designed to break down crude into tiny drops , which can be eaten up by naturally occurring bacteria , to lessen the impact of a giant sea of crude washing on to oyster beds and birds ' nests on shore . But environmental scientists say the dispersants , which can cause genetic mutations and cancer , add to the toxicity of the spill . That exposes sea turtles and bluefin tuna to an even greater risk than crude alone . Dolphins and whales have already been spotted in the spill . The dangers are even greater for dispersants poured into the source of the spill , where they are picked up by the current and wash through the Gulf . The high demand for dispersant carries an additional risk . As BP runs through stocks of the chemical , called Corexit , scientists fear it will fall back on older stockpiles in the developing world that are more toxic than those approved for use in the US . `` You are trying to mitigate the volume of the spill with dispersant , but the price you pay is increased toxicity , '' said Richard Charter , a scientific adviser to Defenders of Wildlife . `` There are no good answers in a mess of this size .

In that letter , dated Jan. 14 , 2010 , Reps. Henry Waxman , D-Calif . , and Bart Stupak , D-Mich . , noted that the company 's efforts to cut costs could imperil safety at BP facilities . Between September 2008 and November 2009 , three BP gas and oil pipelines on Alaska 's North Slope ruptured or clogged , leading to a risk of explosions , the letter said . A potentially cataclysmic explosion was also avoided at a BP gas compressor plant , where a key piece of equipment designed to prevent the buildup of gas failed to operate , and the backup equipment intended to warn workers was not properly installed . The letter was addressed to BP 's president of Alaskan operations , John Ming . The congressmen have been investigating BP 's safety and operations since 2006 , when a 4,800-barrel oil spill temporarily shut down the Prudhoe Bay drilling field pipeline . Neither Waxman nor Stupak returned calls for comment , and it was n't clear from the letter how they obtained the information . The pipeline problems were mentioned in trade and local press , but the compressor plant incident does not appear to have been previously reported . In 2006 , after a string of highly-publicized accidents , BP publicly committed to improving its safety record , and by many accounts it made progress . But this letter suggests concerns about the safety of BP operations persisted in the months leading up to the accident in the Gulf this April , which killed 11 workers and has lead to the largest U.S. oil spill in recent history . In the letter the congressmen say the '' serious safety and production incidents '' could affect the operation of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System , a `` vital energy security asset '' that supplies one fourth of the nation 's daily oil needs . BP announced strong profits on April 27 . According to a banking analyst report , the company benefited from having cut some 5,000 jobs and saving $ 4 billion in operating expenses . A BP spokesman in Alaska did not respond by the time of publication after requesting and receiving detailed questions from ProPublica . The revelation of the incidents comes as BP is battling to stop the 210,000 gallons of oil that are gushing each day from a broken well pipe into the waters of the Gulf . In that accident , a shut-off valve that Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer for exploration and production described Monday as `` failsafe , '' failed to close , and the company had not installed a remote control backup valve that also might have stopped the spill . According to the letter , in the most dangerous of the incidents last year in Alaska , safety backstops also failed . On Oct. 10 , 2009 , a staging valve stuck closed at a large central compressor station in Prudhoe Bay where gas is captured for re-injection back underground . According to the congressional letter , the blockage caused gas to back up on another series of valves . A backup flare meant to burn off that collection of gas was not lit at the time , and cameras , installed so BP staff could monitor the flare 's functions in real time , were not pointed in the right direction . There was no explosion ; the gas vented out before anything could ignite it . Robert Bea , a professor at University of California Berkeley 's department of civil and environmental engineering who has worked for both Shell and BP on Alaska 's North Slope , said the situation at the compressor station sounded like a ticking bomb . `` It 's hard to describe these explosions in terms that people can understand , '' he said . `` It would rival the biggest ones that we have ever had in the history of the oil and gas industry . '' Bea said a blast zone could reach 300 feet and leave a crater 90 feet wide . He likened the potential scenario to a gas valve error that led to the massive explosion of an offshore drilling platform called Piper Alpha in the North Sea in 1988 , in which 167 workers were killed . In a Sept. 29 , 2008 incident according to the congressional memo , a high pressure gas line blew apart without igniting , sending a 28-foot long piece of metal 900 feet through the air and spewing gas . `` Let 's just call them lucky , '' Bea said . `` Even the steel bouncing around can ignite sparks to erupt the gas . '' The letter stated that on Jan. 15 , 2009 a cleaning pig -- a bullet-shaped device that runs diagnostics inside the pipeline -- got stuck and let large amounts of gas leak into a pump station . And on November 29 , 2009 an 18-inch pipe carrying a mixture of oil , natural gas and waste water ruptured , spraying its flammable contents . BP has a recent history of disasters stemming from incomplete maintenance and faulty equipment , including the 2005 blast at a refinery in Texas City , Texas , where 15 workers died after a fuel tower was powered up without following protocol . Then there was the 2006 Alaskan pipeline spill , which occurred four years after BP had been warned about corroded pipelines . The company pleaded guilty to felony counts in the first incident and a misdemeanor charge in the second , tallying fines in excess of $ 62 million . The Committee on Energy and Commerce , now chaired by Waxman , has oversight authority for the Trans-Alaska pipeline . In congressional hearings after the 2006 Prudhoe Bay spill , BP management was accused of making `` draconian '' budget cuts that affected safety and health , including limiting the use of a corrosion inhibitor inside the pipeline , a step that could have prevented the deterioration that led to the 2006 spill . In his most recent letter , Waxman repeats the concern that the company is cutting corners . Last weekend BP 's CEO Tony Hayward told the BBC that the company 's latest spill in the Gulf had no relation to the past . `` I do n't think it 's a trend , '' he said . `` This has got nothing to do with what went on at Texas City . '' In a 2006 interview with this reporter after the refinery fire and Prudhoe Bay pipeline spill , BP America 's former CEO , Bob Malone , said `` I can not see a systemic problem in BP America .

The work should reduce the number of leak points that need to be fixed on the ocean floor , making it easier to drop a containment dome to bottle up the disastrous oil spill threatening sealife and livelihoods along the Gulf Coast . Since an explosion on 20 April , 50 miles off the coast of Louisiana , the Deepwater Horizon well has been spewing at least 800,000 litres a day . Experts say the best short-term solution is to drop a specially built giant concrete-and-steel box designed to siphon the oil away over the breach . Crews for Wild Well Control , a contractor , are putting the finishing touches on the 100-ton containment dome , which is expected to be taken to the leak site today . John Curry , a BP spokesman , said it would be deployed on the seabed by tomorrow . It 's the latest attempt by BP engineers to stem the oil from the rig , which killed 11 workers when it exploded . It sank two days later , and oil started pouring into the Gulf . BP is in charge of the cleanup and President Barack Obamasays the company is responsible for the costs . Officials said that capping one of the three leaks was a step towards stemming the flow . `` It does n't lessen the flow , it just simplifies the number of leak points they have to address , '' David Mosley , a coastguard petty officer 1st class , said . A rainbow sheen of oil has reached land in parts of Louisiana , but the gooey rafts of coagulated crude have yet to come ashore in most places . Forecasts showed the oil was n't expected to come ashore until at least tomorrow . `` It 's a gift of a little bit of time , I 'm not resting , '' said Mary Landry , a US coastguard rear admiral . In their worst-case scenario , BP executives told members of a congressional committee that up to 9.5 m litres a day could spill if the leaks worsened , though it would be more like 6.5 m litres . The worst oil spill in US history resulted from the 1989 grounding of the Exxon Valdez oil tanker in Alaska . It leaked nearly 11m gallons -LRB- 41 million litres -RRB- of crude . Containment domes have never been tried at this depth , about 5,000 ft -LRB- 1,500 m -RRB- because of the extreme water pressure . The dome , if all goes well , could be fired up early next week to start funnelling the oil into a tanker . It was not clear whether the equipment would work , said Bill Salvin , a BP spokesman . `` What we do know is that we have done extensive engineering and modelling , and we believe this gives us the best chance to contain the oil , and that 's very important to us . '' Yesterday seas calmed allowing more conventional methods to contain the spill to get back on track as businesses and residents kept an eye on the ocean currents , wondering when the sheen washing ashore might turn into a heavier coating of oil . Crews put out more containment equipment and repaired some booms damaged in rough weather over the weekend . They also hoped to again try to burn some of the oil on the water 's surface . Chemical dispersants piped 1,500 m to the main leak have significantly reduced the amount of oil coming to the surface , BP said . The company also hoped to shut off one of the smaller of three leaks , though it may not reduce the flow very much , said Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer . From the air yesterday , the site of the Deepwater Horizon explosion looked similar to a week ago , except for the appearance of a massive rig brought in to drill a relief well to shut off the spewing oil . However , that would take months . People along the Gulf Coast have spent weeks living with uncertainty , wondering where and when the oil may come ashore , ruining their beaches and their livelihoods . The anxiety is so acute that some are seeing and smelling oil where there is none . And even though the dead turtles and jellyfish washing ashore along the Gulf of Mexico are clean , and scientists have yet to determine what killed them , many are sure the flow of crude is the culprit . The rig was owned by Transocean . Some of the 115 surviving workers aboard when it exploded are suing the company and BP . In lawsuits filed yesterday , three workers say they were kept floating at sea for more than 10 hours , while the rig burned uncontrollably . They are seeking damages . Guy Cantwell , a spokesman for Transocean , defended the company 's response , saying 115 workers got off alive . Two wrongful death suits have also been filed . While officials worked on the cleanup , the long wait took its toll on the surrounding coastline . Perdido Key , a Florida barrier island between Pensacola and the Alabama state lined with sugar-white sand and studded with condominiums , could be the first place to be affected by the oil spill . `` You could smell it , real heavy petroleum base , '' said Steve Ownesby , 54 , a maintenance man at the Flora-Bama Lounge . The air cleared later , but Owensby 's 28-year-old daughter , Stephanie , who tends a bar at the lounge , said some visitors had complained of feeling ill from the fumes . `` It 's very sad because I grew up out here , '' she said . `` I remember growing up seeing the white beaches my whole life . Every day I 've been going to the beach a lot of people are out watching and crying .

The spill has set off a political backlash against the industry . Photograph : Daniel Beltra\\/Greenpeace\\/EPA The catastrophic spill in the Gulf of Mexico set off a backlash against the oil industry yesterday , with a demand for a ban on future offshore drilling . The anger came as BP executives admitted in a private briefing for members of Congress that the gusher on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico could reach 40,000 barrels a day eight times higher than the current estimate if they can not cap the flow . It also carries the risk of a financial sting , with the White House yesterday backing a proposal by senators that would put oil companies on the hook for up to to $ 10bn -LRB- # 6.5 bn -RRB- for the cost of a spill . The White House spokesman , Robert Gibbs , said the administration supported a proposal to make liability retroactive . The cap would be 133 times greater than the $ 75m bill that BP , which operated the Deepwater Horizon rig , faces under existing US laws following its explosion on 20 April . `` It 's time to believe our eyes and accept the obvious risks of drilling , '' Robert Menendez , a Democratic senator from New Jersey , told a press conference . `` This is about making Big Oil responsible for its excesses . '' Arnold Schwarzenegger , California 's governor , had arrived at a similar conclusion , reversing his support for expanded drilling to help the state 's $ 20bn budget crisis . `` You turn on the TV and see this enormous disaster ; you say to yourself , why would we want to take on that kind of risk ? '' he told a press conference . The spill does not appear to have forced a change of heart for the former governor of Alaska , Sarah Palin , who popularized the Republican `` drill , baby , drill '' slogan in the 2008 election . She told an audience in Kansas City that offshore drilling should continue . `` I want our country to be able to trust the oil industry . '' But BP and other oil firms face further intense scrutiny in Congress . Company officials briefed members of Congress in a closed session yesterday afternoon , with a public grilling scheduled for next week . BP 's position that there had been no need for a backup system for the blowout preventer , whose failure led to the multiple spills , came in for harsh criticism yesterday afternoon . `` I 'm of the opinion that boosterism breeds complacency , and complacency breeds disaster , '' said Ed Markey , who helped write the climate bill which passed in the house last year . `` That in my opinion is what happened . '' The backlash against oil firms is dangerous for Barack Obama , who angered many Democrats and environmentalists in March when he announced a plan to expand offshore drilling , seen as a ploy to win support in the Senate and from oil firms , for climate and energy legislation . But Bill Nelson , a Democratic senator from Florida , said that strategy would have to be abandoned . `` I will make it short and to the point , '' Nelson told reporters . `` The president 's proposal for offshore drilling is dead on arrival . '' And in a new advert , with images of a burning rig and oil-encrusted wildlife , the liberal Moveon.org group asks : `` President Obama , will you lead our country into a clean energy future ? Or will we see more of this ? '' The gulf explosion put the Obama administration on alert , scrambling to demonstrate full engagement with the spill , which threatens ecologically fragile areas from Louisiana through to Alabama and Mississippi and Florida , and could damage livelihoods of millions of people . After Obama 's visit to Louisiana at the weekend , the White House said a number of cabinet officials would return to the gulf coastline this week . The proposals unveiled by three senators yesterday would raise the legal cap on damages that oil firms must pay after a spill from $ 75m to $ 10bn . They would also do away with a $ 1bn per incident cap on an industry fund . The existing limits on liability are 20 years old , dating from the Exxon Valdez spill off Alaska . However , those limits do not apply if it is found that BP was negligent or had violated government regulations at the time the Gulf of Mexico rig exploded . Tony Hayward , BP 's chief executive , refused to comment on the proposal yesterday . He has said the company will bear the costs of the clean-up and any `` legitimate '' claims arising from those who have lost their livelihoods . `` We will absolutely be paying for the clean-up operation . There is no doubt about that . It 's our responsibility we accept it fully . '' He said the firm would also be prepared to pay individuals . `` Where legitimate claims are made , we will be good for them . '' But Menendez and others argue that $ 75m will not begin to pay for the lost livelihoods of shrimpers and others in the fisheries industries . `` We 're glad that the costs for the oil clean-up will be covered , but that 's little consolation to the small businesses , fisheries , and local governments , '' he said . Environmental activists are also looking closely at how to recover costs relating to the spill . To date , BP faces 20 lawsuits arising from the spill . In Mississippi , attention has focused on the high number of sea turtles washed up dead along the state 's beaches in the past three days . The Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Gulfport has done necropsies on the turtles , but the first round found no visible traces of oil . A spokeswoman said more examinations were being done on tissue samples to see if there were hydrocarbons at a microscopic level . Though experts have been struck by the large number of turtles , `` at least 31 in latest counts '' , they point out that now is the season when the animals come close to shore and can get caught in fishing nets and suffocate . Moby Solangi , director of the institute , said the heightened degree of public alertness in the wake of the oil crisis might also explain why more dead turtles were reported this year . BP said the oil slick was not expected to reach land for a few more days . `` It 's still offshore ... Right now we 're not showing landfall for three days , '' its chief operating officer Doug Suttles said yesterday .

More than $ 9bn will come from reputational damage as a result of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill while the total costs are likely to drive up its net equity to debt ratio to 35 % , much higher than its peers , according to Barclays Capital . The assessment came as BP chief executive Tony Hayward insisted the company would `` bounce back '' from the setback though he could not give a timescale for when the flow of oil would be halted . BP has seen $ 25bn wiped off its share price since the scale of the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion and the resulting environmental damage became clear . But some analysts have started to argued the share sell-off is overdone . Barclays took a different tack , saying `` we subjectively estimate that the accident might result in a lasting 5 % discount for BP 's shares relative to its peers '' . The investment bank analysts estimate that the actual clean-up will probably take BP another 10 months , with a total bill of $ 1bn . The cost of containment is likely to be a further $ 700m . Tougher drilling regulations in the aftermath of the spill are likely to wipe a further $ 6bn off expected long-term value of BP because its production growth rate is likely to be significantly impeded . The biggest bill will come from reputational damage , say Barclays , but the analysts still think the company will be able to keep up its promised dividend payments . Shares in BP were steady at the close today at 568p but had been hit earlier in the week when ratings agency Moody 's changed the outlook for BP to negative , in a threat to its credit status . Moody 's said the decision `` reflects considerable uncertainty associated with the financial liabilities and clean-up costs that BP may incur as a result of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico '' . In an interview for BBC Radio 's Today program , Hayward put the blame for the accident firmly on Transocean , the rig operator hired by BP to drill a well now spewing out more than 5,000 barrels a day from deep under the ocean : `` That is a piece of equipment owned and operated by Transocean , maintained by Transocean ; they are absolutely accountable for its safety and its reliability and they report to the regulatory authority for its safety . '' BP accepted total responsibility for the resulting oil spill which is threatening the tourist and fishing industries of the US southern States . While Hayward said relations between the firm and US federal authorities were `` extraordinarily good '' and he was `` absolutely confident '' BP would bounce back , Barclays estimated the oil company could face 100,000 claims at $ 100,000 each . The spill claims are currently capped by legislation at $ 75m a legacy of the Exxon Valdez tanker grounding but Congressional leaders are already talking about raising this to $ 10bn . Barclays also uses this larger figure then whittles it down to $ 6.5 bn on the basis that BP owns 65 % of the well , with other stakes in the hands of local firms Anadarko and Halliburton . It has emerged that the UK safety regulator had criticised Transocean in 2005 and 2006 over blow-out prevention equipment which did the same task as the gear that is believed to have failed two weeks ago in the US Gulf . The Health and Safety Executive issued Transocean with an improvement notice in 2006 , criticising the testing of a so-called blow out preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- . `` The multi-purpose tool used in blow-out preventer pressure testing was not so constructed as to be suitable for the purpose for which it was provided : and failed in service , exposing persons to risks that endangered their safety . '' A year earlier , the HSE issued an improvement notice criticising the condition of the equipment used to operate the BOP on another Transocean rig , which a BP spokesman said was on contract to the London-based oil major . Transocean said all these problems had been quickly tackled .

Photograph : Gerald Herbert\\/AP The giant steel and concrete box which is seen as the best chance of stopping the BP oil spill arrived at the disaster scene in the Gulf of Mexico today , as authorities struggled to control oil breaching an island wildlife preserve . Over the next few days cranes will attempt to lower the 100-tonne contraption around 5,000 ft -LRB- 1,500 metres -RRB- to the sea floor and position it over a leaking pipe that has been gushing 210,000 gallons of crude a day into the Gulf . If all goes accord to plan , the four-storey box will serve as a giant funnel , collecting the oil and piping it to a ship . BP officials have said repeatedly that the plan for capturing and redirecting the oil is exceedingly complex , and has never before been tried at such depths . `` You have 100 tonnes of steel . You have to stop , reposition , and stabilise these sorts of things . I do n't think it 's a fast process , '' said John Curry , a BP spokesman . He said the system had been successfully deployed at depths of 365 metres after hurricane Katrina , but not by a BP crew . In a best-case scenario , the contraption should be operational by Monday . One bookmaker rated the chances of shutting off the leak completely at 1,000-1 . The US coastguard confirmed for the first time that oil had made its way past protective booms and was surrounding Freemason Island . The area is part of a chain of uninhabited barrier islands in the Breton national wildlife refuge . Meanwhile , the Obama Administration suspended planned lease sales for drilling off the coast of Virginia . Environmentalists who have visited the area described a thin band of orange-coloured oil lapping at the shore . `` The expanse itself is made up of three to four different kinds of oil ranging in thickness , including bright orange ribbons of weathered oil on the surface , '' said Rick Steiner , a conservation professor at the University of Alaska , who flew over the region for Greenpeace . `` There were no visible research vessels , and the only visible relief effort in this area was about 30 shrimp boats off the shore of Little Gozier island pulling booms , with no skimmers taking the oil off the surface . '' Efforts to hold back the oil by repositioning booms were undermined by BP 's decision to break up the spill with dispersants . The resulting thinner oil was proving much harder to contain . `` The oil just scoots right under the boom . There is as much oil behind the booms as in the booms , '' he said . `` It 's an exercise in futility . '' The breach deepened fears for brown pelicans and other endangered birds . `` This is an important nesting season , '' said David Ringer , of the Audubon Society . Heavier concentrations of crude remained further offshore , and the coastguard said weather forecasts suggested it would remain so until the weekend . BP said it was relying on cameras from submersible robots to help guide the containment box into place and avoid further damage to the pipe . In addition to the dark , frigid temperatures and extreme high pressures at such depths , crews will be worried about triggering another explosion because of the volatile mix of oil , gas and water . BP faces an equally daunting challenge to contain the political and financial fallout . The Obama administration has kept up the pressure on the oil giant , a move seen in part as a tactic to divert criticism of its own role in the disaster . Recent news reports have suggested the interior department exercised lax oversight in approving BP 's operations in the Gulf , accepting too readily its claims there was little risk of an accident . The department was further embarrassed by an ABC television report disclosing that Tom Strickland , who is in charge of fish and wildlife , went on a rafting trip in the Grand Canyon with his wife and other officials five days after the spill .

Photograph : Staff\\/Reuters Hopes of a quick fix to stop oil from the Deepwater Horizon oil rig gushing into the Gulf of Mexico were dashed on Saturday , when a build-up of crystallised gas blocked the pipes in the huge metal containment tower , which then had to be lifted from the seabed . While BP engineers wrestled with the problem , reports came in of the first tar balls and tar beads washing up on the white sand beaches of Dauphin Island , off Alabama . The metal tower , specially designed and constructed to cap the leak , is the height of a four-storey building and weighs 100 tonnes . The hope was it would hold the oil still gushing out of the well , which could then be siphoned out of the top , but the blocked pipes made that impossible . The chief operating officer , Doug Suttles , said : `` I would n't say it 's failed yet . What I would say is what we attempted to do last night did n't work because these hydrates plugged up the top of the dome . '' He predicted that it could take another 48 hours to find a resolution . The problem is blamed on methane gas , partly frozen into slush by the cold temperatures on the seabed at 1,500 metres -LRB- 5,000 ft -RRB- . Engineers anticipated the problem , but not the volume of the gas build-up in the pipes . Suttles said that solutions could include heating the area , or adding methanol to break up the hydrates . Meanwhile , oil continues gushing into the Gulf of Mexico at a rate of 4,000 barrels a day or more . Teams were sent by BP to Dauphin Island to test the tar washing up on the beaches , to establish whether it really does come from the spill . They will also lay down clusters of oil-absorbing synthetic fibers , and build storm-fencing along the beach . A spokesman for the spill response command said that tar washing ashore on Alabama 's beaches was common . However , local residents , holding up fist-sized chunks , said they had never seen anything like it before . Construction workers have been racing around the clock , all weekend , to finish laying a three-mile boom across the mouth of Mobile Bay , Alabama , the ninth largest port in the US . The boom , tethered to a line of pilings driven into the sea bed , is being built with a double gate to allow ships to pass through . Vessels will be held between the gates , checked for oil contamination , and cleaned if necessary before being allowed to proceed . The bay is also home to beach resorts and commercial and leisure fisheries , including oyster beds . Fishing restrictions mean thousands of boats have been tied up idle . Oyster processing plants are running out of supplies and shutting down , putting hundreds of people out of work . Wayne Eldridge , owner of J&W Marine Enterprises , an oyster plant operator , said : `` I 'm screwed . The biggest thing is I 've got 35 people unemployed there .

Photograph : Daniel Beltra\\/Greenpeace The Obama administration waived environmental reviews for 26 new offshore drilling projects even as the BP oil disaster spewed hundreds of thousands of gallons of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico , environmental activists said today . The charge came as hopes for a quick fix to the Deepwater Horizon spill were dashed when a build-up of crystallised gas blocked pipes in a huge metal containment box that had been built to cap the well . Engineers are now considering a `` junk shot '' , shooting a mix of debris including shredded tires and golf balls into the well at high pressure to clog it , said Thad Allen , a US coast guard commander . With the spill still unchecked and spreading to Alabama 's beaches , there was renewed focus on oversight procedures that allowed BP and Transocean to drill without backup plans in place . The Centre for Biological Diversity said that even after the disaster , the Obama administration did not tighten its oversight of offshore drilling . An investigation by the respected environmental group revealed that since 20 April , when an explosion the Deepwater Horizon rig killed 11 workers , 27 new offshore drilling projects have been approved by the Mineral Management Service -LRB- MMS -RRB- the regulatory agency responsible for overseeing extraction of oil , gas and other minerals . All but one project was granted similar exemptions from environmental review as BP . Two were submitted by the UK firm , and made the same claims about oil-rig safety and the implausibility of a spill damaging the environment , the center said . `` This oil spill has had absolutely no effect on MMS behavior at all , '' said Kieran Suckling , the director of the center . `` It 's still business as usual which means rubber stamping oil drilling permits with no environmental review . '' The charges were the latest in a string of revelations about lax oversight of offshore drilling that , while dating back to the George Bush era , have also damaged the Obama White House . `` I do n't know where the regulators were on this . They certainly were asleep , '' Richard Shelby , a Republican senator from Alabama , told CNN today . `` This reminds me of a big truck speeding along the Los Angeles freeway with no brakes . '' With the Deepwater wellhead pumping 795,000 litres -LRB- 210,000 gallons -RRB- of oil into the sea each day , authorities sought to stop its spread to the Alabama coastline . Allen said a gate was being built to protect the port of Mobile , but owing to the unpredictability of winds and currents he said the entire region should remain on alert . `` The entire Gulf pretty much has to be on guard , '' he told CBS television . BP crews were forced on yesterday to abandon their efforts to put a box over the leak after a combination of ice crystals , high pressure , and low temperatures made the 100-tonne contraption too buoyant . It was unclear whether BP would make a new attempt . `` I would n't say it has failed yet , '' Doug Suttles , the firm 's chief operating officer , told reporters . But Allen said BP was now looking at sealing the well with the junk shot . The latest failure to seal the wellhead has deepened fears about the economic and environmental impact of the spill , which is on course to surpass the Exxon Valdez disaster . `` What it means is that we are most likely looking at one of the worst case scenarios , '' said Jacqueline Savitz , a scientist for the Oceana conservation group . `` The longer it gushes , and the more oil it spews , the more animals are going to be affected . '' The prospect of oil continuing to gush until BP manages to drill a relief well in two or three months time has intensified concerns among those states now on the spill 's trajectory . Florida 's Democratic senator , Bill Nelson , said the spill threatened his state 's fishing and tourism industries and even its military bases . `` You are talking about massive economic losses , '' he told CNN . Environmental and safety procedures on the Deepwater Horizon rig will come under even greater scrutiny this week as multiple investigations into the disaster get underway . In Louisiana , the coast guard and the MMS will start their inquiries with two days of public hearings . The justice department is also conducting an investigation into the spill and has not ruled out criminal charges . `` I 've sent down representatives from the justice department to examine what our options are with regard to the activities that occurred there and whether or not there has been malfeasance on the part of BP or Transocean , '' Eric Holder , the US attorney general , told ABC television . Three separate congressional committees will also take a close look at offshore drilling and the disaster this week , with testimony from the executives of BP America , Transocean , the company which owned the sunken rig , and Halliburton , which made the cement cap on the well , whose failure set the disaster in motion . BP 's initial investigations suggest the blast was caused by a bubble of methane gas that shot up through the drill column and broke several protective seals and barriers , the Associated Press reported . With oil still gushing into the Gulf of Mexico nearly three weeks after the initial explosion , the continuing catastrophe saw commentators from Al Gore to Fidel Castro weighing in at the weekend . The Cuban leader , in a piece in the local media , said the spill was further evidence of corporate . `` The ecological disaster which occurred in the Gulf of Mexico shows how little can governments do against those who control financial capital , '' he wrote , adding `` The hateful tyranny imposed on the world .

Follow live updates here BP revealed yesterday that plans to stop oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico following the Deepwater Horizon explosion had suffered a setback when a build up of crystallized gas blocked pipes in one of its giant sunken towers . The oil company 's long term plan is to drill a relief well from a second oil rig in the Gulf , allowing it to continue to extract the oil . In the meantime BP is attempting to reduce the effect of the leak using chemical dispersants and containment booms , and will try again to manouevre the cofferdam into place . Follow live updates from BP here , and email adam.gabbatt@guardian.co.uk or tweet @adamgabbatt with your thoughts . We 're due to begin any minute . I 'm just being bombarded with classical music at the moment . Hayward says they fight the leak on three fronts - beneath the surface , on the surface , and on the shore . In the `` subsea '' it is the first time the industry has had to deal with anything at this depth . A lot of `` real time learning going on '' . Hayward says the dome was n't as successful as they 'd hoped . There is a lot more gas emerging than they had thought . In the meantime they are moving to position a smaller dome . They refer to the smaller dome as a `` top hat '' . It 's about the size of a barrel - a lot , lot smaller than the 12m high cofferdam they had started using . It will be a lot less effective in capturing the oil , but could be operating within 72 hours . The other measure on the sea bed is to tap into the riser further along the sea bed , and `` tap into '' the riser directly , without having to mess around with sea water contamination . The riser is essentially the pipe that would have pumped the oil to the surface before the explosion . BP have `` an armada of ships '' skimming oil . They 've skimmed over 100,000 barrels of oily water , as well as spraying dispersant . They now have a million feet of boom deployed , with a further 2.5 m in transit . They have thousands of volunteers signed up , and thousands of vessels have applied to participate in the clean up , although at the moment the oil is `` not getting anywhere near the shore , '' Hayward says . `` Could you say why an effort like this was n't anticipated to a greater extent and why you 're having to make it up as you go ? '' The investigation of this incident will through up things we should have been doing differently , Hayward says . Particularly on the failure of the blow out preventer and the inadecuacy of the industry to act at such depths . The industry has not hitherto had an issue of this sort to contend with , he says . Until you come to a specific problem it is difficult to know what you may need to solve it . A lot of learning is going on . What are the risks of the junk shot ? Could it make matters worse ? The risks of that are very very very very low , Hayward says . BP will be trying to make sure this intervention has upsides and no downsides . There have been fears that the junk shot could damage partially working valves which are preventing the leak from being as bad as it could be . Why did n't the dome work ? In the design criteria of the larger dome , we ca n't pump enough water down over it to stop it freezing , Hayward says . The smaller dome should not be as susceptible to the freezing which prevented the first from working . There 'll probably be some generic lessons to be learned , Hayward says . But he wo n't speculate . What will the leak mean for BP and the industry ? It 's a serious situation for BP , Hayward says . We will resolve it , its just a question of how long it will take . I suspect there will be specific findings regarding the ability to intervene 5,000 ft underwater , he reckons . There should be lessons for the industry . Is the junk shot going directly into the well bore ? It will go down `` choke and kill lines '' , into the blowout preventer . Then it will seal the blow out preventer . They would be pumping material into the internals of the blowout preventer , Hayward says . I think the junk shot will go into the blowout preventer . Why was BP so unprepared ? Were there flaws in the level of preparedness ? Hayward says the company is implementing its spill response plan rigirously . It has been very effective in stopping oil getting to the shore . It is the largest spill response effort mounted in the history of the industry . He says the issue of preparedness is around the blowout preventer . The industry will learn from this and make more changes . Tell us about the drilling of the relief well , and what you have in place if that does n't work ? What are the risks it does n't work ? We 're drilling two relief wells , says H , to give ourselves `` belt and braces '' . This should guarantee success . The relief wells will be successful says a confident Hayward . How do you know you 've been successful if you do n't know how quickly the oil is coming out , asks a hack ? By the fact we have contained the oil within the immediate vicinity of the well , says H. Hayward 's off . Kent Wells , senior vice president in BP 's exploration and production business is taking over . Wells is elaborating on the technical aspects . Specifically `` sub sea '' . This is an unprecedented challenge , he says . BP has assembled a small army . They have people from just about every oil and gas company , from the government , from everywhere . BP wants multiple options at combatting the spill . They 're `` designing every option to be successful , and planning for it to fail '' . He 's going to talk about the top hat , then the junk shot . BP felt the big cofferdam -LRB- the 90 tonnes one -RRB- was the best option . But they were aware it may not work . It had a 12 inch opening , and they were going to pump warm water down the pipe to keep it warm and prevent the slush effect that actually ioccurrec , stopping them from pumping off water . Now they 've gone from `` one extreme to the other '' . The `` top hat '' dome is 5ft tall , 4ft wide . Warm sea water will be pumped down . As they lower the dome it will already be operational - hooked up to a ship on the surface . It will be more difficult to place but they will succeed . It should be in place by the end of the week . BP is also trying to shut off the flow . Control pads connected the blowout preventer do n't work because they were attached to the rig , which sank . The junk shot will bung up the blowout preventer . They want a mix of different size of materials that will go in and hold - such as golf balls . BP has been experimenting with different `` recipes '' of junk If one recipe does n't work they 'll try something else . They will follow it with cement , and permanently abandon the well . It will take up to two weeks to work . Shutting of the well -LRB- in this fashion or any other -RRB- is BP 's number one priority . More on the junk shot . Choke and kill lines give an access through valves into the well . The junk shot would go down those lines and clog up blow out preventers . It has been used elsewhere successfully , but not at 5,000 ft - nothing has , Wells says . Could the junk shot make matters worse ? Every time they 've done something they 've considered if it could make matters worse , W says . They `` really believe this is going to pull it off '' . BP have put out a phone number to members of the public saying they can contact the company with suggested solutions , a hack says . Have any of the solutions so far come from the public ? Wells says he could n't know where all the ideas come from . All are processed , he says . How do you get the shot in when stuff is coming out of the hole ? It is separated into 10 different segements . Then BP will turn the valves and shoot it in . They 'll be able to make repeated shots . BP will use `` whatever pressure it takes to pump into the well '' . But it will take a lot of pressure , Wells says . They definitely will be using golf balls , W confirms . Pieces of tyre too . The relief wells take 90 days to get into business , and they started work on the first one a week ago . Work on the second will start in a week . Questions coming from the phones . It 's not me . But nonetheless - what percentage of the oil will be contained by the top hat ? Why was n't the top hat tried first ? Was it because they then have to abandon the well ? Keeping the well open was the last thing on their mind , Wells says . Immediately they were trying to shut down the BOP -LRB- blow out preventer -RRB- . Have you considered collapsing the formation with military action ? Wells says again that they are not worried about losing the well . He is unaware of any technique of bombing the well . It 's a long way down . My request for a question is going unanswered . What is the 90 day estimate based on ? That is how long it will take to intercept the well . There could be complications but 90 days is the plan . The second relief well is being drilled incase they run into problems with the first one . How sure are you that only 5,000 barrels a day are coming out ? We do n't know what it is , no way to measure it , says Wells . No accurate way to put a measure on that . One of the ideas behind big containment chambers was that it would embed itself in the surface , asks an American journalist . How can you be sure a small one will not be moved around by the flow ? The big dome was so heavy because it was so large , says W , not really answering the question . The smaller dome will be held in place by the drill pipe and riser , so that is why it should work . Wells says BP would like to reassure everyone there is a dedicated team working on this , and they will get it under control . Eventually they will bring the BOP up to see what went wrong with it , Wells says . And with that , he is off . You wrote in your blog that the question was asked as to the percentage of oil that will be contained by the top hat ... what was the answer to that question ? or did the question go unanswered ? Good spot , unfortunately it was n't properly answered . Wells said he would not speculate as to how much it might contain . -LRB- Which is a bit odd seeing as figures were around about how much oil the large dome was expected to recover . Maybe BP have learned their lesson . Wells confirmed that the contents of the `` junk shot '' really will be as primitive as they sounded . Golf balls and bits of old tyre . He was very defensive about questions regarding whether BP did not want to use this measure at first as it would mean losing the well , stressing two or three times that saving the well was never on the company 's mind . Both Wells and Hayward did n't provide information on how much oil is spilling out , as they have n't from the start , but Hayward in particular went to great lengths to stress that the clean up operation was `` 2 or 3 times larger '' than any that has been staged before . There was a lot of talk of `` learning as we go along '' and how this spill was unprecedented . While it is true that there is no precedent for a spill at this depth the technology is relatively new a lot of journalists pointed out that should not mean a spill should have have been unexpected , which is why we saw questions on whether BP should have been better prepared . All Hayward would say on the issue was that the industry will be able to learn from the investigation into the incident . He said there will probably be specific findings as to how to deal with problems 5,000 ft underwater . Will that satisfy the critics ?

Photograph : Gerald Herbert\\/AP Nearly three weeks after an oil rig explosion turned the Gulf of Mexico into an environmental disaster zone , BP today still casting about for a clear plan to shut off the gusher of crude that has cost the company $ 350m -LRB- # 235m -RRB- . BP crews were simultaneously exploring a number of different approaches to plugging the leak , known in industry slang as top hat , top kill , and junk shot . `` We are pursuing multiple options in parallel and we are learning all the time , '' BP 's CEO , Tony Hayward , told reporters tonight . `` There 's a lot of real-time learning going on . '' The search for an early fix comes as BP officials put the cost of its response to the spill to date at $ 350m . The final bill could run into the billions . With the failure at the weekend of attempts to lower an enormous dome over one of two leaks , BP was turning towards deploying a more modest containment box known as a `` top hat '' . The initial effort was scrapped because of the formation of ice-like hydrates , a mixture of water and gas , which clogged up the four-storey-high concrete and steel box . Oil industry experts said placing a smaller box over the smaller of the two leaks would limit the amount of sea water , and so reduce the formation of the crystals that BP feared would destabilise the box . The first attempt could get under way mid-week . Engineers are also looking at a `` top kill '' , installing a new stack of valves on top of the blowout preventer whose failure in the wake of the 20 April explosion gave way to the disaster . Then there is a `` junk shot '' , firing shredded tyres and golf balls into the blowout preventer in the hope of clogging it . Engineers would then attempt to put in a concrete seal . That effort could get started next week . BP is also studying the idea of fitting a new , larger pipe at the end of the well 's original 5,000 ft pipe , which now lies crumpled on the ocean floor . But all of those options are highly challenging . `` You are doing this at 5,000 feet water depth , under immense pressure and in complete darkness and you 're doing all this with remote vehicles , '' said Byron King , an energy industry analyst . `` You are feeling your way around , and that is a very tricky idea . '' They also carry the risk of making the disaster even worse , said Philip Johnson , a petroleum engineering professor at the University of Alabama . With no clear sign of an early fix , authorities were stepping up their efforts to keep the oil from making landfall . More than a million feet of boom have been deployed along the coast , and in Louisiana helicopters having been dropping sandbags along barrier islands and marshes . Submersible robots , meanwhile , were squirting chemical dispersants directly into the well at depths of 5,000 ft to try to thin the oil before it rises to the ocean surface . But there were reports that the oil , which had been seen for days on uninhabited barrier islands , had now reached the mainland . Greenpeace said it had found blobs of oil on the beach and in the reeds at Port Eads , the southernmost tip of Louisiana .

It 's a long shot known as a ` junk shot ' , but it might just work The oil spill containment box aboard a barge in the Gulf of Mexico . Photograph : Gerald Herbert\\/AP Since the Deepwater Horizon explosion two weeks ago , it has been hard not to view as primitive the efforts to contain the oil and prevent more of it leaking . Whether it is the containment booms drafted in to prevent the oil washing ashore or early efforts to set the oil on fire , or even the attempts to funnel the leaking oil via giant sunken towers , the somewhat low-tech containment efforts starkly contrast with the often hi-tech methods usually witnessed in deep-sea drilling . The latest BP plan being weighed up is similarly low-tech . Engineers may try to plug the well by pumping debris into it at high pressure , a method known as a `` junk shot '' . `` They are actually going to take a bunch of debris - some shredded up tyres , golf balls and things like that - and under very high pressure shoot it into the preventer itself and see if they can clog it up to stop the leak , '' the US Coast Board Admiral Thad Allen told CBS News yesterday . Tyres , golf balls , and `` things like that '' do not immediately inspire confidence , However Dr Simon Boxall , oceanographer at the National Oceanography center in Southampton , Hampshire , said the unique conditions of the Deepwater Horizon spill there has never been an oil leak at this depth before mean all traditional methods `` go out of the window '' . There have been blow outs in shallow water , but with those you 're looking at 100-metre-deep tops , where you can get divers down and you can get equipment down , '' he said . `` It 's nothing compared to doing it 1,500 m -LRB- 5,000 ft -RRB- down this goes beyond all our technological knowhow and experience . '' . Boxall said a junk shot has been tried before , although he was only aware of one incident , which took place at a much shallower depth . `` We 're working in completely new territory , but the idea is not quite as daft as it sounds , '' he said . `` Bear in mind the pressures at these depths are phenomenal , so what seems like an odd thing to bung a hole with at the surface can actually work quite well . Golf balls seem really quite hard but actually they 're quite soft . `` Certainly if you add a tonne of pressure per square inch to a golf ball then it starts to give . So I guess what they 're looking to do is use these things that are slightly plastic in their feel to bung into a hole which will help bung it up . '' The main problem for engineers is how to get the debris into the well almost a mile beneath the surface . The plan is to block the well beneath the semi-operational cut-off valves at the moment , the well is partly shut off , restricting the oil flow without making the spill worse . `` They 're planning to sort of try and insert them somehow magically before the cut off valve , but that does n't quite make sense , '' Boxall said . `` All these things you can imagine are perfectly feasible on land if you had whatever technology was available to bung them in the hole . `` But when you 're looking at some mechanism to fire them into a hole when you 're a mile down in seawater , I ca n't imagine what they would use , unless they 're using compressed air but that is difficult at those depths anyway because the pressures are so great . '' He added : `` There are one or two engineers out there who seem to be thinking : ` This is ok as long as we do n't cause more damage than we solve . ' '' BP 's ultimate solution to the leak is to drill a relief well , but that could take up to three months before that is completed . In the meantime , they will continue to try and position a cofferdam over one of the leaks today .

Photograph : Ted Jackson\\/AP BP insisted last night that its contingency plan had worked , despite coming under fire in Congress for minimizing the risks of offshore drilling and trying to shirk blame for the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico . With an estimated 4m gallons of oil polluting the gulf from the ruptured well , Lamar McKay , the chief executive of BP America , said the company had adequately anticipated the potential scale of any spill and that its clean-up operation had gone according to plan . `` We had a very specific plan , '' he told the Senate . `` It has actually worked . '' But he acknowledged the spill could grow to nearly 19m US gallons by the time a relief well the only sure method of stopping the leak is drilled . BP 's defense came at the end of a testy day of hearings before two committees which saw the three oil titans connected to the disaster repeatedly accused of trying to slough off their financial and legal obligations . Executives of BP America , which owned the well , Transocean , which owned the sunken Deepwater Horizon rig , and Halliburton , which cemented the wall , were repeatedly taken to task by senators for failing to put in place adquate safety regimes . BP was also pressed for specifics on its commitment to honor all `` legitimate claims '' for damages from the spill . The senators ' anger grew as all three admitted they could offer no guarantees against another calamity in the Gulf . `` There is just nothing there underneath your statements , '' said Barbara Boxer , the chair of the Senate environment and public works committee . `` If you look at what 's happening it is very very disturbing . '' But other senators acknowledged a failure of regulatory oversight . `` We dropped the ball here , '' said Max Baucus , a Democrat from Montana . The day got underway with BP America 's chief executive , Lamar McKay , pointing to Transocean , the operator of the rig , and pinning a failed blowout preventer , a 450 tonne set of valves now lying on the ocean floor . `` We have a blowout preventer that did n't work , '' McKay said . Transocean 's Steven Newman fired straight back . `` Offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , in this case BP , '' he said . Its health , safety and environment officer , Tim Probert , started off by warning against a premature rush to judgment then took his turn at assigning blame . Like Newman , he told the hearing that Halliburton had carried out its work according to BP 's specifications . Yesterday 's hearings on Capitol Hill and in Kenner , Louisiana mark the first official efforts to unravel the causes of spill , and prevent future disasters . BP and the others were put on notice the spill could well change the future of offshore drilling . `` If you ca n't convince people that you can operate safely , not only will BP not be out there , but Transocean wo n't be out there to drill the rigs , and Halliburton wo n't be out there cementing , '' said Lisa Murkowski , a Republican from Alaska who supports drilling . The first changes were set in motion yesterday , with the Obama administration proposing reform in the policing of offshore drilling following repeated charges that regulators were too cosy with oil companies . A proposed overhaul of the mineral management service would put a firewall between officials approving projects and those responsible for making operations meet safety and environmental standards . The move comes amid repeated charges from senators yesterday that the mineral management service was `` too cozy '' . The hearing was told the BP and other companies routinely won exemptions from environmental review of offshore projects , a waiver process McKay described as `` just the industry standard '' . Meanwhile , the long-awaited energy and climate bill due for release today was also tweaked in response to heightened concerns about drilling . The bill will still expand offshore drilling , but environmental groups said they were assured that states would be able to veto projects within 75 miles of their shores . As the hearings played out on Capitol Hill , the Louisiana national guard deployed troops in Blackhawk helicopters to drop sandbags along the shoreline . Much evidence at the two hearings yesterday was technical , about various protective devices that should if functioning properly prevent catastrophe . One key detail could be the cement casing of the well . Halliburton noted the well had been left without a cap or blowout preventer for five months before the explosion . BP also faced tough questions about whether it was too complacent about the risks of deepwater drilling , given more than a dozen accidents in the last five years involving failed blow out preventers . BP was also pressed repeatedly to spell out its commitment to pay all `` legitimate '' claims of compensation for the spill . Senators also accused the company of cutting corners in its disaster planning by failing to have a containment dome and stocks of dispersants were not on standby . `` What I see here is a company flailing around trying to deal with a worst-case scenario , '' Robert Menendez , a New Jersey senator , told BP . The three companies were also forced to admit under questioning that they were conducting no research into how to deal with deep water spills . BP , in particular , was singled out over fatal accidents in Texas , as well as safety violations in Alaska .

The committee 's witnesses are Steven Newman , head of Transocean , Lamar McKay , president and Chairman of BP America , and Tim Probert , who is the lucky holder of the title of chief health , safety and environmental officer for Halliburton . You can read their prepared testimony here and what we can say so far is that the three companies are adopting what one observer has called `` the Shaggy defense '' - in the words of Senator Robert Menendez , Democrat of New Jersey : `` BP says Transocean , Transocean says Halliburton I can see the liability chase . '' From the written testimony from the three witnesses , you can see why Menendez might think that . Here 's BP 's Lamar McKay -LRB- pdf -RRB- : BP is one of the lease holders and the operator of this exploration well . As operator , BP hired Transocean to conduct the well drilling operations . Transocean owned the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig and its equipment , including the blowout preventer ... Only seven of the 126 onboard the Deepwater Horizon were BP employees ... Blowout preventers are used on every oil and gas well drilled in the world today . They are carefully and deliberately designed with multiple levels of redundancy and are regularly tested . If they do n't pass the test , they are not used . The systems are intended to fail-closed and be fail-safe ; sadly and for reasons we do not yet understand , in this case , they were not . Transocean 's blowout preventer failed to operate . The committee has been off for a recess , to do some actual voting on the financial regulation bill , and now they are up and running ... read on . 12.00 pm : If you are following these hearings on Twitter , then there 's some excellent live tweeting going on from Kate Sheppard @kate_sheppard and my excellent colleague Suzanne Goldenberg @suzyji , at the hearings itself . If you want to make your life more exciting then watch the whole thing live via the web on C-Span here . 12.11 pm : More on the blame game , this time the drill owner Transocean blaming Halliburton and BP for something going wrong in the cement plug that was supposed to seal the well . Here 's Transocean 's Steven Newman : The cementing process is dictated by the operator 's well plan , and the testing of the cement on the Deepwater Horizon was performed by the cement contractor -LRB- Haliburton in this instance -RRB- as specified and directed by BP ... -LRB- T -RRB- he one thing we know with certainty is that on the evening of April 20 , there was a sudden , catastrophic failure of the cement , the casing , or both . Therein lies the root cause of this occurrence ; without a disastrous failure of one of those elements , the explosion could not have occurred . In other words : nothing to do with us , mate . 12.20 pm : The senators are starting to get unhappy about the blame-game sharing going on here . Lisa Murkowski from Alaska , a state that knows all about oil wants to stop the Reservoir Dogs style face-off : I would suggest to all three of you that we are all in this together because this incident will have an impact on the energy policy of our country . If you ca n't convince people that you can operate safely , not only will BP not be out there , but Transocean wo n't be out there to drill the rigs and Halliburton wo n't be out there cementing . In other words , get your act together or you 'll spoil it for the rest of us ? Murkowski of course is from the `` drill , baby , drill '' wing of the Republican party . -LRB- Which implies there 's a non-drilling wing of the Republican party , which there is n't , but some parts are more pro-drilling than others . -RRB- 12.45 pm : Well if you ever wanted to know anything about deep-sea drilling , you 'll love this hearing . Also , if you like hearing phrases like `` operating procedures '' and `` manipulating the pipe through the BOP '' . Sometimes some words of English break through . Senator Mary Landrieu asks : `` Will BP pay ? '' That is , over and above the $ 75m cap that legislation allows for . BP 's McKay : `` We 've been very clear . We are going to pay all legitimate claims , all legitimate claims . '' Landrieu : `` Define ` legitimate ' for us ? '' Excuse me while I go and short BP shares . 1pm : Senator Ron Wyden is a bit of hero to many Democrats , and you can see why at this hearing . Here he 's grilling BP which he appears to identify as the villain of this piece over their far-from-spotless safety record in recent years . After Wyden lists some unsafe BP events of recent years , he charges : `` There is a pattern of safety problems at BP . Why has BP not been able to change its corporate culture ? '' BP 's McKay responds : `` I 'll acknowledge we 've got issues and we 've got to change some areas of the company ... It gets down to the agenda and the culture of the company . '' Wyden snorts : `` It sure does ! The culture is that this company has had one accident after another . '' Senator Menendez mentions that the room in which the hearing is being held is the same one used for hearings on the sinking of the Titanic : We were told that the Titanic was so technologically advanced that it could n't sink , and we were told that this well was so technologically advanced that it could n't spill . Unfortunately both of these technological marvels ended in tragedy . In that case , BP will soon be blaming an iceberg . 1.05 pm : It should be mentioned that Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama is very interested in mud . There are technical reasons why this is important . Meanwhile , Kate Sheppard has a good round-up of the intra-mural finger-pointing between the three companies on Mother Jones 's website . 1.19 pm : Maria Cantwell , Democratic senator from Washington state , goes back to the question of BP 's paying compensation , listing a series of areas where BP might have to cough up . But would BP compensate state and local governments , for example , for lost tax revenue ? `` Question mark , '' responds McKay , who is taking most of the heat here . -LRB- Have the senators really forgotten about Halliburton 's toxic PR image , hmm ? -RRB- 1.30 pm : So that brings this part of the hearings to a close - the three execs will now shoot over to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works , which might be more exciting since it is n't stuffed with pro-oil state senators -LRB- he said glibly -RRB- . As the hearings wound up , some protesters -LRB- there are a few in the audience -RRB- started an imaginative variation on the old Vietnam War chant : Hey hey , Lamar McKay , who many fish did you kill today ? Call me old fashioned but it does n't quite have the power of `` LBJ , how many kids did you kill today ? '' Right , we 're in recess until 2.30 pm ET . 2.30 pm : Here we go again : welcome to part two of the grilling of three oil execs relating to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill . Compared to the excitement in the UK with the change of government , this committee meeting might not seem quite as dramatic , but this session promises to be more bare-knuckle than this morning 's round . This one is the environment and public works committee , which contains rather more feisty senators , and chaired by the far tougher Barbara Boxer , who says today that the spill `` could be one of the greatest environmental disasters we 've ever seen '' . Once again the unholy trinity of Halliburton , BP and Transocean are giving testimony , the same three as this morning . 2.45 pm : The committee 's senators are making their opening statements , and all ready there 's a much tougher tone to their remarks . Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey has a nice line : `` What this spill shows us is that offshore drilling can not be conducted safely ... Drilling is a 19th century solution to a 21st century problem . '' 2.55 pmpm : And then again there 's a different view from senator David Vitter of Louisiana , a Republican who knows all about being covered in filth . -LRB- That 's a reference to the DC Madam prostitute scandal , when Vitter was found to involved . -RRB- Anyway , Vitter thinks that the matter is so serious that these hearings should n't even be held . `` I think that having hearings while the disaster is ongoing is a mistake , '' says Vitter , because the hearing is `` pulling some amount of resources and focus away from that ongoing disaster '' . Now you might think that 's a pathetic line of argument . But think about it for a minute . Then you can be really sure it 's a pathetic line of argument . Senator Sheldon Whitehouse , a Democrat of Rhode Island , takes a different line : `` We were told that ` drill , baby , drill ' was the solution to all our problems . Go tell that to the tourist industry in Florida . '' 3.09 pm : Senator Richard Shelby deserves to win a prize . A prize for chutzpah . In fact , he 's done even better than Vitter in the chutzpah stakes . In his remarks , he wants to know what was going on at Department of the Interior 's Minerals Management Service . `` I 'm just asking , '' he says . Yes , it was obviously their fault . -LRB- He has a point about how badly run the MMS was ... under the Bush administration . But he 's also making a wider point about the ineffectiveness of government , I think . -RRB- 3.19 pm : Senator Bill Nelson of Florida is getting stuck in , warning of the Deepwater spill : `` one of my worst nightmares might be coming true '' . Nelson 's now sketching out a nightmarish scenario , in which the oil spill hits an ocean stream in the Gulf , goes around the tip of Florida , up the US east coast and ends up ... on the coast of Scotland ! If only Britain had a government it could do something about this . Nelson : `` Is it worth the trade off to our economy in Florida , not only to our beaches but our fisheries and our oysters , is it worth the trade off ... for 10 % of the undiscovered oil in the Gulf of Mexico ? The answer is clearly : no. '' Nelson 's also lighting into the MMS : `` A sorry record , a record of incestuous relationships , of sex parties , pot parties . MMS needs to be cleaned up . '' Everything needs to be cleaned up . `` Madam chairman , those are my heartfelt remarks , '' concludes Bill . `` They certainly are , '' replies Boxer . 3.32 pm : Now it 's the chance for the witnesses , starting with BP America 's Lamar McKay . `` I grew up in Mississippi ... I know what people are going through , '' he says . Faintly , in the breakground , you can hear the Windows XP start-up tune . 3.38 pm : So now that Britain has a government again it needs to get cracking on that contingency plan for when the Gulf oil slick hits Scotland , as Ben Nelson 's nightmare predicts . 3.55 pm : Tim Probert of Halliburton now speaking - and we 're back to the blame-game shifting of the morning session . Shorter version of Probert 's defense : We ca n't possibly make any opinions on what might have happened at Deepwater Horizon rig until all the facts are known . Except that if the blow-out preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- had worked none of this would have happened . But that 's not what the Transocean people say in their evidence : The attention now being given to the BOPs in this case is somewhat ironic because at the time of the explosion , the drilling process was complete . The well had been sealed with casing and cement , and within a few days , the BOPs would have been removed . At this point , the well barriers the cementing and the casing were responsible for controlling any pressure from the reservoir . Remember : Transocean drilled the well , Halliburton did the cement plug . Now things are getting interesting : Barbara Boxer : `` Mr Probert , I was taken by your testimony , it seems to be that your blaming the well owner here . '' Probert : `` I certainly did n't mean to suggest that , I was just explaining the role of the parties . '' For legal reasons , you will have to speculate on your own interpretation of which of these lying bastards is lying . Oh god now its Senator Inhofe . He wants to know just how terrific a job they are doing in cleaning up the oil with those nice chemical dispersants . Now he 's banging on about how the MMS inspected the Deepwater Horizon 26 times . But otherwise he seems to be speaking in some rustic argot . 4.10 pm : Senator Lautenberg asks each of the three execs : who was responsible for the explosion and spill ? 4.14 pm : Sounds like this hearing is n't going to last long because of all the votes the senators have to make on the financial regulations act . Anyway ... here 's David Vitter and the thing he 's interested is stopping this terrorist oil from touching the beaches of Louisiana . So he 's going to ask some micro-questions aimed at making sure his state gets more oil boom coverage . Of course all politics is local but this is parochialism gone mad . This way , no one asks the nice oil people any awkward questions ... like , why did your rig explode ? 4.30 pm : Right , so the committee 's gone into recess for voting and its unclear when it will come back to life , so let 's leave it there . No fireworks , certainly nothing on the scale of the Goldman Sachs hearings a couple of weeks ago , perhaps because the spill is still on-going and enough evidence has n't been assembled to really probe the companies involved . Ben Cardin of Maryland had a good shot at it , asking BP about known safety issues involving blowout preventers that have failed . '' `` Obviously in hindsight we did not anticipate something of this impact , '' says McKay . So , replies Cardin , then how can you be sure in the future ? My colleague Suzanne Goldenberg sums up the hearings earlier today , and the blame-all-round policy taken by the oil companies : As the Energy and Natural Resources committee hearing got underway , Senate staffers joked it could be subtitled Scenes from an Execution , with a grilling due from the senators . But some of the worst damage may well have been done by executives themselves , as the three companies all tried to shift the responsibility . And no Ann Coulter , this is not demographics .

Photograph : KPA\\/Zuma\\/Rex Features BP was aware of equipment problems aboard the Deepwater Horizon rig hours before the explosion pumped millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , a congressional hearing was told yesterday . In a second day of hearings , the House of Representatives 's energy and commerce committee said documents and company briefings suggested that BP , which owned the well ; Transocean , which owned the rig ; and Halliburton , which cemented into place the casing for the well , ignored tests in the hours before the 20 April explosion that indicated faulty safety equipment . `` Yet it appears the companies did not suspend operations , and now 11 workers are dead and the gulf faces an environmental catastrophe , '' Henry Waxman , the chair of the energy and commerce committee , said , demanding to know why work was not stopped . The committee heard testimony from oil executives suggesting multiple failures of safety systems that should have given advance warning of a blowout , or should have promptly cut off the flow of oil . The failures included a dead battery in the blowout preventer , suggestions of a breach in the well casing , and failure in the shear ram , a device of last resort that was supposed to cut through and seal the drill pipe in the event of a blowout . `` Already we have uncovered at least four significant problems with the blowout preventer used on the Deepwater Horizon drill rig , '' said Bart Stupak , a Democrat from Michigan who chairs the oversight subcommittee . The examination was far tougher on the oil companies than the Senate hearings on Tuesday . BP also faced a financial sting as the White House asked Congress to approve $ 118m in recovery costs , to be passed on to the oil company . While the committee accused the oil industry of failing to anticipate the dangers of offshore drilling , senators John Kerry and Joe Lieberman unveiled a climate and energy bill that for the first time will put a price on carbon and require American cuts in greenhouse gas emissions . Kerry said he believed the oil spill would give impetus to the American Power Act . `` This a bill for energy independence after a devastating oil spill , a bill to hold polluters accountable , a bill for billions of dollars to create the next generation of jobs and a bill to end America 's addiction to foreign oil . '' But after eight months of careful courtship of industry and political opposition , the bill has no Republican backers after Senator Lindsey Graham , a co-author , withdrew his support last month and the immediate response from industry groups and mainstream environmental groups was guarded . Passage of the law is seen as crucial to a global deal on climate change . The 987-page bill was carefully positioned to secure support from industry and moderate Republicans , making the final product far weaker than environmental organizations wanted . In response to the oil disaster , the bill moderated its original support for offshore drilling , giving states veto power over projects in waters 75 miles from their shores . States that go ahead will be able to keep a bigger share , 37 % , of federal revenues from drilling . Otherwise the bill calls for 12 nuclear plants and sets aside $ 2bn for research into clean coal . Greenpeace condemned it as a `` dirty energy bailout '' , with director Phil Radford adding : `` It seems that after a year and a half wrangling , the only people who can be happy with this bill are the fossil fuel industry lobbyists . '' The bill aims for a 17 % cut in emissions over 2005 levels , the same weak target enshrined in a bill passed by the House in June last year . But the Senate version would apply to a smaller share of the US economy . Heavy industries would not be required to cut emissions until 2016 . The bill would stop the Environmental Protection Agency regulating greenhouse gases and would scrap region cap and trade systems now underway in two dozen states and Canadian provinces . cents This article was amended on 19 May 2010 .

Keeping mum : BP chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg . Photograph : Public Domain As BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward toils 24\\/7 to contain the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that is wreaking havoc on the environment and on BP 's battered reputation in the US , one figure is notably absent that of the group 's new chairman . It will not have escaped the notice of shareholders who have seen billions wiped off the value of the oil group since Deepwater Horizon exploded last month with the loss of 11 lives , that Carl-Henrik Svanberg is keeping an unusually low profile , given the scale of the disaster that has engulfed the company . He is being paid # 750,000 a year to bat for BP , but is maintaining complete radio silence . A BP spokeswoman makes soothing noises it is not Svanberg 's job to run the business , but he has been out to the crisis control center in Houston , is being kept up-to-date with what is happening out there and is `` very supportive '' of his chief executive . He does not , however , plan to say anything publicly . But the damage to BP , whose value to pension funds is vast , could escalate now that the congressional investigations committee has revealed a possible catalogue of safety failures , including failed pressure tests on the day of the explosion . Now facing at least six congressional committee investigations and the possibility that the # 75m legal cap on its US liability might be retrospectively removed , BP will be hoping groundwork done before the explosion will now pay dividends . According to the US Centre for Responsive Politics , it spent $ 16m lobbying on Capitol Hill last year and $ 3.5 m -LRB- # 2.4 m -RRB- in the first three months of this year . Natural territory for a chairman of an oil major , one might think . It is almost impossible to conceive of Svanberg 's predecessor , barrister , politician , banker and businessman Peter Sutherland , adopting such a low-profile approach -LRB- even though he was paid substantially less than Svanberg -RRB- . Sutherland was a combative and aggressive character , who would undoubtedly have provided some air cover . Svanberg 's appointment to BP last year was always regarded as a bit out of left field . He had spent his career in Swedish industry , most recently as the boss at locks group Assa Abloy and then at mobile phone group Ericsson . But he had zero experience of the oil industry , and has admitted he was surprised to be offered the BP job . It is tempting to suggest that he may be out of his depth with BP , but the fact is that in Sweden he is a high-profile business name , with a reputation for speaking his mind who sparked a huge row in 2006 when he controversially called for a change of government . Todayfor the first time , Hayward admitted that his job may be on the line . As he pledged again to `` fix '' the problem , he said `` I will be judged by the response '' to the disaster . That is true , but he is as likely to be judged by the circumstances , and any failures , that led up to the crisis . Maybe Svanberg realizes that being too supportive of his chief executive may not be the best course of action for his own reputation .

Photograph : John Moore\\/Getty Images Marine scientists were carefully viewing footage of oil and gas billowing out of a ruptured well on the ocean floor today , to try to deliver the first reliable estimates of the crude gushing into the Gulf of Mexico it could be as much as 70,000 barrels a day . The video could help resolve the increasingly contentious debate about the scale of the disaster , and the oil companies ' willingness to give access to any information . BP has claimed repeatedly there is no way of measuring the scale of the leak . The US Coast Guard , meanwhile , has stuck to an early estimate of 5,000 barrels a day . Independent marine researchers have suggested the spill could be much larger . National Public Radio in the United States last night reported that the well is spewing up to 70,000 barrels of oil a day , or 2.9 m US gallons the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez disaster every four days . Nearly 11m gallons of oil were spilled in Alaska 's Prince William Sound in 1989 when the Exxon Valdez tanker ran aground , oiling beaches and poisoning marine life for generations . NPR said scientific analysis of newly released video footage from the ocean floor suggested the gusher was 12 times more powerful than estimates offered so far by the Coast Guard or BP . Its analysis was conducted by Steve Werely , an associate professor at Purdue University , using a technique called particle image velocimetry , a method was accurate to 20 % . That puts the range of the oil spill from 56,000 to 84,000 barrels a day . Werely told The Guardian he based his estimate on techniques which track the speed of objects traveling in the flow stream . `` You can see in the video lots of swirls and vortices pumping out of the end of the pipe , and I used a computer code to track those swirls and come up with the speed at which the oils is shooting out of the pipe , '' he said . `` From there it is a very simple calculation to figure out what is the volume flow . '' He said he had use the method for 15 years , and elsewhere it had been in use for 25 years . Scientists had spent the day scouring the video footage of the gushing pipe on the ocean floor to try to arrive at estimates . Eugene Chiang , an associate professor at the University of California Berkeley who teaches a course on measurement , said he had been copied on an email which set it as a science challenge for academics . `` It was just like estimating the number of jelly beans in a can , it had that kind of a feeling but of course with much more serious consequences , '' he told the Guardian . Chiang said he used relatively `` back of the envelope '' calculations to put an estimated rate for the spill at 20,000 to 100,000 barrels a day . Chiang studied the angle of the flow of oil and gas from the leaking pipe , and made calculations about buoyancy and gravitational acceleration . `` I estimated that it was moving 100cm per second going up as a very rough estimate , so then all I needed to know was the area of the pipe . '' His guess turned out to be very close to the measurements released by BP . `` This was just based on back-of-the-envelope scribbling and looking at the vide ; but even within that range you can already infer that this is a huge disaster exceeding the magnitude of the Exxon Valdez spill by quite a large margin , '' he said . `` The calculation is uncertain , but I am confident enough to say that this is one of the big ones . It is not 5,000 barrels a day . That much I can say . '' However , these estimates made no impact on BP . `` We have said from the begining there is no way to estimate the flow coming out of the pipe . '' said Mark Proegler , a spokesman for BP . `` Our estimate was provided by the coast guard and Noaa -LRB- the ocean and atmospheric agency -RRB- and it is based on satellite imagery , overflight observations , and on water observations . '' The size of the spill has long been contested territory . In the initial 48 hours after the rig went down , the Coast Guard offered repeated assurances there was no evidence of a leak from the crumpled pipe on the ocean floor . The Coast Guard later admitted its initial assurances were based on data from BP 's robot submersibles . The Coast Guard then suggested the ruptured well was leaking at 1,000 barrels a day before revising upwards to 5,000 barrels a day . But marine scientists have been warning of a much more extensive spill , and have been demanding BP release data gathered from its remote operating vehicles , such as the video footage released on Wednesday . BP officials last week laid out a worst case scenario of 60,000 barrels a day when they were in a closed-door briefing with members of Congress in Washington DC . But the release of the first video from BP 's submersible cameras under growing pressure from scientists and news organizations could help scientists arrive at independent estimates . Timothy Crone , at the Lamont-Doherty earth observatory , part of Columbia University in New York , a scientist who has spent years studying natural jets on the ocean floor , said that he would be able to produce an independent estimate of the leak by analyzing the video and information from BP on the diameter of the leaking pipe . `` If they took about 20 or 30 seconds of video with a very specific purpose of measuring flow rates , which means having the ROV -LRB- remotely operated vehicle -RRB- stay completely still or parked on the bottom , and you got video of the plume close to the leak , and if it was illuminated and with high resolution , then you could get pretty good estimates of the flow rates , '' Crone said . The scientists say access to the video from BP 's ocean-floor vehicles could become even more crucial in the next few days for gauging the success of various devices to clog the leak . BP engineers today began the slow process of trying to fit a smaller tube inside the crumpled riser pipe on the ocean floor to try to siphon oil to the surface . Officials said it could take 12 hours to insert the tube into the pipe without running into debris . Engineers are also considering a smaller version of a failed containment box . The original device was abandoned because it trapped hydrate crystals which could clog the pipe . `` One of the really critical things is , if you do n't know the flow , it is awfully hard to design the thing that is going to work , '' said Norman Guinasso , director of the geochemical and environmental research group at Texas A&M University . `` This has been going on for weeks and we are just assuming the flow rate is the same . '' The Deepwater Horizon Unified Command -LRB- set up by the Marine Board of Investigation to report on the explosion on 20 April which caused the leak -RRB- posted the first clip on Wednesday . It said the oil and gas were flowing from the larger of the two known leaks on the riser . `` This leak is located approximately 460ft -LRB- 140 metres -RRB- from the top of the blowout preventer and rests on the sea floor at a depth of about 5,000 ft. '' Initial investigations by Congress and government agencies in Louisiana have pointed to a series of equipment failures on the rig , and a culture of lax regulatory oversight of the offshore drilling industry . Deepwater Horizon has heightened sensitivities for offshore drilling world-wide . Off Venezuela , an offshore natural gas platform leased to the national oil company sank early today , and within hours Hugo Ch vez , the president , was on Twitter offering reassurances that all 95 crew were safe and that there was no risk to the environment . Officials said that a tube connecting the rig to the gas field was disconnected and the safety valve sealed . cents This article was amended on 14 and 21 May 2010 .

However , earlier this week he sounded less sanguine when he admitted that the leak is being fought on three fronts : beneath the surface , on the surface and on the shore . At the `` subsea '' level , he said , this was the first time the industry had had to deal with any problems at this depth , and that there was a lot of `` real-time learning going on '' . Hayward promised yesterday that BP would `` fix '' the disaster , which is on course to eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez incident as the biggest US oil spill in history . `` The only question is we do not know when , '' he said . That indicates little progress from last week , when he was unable to give a timescale for when the flow of oil would be stemmed . Nonetheless , he confidently declared on the Thursday before last that BP would `` bounce back '' from the setback . This week he insisted that deep-water drilling would continue in the US despite the growing environmental and political backlash , and came up with this memorable analogy : `` Apollo 13 -LRB- the unsuccessful third mission to the moon in 1970 -RRB- did not stop the space race .

BP is now using undersea robots to try to stem the leak . Photograph : Stan Honda\\/AFP\\/Getty Images BP is using undersea robots to try to thread a small tube into the jagged pipe that is pouring oil into the Gulf of Mexico in the latest attempt to stem the spill from a blown-out well that has pumped out more than 90,000 barrels of crude . The company was trying to move the 15cm diameter tube into the leaking 53cm pipe , known as the riser . The smaller tube will be surrounded by a stopper to keep oil from leaking into the sea , BP said . The plan is for the tube to siphon the oil to a tanker at the surface . Since the 20 April drilling rig explosion which caused the spill , BP , the rig operator and leaseholder , has tried several ideas to plug the leak . In the fateful hours before the Deepwater Horizon exploded about 50 miles off the Louisiana shore , a safety test was supposedly performed to detect if explosive gas was leaking from the mile-deep well . While some information was being transmitted to shore right up until the blast , officials from Transocean , the rig owner , told Congress that the last seven hours of transmissions are missing and that all written logs were lost in the explosion . Earlier tests that suggested explosive gas was leaking were preserved . The missing data poses a problem for investigators unsure what decisions were made during those hours and what warnings might have been ignored . `` There is some delay in the replication of our data so our operational data , our sequence of events ends at 3 o'clock in the afternoon on the 20th , '' Steven Newman , president of Transocean , told a Senate panel . The rig blew up at 10pm , killing 11 workers and unleashing the gusher . Houston lawyer Tony Buzbee , who represents several rig workers involved in the accident , questioned whether what he called `` the phantom test '' was even performed . `` I can just tell you that the Halliburton hands were scratching their heads , '' said Buzbee , whose clients include one of the Halliburton crew members responsible for cementing the well to prepare for moving the drilling rig to another site . Details of a likely blowout scenario emerged this week for the first time from congressional and administrative hearings . They suggest there were both crew mistakes and equipment breakdowns at key points on the day of the explosion . Buzbee said that when Halliburton showed BP and Transocean officials the results of the pressure tests that suggested gas was leaking , the rig workers were put on `` standby '' . Buzbee said one of his clients told him `` the Transocean and BP company people got their heads together '' and 40 minutes later gave the green light . The attorney said the Halliburton crew members were not shown any new test results . `` They said they did their own tests , and they came out OK , '' he said . `` But with the phantom test that Transocean and BP allegedly did , there was no real record or real-time recordation of that test . '' None of the three companies would comment on whether any data or test results were purposely not sent to shore , or on exactly who made the final decision to continue the operations that day . If BP 's tube insertion does n't work , the company could try a second metal containment box , which would be placed over the well and siphon the oil to the surface . The first attempt to stem the flow with a huge containment tower failed on Saturday . The company might also shoot materials of different shapes and sizes into the holes in the blowout preventer a giant piece of machinery that is allowing some of the oil to escape . In this `` junk shot '' , engineers would propel pieces of tyres , golf balls , knotted rope and other items into it in the hope that fragments of the correct size will block the appropriate holes . Once the leak is plugged , heavy mud would be poured in . The leak would then be sealed off with cement . BP also has sprayed chemicals on the oil to break it up into smaller droplets . The size of the spill , as measured from satellites , seems to have grown about 50 % from 10 May to late yesterday , said Hans Graber , director of the University of Miami 's center for southeastern tropical advanced remote sensing . `` There 's a hell of a lot coming out , '' he said . The estimate that 5,000 barrels are leaking daily comes from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and has frequently been cited by BP and the US Coast Guard . Some scientists have said that , based on an analysis of BP 's video of the leak , the flow rate is much higher but others have concluded the video is too grainy to draw any such conclusions .

Photograph : Sarah Lee for the Guardian Tony Hayward , the beleaguered chief executive of BP , has claimed its oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is `` relatively tiny '' compared with the `` very big ocean '' . In an bullish interview with the Guardian at BP 's crisis center in Houston , Hayward insisted that the leaked oil and the estimated 400,000 gallons of dispersant that BP has pumped into the sea to try to tackle the slick should be put in context . `` The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean . The amount of volume of oil and dispersant we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume , '' he said . US authorities estimate that about 5,000 barrels of oil a day are leaking from the damaged pipeline lying on the seabed after attempts to stem the flow failed . The spill began just over three weeks ago when a buildup of gas erupted from a well being drilled by BP in seabed about 1,500 metres -LRB- 5,000 ft -RRB- below sea level . When the gas ignited at the surface , the explosion sunk the rig , the Deepwater Horizon , and 11 workers were killed . Hayward promised that BP would `` fix '' the disaster , which is on course to eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill as the biggest US oil spill in history . `` We will fix it . The only question is we do not know when . '' But the BP boss admitted for the first time that his job was on the line because of the Gulf of Mexico disaster . Asked if he felt his job was already under threat , he replied : `` I do n't at the moment . That of course may change . I will be judged by the nature of the response . '' Hayward stressed that BP 's efforts to contain the spill had succeeded in dispersing the oil and preventing large amounts reaching the shoreline around the Gulf . But environmentalists are concerned about the unseen damage being done to marine life by the oil , which is sinking to the seabed . Hayward said that BP was `` increasingly confident '' that progress was being made in trying to find ways to seal the faulty blow-out preventer , which failed to shut down the well and stem the flow of oil . This week , US politicians attacked BP and the other companies involved in the drilling when they gave evidence at Senate hearings into the disaster . But Hayward insisted that deep-water drilling would continue in the US despite the growing environmental and political backlash against the company . `` Apollo 13 -LRB- the unsuccessful third mission to the moon in 1970 -RRB- did not stop the space race , '' he said . `` Neither did the Air France plane last year coming out of Brazil -LRB- which mysteriously crashed -RRB- stop the world airline industry flying people around the world . It 's the same for the oil industry . '' He pointed out that the Gulf of Mexico , much of it in deep waters , represented one-third of the US 's oil and gas production . He insisted that BP was in far better shape to respond to the disaster than it was five years ago under his predecessor , Lord Browne . In 2005 , 15 workers died in an explosion at BP 's Texas refinery . BP was then fined a record # 53m by the US authorities , who also criticised the company 's safety culture . BP also suffered a pipeline leak in Alaska in 2006 . `` In the last four or five years we have made major improvements in safety performance . It has made the company much better Four years ago it could have been very different , '' Hayward said . BP 's share price has slumped since the disaster . BP told the City yesterday it had now spent $ 450m -LRB- # 304m -RRB- fighting the oil leak , but some analysts put BP 's total bill for the clean-up and damages at $ 23bn . President Barack Obama has now proposed scrapping a cap on BP 's liability for the spill . Transocean , the world 's largest offshore drilling contractor which owned the Deepwater Horizon , filed papers in a Houston court on Thursday seeking to limit its legal liability to $ 27m . Hayward said it was `` unwise '' to speculate about the direct causes of the accident before investigations had been completed . `` There is a lot of speculation , red herrings and hearsay . '' He also admitted that BP had made mistakes in its early response to the crisis . It initially refused to compensate fishermen who were unable to produce written proof of their normal earnings . Most keep no such records . He also said BP had made a mistake when fishermen signing up to help with the relief effort were required to sign agreements limiting their receipt of any future damages from BP . `` It was a bit bumpy to get it going . We made a few little mistakes early on .

Photograph : Joe Raedle\\/Getty Images Scientists have raised urgent new concerns over the latest efforts to mitigate the catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico caused by the oil rig explosion on BP 's Deepwater Horizon . Latest efforts to limit the environmental damage involve an untried deep-water technique , using a toxic dispersant that they believe may damage ocean life . But the new method has so far only succeeded in ratcheting up the growing controversy surrounding the spill . On Friday , Barack Obama appeared to be losing his patience with oil company executives and officials who have been trading blame since the rig exploded . `` I will not tolerate more finger-pointing or irresponsibility , '' he said in the White House rose garden , flanked by members of his cabinet . `` The system failed , and it failed badly . And for that , there is enough responsibility to go around . And all parties should be willing to accept it . '' Approval by the US Environment Protection Agency -LRB- EPA -RRB- for the pumping of tens of thousands of litres of the chemical Corexit 9500 deep on to the seabed early yesterday comes despite warnings from Louisiana state health officials , scientists and fishermen that the technique is untested and potentially hazardous to marine life and the wider ecosystem . Louisiana officials claim BP and the EPA ignored their concerns about how the chemicals may harm the sea floor . This round of attempts to both stop the spill and deal with the oil being spewed out follow the failure to capture the leak by the lowering of a 100-tonne metal box over the damaged seabed wellhead . In the coming days BP will attempt a `` junk shot '' . This involves pumping the damaged blow-out preventer lying on the ocean floor which failed during the explosion that killed 11 workers with golf balls and other material to clog it up before closing it with heavy mud . But it is the use of the chemical dispersant in such depths that has become the increasing focus of concern . Until now , Corexit 9500 has been approved for surface use only . Chemical dispersants break oil into small globules , allowing it to disperse more quickly into the water or air before currents can wash it ashore . Corexit 9500 has been identified as a `` moderate '' human health hazard that can cause eye , skin or respiratory irritation with prolonged exposure . Its makers also warn that it has the tendency to `` bioconcentrate '' in the environment . Louisiana health and hospitals secretary Alan Levine said federal regulators have been too quick to dismiss worries about the chemicals : `` Our concerns about the use of these dispersants underwater is based on the fact that there is virtually no science that supports the use of those chemicals . We 're trading off what we know is going to be environmental damage on the surface for environmental damage of a level we do n't know that is going to be under the surface . '' Carys Mitchelmore , an environmental chemist at the University of Maryland Centre for Environmental Science and a co-author of a 2005 US National Academies report on dispersants , told Nature : `` No one will tell you using dispersants wo n't have an effect . You 're trading one species for another . The long-term effects are really unknown . The dispersant has inherent toxicity . And these oil droplets tend to be the same size as food particles for filter-feeding organisms . '' `` Dispersants are toxic to marine life , so there are trade-offs to consider , '' David Pettit of the Natural Resources Defense Council told the Washington Post last week . `` And just because humans ca n't see oil on the surface does n't mean it 's not still in the water column , affecting marine life from plankton to whales . '' Another toxiciology expert , Dr William Sawyer , who has made a presentation to the US lawyers representing environmental and other interests after the spill has added to the concern : `` The dispersants used in the BP clean-up efforts , known as Corexit 9500 and Corexit EC9527A , are also known as deodorized kerosene , '' he told the group . `` With respect to marine toxicity and potential human health risks , studies of kerosene exposures strongly indicate potential health risks to volunteers , workers , sea turtles , dolphins , breathing reptiles and all species which need to surface for air exchanges , as well as birds and all other mammals . Additionally , I have considered marine species which surface for atmospheric inhalation such as sea turtles , dolphins and other species which are especially vulnerable to aspiration toxicity of Corexit 9500 into the lung while surfacing . '' Meanwhile , concern was mounting that substantial slicks of oil might be on the point of reaching Louisiana 's fragile marshlands . TV footage late on Friday from a helicopter flight over Louisiana 's barrier islands showed miles of slick being washed by waves through wide passes between islands directly toward the wetlands of Terrebonne Parish .

Photograph : John Moore\\/Getty Images Late last Saturday afternoon , the helicopter reeled around for one last low sweep over the wetlands in the Mississippi delta . That was when Melanie Bell , normally a manager for BP 's North American gas business in Houston , spotted a small oily sheen on the water . It was approaching a narrow stretch of beach at the end of a spit at South Point , near where the Mississippi river meets the Gulf of Mexico . Oil from the Deepwater Horizon disaster had finally hit land . On Monday , BP 's staging post at the nearby tiny port of Venice swung into action . Volunteers wearing chemical protection suits waded into the water and combed the beach to begin the clean-up . Not much was found that day , but on each of the following two days , they collected about 450 large sacks of oil , which had emulsified mostly into dime-sized tar balls , and of oily debris . Flying over the same spot again a few days later , Commander Jason Tieman , a reservist in the National Coastguard , explains over the thudding din of the 19-seater Sikorsky helicopter that the big problem was spotting the oil : `` It 's very hard to see from the air . You really need to be on the ground or in a boat . Even then , sometimes you might walk right on top of it , thinking it was seaweed . '' The former tug boat driver was working for a software firm in Houston when he was drafted into the operation . He adds that the staging post had ordered binoculars because there were n't enough to go around : `` They would be useful to spot wildlife . '' On the ground , relief workers are erecting miles of yellow inflatable booms which snake around the edge of the maze of waterways and tiny islands stretching inland as far as the eye can see . Nearby are two wildlife refuges where flamingos and pelican nest . Some 400 miles to the west , at BP 's US headquarters in Houston , Texas , the third floor is a makeshift crisis center . Five hundred staff from BP and other companies are directing efforts to stem the estimated 5,000 barrels of oil spewing each day from the stricken pipeline on the seabed . The atmosphere on Wednesday night in the dimly lit `` mission control room '' a reference to Nasa , which is also based in Houston is tense . Half a dozen engineers huddle in front of one of eight video screens on the wall . It is beaming live images taken by one of the 12 robots trying to fix the leaks on the seabed . A metal claw is grabbing at a mess of wires around a yellow pipe on the blow-out preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- , the vital piece of kit which is designed to shut down a dangerous well , but inexplicably failed . An engineer explains that the robot is attempting to reinstall the `` brain '' of the BOP so that it can reactivate the locked valves to cut off the flow of oil . Suddenly , a voice comes on the line . An engineer identified only as Geoff , on a ship directly above the pipeline and operating the robot remotely , asks : `` Do you want to try it again ? '' The lead engineer speaks into the microphone in front of the screen : `` A couple of experts are saying here it will not fit . '' Geoff replies : `` We can just spin it . '' mission control : `` Roger that . OK , that 's what we 'll do . '' It 's painfully slow and complex work which has never been attempted before in these conditions : the small box-shaped robots , equipped with two claws , are operating in almost freezing water 5,000 ft below the surface , in pitch black and strong currents . Reactivating the BOP in this way could take 10 days and there 's no guarantee it will work . BP , which was showing off its oil spill efforts to journalists and US politicians last week , wants the world to know the lengths to which it is going to tackle the spill . The statistics , which the company updates most days , are certainly impressive : 2,500 BP staff from around the world have been drafted in , 200 government , fishing and environmental organizations are also involved in the effort , along with 160 different companies . The terms BP uses are deliberately militaristic , to signal its serious intent : an `` armada '' of 200 vessels is skimming the water near the source of the spill , then processing and removing the oil . Hercules transporters and dozens of other planes are also `` bombing the hell out of it -LRB- the spill -RRB- with dispersant '' . BP has 15,000 `` armed '' fishermen and other volunteers closer to shore on its payroll . BP chief executive Tony Hayward admits to resorting to Churchillian language : he describes a battle on three fronts the subsea -LRB- at the source of the spill -RRB- , the surface and the `` enormous defense of the beaches operation '' . BP 's US headquarters are on the `` energy corridor '' , a freeway on the edge of Houston where the corporate headquarters of Shell , ExxonMobil and ConocoPhilips , among others , are based . The spill is n't just bad news for BP : it is likely to result in tougher regulations on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico for everyone . BP faces an onslaught from the media and US politicians ; last week senators mauled the company , along with its contractors on the Deepwater Horizon rig Transocean and Halliburton during hearings into the disaster . Big Oil is pulling together to help out BP , according to Kent Wells , head of the communications effort at the crisis center . `` It 's unbelievable teamwork between companies which are normally competitors but are now working together , '' he says . `` We all know there is finger-pointing going on in Washington , but there 's no finger-pointing going on here . '' Friends from more unlikely quarters have also emerged . Members of the public have been emailing US journalists covering the story offering their help . James Cameron , the director of movies Avatar and Titanic , also called BP 's press office , offering to lend the company his fleet of manned submarines . He used the submarines to take 3D images of the Titanic shipwreck to help him research his film possibly an ominous sign for BP , which politely declined the offer . Hayward claims not to have read any newspapers or watched the news since he flew out to the US two days after the accident to oversee the operation : `` I do not want my judgment to be clouded by what is being written about me . '' He ca n't be blamed for wanting to stay focused . He needs to : some estimate that the spill could cost BP $ 23bn -LRB- # 18bn -RRB- and tarnish its reputation for years . He flew out to the US two days after the accident , and has only been back to the UK for 36 hours to pack more bags . He promises to remain in the US until the spill is fixed . The Observer met him on Wednesday evening , at the end of a typically long day . His first meeting had taken place at 6am , when he led a tour of the Houston crisis center for US interior secretary Ken Salazar and energy secretary Steven Chu . Most days he also tours the dozen or so staging posts and command centres dotted around the coast . Hayward , who stays in a nearby hotel , said most nights he slept five or six hours each night , but added : `` Some nights I 've not slept very well . Not -LRB- because I was -RRB- worrying but thinking how we can stay ahead of it -LRB- the spill -RRB- . '' One BP colleague said : `` He has balls of steel . '' Hayward , who has a degree in geology , mounted a robust defense of BP 's recent safety record . While conceding that , with hindsight , BP should have had a contingency plan in place for dealing with such an accident , he insisted : `` Our safety track record in the Gulf of Mexico is the best in the industry . '' He was also surprisingly confident that BP would be able to control the spill and limit the damage : `` The containment exercise on the surface is proving to be extraordinarily successful . Through a combination of dispersant , booming , skimming and burning , we are containing the spill . '' Asked how BP could ever quantify the damage caused by the spill , he just says `` we will measure it '' , without saying how . Jacqueline Savitz , a scientist specialising in marine biology and environmental toxicology at campaign group Oceana , says the long-term effects of the spill may never be known . For example , Atlantic Blue Fin tuna are currently spawning in the Gulf of Mexico only one of two places in the world where this happens and the larvae are very sensitive to higher levels of toxins . The effects are long term , affecting the reproductive abilities of the fish , she says . To date , the recorded impact on wildlife has been tiny , which BP attributes to the fact that it has prevented most of the oil hitting land . According to the US Fish and Wildlife Service , which is working with BP across its command centres , only 20 `` oiled '' birds have been found . Ten were dead , one died in the rehabilitation facility and another was `` euthanised '' . But Savitz says that most of the birds and fish die from the spill out to sea and will not wash ashore , never to be seen , let alone counted . Often they are eaten by other animals , passing on the toxicity . `` You obviously ca n't count how many zooplankton are being impacted , '' she says . While using an estimated 400,000 gallons of dispersant so far is helping to keep the oil from reaching the shore and killing birds , the higher levels of toxicity will be more damaging to fish , she says . `` But it certainly helps BP 's public relations story if oil is not hitting the shore , '' she adds . Back at the staging post at Venice , the makeshift camp of trailers and pre-fabricated buildings which have sprung up in the past fortnight are taking on a more permanent feel . Slade Brockett , the staging area manager , has ordered two giant plasma screens and board games to help the workers and volunteers unwind . Rotas are being rearranged to schedule days off as the strain of working 16 - or 17-hour days starts to tell . The enthusiasm and can-do attitude of those involved is genuine . Brockett , a project engineer drafted in from BP 's Cherry Point refinery near Washington , told journalists : `` I called my wife on mother 's day . I know it 's not something you 're supposed to say , but I told her how much fun I was having . '' Perhaps mindful of BP 's watching public relations team , he also added more cautiously : `` I have been pleasantly surprised by how little oil has landed . We know we have been relatively blessed so far , but we have to be prepared for weather changes . '' For all the undoubtedly impressive efforts of BP and everyone else involved , a vast amount of oil continues to spew into the Gulf of Mexico every day . Hayward said he was `` increasingly confident '' that steps to reactivate the BOP and shut down the well would work . If they do n't and other methods also fail oil will keep leaking for at least another three months , when the first of two relief wells is expected to be in place to plug the existing well . But the crisis for BP does n't end there . It faces years of litigation from affected communities and over liability for the accident , which killed 11 workers . Politicians are also clamouring for tighter regulations on the industry . BP , directing a military-style clean-up operation with its army of volunteers , wants to show that it , and the industry , can be trusted to operate safely . Whether its undoubtedly impressive efforts to turn a disastrous situation into merely a terrible one will convince its critics remains to be seen .

Photograph : Gerald Herbert\\/Pool\\/EPA Ocean scientists in the Gulf of Mexico have found giant plumes of oil coagulating at up to 1,300 metres below the surface , raising fears that the BP oil spill may be larger than thought and that it might create huge `` dead zones '' . Members of the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology have been traversing the area around the scene of the Deepwater Horizon , the rig that exploded and sank on 20 April . Using the latest sampling techniques , they have identified plumes up to 20 miles away from the Deepwater Horizon well head that continues to spew oil into the water at a rate of at least 790,000 litres a day . The largest plume found so far was 90 metres thick , three miles wide and 10 miles long . Samantha Joye , marine science professor at the University of Georgia , who is working on the project , told the Guardian : `` The plumes are abundant throughout the region . I would say they 've become characteristic of this environment . '' BP last night announced the first good news in several days in its efforts to contain the spill , saying it had succeeded in inserting a tube into the riser , the broken pipe from which most of the oil is gushing , allowing oil and gas to be siphoned off into a drill ship at the surface . The procedure , likened to threading a needle , failed early on Sunday morning , but a second attempt succeeded . Kent Wells , a BP executive , said he had no idea how much oil and gas was now being safely siphoned off . The firm intended slowly to increase the volume until they had reached the maximum possible , he said , though no figures could be put to that either . Wells added that in the next 10 days BP would try to block off the entire riser using heavy materials which , if successful , would kill the leak for good . The presence of huge strings of oil deep underwater has puzzled scientists on board the research vessel Pelican , back in dock after almost two weeks at sea . The assumption had been that the oil would rise to the surface , but instead it has formed into multiple layers suspended in varying thicknesses deep in the water . There is speculation that the plumes , first reported by the New York Times , might be forming as a result of BP 's use of dispersants injected close to the source of the spillage at the sea floor . The technique has never before been used , and scientists are now wondering whether the dispersants are causing the oil to coagulate into relatively large clumps which are then heavier than water and remain suspended below the surface of the sea . One concern linked to the plumes is that the oil will reduce oxygen levels in the water as micro-organisms work to decompose it . In some parts of the Gulf , oxygen levels are already almost one-third below normal . If they fall below levels needed to support life , dead zones devoid of all marine creatures could be created . The Pelican scientists , from the University of Mississippi , have been using a range of gadgetry to detect the plumes . They include fluorometers that spot oil using color measurements , a remotely operated vehicle that they submerge to describe oil aggregates at up to 75 metres below the surface , and equipment that records oxygen levels . They have set up a long-term acoustic monitoring device on the sea floor that will pick up marine mammal calls to help track the impact on population sizes over time . As knowledge grows of the environmental impact , pressure is mounting on both BP and the Obama administration . The oil giant has been accused of trying to withhold the full scale of the disaster . Some experts who have studied video footage of the oil spewing from the wellhead have estimated the rate of spillage at up to 13m litres a day 14 times greater than BP 's figure . The US government is also coming under scrutiny for the way it has handled the crisis , and for having had too relaxed an attitude towards offshore drilling before the disaster happened . One environmental group , the Centre for Biological Diversity , has threatened to sue the administration for having bypassed regulations in approving new drilling sites . The center says that more than 300 drilling operations have been given the go-ahead since Obama took office in January 2009 , without obtaining proper permits relating to protection of whales and other marine mammals .

BP 's tube can collect an amount of oil equal to 1,000 of these each day . But between 4,000 and 99,000 barrels per day are still leaking into the Gulf of Mexico . Photograph : Kay Nietfeld\\/Corbis The company said that it would now be able to capture 1,000 barrels of oil a day after inserting a small tube into the end of the broken pipeline lying on the seabed . Official estimates put the spill at 5,000 barrels of oil a day , but some scientists say the spill could be as much as 100,000 barrels daily . BP says there is no way to measure it accurately . BP began funnelling some of the leaking oil and gas using the tube yesterday . The tube , 4 inches in diameter , has been inserted into the 21-inch diameter pipeline . A BP spokesman said the company hoped later this week to divert more than the 1,000 barrels of oil per day now envisaged . He said the ramp-up would be slow to prevent the build-up of crystal-like gas hydrates , which have hampered previous efforts to stem the flow . He did not give the maximum amount the tube could divert and BP released a statement cautioning that this was a new technology , so `` both its continued operation and its effectiveness in capturing the oil and gas remain uncertain '' . BP is storing the captured oil in vessels on the surface and flaring the gas . The company said it hoped to stop the leak entirely when it attempts to re-activate the blow-out preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- , which failed to shut down the well , as designed , in a week . BP engineers working in a crisis center at the company 's US headquarters in Houston say they assume each attempt to stem the flow will fail , so always have an alternative plan . Chief operating officer Doug Suttles told the US news channel CNN : `` We 're throwing absolutely everything at this . '' Journalists ringing BP 's general press inquiry number in the US for information about the disaster are greeted with a recording asking for anyone with `` suggestions about possible technical solutions '' to get in touch . Concern is also growing that vast plumes of oil are forming beneath the surface , creating huge `` dead zones '' where marine life can not survive . BP has pumped more than 500,000 gallons of chemical dispersant into the sea , much of it at the source of the leak . Scientists say these unprecedented quantities of dispersant are preventing most of the oil from reaching the surface but could be making the pollution worse . BP staff involved in the oil spill response operation are providing conflicting accounts of the effects of the dispersant . Ian Cavanagh , vice-president for subsea , surface and wells and one of BP 's leadership team directing the response based in Houma in Louisiana , told the Guardian last week that the effect of the dispersant was to break the oil down into smaller and smaller separate molecules until they dispersed into the eco-system . But Melanie Bell , operations team leader with oversight of the near shore booming and shoreline clean-up operations in the Venice area , said that the dispersant , oil and water were forming jelly-like blobs , which were washing up on the shore . A BP spokesman admitted that dispersant , which toxicologists liken to very strong detergent , is less effective if it comes into contact with oil that has already been in water for several days . The chief executive of the British oil company , Tony Hayward , sparked controversy last week when he told the Guardian that the amount of leaking oil and dispersant used were `` relatively tiny '' compared with the `` very big ocean '' of the Gulf of Mexico . The faulty BOP has been subpoenaed by US investigators . BP has been taking images of the device using underwater robots , which it believes will exonerate it of any blame for the accident , which is on course to surpass the Exxon Valdez spill as the worst oil disaster in US history . Even when the well is shut down , BP says it will take three or four months to bring the 450 tonne BOP to shore to be examined properly .

Photograph : KPA\\/Zuma\\/Rex Features The vast deepwater methane hydrate deposits of the Gulf of Mexico are an open secret in big energy circles . They represent the most tantalizing new frontier of unconventional energy a potential source of hydrocarbon fuel thought to be twice as large as all the petroleum deposits ever known . For the oil and gas industry , the substances are also known to be the primary hazard when drilling for deepwater oil . Methane hydrates are volatile compounds natural gas compressed into molecular cages of ice . They are stable in the extreme cold and crushing weight of deepwater , but are extremely dangerous when they build up inside the drill column of a well . If destabilized by heat or a decrease in pressure , methane hydrates can quickly expand to 164 times their volume . Survivors of the BP rig explosion told interviewers that right before the April 20 blast , workers had decreased the pressure in the drill column and applied heat to set the cement seal around the wellhead . Then a quickly expanding bubble of methane gas shot up the drill column before exploding on the platform on the ocean 's surface . Even a solid steel pipe has little chance against a 164-fold expansion of volume something that would render a man six feet six inches tall suddenly the height of the Eiffel Tower . Scientists are well aware of the awesome power of these strange hydrocarbons . A sudden large scale release of methane hydrates is believed to have caused a mass extinction 55 million years ago . Among planners concerned with mega-disasters , their sudden escape is considered to be a threat comparable to an asteroid strike or nuclear war . The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , a Livermore , Ca.-based weapons design center , reports that when released on a large scale , methane hydrates can even cause tsunamis . So it is not surprising to anyone who knows about the physics of these compounds that the Deepwater Horizon rig was lost like a waterfly crumpled by a force of nature scientists are still just getting to know . Number One Deepwater Drilling Issue SolveClimate contacted scientists at the Colorado School of Mines , Center for Hydrate Research , who focus on the fundamental science and engineering of methane hydrates to gain further insight . They did not want to speculate on the role that methane hydrates could have played in the BP disaster , but they were willing to provide a basic understanding of the nature and behavior of these familiar but little understood substances . `` Gas hydrates are the number one flow assurance issue in deepwater drilling , '' Carolyn Koh , an associate professor and co-director of the Hydrate Center , told us in an exclusive interview . She explained that the oil and gas industry has a lot of experience with methane hydrates , because they have to be kept from forming in pipes or they will clog the lines , stop the flow of oil , and pose a danger . Drillers use inhibitors such as methanol to keep the hydrates from crystallizing inside drill rigs operating at great depth , where conditions for methane hydrate formation are ideal . This film clip of an experiment conducted on the ocean floor near the Deepwater Horizon drilling site demonstrates how quickly and easily methane hydrates can form . It was conducted by the Gulf of Mexico Hydrates Research Consortium aboard the Seward Johnson in September 2006 . The voices of the scientists conducting the experiment are clearly audible . The clip shows with remarkable clarity a robotic arm maneuvering a clear tube over a stream of hydrate bubbles emanating from a crater on the sea floor . Within minutes , gas trapped in the tube begins to form a visible solid a white ice matrix thanks to the extreme cold and pressure of the ocean depth . When the tube is inverted , the hydrate , less dense than seawater , floats out of the tube , dissociating into its components , gas and water . Oil and gas drillers encounter far greater volumes of methane hydrate than the gentle stream of bubbles escaping from a small fissure that are shown in the film . Amadeu Sum , an assistant professor at the Colorado School of Mines and also a co-director of the Hydrate Center , explained that methane hydrates can be encountered by drillers in the deep ocean where methane hydrates are trapped in sediments beneath the ocean floor . Vast Deposits in Ocean Sediments Professor Sum explained gas and oil flow up the pipe together in normal drilling operations . These hydrocarbons occur naturally together in conventional drilling operations . The deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico , and other places where methane hydrates exist , present drillers with special safety challenges . For one thing , methane hydrates are believed to exist in vast deposits underneath the ocean floor , trapped by nature in ocean sediments . Deepwater drillers could find themselves drilling through these natural hydrate deposits . Professor Sum said geologists know much less about these hydrate-bearing sediments than conventional ocean sediments , and that there is `` little knowledge of the risks '' of drilling into them . The Deepwater Horizon rig was drilling in Block 252 of an area known as the Mississippi Canyon of the Gulf , thought to contain methane hydrate-bearing sediments , according to government maps . The platform was operating less than 20 miles from a methane hydrate research site located in the same canyon at Block 118 . From the sea floor a mile down , the Deepwater Horizon rig had penetrated another 18,000 feet almost another five miles down into the earth 's crust with pipe . According to the National Academy of Sciences , which published a bullish report on the energy potential of methane hydrates , `` Industry practice is to avoid methane-bearing areas during drilling for conventional oil and gas resources for safety reasons . '' Professor Sum explained that because `` with oil there is usually gas present , '' it is possible for methane hydrates to form in the pipe even when not drilling through hydrate-bearing sediments . The pressure and cold of the deepwater create conditions that encourage gas flowing into the pipe to form hydrates , and if the rate of crystallization is rapid enough , the hydrates can clog the pipe . The cofferdam that BP lowered over the broken pipe gushing oil to contain the spill was almost immediately clogged by methane hydrates , which formed spontaneously . Gas escaping with the oil from the well , when trapped in the steel structure with cold water under great pressure , rapidly accumulated into an ice-like matrix . In a book about methane hydrates , which Professor Koh co-authored , brief mention is made of a case in which methane hydrates caused a gas pipe to rupture on land , leading to loss of life . Two workers were attempting to clear a line in which a hydrate plug had formed . The authors say that `` the impact of a moving hydrate mass '' caused the pipe to fail . The explosion caused a large piece of pipe to strike the foreman , killing him . The book then quotes from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers Hydrate Guidelines to describe proper procedures for safely removing a hydrate plug in a pipe on land . SolveClimate was not able to find more detailed public documentation of this incident in Alberta , but mention is made in an article in a publication of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory , a federal research center associated with the Department of Energy , of a different unspecified incident on a drilling rig . `` Forces from methane hydrate dissociation have been blamed for a damaging shift in a drilling rig 's foundation , causing a loss of $ 100 million , '' the article reports . Although public discussion of damage from methane hydrate accidents appears to be minimal , the danger is well-recognized within the industry . Last November , one Halliburton executive gave a presentation before a meeting of the American Association of Drilling Engineers in Houston , titled `` Deepwater Cementing Consideration to Prevent Hydrate Destabilization . '' It recognizes that the cementing process releases heat which can destabilize methane hydrates , and presents something called Cement System 2 as a solution to the problem . One of the graphs shows that the system does n't achieve gel strength for four hours . Yet according to an eyewitness report broadcast on Sunday on 60 Minutes , BP managers made the decision to decrease pressure in the well column by removing drilling mud before the cement had solidified in three plugs Halliburton had poured . When a surge of gas started shooting up the well , a crucial seal on the blowout preventer at the well head on the ocean floor failed . It had been damaged weeks before and neglected as inconsequential by Transocean managers , according to the CBS news broadcast , even after chunks of rubber emerged from the drilling column on the surface . According to the Associated Press , the victims of the Deepwater Horizon explosion said the blast occurred right after workers `` introduced heat to set the cement seal around the wellhead . '' It is not known if Halliburton was employing Cement System 2 , and testifying before the Senate last week , a Halliburton executive made no mention of methane hydrate hazards associated with cementing in deepwater . Professors Koh and Sum are concerned that a focus on the dangers of methane hydrates in deepwater drilling will obscure their promise as an energy solution of the future . They are conducting research in the laboratory to create methane hydrates synthetically in order to take advantage of their peculiar properties . With their potential to store gas -LRB- both natural gas and hydrogen -RRB- efficiently within a crystalline structure , hydrogen hydrates could one day offer a potential solution for making fuel cells operate economically . Still at the fundamental stage , their work on storage is not yet complete enough to apply to commercial systems . At the same time , there is an international competition underway to develop technology to harvest the vast deposits of methane hydrates in the world 's oceans . Japan has joined the US and Canada in pursuit of this energy bonanza , motivated by the $ 23 billion it spends annually to import liquefied natural gas . According to a Bloomberg News article called `` Japan Mines Flammable Ice , Flirts with Environmental Disaster , '' the Japanese trade ministry is targeting 2016 to start commercial production , even as a Tokyo University scientist warned against causing a massive undersea landslide that could suddenly trigger a massive methane hydrate release . The U.S. has a research program underway in collaboration with the oil industry , authorized by the Methane Hydrate Research and Development Act of 1999 . The National Methane Hydrates R&D Program is housed at the National Energy Technology Laboratory -LRB- NETL -RRB- of the Department of Energy . The National Academy of Sciences provided a briefing for Congress last January on the energy potential of methane hydrates based on its report which asserts that `` no technical challenges have been identified as insurmountable '' in the pursuit of commercial production of methane hydrates . In the wake of the BP oil disaster , SolveClimate attempted to contact Dr. Charles Paull of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute , the lead author of the report . He was unavailable for comment , attending an international workshop on methane hydrates research in New Zealand from May 10-12 , and according to his assistant , out of email contact .

Photograph : Patrick Semansky\\/AP There 's worrying news from the House of Representative 's commerce and energy committee hearing on the size of the oil spill from BP 's broken Deepwater Horizon well in the Gulf of Mexico . According to independent experts testifying before the subcommittee hearing , the daily spill estimate of 5,000 barrels , used by BP and government agencies in recent weeks , is far too low . The real figure is more likely to range between 20,000 barrels a day or up to 100,000 barrels a day with the experts arguing that because BP was not releasing vital data , it was difficult to make an accurate estimate . Some of the most chilling testimony came from Steve Wereley , a professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University . Based on the latest video that BP released , he told the committee that the two wellhead leaks combined to gush 95,000 barrels a day into the Gulf of Mexico , with 70,000 barrels from the largest leak and 25,000 from the smaller . Wereley also said his estimate could be wrong by plus or minus 20 % so the daily rate of leakage would be between 76,000 and 104,000 barrels a day . He told the committee : `` The media keeps using the 5,000 barrel a day estimate , but there is scientifically no chance ... BP 's estimate is nowhere near correct . It is certainly larger . '' He later said : `` I do n't see any possibility , any scenario under which their number is accurate . '' Update : My colleague Suzanne Goldenberg , the Guardian 's US environment correspondent , interviewed Wereley last week about how he arrived at his estimates : Wereley told the Guardian he based his estimate on techniques which track the speed of objects traveling in the flow stream . `` You can see in the video lots of swirls and vortices pumping out of the end of the pipe , and I used a computer code to track those swirls and come up with the speed at which the oils is shooting out of the pipe , '' he said . `` From there it is a very simple calculation to figure out what is the volume flow .

Photograph : Spillcam One month after the fiery collapse of the Deepwater Horizon , BP bowed to demands from scientists and members of Congress this week and has posted a live video feed of the gusher of oil on the ocean floor . The decision came only hours after a hearing in Congress in which BP was accused of withholding data from the ocean floor , and blocking efforts by independent scientists to come up with estimates for the amount of crude spewing into the Gulf each day . Ed Markey , who presided over the hearing , said BP would post the footage on the website of his house subcommitte on energy independence and global warming as early as Wednesday night . It was delayed but is now live . The footage could help defuse rising anger at BP from scientists and news organizations at the oil company 's reluctance even to discuss the size of the spill . BP has refused to share data gathered by cameras on its submersible robots . Its officials have also insisted repeatedly that it is impossible to determine the size of the spill . The lack of disclosure put BP under fire yesterday . `` Oil has been spewing into the ocean for 30 days yet the true extent of this spill remains a mystery , '' an angry Markey told the hearing yesterday . `` BP thinks this is their ocean so they should control information about the spill . '' The Obama administration too was criticised for sticking to its early estimates of 5,000 barrels a day a much lower estimate than those produced by independent scientists . The coast guard said this week it was assembling a team of experts to produce an estimate of the spill . Earlier yesterday , four independent scientists told Markey 's committee that BP 's refusal to release the footage was blocking independent efforts to estimate the size of the spill . Richard Camilli , a scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute , said BP had intitially reached out to experts for help in measuring the spill . He was set to fly to Houston to join the effort at 3am on 5 May . A day later , BP called off the visit . `` The rationale was that they were on a very tight time schedule , '' he said . `` The greater priority was to place the containment structure over the main leak '' an effort that failed . Frank Muller-Karger , an oceanographer at the University of South Florida , told the hearing the full consequences of the spill or of the chemicals used in the clean-up effort remained unknown . `` I think this is a problem we are going to have to live with for years rather than months , '' he said . Before last night 's decision , BP had released just two short pieces of video from the ocean floor frustrating scientists who had been trying to estimate the size of the spill . But experts still managed to use the first clip , which was barely 30 seconds long and low-resolution , to produce estimates that were many times larger than the Obama administration estimate of 5,000 barrels a day . Steve Wereley , an associate professor at Purdue University who was also at yesterday 's briefing , came up with an estimate of 70,000 barrels a day . He told the committee yesterday he could not conceive of a scenario where the flow of oil from the ruptured well was only 5,000 barrels a day . `` All outsider estimates are considerably higher than BP 's .

Photograph : Stephane Jourdain\\/AFP\\/Getty Images The White House directed BP to cut its use of chemical dispersants to break up the Louisiana oil slick by as much as 50 % yesterday , reflecting concerns that the clean-up of the spill could be worsening the economic disaster in the Gulf of Mexico . Lisa Jackson , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , said the Obama administration wanted the oil company to scale back its use of chemicals on the water surface . The order came amid increasing tension between the administration and the oil company about how to manage the oil on the ocean floor , more than a month after the sinking of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig . `` I am recommending as strongly as we can that we absolutely minimize the use of dispersants and that we monitor as rigorously as we can , '' she told a conference call with reporters touring Louisiana marshes contaminated by the oil . She said she thought BP would be able to cut its use of chemicals to break up the spill by half or even 75 % by injecting smaller quantities underwater . The directive is in line with a hardening of administration 's rhetoric against BP . With thick brown sheets of crude oil now washing up on shore , the White House as well as the oil company is feeling the pressure of not stopping the leak . Louisiana 's governor , Bobby Jindal , said he had warned the administration for days that the booms deployed by BP would not keep back the oil . He has said some 65 miles of Louisiana 's coastline is affected , contaminating oyster beds and coating pelicans and sea turtles in oil . Independent scientists and members of Congress have also been warning about BP 's heavy reliance on a dispersant called Corexit which is banned in the UK because it is harmful for marine life . BP has poured more than 650,000 gallons of the chemical on to the spill . Scientists told congressional hearings last week that Corexit was more toxic and less effective than other dispersants on the market . Conservationists fear the chemical could further jeopardise already depleted stocks of fish such as Atlantic bluefin tuna or poison endangered species of turtle . The Centre for Biological Diversity petitioned the Obama administration yesterday to protect the bluefin tuna as an endangered species . The move would compel the administration to consider the consequences of offshore drilling before sanctioning any more oil rigs . Jackson directed the EPA last week to seek out alternative chemicals within 24 hours , but admitted yesterday that BP had continued to use Corexit to break up the spill . She and the coast guard commander , Mary Landry , defended the use of the chemical , arguing it had prevented a more devastating landfall of heavy crude . But she admitted the longterm consequences of using enormous quantities of the chemical over such a long period of time were unresolved . `` It is clear to me that the science of dispersants has not in any way kept up with our ability to drill and use fossifl fuels and that is a huge disconnect , '' she said .

Photograph : Hans Deryk\\/REUTERS BP 's latest plan to stop oil leaking from its subsea well is called a `` top kill '' . The procedure , which could last two days , has been successful in the past , but has never been attempted at such depths before . The process works by forcing `` heavy mud '' into the well to overcome the rising oil and shut down the flow . If the mud does the job , engineers will follow up by pumping concrete into the well to plug the leak . BP has several boats in the region holding a total of 50,000 barrels of heavy mud , far more than the company believes it will need . Heavy mud is made by mixing a natural mineral called barite with water and sometimes polymers to thicken the mixture . To kill the well , the heavy mud is pumped from one of the surface vessels to BP 's offshore platform that floats above the well . From here , it is channelled down a drill pipe into two narrower hoses , which pass into a manifold on the seafloor . The manifold controls the flow of mud through two more hoses into the `` blowout preventer '' unit that sits on top of the well on the sea floor . BP plans to pump mud into the well at a rate of 50 barrels a minute , enough , the company hopes , to overwhelm the pressure of the rising oil , forcing it back down into the well . If the procedure goes wrong , it could make the leak worse . Mud that is pumped into the well might be forced out of the top of the blowout preventer and into the riser , from where the oil is leaking . The sudden rush of mud may cause more oil to leak out . If engineers think too much mud is being forced out of the top of the blowout preventer , instead of going down into the well , they can use the manifold to pump in what is called a `` junk shot '' . The junk shot contains pieces of tyre , golf balls and bits of rope , which should clog up the blowout preventer and stop the mud and oil leaking out . BP puts the chances of the top kill working at somewhere between 60 and 70 % . One difficulty is that the leak is a mile underwater , far too deep for divers to do the complex work of checking that all the pipes are connected properly . If the top kill fails , BP will move on to its next plan , which is to use what is called a lower marine riser package -LRB- LMRP -RRB- cap . In this option , engineers cut the damaged riser pipe from the top of the blowout preventer and lower the LMRP on top . Provided the cap forms a good enough seal , the LMRP can direct oil coming up from the well through a fresh section of piping to the Discoverer Enterprise ship on the surface . Another option BP is investigating involves lowering a new blowout preventer onto the old one to shut off the leak .

The manifold controls the flow of mud through two more hoses into the `` blowout preventer '' unit that sits on top of the well on the sea floor . 2.33 pm : Something is stirring 5,000 feet below the sea . BP 's live video floor from the sea-bed has sprung to life , showing many different views of the machinery around the well-head -LRB- I 'm guessing , it may be all in a swimming pool in Houston of course -RRB- . If you want to follow it live on the web then the link is here , with the catchy title of `` Live video link from the ROV monitoring the damaged riser '' . But be warned : it 's very slow and jerky , and if your browser is anything like mine , then it will slow your ` puter down to a 1995-era PC . Throughout the extended top kill procedure which may take up to two days to complete - very significant changes in the appearance of the flows at the seabed may be expected . These will not provide a reliable indicator of the overall progress , or success or failure , of the top kill operation as a whole . BP will report on the progress of the operation as appropriate and on its outcome when complete . In other words , do n't be alarmed , BP 's got everything ... well , just do n't be alarmed . No word about what happens if sentient giant squid appear and launch their scheme for world domination although that may be the plot for `` Top Kill : The Movie '' . 3.04 pm : CNN are speaking to an oil expert named Eric Smith from Tulane University 's energy institute , and he thinks everyone is being too pessimistic about top kill 's chances of success . He reckons it has a 70 % chance of success , based on the fact that the technique has been used multiple times in the past . Asked why if it 's such a good idea then why did n't BP try it earlier instead of waiting 37 days , Smith said that engineers have a `` mindset '' whereby they try all the safe options first . 3.15 pm : Oh and here 's some not-good news from the Christian Science Monitor -LRB- despite the name it 's a very reputable publication in the US , for those of you who are n't familiar with it -RRB- : There is a possibility that the top-kill could backfire , breaking the flow of oil wide open from where it 's currently restricted as it moves through a the crumpled `` riser '' pipe left lying on the Gulf floor after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank on April 22 . 3.17 pm : So it has come to this Democratic Senator Bill Nelson on cable news right now : `` If this thing does n't work then the President has got to turn this over to the US military . '' That leaves CNN 's idiot anchor to start speculating about using the US navy 's nuclear submarines . And they are meant to do what , exactly ? 3.28 pm : Wow , CNN anchor Rick Sanchez is asking a retired admiral some very silly questions , such as why ca n't we use our nuclear submarines ? -LRB- Because they could n't do anything , the admiral says gently . -RRB- But then Sanchez goes one step further in demanding to know why the US military are n't being used in the Gulf right now : We see our guys over there solving the problems of the Iraqis ... and now it 's our country that 's in need , why ca n't we use those boots on the ground to solve our problems in our country ? Who needs Fox News when CNN has comedy gold like that ? 3.40 pm : The White House has announced that President Obama is to cut short a visit to Chicago on Friday to make another trip to the Gulf of Mexico and visit the site of the spill . More from Florida 's Senator Bill Nelson , who wants the US government to take over running the whole operation and put the military in charge : `` The military has an apparatus , the organization by which it can bring together the civilian agencies of government and to get this thing done . '' Nelson 's comments reflect growing frustration among lawmakers in Congress even in the president 's own party that the administration has not done enough to stop the spill and quell the damage . 4pm : So what is actually going down there ? Looking at the BP live feed , most of the shots are of the blow out preventer 's valves , in particular the so-called `` kill valve '' and choke valve . In normal operations the value would have a tube or line attached to the oil rig at the surface , but of course since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded last month they are n't . According to experts being interviewed on cable news , lines have been added to the valves - and in some shots tubes can been seen with the markings `` kill '' and `` BOP '' -LRB- for blow out preventer -RRB- and arrows . These are presumably now pumping heavy mud into the valves right now . How we will know if the top kill is working ? The oil leak at the riser at the top of the damaged blow out preventer will start to change color once the mud has been pumped down to a sufficient depth , from its current dark gray or black to a light gray , signifying that mud and not oil is leaking out . 4.30 pm : So it 's all about the state of the blow out preventer . It has been damaged and will have to cope with enormous pressure : 50,000 pounds of heavy drilling mud pumped at high velocity . So ... how are those relief wells coming along ? 5pm : Bobby Jindal , the governor of Louisiana , holds a press conference but because of his habit of speaking at such a rapid pace that youcanbarelyunderstandhim it 's hard to tell what he wants , other than more resources , or as Bobby calls it , `` moreresources '' , or even `` moresources '' . More seriously , Jindal says that more than 100 miles of Louisiana coast have now been affected by the oil spill . 5.30 pm : The Centre for American Progress 's Wonk Room blog has a good piece on what the federal government should be doing as of now : But if government has little choice but to keep the perpetrator on the job at the immediate crime scene , it does have a choice when it comes to operations beyond the urgent task of quelling the erupting well . In addition to the efforts to stop the leaks , BP now controls claims processing , environmental contractors on land and sea , volunteer assistance , access to the disaster site , and data collection . Federal and state governments in the gulf must take greater charge of containing the ecological impacts and coordinating the response , as the President has full authority to do . 6.00 pm : Here 's a video animation from the Deepwater Horizon response team that should make what 's happening today even clearer . It 's silent so do not adjust your laptop . 6.37 pm : Tony Hayward , the chief executive of BP , steps up to the camera to make a statement . Everyone is working very hard , he says , and then remarks that he 's sure everyone is watching the video feed . `` I 'm sure it 's not really an indication of what 's going on ... we will be continuing for another 24 hours , and it will be another 24 hours before we know if it 's successful . '' And with that he walks off camera . 7pm : Latest opinion poll shows that Obama and the administration is getting heat , along with BP , for the response to the Gulf oil spill . From USA Today : The response to the disaster by energy giant BP , President Obama and the federal government all get terrible grades from Americans in a USA TODAY\\/Gallup Poll . Nearly three-fourths of those surveyed Monday and Tuesday say BP is doing a `` poor '' or `` very poor '' job in handling the calamity . Six of 10 say that of the federal government . And a 53 % majority give Obama a poor rating . Good news , however : there does appear to be a shift in public sentiment towards future oil exploration . Now , 53 % of Americans say protection of the environment should be given priority , `` even at the risk of limiting energy supplies '' , which is a turnaround from previous surveys . 7.15 pm : So , five hours into `` top kill '' and we 're still waiting to hear what the outcome is going to be with BP saying it may be another 24 hours before the success or failure is known . There 's a lot riding on this , obvious . Public anger at the response and clean-up is building , and if this fails then the White House will be expected to do something more dramatic to take charge of the clean-up , at the very least . You might think things ca n't get any worse , although documents revealed at a congressional hearing earlier today suggest that the company may have low-balled its earliest estimates of the size of the oil leak , saying one thing in public while contemporary internal documents showed much higher estimates : In today 's natural resources hearing on the BP disaster , -LRB- congressman -RRB- Ed Markey brought out proof that BP knew it was lying about the flow of oil from its disaster . He brought two BP documents showing that even when their Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles was giving low-ball estimates of 1,000 BBL\\/day , BP 's own internal documents showed that their best guess was 5,000 . Presumably BP would be very , very happy if the US government took charge . Asked directly about the operation 's progress so far , Suttles replied : `` It 's too hard to say we 've all been here a long time and ridden the roller-coaster , and we just need to wait 24 hours and see . '' He said that so far 7,000 barrels of mud had been pumped into the valves of the blow out protector through its choke line and kill line , and that was `` proceeding as expected today '' , and that no new leaks had appeared as a result of the top kill operation . Pumping would continue , followed an evaluation and ultimately cement would be pumped in to seal the well . `` We expect these activities to be completed in the next 24 hours , '' Suttles said . Asked what would happen if the top kill failed , Suttles said BP had other plans , including placing a new blow out preventer on top of the existing failed blow out preventer , while drilling of a relief well would continue in any case . Challenged as to why BP had n't tried the top kill method earlier , Suttles said : `` We did n't want to take any action to make it worse , '' and that considerable time and effort was required to gather the data to carry out the top kill . Back on shore there are signs that BP 's troubles wo n't end even if the top kill is a success . The Associated Press reports : Dozens of witness statements obtained by The Associated Press show a combination of equipment failure and a deference to the chain of command impeded the system that should have stopped the gusher before it became an environmental disaster . In a handwritten statement to the Coast Guard obtained by the AP , Transocean rig worker Truitt Crawford said : `` I overheard upper management talking saying that BP was taking shortcuts by displacing the well with saltwater instead of mud without sealing the well with cement plugs , this is why it blew out . '' At a Coast Guard hearing in New Orleans , Doug Brown , chief rig mechanic aboard the platform , testified that the trouble began at a meeting hours before the blowout , with a `` skirmish '' between a BP official and rig workers who did not want to replace heavy drilling fluid in the well with saltwater . The switch presumably would have allowed the company to remove the fluid and use it for another project , but the seawater would have provided less weight to counteract the surging pressure from the ocean depths . Brown said the BP official , whom he identified only as the `` company man , '' overruled the drillers , declaring , `` This is how it 's going to be . '' Brown said the top Transocean official on the rig grumbled , `` Well , I guess that 's what we have those pinchers for , '' which he took to be a reference to devices on the blowout preventer , the five-story piece of equipment that can slam a well shut in an emergency .

Photograph : Charles Dharapak\\/AP A leak from the Oval office suggests it did not take Barack Obama long to grasp the enormity of the political disaster washing towards him with the oil spill in the Gulf . The ordinarily unflappable president , reported the Washington Post , cut off a briefing by aides in the first week after the Deepwater Horizon cut down with a terse command : `` Plug the damn hole . '' A month later , and with the hole still unplugged , Obama is being forced to show he is in personal command of the environmental crisis . He is expected to impose tighter new controls on offshore oil drilling tomorrow , following up the announcement with a visit to the Gulf on Friday . The step-up in personal engagement comes amid signs that the US public is redirecting some of its anger at the spill from BP and the oil industry towards his administration . The slow-motion nature of the disaster with crude only reaching the shores in significant quantities this week has emboldened political opponents to try to capitalize on the seeming powerlessness of Obama and BP to cap the spill . Louisiana 's governor , Bobby Jindal , a onetime rising young star in the Republican party who has been overshadowed on the national stage by Tea Party activists , has accused the administration of sitting on his requests for berms to protect barrier islands in his state from oil . Even Sarah Palin , who coined the term `` Drill , Baby , Drill '' , felt emboldened to accuse Obama this week of being in thrall to the oil industry . His appearance of public detachment has also frustrated some Democrats , who were hoping he would use the crisis to help push through energy and climate legislation . Others were looking to Obama to reverse his decision last March to expand offshore drilling . But the administration said today that it still saw offshore drilling in America 's energy future although more stringently regulated . Democratic strategist James Carville attacked Obama this morning for retaining his customary cool . `` I have no idea of why they did n't seize this thing , '' the Clinton loyalist told ABC breakfast television . `` The president of the United States could have come down here , he could have been involved with the families of these 11 people who were killed in the explosion . '' Some of the outrage directed at Obama now could be overspill from public 's anger over economy and financial scandals . `` I do wonder whether Deepwater Horizon is the Wall Street of the ocean , privatising profits while the public carries the risk , '' Nick Rahall , the chair of the house natural resources committee , told a hearing today . But the hands-off approach which now seems to be unravelling appears to have been a deliberate strategy by the White House to keep the focus on the spill and its clean-up firmly on the oil industry . Unlike hurricane Katrina regularly compared to the spill by the Republicans the Obama administration deployed resources early on to the Gulf , despatching cabinet secretaries , and mobilising cleanup teams . But it was determined that the environmental disaster carry a BP or oil industry brand . Even the regular email updates on cabinet officials ' visits to the Gulf are branded `` Deepwater Horizon '' . The administration has repeatedly put responsibility for the cleanup on the oil firm . `` We will keep our boot on their neck until the job is done , '' the interior secretary , Ken Salazar , said this week . But a CNN poll suggests the focus on BP has distracted from the administration 's own efforts , showing for the first time that the majority of Americans , 51 % , disapprove of Obama 's handling of the crisis . Commentators are also increasingly complaining about lax oversight by his administration before the spill , and a hands-off approach to the cleanup . The shift follows official investigations and news reports suggesting widespread corruption within the government agency in charge of regulating offshore drilling , with inspectors being treated to free tickets to American football games . The minerals management service also repeatedly ignored environmental warnings from government scientific agencies about potential risks of such drilling . Salazar said the culture was a hangover from the Bush era . That explanation has not satisfied critics , who say the Obama administration needs to be held to account for its management over the past 15 months . `` You were supposed to be the new sheriff in town , '' said Mike Coffman , a Republican congressman from California , accusing the secretary of failing in his duties .

The latest effort to stem the leak comes as two congressman said warning signs were identitifed before the explosion last month that brought down the company 's Deepwater Horizon oil rig . The company is awaiting the results of diagnostic tests , which will indicate whether it can later today begin the top kill procedure of choking off the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico by force-feeding it heavy drilling mud and cement . The process has never been tried so deep underwater before and if it fails , it could make the leak worse . It comes as politicians and others are losing patience with the company over its several failed attempts to stop the leak that started more than a month ago after an offshore drilling rig exploded . About 7m gallons of crude have spilled into the sea since , fouling Louisiana 's marshes and coating birds and other wildlife . `` We want what everybody wants to stop the flow at the source as quickly as possible , '' said BP spokesman John Curry . `` We understand the frustration and we just want to bring this to closure . '' BP chief executive officer , Tony Hayward , pegged its chances of success at 60 % to 70 % . And the company said those who want to can watch the procedure online . Live video of the leak has been available for the past few days , and BP said that it will continue throughout the procedure . The attempt comes as more hearings this week focused on what led to the explosion on 20 April aboard the Deepwater Horizon that killed 11 workers and triggered the catastrophe . Senior managers from Transocean , which owned the rig , were complaining that day that BP was `` taking shortcuts '' by replacing heavy drilling fluid with seawater in the well , according to sworn testimony by Truitt Crawford , a rig roustabout . BP was leasing the rig and is responsible for stopping the leak and the cleanup . The seawater was being used in preparation for dropping a final blob of cement into the well as a temporary plug for the pipe . Workers had finished pumping the cement into the exploratory well to bolster and seal it against leaks until a later production phase . Crawford said seawater would provide less weight to contain surging pressure from the ocean depths . His testimony was expected to be part of a hearing in New Orleans . A BP spokesman declined to comment on what he said . Dozens of worker statements obtained by The Associated Press describe the hours and minutes before the sudden , violent blowout and many said they were concerned about the pressure coming from below . And tests within an hour of the blast indicated the pressure was building , according to a congressional memo . The buildup was an `` indicator of a very large abnormality , '' in the well , BP 's investigator said . The rig team was `` satisfied '' that another test was successful and resumed adding the seawater , said the memo by Henry Waxman and Bart Stupak to members of the committee on energy and commerce , which is investigating what went wrong . There were other warning signs of problems included an unexpected loss of fluid from a pipe known as a `` riser '' five hours before the explosion , which could have indicated a leak in the blowout preventer , the memo said . The blowout preventer is designed to shut down the well in case of an emergency . BP has cited its failure as a contributor to the blast . If all goes as planned , engineers will pump fluid twice as dense as water from two barges into two 3-inch-wide lines that will feed it into the blowout preventer . Crews plan to pump it in at a rate of 1,680 to 2,100 gallons per minute in an attempt counteract the upward pressure of oil gushing to the surface . They stockpiled some 50,000 barrels of the heavy mud , a manufactured substance that resembles clay . Bob Bea , an engineering professor at the University of California at Berkeley , said the procedure carries a high risk of failure because of the velocity at which the oil may be spewing . `` I certainly pray that it works , because if it does n't there 's this long waiting time '' before BP can dig relief wells that would cut off the flow , Bea told The Associated Press . Wells said it could take up to two days to determine whether the top kill is working .

As BP made tentative progress in plugging the leak through a high-stakes `` top kill '' operation a mile under the surface of the ocean , the US president , Barack Obama , pledged to hold the British company responsible for the `` horrific damage '' caused by the accident . `` We will demand they pay every dime they owe for the damage and painful losses they 've caused , '' said the president , who will travel to the area tomorrow . He insisted he was personally overseeing the response to the disaster , brushing aside criticism of his government 's actions . It became clear today that the disaster is several times worse than BP and the government had previously estimated . Experts revealed that between 12,000 and 19,000 barrels of oil had been gushing from the Macondo well daily since the spill began on 20 April , eclipsing an earlier figure of 5,000 barrels daily . One measurement put the spill at up to 25,000 barrels each day . That would mean that nearly 39m gallons -LRB- 148m litres -RRB- may have spilled . `` This is a very significant disaster , '' said Marcia McNutt , director of the US Geological Survey . Even the conservative end of the figures put the spill at nearly 19m gallons well in excess of the 11m gallons lost when the Exxon Valdez oil tanker hit a reef off Alaska 21 years ago , wreaking havoc along a wilderness coastline . The White House blocked permits for new undersea drilling for six months and suspended planned mining exploration at two sites in Alaska . The top US regulator in charge of overseeing oil exploration , Elizabeth Birnbaum , resigned as Obama criticised her Minerals Management Service for having a `` sometimes corrupt '' relationship with the oil industry . At a White House press conference Obama deflected comparison of his administration 's handling of the spill crisis with that of George Bush 's notoriously lacklustre response to Hurricane Katrina . `` I 'll leave it to you guys to make those comparisons , '' he told reporters . But he admitted his administration had been too slow to produce its own estimate of the size of the spill , and that it should have pushed BP harder to share data from equipment on the ocean floor . `` This is an area where I do think our efforts fell short , '' he said . `` There was a lag of several weeks that I think should not have happened . '' BP succeeded in stemming the flow of the leak by pumping thick drilling mud into the ruptured ocean floor at high pressure . But 24 hours into the `` top kill '' effort , its engineers were still trying to stabilise the well sufficiently to plug it with a concrete cap .

Photograph : Associated Press\\/BP BP embarked upon a high-risk `` top kill '' procedure using drilling mud last night to cap the catastrophic gush of oil in the Gulf of Mexico , as it faced fresh accusations of shortcuts in the hours before an explosion destroyed the Deepwater Horizon rig . After hesitation by top BP executives as they analyzed data from robot submarines at the site of the leak , and under intense pressure from the Obama administration , the US coastguard gave the go-ahead for the operation to pump a cocktail of mud and heavy fluid at high pressure into the Macondo well , 50 miles off the Louisiana shore . Underwater TV cameras showed a live feed of oil billowing out while BP 's heavy machinery moved into position . Chief executive Tony Hayward warned that the operation , never before attempted at a depth of 5,000 feet -LRB- 1,500 metres -RRB- , had only a 60 % to 70 % chance of success and could take several days . Barack Obama described the disaster as `` heartbreaking '' and expressed hope it would work . `` If it 's successful , and there 's no guarantee , it should greatly reduce or eliminate the flow of oil now streaming into the Gulf from the sea floor , '' said the president . After a boat trip to see the damage , Louisiana 's governor , Bobby Jindal , displayed vivid photos showing that oil was killing cane plants along the state 's offshore marshes , an area which he described as `` the nursery of the gulf '' . `` We 've been fighting this oil nearly a month now , requesting resources . Too often , the response has been too little , too late , '' he said ; absorbent booms to capture oil were becoming saturated . `` We ca n't afford to wait another 24 , or 48 hours . '' The slick is estimated to cover 16,000 sq miles of ocean , It began on 20 April when an explosion and fire destroyed BP 's rig , killing 11 people . Since then efforts by BP to stem the flow , first by placing a dome on top of the leak , have come to nothing . David Summers , a professor at Missouri University of Science and Technology , said it would be clear within days whether the `` top kill '' procedure had worked . The method was straightforward and would have been started much earlier , were it not for the inaccessibility , he said : `` It 's relatively simple and been done many times before , but not at this depth . '' In a massive operation , 22,000 people and 1,100 vessels are tackling the slick . BP 's top executives are monitoring events from a control center in Houston . But as investigations begin into the cause , BP is facing accusations of `` short cuts '' in the hours before the rig blew up . In official hearings in New Orleans , several workers who survived raised questions about a decision shortly before the explosion in which rig bosses displaced heavy mud with salt water in the pipe rising from the seabed , potentially hampering the rig 's ability to withstand pressure from the ocean depths . At yesterday 's hearings Truitt Crawford , a roustabout on the rig , told coastguard investigators : `` I overheard upper management talking , saying that BP was taking shortcuts this is why it blew out . '' Another witness , Doug Brown , chief mechanic on the rig , said there was a `` skirmish '' between a BP `` company man '' , a driller and engineers : `` The driller was outlining what would be taking place , whereupon the company man stood up and said ` no , we 'll be having some changes to that ' , '' Brown said . A memo given to a congressional committee by BP reveals events as workers prepared to put a cement plug on the well in preparation for the rig to be moved . Two hours before the explosion , tests showed a buildup of pressure and subsequent decisions to press ahead with the operation are under scrutiny . BP has pointed out that other firms were involved it was leasing the rig from Transocean , which owned and operated it , while the US firm Halliburton was responsible for a cement plug . A poll by CBS News found 70 % disapproval of BP 's handling , and 45 % unhappy with the Obama administration 's response . Interior secretary Ken Salazar described it as a `` massive and potentially unprecedented environmental disaster '' , and BP would be liable for costs beyond a usual $ 75m -LRB- # 52m -RRB- maximum liability for oil firms in clean-ups : `` BP will be held accountable for costs of the government in responding to the spill and compensation for loss or damages . '' As shrimpers , fishermen and tourism industry workers along the Louisiana coast see their livelihoods dwindle , BP has watched its share price slump by 28 % , wiping $ 84bn off its market value . Some 1,200 vessels and 22,000 people are involved in the effort to temper the scale of the disaster . The US agency overseeing oil companies is also under intense criticism . An official report found that the Minerals Management Service allowed staff at oil and gas firms to fill in inspection reports in pencil , with regulators later going over the answers in ink . Mary Kendall , acting inspector general at the department of the interior , told a congressional committee yesterday that there were problems with `` gift acceptance , fraternising with industry and pornography '' at the agency . She suggested there was a problem with the closeness of ties between watchdogs and industry executives : `` The individuals involved in the fraternising and gift exchange both government and industry have often known one another since childhood .

Photograph : Patrick Semansky\\/EPA Day 37 of the oil spill crisis in the Gulf of Mexico , and the head of the US coastguard for Louisiana , in charge of the battle to prevent the massive oil slew from reaching shore in this most endangered region , was locked in debate with a local man about the second world war evacuation of Dunkirk . `` We need a Dunkirk-type of response where we throw everything we have at it , '' said Lance Gremillion , the local vet . `` I hope this is not turning into Dunkirk , '' replied Captain Edwin Stanton , dressed in a navy blue coastguard uniform . `` The British forces in Dunkirk suffered huge losses we do n't want that to happen here . '' `` I do n't mean Dunkirk in terms of losses , '' countered the vet , `` I mean in terms of focusing all our resources in order to prevent a far greater disaster , ingenuity succeeding over seemingly insurmountable problems . '' The mood in Louisiana over the Deep Horizon oil catastrophe has matured from shock , to bafflement , to anger and has now slipped into the surreal . Stanton had come , along with a senior representative of BP , to address the people of Phoenix , a small community on the east bank of the Mississippi . In his address to the gathering , the coastguard chief discharged his secret weapon : statistics . About 100 miles of shoreline had by now been affected by oil , of which about 25 miles was amenable to cleaning , Stanton told 200 people assembled in Phoenix high school . Some 266,000 barrels of oil had been collected by skimmers out of a total of more than 6m barrels that had dispersed since the rig exploded on 20 April . More than 679,000 ft of hard containment boom and 540,000 ft of absorbent boom had been laid to block the oil from reaching shore . `` I hope you are impressed by these numbers , '' he said . `` I certainly am . This has been the most extraordinary response I have ever seen . I would not have expected this measure of success , and you should feel somewhat relieved by that . '' His choice of words was met with blank stares from the audience and a few audible guffaws . Sean Walsh , a teacher from the Phoenix school , had come armed with his own set of statistics . Over the past 100 years , more than 600bn gallons of oil had been extracted from Louisiana 's coastline and yet what had the state to show for it ? Louisiana ranked second worst state in America in terms of its education system . `` What I want to know is how is BP going to rebuild Louisiana . I 'm tired of all the profit being taken out of the area and nothing being put back , '' he said . At which point Bob Fryar , a BP senior vice-president , unleashed his own Dunkirk-style aerial bombardment of figures . BP had provided $ 15m to encourage tourism in Louisiana and would spend $ 500m over 10 years to research the environmental impact of the oil spill . `` BP will continue to invest in the things that matter to people , '' he said . But why was there so little sign of action , Gremillion , the vet , wanted to know . The sections of boom he had seen out in the sea were laid piecemeal and at random , and there seemed to be far too few skimmers drawing up the oil . `` This is becoming just like Katrina again . They are just following a flowchart and refusing to deviate from it : ` This is what the flowchart says , and this is what we are going to do .

Photograph : Associated Press The Gulf oil spill has surpassed the Exxon Valdez as the worst in US history , according to new estimates released today , although the coastguard and BP said an untested procedure to plug the leak appeared to be working . A team of scientists , trying to find out how much oil has been flowing since the offshore rig Deepwater Horizon exploded on 20 April , found the rate was more than twice and possibly up to five times as high as previously thought . Even using the most conservative estimate , that means the leak has grown to nearly 72 million liters , surpassing the size of the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster , which at about 42 million litres had been the nation 's worst spill . Under the highest estimate , nearly 148 million litres may have spilled . Meanwhile BP engineers hare well advanced on the risky procedure known as a `` top kill '' to try to cut off the flow by pumping heavy drilling fluid into the well . If that works , BP will inject cement into the well to seal it . The top kill has been used above ground but has never been tried in deep water . BP estimated its chance of success at 60 to 70 per cent . Lieutenant commander Tony Russell , an aide to Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , said Thursday that the mud was stopping some oil and gas but had a ways to go before it proved successful . The top kill started Wednesday night and it could be several days before officials know if it is working . `` As you inject your mud into it , it is going to stop some hydrocarbons , '' Russell said . `` That does n't mean it 's successful . '' BP spokesman Tom Mueller also discounted news reports that the top kill had worked . `` We appreciate the optimism , but the top kill operation is continuing through the day today that has n't changed , '' he said . `` We do n't anticipate being able to say anything definitive on that until later today . '' Oil is coating birds and delicate wetlands along the Louisiana coast , and the political fallout from the spill has reached Washington , where the head of the federal agency that oversees offshore drilling resigned today . Elizabeth Birnbaum , the director of the minerals management service , stepped down hours before a planned White House press conference where President Barack Obama was expected to extend a moratorium on new deepwater oil drilling . Birnbaum and her agency came under withering criticism from lawmakers of both parties over lax oversight of drilling and cozy ties with industry . An internal Interior Department report released earlier this week found that between 2000 and 2008 , agency staff members accepted tickets to sports events , lunches and other gifts from oil and gas companies and used government computers to view pornography . Birnbaum had run the service since July 2009 . After receiving the results of a 30-day safety review from the interior secretary Ken Salazar , Obama also planned to delay controversial lease sales off the coast of Alaska and cancel plans for drilling lease sales in the Western Gulf and off the coast of Virginia , according to a White House aide . If the top kill fails , BP says it has several backup plans , including sealing the well 's blowout preventer with a smaller cap , which would contain the oil . An earlier attempt to cap the blowout preventer failed . BP could also try a `` junk shot '' shooting golf balls and other debris into the blowout preventer to clog it up during the top kill process . The only permanent solution is drilling a second well , but that will take a couple of months . BP plans to go ahead with that even if the top kill works . Speaking six hours into the operation , BP 's chief operating officer , Doug Suttles , said it appeared to be working and that mud , not oil , was now coming out of the ruptured pipe . `` We 're doing everything we can to bring it to closure , and actually we 're executing this ` top kill ' job as efficiently and effectively as we can , '' he said . The company has 50,000 barrels of mud on location , which it described as `` far more than necessary , but we want to be prepared for anything '' . Last night , Barack Obama described the disaster as `` heartbreaking '' and expressed hope that the procedure will work . `` If it 's successful , and there 's no guarantee , it should greatly reduce or eliminate the flow of oil now streaming into the Gulf from the sea floor , '' the president said . Obama added : `` We will not rest until this well is shut , the environment is repaired and the clean-up is complete . '' His statement followed a poll by CBS News yesterday which found 70 % disapproval of BP 's handling , and 45 % unhappy with the Obama administration 's response . Yesterday , Salazar reiterated that BP will be `` held accountable '' for compensation and government costs . The oil company may find itself having to answer further questions today , after revelations that just days before the Deepwater Horizon explosion the company had chosen to use the riskier of two types of casing for the leaking well . The New York Times reported the existence of a BP document , given to the paper by a Congressional investigator , which noted the casing that the company had chosen was described in the document as the `` best economic case '' , despite BP admitting it carried risks beyond the potential gas leaks . Greg McCormack , director of the Petroleum Extension Service at the University of Texas at Austin , told the newspaper that BP 's decision was `` without a doubt a riskier way to go '' , an assessment which the New York Times reported several other engineers had agreed with . A BP spokesman argued that the Deepwater Horizon approach had not been unusual . Hayward yesterday visited the scene of the environmental disaster in Port Fourchon in southern Louisiana , where he said he was `` absolutely gutted '' that the crude oil had started to wash ashore . `` As I said , it 's clear that the defense of the shoreline , at this point , has not been successful , '' Hayward said . `` I feel devastated by that , absolutely gutted . What I can tell you is that we are here for the long haul . We are going to clean every drop of oil off the shore . Just days after a top US official suggested that BP faced an `` existential crisis '' , Hayward conceded : `` I think this is clearly a major reputational issue for BP .

Louisiana residenst are angry at what they view as an inadequate federal and BP response . Photograph : Larry Downing\\/REUTERS In a small , wood-panelled courtroom in the back streets of Belle Chase on the banks of the Mississippi , a trial of sorts is taking place . Chief witness for the prosecution is a large rotund man with a breeze-reddened face who is addressing the legal benches and the packed public area with growing passion . `` Where is the plan ? '' he says , speaking into a microphone . `` We have been waiting and waiting for a plan , and still there is n't one . There is no plan . '' In the dock the absentee defendants are BP , the US coastguard and the federal government , who all stand accused in the court of local public opinion of failing to protect Louisiana 's rich coastline from the oil disaster unfolding in the Gulf of Mexico . Billy Nungesser , the elected parish chief for this stretch of the Mississippi , has come to address the full council , assembled for convenience 's sake in this unused courtroom . `` We are going to throw everything and the kitchen sink at this , and we do n't care if we do n't have permission . Come Saturday , we are going to go out there and begin the clean-up , with or without BP . '' The public bursts into applause . This being a council meeting and not a proper trial there is no judge to call the room to order . If it had been a criminal setting , and not a civil assembly of council officials , you might call it vigilantism . It began last Sunday in a spontaneous expression of frustration at the apparent lack of action to protect Louisiana 's wetlands , one of America 's largest and richest ecosystems , from the menacing swirl of oil gathering off the coast from the stricken Deep Horizon well . As the first big flows of oil began to reach land last weekend , local people were astonished to find 30 private shrimp boats sitting idle at Grand Isle , a pristine stretch of beach that was now directly threatened . BP had commissioned the boats for use in fighting the slick , but had left them doing nothing . Nungesser , backed by the governor of the state of Louisiana , Bobby Jindal , went it alone . They `` commandeered '' the boats and mobilised fishermen , sending them out to lay a boom in front of Grand Isle to hold back the oil . Such was the success of that action both in terms of ameliorating the oil impact and in boosting the morale of those involved that Nungesser then wanted to roll it out across the marshlands . `` We ca n't wait anymore for BP to give us permission , we 're going ahead anyway , '' he told the courtroom . Outlining his alternative plan , he said that on Saturday two teams of about 50 people would be sent out to barrier islands off the coast to begin dredging up small berms -LRB- barriers -RRB- to keep the oil from getting into the marshes . Where oil had already encroached into the sensitive grasses of the wetlands , special equipment would be used to drive it out then collect it . A helicopter supplied by the sheriff 's office would act as their eyes overhead and they would be advised by Philippe Cousteau , grandson of the underwater explorer Jacques . It was into this cauldron of brewing anger that Barack Obama jumped on yesterday , touring Louisiana for the second time since the crisis had begun on 20 April with the explosion of the Deep Horizon rig . With every day that passes , comparisons between the oil spill and George Bush 's disastrous handling of the Katrina hurricane in 2005 become more prevalent , and with them the political perils for the Obama administration . As it happens , one of the US president 's supporters over his handling of the crisis is Nungesser . The two met the last time Obama visited the region , and Nungesser was impressed by his willingness to listen to ideas about what to do . When a coastguard official expressed doubt about the efficacy of Nungesser 's suggestions , Obama turned to that official and said : `` You got a better plan ? '' According to the US coastguard , more than 100 miles of shoreline in Louisiana has now been affected by the oil , only a quarter of which will easily be cleaned . More than a million feet of protective booms have been laid around the most endangered islands and bayous , an emergency response that the coastguard claims has been `` historic '' , `` epic '' and largely successful . But the contrast between the rhetoric and what they see has baffled residents . If the response has been so successful , why was oil coming ashore this week with no attempt to stop it ? Why have booms been laid in stretches that appear to be ad-hoc and patchy ? Why , when you approach the authorities for permission to protect a marshland , is there so much red tape and no clear accountability between BP , the coast guard and the federal government ? Above all , they ask , why , with the disaster declared bigger than Exxon Valdez , the worst in US history , does there seem to be such a lack of urgency ? `` It 's sad to see the oil just sitting there , '' said Darren Crowe , a Louisiana state senator , after Nungesser finished speaking . `` It 's like your house is burning down when you have a fire engine sitting there right over the road . '' We take a boat out to look at some of the affected areas , speeding along bayous through a bed of grasses that extends to the horizon . As the waterways open into the bay we come to Cat island where thousands of pelicans are nesting . The island has been encircled with orange booms that are meant to contain the oil , but the equipment seems in need of maintenance as in parts it has been deposited on shore . The island was awash with oil two days ago , collected between the rings of the boom . The neighbouring island , Queen Bess , has oil in patches on the grasses , rendering them dark brown and greasy , . A group of pelicans and their young are perched three metres away . For now the oil has gone again , swept back out to sea by changing winds . But everybody expects that , in days , weeks , months , maybe even years , it will be back again , and they want to know what is going to be done to stop it next time .

Greenpeace UK has launched a campaign to reinvent BP 's logo , which it then intends to use `` in innovative and exciting ways as part of our international campaign against the oil company '' .

Photograph : Jim Watson\\/AFP\\/Getty Images Prolonged exposure to crude oil and chemical dispersants is a public health danger , environmental scientists warned yesterday as BP spent a third day trying to initiate a `` top kill '' operation to cap the ruptured well on the sea bed . The oil firm moved to a second stage of the procedure by injecting material such as golf balls , shredded tyres and rope into the well . But John Pack , a spokesman for BP , said it would not be clear until tomorrow if it would work . `` We have never said there is a deadline or a schedule , '' he said . `` We need to take this pretty slowly , but everything is going according to plan . '' BP 's beleaguered chief executive , Tony Hayward , yesterday drastically scaled upwards his assessment of the spill in the Gulf of Mexico . `` This is clearly an environmental catastrophe . There is no two ways about it , '' he told CNN . `` It 's clear that we are dealing with a very significant environmental crisis and catastrophe . '' In an interview with the Guardian two weeks ago , he had described the oil spill as `` tiny '' relative to the size of the gulf . `` The amount of volume of oil and dispersant we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume , '' he said then . However he was optimistic that the `` top kill '' stood a good chance of success , which he put at 60-70 % . `` We have wrestled it to the ground , but we have n't put a bullet in its head yet , '' Hayward said . With no immediate end in sight , there were growing concerns over the effects on public health of a prolonged exposure to the oil as well as to the more than 3,640,000 litres -LRB- 800,000 gallons -RRB- of chemical dispersants sprayed on the slick . Environmentalists and fishing groups in Louisiana say prolonged exposure to the oil , in the form of tiny airborne particles as well as dispersants , could be wreaking devastating damage on public health . They also accuse BP of threatening to sack workers who try to turn up for clean-up duty wearing protective respirators , and the Obama administration of refusing to release results of air and water quality tests that would show the impact of crude oil and dispersants on the environment . Wilma Subra , a chemist who has served as a consultant to the Environmental Protection Agency , said there was growing anecdotal evidence that locals were falling ill after exposure to tiny airborne particles of crude . Air quality data released earlier by the EPA suggested the presence of chemicals that while still within legal limits could be dangerous . But Subra complained that the EPA was not releasing all data it had gathered from BP . `` Every time the wind blows from the south-east to the shore , people are being made sick , '' she said . `` It causes severe headaches , nausea , respiratory problems , burning eyes and sore throats . '' Long-term health effects include neurological disorders and cancer . Subra said there was even greater concern for those recruited to lay booms and skim crude off the water , since they were in closer proximity to the oil and the chemical dispersants . Clint Guidry , of the Louisiana Shrimp Association , has accused BP of threatening to sack workers who turn up wearing respirators . The oil firm said it was not aware of any workers being turned away , but noted that it was the responsibility of the Obama administration to decide whether such protective gear was warranted . Hugh Kaufman , chief investigator for the EPA 's ombudsman , said he encountered similar worker safety policies after 9\\/11 . `` If people are wearing respirators , it scares people because they realize how toxic it is , '' he said `` The administration is down-playing the problem because it saves them money down the line . It was the same at Ground Zero . '' EPA tests indicate that the combined effect of dispersants and crude oil are even more toxic than individually . `` There are dispersants being applied by aeroplane and by boat , and these people on the water are being sprayed over and over again , '' Subra said . Five offshore rigs have been shut down since the spill after workers fell ill . Seven workers on a boat trying to scrub the oil from Breton Sound were taken to hospital on Wednesday , complaining of burning eyes , headaches , nausea , dizziness and chest pains . Five were treated and released . Administration officials suggested in a conference call with reporters that the workers could be suffering from sunstroke in the hot Louisiana temperatures . They also said the workers recruited for the clean-up fishermen and shrimpers put out of work because of the spill had received training and wore protective gear . However , the protective clothing does not include respirators , which environmental activists say violates safety regulations for workers exposed to dangerous chemicals . None of the workers pictured raking up oil from the beaches of Grand Isle Louisiana in photographs released by the Deepwater command center today was wearing a mask or respirator .

Photograph : John Moore\\/Getty Images A delicate `` top kill '' operation by BP appears to have halted the gush of oil and gas from its ruptured Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico , although experts warned that the underwater leak was still far from being permanently fixed . Engineers were due last night to begin a second round of pumping thick drilling mud at high speed into the ocean floor , which lies 5,000 feet -LRB- 1,500 metres -RRB- under the surface of the sea about 50 miles off Louisiana . Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer , insisted that the operation was going to plan , but admitted : `` What we do know is that we have not yet stopped the flow . '' He said BP engineers would soon use additional materials to try to plug the well , suggesting heavy mud deployed so far would not work on its own . `` It 's quite a roller coaster , '' he told a reporters ' conference call , adding that the disaster had cost BP $ 850m so far . The modest signs of progress came amid dismal news on the sheer extent of the environmental damage caused by the accident , which began when BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on 20 April , killing 11 workers . New government estimates of a leak of 12,000 to 19,000 barrels of oil a day indicated that after 37 days , the slick could be twice as large as the fallout from the tanker Exxon Valdez , which hit a reef off Alaska in 1989 . `` This will be felt for generations to come , '' said Regan Nelson , senior oceans advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington . `` It 's an unprecedented disaster . '' Environmental scientists who have toured the marshes off Louisiana by boat described a vast expanse of crude half an inch thick , with no visible sign of the BP or government clean-up efforts . `` We could n't see into the water at all , one engine quit working , '' said Larry Schweiger of the National Wildlife Federation . `` We are talking about really heavy oil spill out there , and no one is out there cleaning it . No one is out there measuring the scope of the oil mass . '' Doug Inkley , a wildlife biologist with the National Wildlife Federation , described seeing dead jellyfish and sharks affected by the slick . `` It 's impossible to me to know how any living organism could survive in that , '' he said . At least seven oil clean-up workers were taken to hospital yesterday after reporting nausea and headaches as a result of contact with chemical dispersants used to break up the slick . Administration officials said the cause of the illness was unclear . Offshore , marine scientists from a University of South Florida research ship reported the discovery of a new underwater plume of oil extending 22 miles from the ruptured well towards Mobile Bay , Alabama , raising new fears about deep water toxicity . After failing earlier in the month to halt the leak with a top hat-shaped dome , BP began pumping bargeloads of sludge into the well on Wednesday afternoon . Seven hours later , the company was able to drop the pressure at which it was pumping , a development considered positive by experts who said it meant the well contained a column of mud , rather than a plume of oil . `` That means they had enough pressure to displace the oil from the well into the rock formation , '' said David Summers , a professor of mining engineering at Missouri University of Science & Technology . However , he said the job was not complete yet : `` They have n't been able to totally balance the pressure . The column of mud in there should be stable enough to stand there by itself . But they 're still having to apply a little bit of pressure to keep the column stable . That means they may not have got the mud all the way down the well yet . '' There is still a risk that the pipe leading into the well could rupture . If the effort fails , BP has mooted trying a `` junk shot '' to block the leak by firing golf balls , tyres and other debris into the ocean floor . Meanwhile , the company is drilling two `` relief wells '' to suck up oil in a controlled way , although these are unlikely to be ready until August . Scientists warned there was potential for even greater damage , with a forecast of an unusually hazardous hurricane season . The national weather service in its yearly forecast for the hurricane season starting on 1 June predicted between eight to 14 hurricanes across the Atlantic . Of those , three to seven could be major hurricanes , category three storms or higher . Hurricane Katrina was a category three . `` If this outlook holds true , this season could be one of the more active on record , '' said Jane Lubchenco , the head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , the government agency that oversees the forecast . The pace of congressional investigations into the oil disaster also intensified with BP ordered to produce documents by June 3 into what was described as `` questionable '' decisions on well casing in the hours before the explosion . In a letter to BP , Henry Waxman , the head of the energy and commerce committee , said he was concerned by omissions in BP 's 48-page briefing to Congress on the events leading up to the explosion . `` This raises the possibility that BP 's internal investigation is not examining the consequences of BP 's own decisions and conduct , '' he said . Severe weather could accelerate the movement of the slick , which is threatening to stretch beyond Louisiana 's coastline to the beaches of Florida and could spread as far as Cuba .

'' Doug Inkley , a wildlife biologist with the National Wildlife Federation , described seeing dead jellyfish and sharks affected by the slick . `` It 's impossible to me to know how any living organism could survive in that , '' he said . At least seven oil clean-up workers were taken to hospital yesterday after reporting nausea and headaches following contact with chemical dispersants used to break up the slick . Administration officials said the cause of the illness was unclear . Offshore , marine scientists from a University of South Florida research ship reported the discovery of a new underwater plume of oil extending 22 miles from the ruptured well towards Mobile Bay , Alabama , raising new fears about deepwater toxicity . After failing earlier in the month to halt the leak with a top hat-shaped dome , BP began pumping bargeloads of sludge into the well on Wednesday afternoon . Seven hours later the company was able to drop the pressure at which it was pumping , a development considered positive by experts who said it meant the well contained a column of mud , rather than a plume of oil . `` That means they had enough pressure to displace the oil from the well into the rock formation , '' said David Summers , a professor of mining engineering at Missouri University of Science and Technology . However , he said the job was not complete yet . `` They have n't been able to totally balance the pressure . The column of mud in there should be stable enough to stand there by itself . But they 're still having to apply a little bit of pressure to keep the column stable . That means they may not have got the mud all the way down the well yet . '' There is still a risk that the pipe leading into the well could rupture . If the effort fails BP has talked about trying a `` junk shot '' to block the leak by firing golf balls , tyres and other debris into the ocean floor . The company is drilling two `` relief wells '' to suck up oil in a controlled way , although these are unlikely to be ready until August . Scientists warned there was potential for even greater damage , with a forecast of an unusually hazardous hurricane season . The national weather service in its annual forecast for the hurricane season starting on 1 June predicted between eight to 14 hurricanes across the Atlantic . Of those , three to seven could be major hurricanes , category 3 storms or higher . Hurricane Katrina was a category 3 .

There are no significant events to report at this time . BP will provide updates on progress as appropriate . In addition to watching the progress of the top kill , it will be interesting to see how the markets react to the announcement from the Obama administration that proposed exploratory drilling in the Arctic Ocean will be suspended until 2011 potentially disrupting Shell Oil 's plans to begin drilling five exploratory wells this summer . Yesterday Barack Obama described the disaster as `` heartbreaking '' while BP chief executive Tony Hayward went for the phrase `` absolutely gutted '' , in an apparent contest to see who was the most concerned as opinion polls suggest large parts of the US public are dissatisfied with both men . Follow updates on the top kill , and get all your oil spill news here . This interactive graphic by my colleague Paddy Allen show how the top kill should work . BP 's live feed of the oil leak does n't appear to be working , but some other sites have video streams that I 've had more luck with so far this morning . The oil company does warn that the stream `` may freeze or be unavailable from time to time '' , but other sites were running the footage not so long ago when BP was down PBS news 's footage was working well earlier , although it seems to have stalled now . I 'll keep looking for reliable streaming of the oil BP said that throughout the top kill procedure `` very significant changes in the appearance of the flows at the seabed may be expected '' , which could be exciting . -LRB- Although it did add , disappointingly , that : `` These will not provide a reliable indicator of the overall progress , or success or failure , of the top kill operation as a whole . '' -RRB- The top kill has worked above ground but has never before been tried 5,000 feet beneath the sea . -LRB- Keen followers of the Gulf oil spill so far will recall that the same applies to every technique and let 's face it , there have been many that BP has employed so far , as there have never been an oil leak this far beneath the surface before -RRB- . BP has rated the latest attempt 's chance of success at 60 to 70 percent . `` The absence of any news is good news , '' said Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , who 's overseeing the operation . `` It 's a wait and see game here right now , so far nothing unfavorable . '' Incidentally , the engineers working to stop the spill have come up with some ingenious names for their efforts so far . From introducing the word ' cofferdam ' to a wider audience , to reinventing the top hat as a -LRB- failed -RRB- device to capture the oil , to the brilliantly named `` junk shot '' , the terms for BP 's attempts have never failed to capture the imagination .

Paul Pemberton emails to recommend the ' Simultaneous Operations Overview - Subsea Operations ' section of the BP web site , which is much more interesting than it sounds . The site has lots of graphics showing the different types of equipment being used in both the top kill attempt and the wider clean up operation . The Los Angeles Times is reporting that President Obama will announce today he 'll extend a moratorium on new deepwater drilling for six months in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster . This is more information coming out about the month long review the US interior ministry has just conducted into oil drilling . The Obama administration is also suspending proposed exploratory drilling in the Arctic Ocean following the report from interior secretary Ken Salazer . This is Matthew Weaver taking over from Adam Gabbatt . BP 's reputation is taking a massive kicking online . BP bashing on Twitter is being led by the spoof account @BPGlobalPR . It features links to T-shirts bearing a smudged-oil logo `` BP cares '' . The same ironic term is also trending on the network at #BPcares . Over on Facebook almost 150,000 users have expressed support for a group called BoycottBP . But the LA Times says : The `` top kill '' effort , launched Wednesday afternoon by industry and government engineers , has pumped enough drilling fluid to block all oil and gas from the well , Allen said . The pressure from the well is very low , but persists , he said . BP 's share price has increased by almost 6 % on the news of Top Kill 's apparent success , according to my colleagues on the business desk . The US Geological Survey is due to hold a conference call with reporters at 3pm . Our US business correspondent Andrew Clark is due to take part . The LA Times reporter , Jim Tankersley , who broke the story about about Top Kill succeeding , has back tracked slightly . The New Orleans news site Nola.com is not getting quite as excited by Thad Allen comments , as the LA Times . An attempt to kill the runaway deepwater horizon well spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico is going according to plan so far , leaving the coast guard admiral in charge of managing the spill `` cautiously optimistic '' but unwilling to say the well is capped . An earlier version of this story termed the effort `` successful . '' Officials clarified that neither government nor BP officials had declared the effort a success yet . They caution that only after the cementing is complete and the well is sealed can the top kill be called successful . Here 's a sumnmary of the main points so far : cents Reports say that the ` top kill ' operation is going to plan and has stopped the flow of oil from the spill . Earlier reports that it had succeeded have not been confirmed by BP or government officials cents BP 's share price has increased cents President Obama has extended a moratorium on new deepwater drilling for six months . The president is due to give a press briefing at the White House later . News is emerging on Twitter about what is being said at US Geological Survey -LRB- USGS -RRB- conference call . Flow rate call with USGS . Dr. Marcia McNutt , chair of flow rate technical group , talking to reporters . McNutt says numbers did n't matter in response , which has `` been based on a worst-case , catastrophic scenario . '' Surface observations indicate 130k-270k barrels as of May 17 , estimates that equal amount burned , dispersed , etc. . One of the teams evaluating flow says could be as high as 25,000 barrels , which would be 5x the previously accepted figures from NOAA\\/BP . McNutt says that reasonable lower figure is 11,000 barrels per day , which is already more than twice as much as # given by NOAA , BP so far . Team looking at satellite info estimates 12,000-19 ,000 per day flow from well . #BPspill 4 minutes ago via web Andrew Clark , who has also been listening to the USGS conference call , has this : Marcia McNutt , director of US Geological Survey -LRB- and scientific adviser to interior sec Ken Salazar -RRB- , has been giving figures suggesting flow of oil from the leak has been much higher than BP estimated . According to three different scientific measurement methods , the leak has been flowing at minimum of 12,000 barrels per day , and it could be as much as 19,000 barrels . That 's way above BP 's estimate of 5,000 barrels . As of May 17 , a Nasa imaging plane found 130,000 to 270,000 barrels of oil on the surface of Gulf . Roughly the same volume again had already been burned , skimmed , dispersed or evaporated . `` This is obviously a very , very significant environmental disaster , '' McNutt said . Just to be clear : the USGS did not comment on the top kill operation , it was discussing the damage so far . But Thad Allen , the US coast guard official , has been discussing top kill . He told the radio station NPR that it was too early to say whether it had succeeded : `` Over the course of the last 12 to 18 hours , they have been able to force mud down and not allow any hydrocarbons to come back up , '' `` It 's a matter of put some mud down , take some pressure readings , put some mud down , take more pressure readings . One thing they do n't want to do is put so much mud down that there may be a structural problem for the well-bore casing and potentially rupture them , which would be something we would n't want to have happen . '' The leak could have been five times worse than BP estimates , according to another disturbing update from the USGS . Andrew Clark writes : To clarify further , the government had three measurement methods . All three agreed the spill has been at least 12,000 barrels per day . Two of them said an upper limit 19,000 per day . The third put the upper limit at 25,000 barrels per day , which would be five times what we were previously told both by the administration and by BP . Better news from Andrew Clark on top kill : I 've been talking to David Summers , a professor of mining engineering at Missouri University of Science and Technology , who has been following the operation closely . He says that about seven hours after beginning the `` top kill '' attempt yesterday , BP was able to drop the pressure of mud being pumped into the well - which was a good sign . `` That means they had enough pressure to displace the oil from the well into the rock formation , '' says Summers , so the well now contains a column of BP 's drilling mud instead of a spurt of oil . However , the job is n't quite done yet : `` They have n't been able to totally balance the pressure yet . The column of mud in there should be stable enough to stand there by itself . But they 're still having to apply a little bit of pressure to keep the column stable . That means they may not have got the mud all the way down the well yet . '' Still , Summers reckons it 's going as well as can be expected and based on what he 's seeing , he 's optimistic : `` The whole thing could be sealed and capped by this time tomorrow . '' This is Richard Adams in the Guardian 's Washington office , taking over from Matt Weaver for the rest of the day . 10.38 am CDT : It 's a stinking hot day here in Washington , and the White House press corp is already assembled outside in the blazing sun waiting for President Obama 's press conference to start at 12.45 pm ET . More bad news : the Deepwater Horizon spill is officially larger than the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska back in 1989 , making it now the worst oil spill in US history by some distance depending on which estimate you prefer . Even using the most conservative estimate , that means the leak has grown to nearly 19m gallons , surpassing the size of the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster , which at about 11m gallons had been the nation 's worst spill . Under the highest estimate , nearly 39m gallons may have spilled . 10.43 am CDT : More on the Minerals Management Service director Elizabeth Birnbaum , who left her post today after scathing criticism of the agency for its lax work and overly-cozy relationships with the industry it was regulating . Birnbaum has only been in the job since July last year so it seems a little harsh . Ken Salazar , the interior secretary , said that Birnbaum resigned `` on her own terms and of her own volition '' , rather than being sacked . But in such situations there 's always a jumped\\/pushed element . 11.04 am CDT : There 's a fantastic on-the-ground report from Mac McClelland , a reporter for Mother Jones magazine , who details her run-ins with BP staff and local police in trying to report from the beaches of Louisiana , and what she found there : The shoreline is packed with men in hats and gumboots and bright blue or white shirts . Nearly all are African-American , all hired from around New Orleans . They tell me they 've been standing in these exact same spots for three days . It 's breathtakingly hot . They rake the oil and sand into big piles ; other workers collect the piles into big plastic bags , and still other workers take them to a plant where the sand is separated out and sent to a hazardous-waste dump and the oil goes on for processing . Then the tide comes in with more oil and everybody starts all over again . Ten dollars an hour . Twelve hours a day . 11.15 am CDT : Not so long ago the Republican governor of Louisiana , Bobby Jindal , was telling anyone who would listen that the federal government was too big . For obvious reasons he now takes a rather different view , and will tell anyone who will listen that the federal government just is n't doing enough . And because of the oil spill he does n't have enough time to finish writing his biography : A Jindal spokesman confirmed Tuesday that the governor 's upcoming memoir , titled Real Hope , Real Change : New Conservative Solutions to Rescue America , wo n't be released in July as planned . Those new conservative solutions to rescue America will just have to wait until the old federal government has rescued America from the oil spill .

CNN 's John King wants to know why President Obama is n't showing more anger to the public , so maybe at this press conference the president will punch someone from BP to make that point . -LRB- Because violence is never the answer , kids . -RRB- Wolf Blitzer says that he tweeted this morning that Obama was losing the crucial CNN guest commentator demographic , meaning James Carville , the Louisiana native who is n't happy . And if you 've lost James Carville , you 've lost middle America , right ? Sorry , that was Walter Cronkite . 11.50 am CDT : Obama 's now talking in the East Room , starting with a quick update on the spill and the top kill operation . `` This procedure offers no guarantee of success , '' warns Obama . On BP , he says : `` We will demand they pay every dime for the damage they have done ... Make no mistake , BP is operating at our direction . '' `` Those who think we were slow in our response or lacked urgency do n't know the facts . '' 11.55 pm CDT : Obama 's now laying into the `` scandalously close relationship between the oil industry and those who were regulating them '' , and how laws were `` tailored by the industry to serve its needs and not the public 's . '' Obama made official the announcement of action against deep-sea drilling : cents suspend two permits to drill off the coast of Alaska cents cancel oil lease sales off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and Virginia cents suspend new permits for deep water wells for a further six months cents suspend action of current wells being drilled in the Gulf of Mexico -LRB- that is , new wells being drilled , not wells in operation -RRB- 12.02 pm CDT : CNN is tastefully carrying a small window with the `` oil spill cam live '' in the bottom righthand corner of the screen , showing oil -LRB- or mud , by now , we hope -RRB- gushing out while Obama is speaking . 12.07 pm CDT : Asked about public concern at BP 's continued involvement in the efforts to stop the spill , Obama responds : `` This notion , that for the last three or four weeks somehow the federal government is sitting on the sidelines and we 've just been letting BP make the decisions , is not true . '' Obama says that one of his first questions , during a meeting in the situation room early on in the crisis , was whether the government had the technology to tackle to leak . He was told that it did n't , and that BP had did . `` Should the federal government have this technology ? '' Obama said , and that will be one of the issues that the new panel being set up will consider . `` But for now , BP has the best technology , along with other companies , in capping the well down there . '' 12.18 pm CDT : Chuck Todd of MSNBC asks Obama to address the Katrina comparisons , a very popular topic of conversation on the US right and left . `` I 'll leave it to you guys to make these comparisons and make judgments . What I 'm spending time thinking about is how we solve the problem , '' replies Obama , in a lofty tone . `` I am confident people are going to look back and say this administration was on top of an unprecedented crisis . '' Obama is very much on the defensive here and is lacking fluency in his answers . `` I think there was a lack of anticipating what the worst case scenarios would be . '' 12.33 pm CDT : Oh a question from Helen Thomas , about why America 's military is still in Afghanistan . Because she has been in the White House press corp since the Chester Arthur administration , Obama politely responds . Speaking of which , President Arthur would have done a great job at cleaning up this spill . He certainly cleaned up the US civil service . Now the New York Times reporter is asking if Elizabeth Birnbaum was fired or sacked or what ? `` I only found about it this morning , '' says Obama , `` I do n't know the circumstances . '' 12.40 pm : `` You never heard me say , ` drill , baby , drill ' , '' says Obama . On the live video feed from the well head , a robotic arm has appeared . No , it appears to be part of the submarine . Now there 's a question about really ? Arizona 's immigration law and the decision to send 1,200 National Guard members to the border with Mexico . Obama is asked if he is favor of boycotting Arizona -LRB- because of its quasi-racist new law which requires the police to ask for immigration status of anyone they suspect of being an illegal immigrant -RRB- . `` I 'm president of the United States , I do n't endorse boycotts or not endorse boycotts . That 's something that the private citizens can make a decision about , '' says Obama , sensibly although perhaps a little too even-handedly . 12.47 pm CDT : `` And it 's not just me , by the way . When I woke this morning and I 'm shaving and Malia knocks on my bathroom door and she peeks in her head and she says , ` Did you plug the hole yet , Daddy ? ' Because I think everybody understands that when we are fouling the Earth like this , it has concrete implications not just for this generation , but for future generations , '' says Obama , now making the case that he is fully engaged on fixing the spill disaster , and so it seems is the rest of his family . This is from the last question of the press conference , from Major Garrett of Fox News , who asked : `` Is your boot on the neck of BP ? '' , employing the metaphor used by interior secretary Ken Salazar . `` I would say we do n't need to use language like that , what we need is action to make sure BP is made accountable , '' replies Obama . `` The Gulf is going to be affected in a bad way . So my job right now is to make sure everyone in the Gulf understands , this is what I think about when I wake about in the morning and the last thing at night . And Obama finishes by saying that he is responsible : `` In case you 're wondering who 's responsible , I take responsibility . It is my job to make sure this thing is shut down . '' 12.56 pm CDT : So the press conference is over , but this was n't Obama 's best effort . `` People want a more visceral president , '' opines John King , a journalist who works for CNN . Everyone on CNN agrees that because Obama has been in office now for a year and a half -LRB- actually , 16 months , but hey -RRB- everything is now his fault . Which seems more than fair . By now he should have got around to reading all the drilling licenses and environmental exemptions . 1.09 pm CDT : Now the robotic arm appears to be using a spanner on the live video feed from the ROV . It 's very cool , although to be honest it 's doing a rubbish job . TV expert thinks that it might be something to do with adding a sensor to measure the temperature . Apparently this is all good news . -LRB- The spanner or wrench , if you are American is now just sitting on top of the leak . -RRB- 1.15 pm CDT : Has the tide turned ? It 's now 24 hours since the top kill operation began the initial period that would dictate the success or failure , according to BP and all the news so far is that it appears to be working . The color of the fluid , as seen on the live feed , has certainly lightened since yesterday , and the experts are hailing this as an excellent sign of progress . `` The fluid you see right now is almost 100 % the fluid that 's being pumped down from the surface to create the seal , '' says Professor Don van Nieuwenhuise from the University of Houston 's geo-science program , on CNN . `` From what I can see it 's going very well . '' Van Nieuwenhuise is a veteran of several top kill operations . When can the cement go in and seal it up ? That 's the tricky part , the professor says , since it can lead to another rupture . But there were indications that the heavy fluid , called mud , was slowly building up within the well bore as it was being pumped from surface ships through pipes on the seafloor . At first , most of the mud was carried away by the oil and gas streaming up through the well at high pressure , but with enough mud being pumped in at a fast enough rate , it started accumulating inside the well as intended . Unless something goes wrong , at some point , enough mud and thus enough weight would accumulate to overcome the upward pressure of the escaping oil and gas , and seal the well . A senior technician working on the measure said on Thursday that the vast amount of data collected so far was positive , and that there was general optimism that it was succeeding . Planning has begun for cementing the well , the next step in sealing it after the flow of oil and gas is stopped by the drilling mud , but that stage would not be undertaken for at least several hours . Yesterday : The flow on Wednesday afternoon . Notice how the flow was longer and straighter in the -LRB- bottom -RRB- image , indicating that it was at higher pressure -LRB- velocity -RRB- and that now it blows out at much closer distance , meaning it does n't have the same pressure -LRB- velocity -RRB- . Today : the flow as seen this morning . 1.45 pm CDT : To gauge how the fluid from the leak has changed , here are two screen grabs from today and yesterday , from the excellent site The Oil Drum , which is providing some valuable expert commentary : Below ... are two pictures to show why I believe that the injection pressure of mud into the well has dropped , indicating that BP have filled the well , and are now holding pressure to see if there are any problems . I would assume , if none develop , that they will inject cement to seal the top of the well , sometime today . 2.35 pm CDT : The AP are reporting that seven workers helping to clean up the Gulf oil spill are still in hospital after they reported dizziness , headaches and nausea while working on boats off the Louisiana coast : West Jefferson Medical Center spokeswoman Taslin Alfonzo said Thursday that doctors believe the likely cause is chemical irritation and dehydration from long hours working in the heat . Alfonzo said the workers told doctors they believe chemicals used to break up the oil made them sick . Authorities say the workers became ill Wednesday while cleaning up oil in Breton Sound , southeast of New Orleans . Officials ordered all 125 commercial boats working the cleanup there to leave the area . 3.15 pm CDT : Oh dear . It appears that some evil hackers managed to briefly hijack the @BP_America official Twitter account . According to Fox News , at least one rogue tweet was up on the official BP feed for only a brief time before it was caught by an eagle-eyed BP employee -LRB- at least they 're good at something -RRB- . The offending tweet read : `` Terry is now in charge of operation Top Kill , work will recommence after we find a XXL wetsuit . 3.30 pm CDT : The Coast Guard is holding a press conference in Venice , Louisiana , saying that mud is still being pumped into the well and `` wait and see '' is still the order of the day . Admiral Thad Allen says mud is still coming out of the leak , which suggests the pressure still has n't been contained . `` They said this could take 24 to 36 hours , and they are in the process of monitoring it , '' said Allen , who was more downbeat than his previous appearance this morning . Offshore drilling simply does not achieve the goals that its advocates claim , and it is not worth the risk . If we are serious about wanting to break our dependence on foreign oil and move to energy independence ; if we want to lower the cost of energy ; if we want to combat climate change and cut greenhouse gas emissions ; if we want to create millions of new jobs then more offshore drilling is not the way to go . 4.02 pm CDT : Admiral Thad Allen pops up on MSNBC to be interviewed\\/shouted at by Chris Matthews . Matthews barks at the admiral to ask if top kill is working . Allen wo n't be drawn , but does say : `` They 've successfully done something at 5,000 feet that 's never been done before . '' On the idea of getting a fleet of supertankers to cruise around sucking up oil from the water 's surface , as was done off Saudi Arabia in the 1990s , Adm Allen says there are various problems , such as not having enough room around the Deepwater rig site , but that it 's being considered . 4.30 pm CDT : Bad news : the New York Times is reporting that the top kill effort has been suspended by BP because too much fluid is still escaping from the leak . BP had to halt its ambitious effort to plug its stricken oil well in the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday afternoon when engineers saw that too much of the drilling fluid they were injecting into the well was escaping along with the leaking crude oil . A technician at the BP command center said that pumping of the fluid had to be stopped temporarily while engineers were revising their plans , and that the company hoped to resume pumping by midnight , if federal officials approved . The technician , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters , said the problem was not seen as serious . `` We 're still quite optimistic , '' he said , but cautioned : `` It is not assured and its not a done deal yet . All of this will require some time . '' The NYT is doing some top reporting work on top kill . 5.15 pm CDT : The Associated Press is confirming the New York Times story , mentioned below , that BP has suspended top kill operations for the time being : BP is pausing its unprecedented attempt to plug the Gulf of Mexico oil leak , saying it wants to monitor the effects of the top kill attempt . BP said Thursday that nothing was going wrong with the procedure that involves force-feeding mud into the blown-out well in an attempt to overcome the oil flowing upward . BP says it hopes to resume shooting mud into the well Thursday night . Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles says he is not surprised that it is taking longer than expected . Garret Graves with the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority shows his hand after collecting oil samples in Pass A Loutre near Venice , Louisiana on 26 May 2010 Photograph : Sean Gardner\\/Reuters Scientists warned there was potential for even greater damage with a forecast of an unusually hazardous hurricane season . The national weather service in its yearly forecast for the hurricane season starting 1 June predicted between eight to 14 hurricanes across the Atlantic . Of those , three to seven could be major hurricanes , category three storms or higher . Hurricane Katrina was a category three . Amid all the talk of technology and top kills , it 's easy to overlook the risks that remain , and how the people and the economy of the Gulf of Mexico will be living with the consequences of this for many years . 6pm CDT : Doug Suttles makes an appearance on CNN , and says that BP has restarted pumping mud into the well within the last hour , after earlier suspending pumping as reported by NYT and AP -LRB- see below -RRB- . Based on Suttles comments it appears that pumping actually stopped for several hours earlier today as BP 's engineers tried to judge what had happened . Asked by CNN what had happened , Suttles said : `` Too much of the mud is exiting the riser as opposed to going down the well bore . '' This could be fixed in several ways , including the infamous `` junk shot '' , using a more viscous mud type , or finally restarting pumping at very high rates . Should n't BP have given more information about the state of the pumping and the top kill , given the level of public interest ? `` I should apologise to folks that we have n't given more data on that , we 've been so focussed on the operation , '' said Suttles . Once again , `` We should know in the next 24 to 36 hours '' if it 's successful . James Carville pops up on CNN to comment on Suttles ' revelation about the stop-start pumping : `` This is why no one believes BP any more . '' 6.55 pm CDT : So , where are we now ? It turns out that , rather than pumping mud into the well as part of its top kill procedure , that BP actually suspended pumping around midnight local time last night , because it needed more mud to be brought in . None of this was mentioned in the course of the day by BP , which merely repeated the 24-hour window line that it has maintained since the top kill operation started on Wednesday . Pumping has now resumed although we only have BP 's word for that . The problem appears to be that the drilling mud was gushing from the the broken drill pipe . That does n't mesh with BP 's repeated statements during the day that everything was going according to plan . `` The fact that we had a bunch of mud going up the riser is n't ideal but it 's not necessarily indicative of a problem , '' said spokesman Tom Mueller told AP tonight . BP only made these revelations after first the New York Times and the Associated Press reported that the top kill pumping had ceased . Now BP says it could be late tomorrow or the weekend before it knows if it has cut off the oil from the ruined well . 7.30 pm CDT : The Washington Post has more details on BP 's stop-start top kill process , and mentions that BP is considering a `` junk shot '' tonight : Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer , said that on Wednesday the company had blasted high-pressure mud into the leaking well two times , trying to force the oil down in a procedure compared to using one firehose against another . After doing it twice , Suttles said , the company stopped about midnight Wednesday , and spent Thursday assessing the plumes still shooting out of broken machinery . He said that company officials believed the two efforts had probably made some progress . `` I think some people believe it has . Some people believe it 's less obvious it has , '' Suttles said . `` What we do believe we 've done is successfully pumped some mud , some of this drilling mud , into this wellbore . '' But , Suttles said , oil was still coming out , despite these efforts : `` What we do know is that we have not yet stopped the flow . '' He said the company would try the procedure again Thursday evening and might add chunkier debris such as rubber balls to the mix in hopes of clogging the leaking pipe . That procedure is known as a `` junk shot . '' 8pm CDT : This seems like a good place to wrap things up for the night . The latest word from BP is guess what ? it will take another 24 to 48 hours before we know if top kill has been successful . But in the meantime , nothing has gone wrong , according to BP . Since this is a hugely technical exercise , we turn to the experts , and few are more expert than Eric Smith of the Tulane Energy Institute , who says that BP 's stop-start activities do not indicate the top kill had failed . `` The good news is that they pumped in up to 65 barrels a minute and the thing did n't blow apart , '' Smith told AP . `` It 's taken the most pressure it needs to see and it 's held together .

Photograph : Getty Images The Gulf of Mexico oil spill , which could see BP face hundreds of lawsuits , is giving new impetus to a highly damaging legal case stemming from a previous environmental disaster in Alaska . A UK pension fund alleges that it lost money because of falls in the BP share price after a pipeline leak in the Prudhoe Bay field four years ago . Lawyers for the fund say the latest spill is providing further ammunition for its case . `` It is too soon to tell exactly what went wrong in the gulf , but what is clear is that they -LRB- the accidents -RRB- both reflect a corporate culture and series of operating procedures that need to be reformed , '' said Thomas Dubbs , a partner at New York law firm Labaton Sucharow , which is handling the case against BP for the Lothian pension fund , claiming tens of millions of dollars . The fund , an investor in BP , looks after the retirement benefits of 67,000 workers employed by councils in Edinburgh and the Midlothian area , and also by the local bus company . The pension providers are taking the company to court for the stock market losses attached to pipeline fractures that resulted in 200,000 gallons of oil being spilled and the Prudhoe Bay field being temporarily shut down . Accidents in March and August 2006 knocked billions off the BP share price , and Lothian is arguing that its funds have paid the price for management ineptitude . The Lothian case could open the way for similar challenges and do further damage to BP 's reputation , which was also hurt by the Texas City refinery fire in the US in 2005 , when 15 workers died . The company is being battered anew by the Gulf of Mexico disaster , which has wiped $ 30bn off the share price . Investigations by Congress and US federal authorities into the Alaskan spills showed , say the plaintiffs , `` that BP knowingly , or with deliberate recklessness , failed to properly maintain , operate , inspect and monitor its pipelines at Prudhoe Bay '' . They go on : `` BP had received repeated warnings from multiple sources and knew that its pipelines were severely corroded , repeatedly cut corrosion-inhibiting maintenance in order to reduce costs and improve profits , and failed for more than 14 years to inspect the inside of the pipelines with an in-line inspection tool that would have precisely identified the level and location of the corrosion . '' The Prudhoe Bay case comes as the oil company and the rig operator in the Gulf of Mexico , Transocean , are reported to be facing 130 lawsuits filed by fishermen , property owners and tourism businesses claiming damages from the oil coming ashore after the explosion . The Lothian action , brought against BP 's former group chief executive Lord Browne and BP America boss Robert Malone , claims that the company knew of the corrosion problems at the highest level . The Lothian lawyers say that , as far back as May 2004 , the chairman of the environmental committee of BP 's board of directors , Walter Massey , received a letter predicting a `` major catastrophic event '' and warning that cost-cutting had caused `` serious corrosion of flow lines and systems '' . BP declined to comment on the case .

Photograph : George Esiri\\/Reuters We reached the edge of the oil spill near the Nigerian village of Otuegwe after a long hike through cassava plantations . Ahead of us lay swamp . We waded into the warm tropical water and began swimming , cameras and notebooks held above our heads . We could smell the oil long before we saw it the stench of garage forecourts and rotting vegetation hanging thickly in the air . The farther we traveled , the more nauseous it became . Soon we were swimming in pools of light Nigerian crude , the best-quality oil in the world . One of the many hundreds of 40-year-old pipelines that crisscross the Niger delta had corroded and spewed oil for several months . Forest and farmland were now covered in a sheen of greasy oil . Drinking wells were polluted and people were distraught . No one knew how much oil had leaked . `` We lost our nets , huts and fishing pots , '' said Chief Promise , village leader of Otuegwe and our guide . `` This is where we fished and farmed . We have lost our forest . We told Shell of the spill within days , but they did nothing for six months . '' That was the Niger delta a few years ago , where , according to Nigerian academics , writers and environment groups , oil companies have acted with such impunity and recklessness that much of the region has been devastated by leaks . In fact , more oil is spilled from the delta 's network of terminals , pipes , pumping stations and oil platforms every year than has been lost in the Gulf of Mexico , the site of a major ecological catastrophe caused by oil that has poured from a leak triggered by the explosion that wrecked BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig last month . That disaster , which claimed the lives of 11 rig workers , has made headlines round the world . By contrast , little information has emerged about the damage inflicted on the Niger delta . Yet the destruction there provides us with a far more accurate picture of the price we have to pay for drilling oil today . On 1 May this year a ruptured ExxonMobil pipeline in the state of Akwa Ibom spilled more than a million gallons into the delta over seven days before the leak was stopped . Local people demonstrated against the company but say they were attacked by security guards . Community leaders are now demanding $ 1bn in compensation for the illness and loss of livelihood they suffered . Few expect they will succeed . In the meantime , thick balls of tar are being washed up along the coast . Within days of the Ibeno spill , thousands of barrels of oil were spilled when the nearby Shell Trans Niger pipeline was attacked by rebels . A few days after that , a large oil slick was found floating on Lake Adibawa in Bayelsa state and another in Ogoniland . `` We are faced with incessant oil spills from rusty pipes , some of which are 40 years old , '' said Bonny Otavie , a Bayelsa MP . This point was backed by Williams Mkpa , a community leader in Ibeno : `` Oil companies do not value our life ; they want us to all die . In the past two years , we have experienced 10 oil spills and fishermen can no longer sustain their families . It is not tolerable . '' With 606 oilfields , the Niger delta supplies 40 % of all the crude the United States imports and is the world capital of oil pollution . Life expectancy in its rural communities , half of which have no access to clean water , has fallen to little more than 40 years over the past two generations . Locals blame the oil that pollutes their land and can scarcely believe the contrast with the steps taken by BP and the US government to try to stop the Gulf oil leak and to protect the Louisiana shoreline from pollution . `` If this Gulf accident had happened in Nigeria , neither the government nor the company would have paid much attention , '' said the writer Ben Ikari , a member of the Ogoni people . `` This kind of spill happens all the time in the delta . '' `` The oil companies just ignore it . The lawmakers do not care and people must live with pollution daily . The situation is now worse than it was 30 years ago . When I see the efforts that are being made in the US I feel a great sense of sadness at the double standards . What they do in the US or in Europe is very different . '' `` We see frantic efforts being made to stop the spill in the US , '' said Nnimo Bassey , Nigerian head of Friends of the Earth International . `` But in Nigeria , oil companies largely ignore their spills , cover them up and destroy people 's livelihood and environments . The Gulf spill can be seen as a metaphor for what is happening daily in the oilfields of Nigeria and other parts of Africa . `` This has gone on for 50 years in Nigeria . People depend completely on the environment for their drinking water and farming and fishing . They are amazed that the president of the US can be making speeches daily , because in Nigeria people there would not hear a whimper , '' he said . It is impossible to know how much oil is spilled in the Niger delta each year because the companies and the government keep that secret . However , two major independent investigations over the past four years suggest that as much is spilled at sea , in the swamps and on land every year as has been lost in the Gulf of Mexico so far . One report , compiled by WWF UK , the World Conservation Union and representatives from the Nigerian federal government and the Nigerian Conservation Foundation , calculated in 2006 that up to 1.5 m tons of oil 50 times the pollution unleashed in the Exxon Valdez tanker disaster in Alaska has been spilled in the delta over the past half century . Last year Amnesty calculated that the equivalent of at least 9m barrels of oil was spilled and accused the oil companies of a human rights outrage . According to Nigerian federal government figures , there were more than 7,000 spills between 1970 and 2000 , and there are 2,000 official major spillages sites , many going back decades , with thousands of smaller ones still waiting to be cleared up . More than 1,000 spill cases have been filed against Shell alone . Last month Shell admitted to spilling 14,000 tonnes of oil in 2009 . The majority , said the company , was lost through two incidents one in which the company claims that thieves damaged a wellhead at its Odidi field and another where militants bombed the Trans Escravos pipeline . Shell , which works in partnership with the Nigerian government in the delta , says that 98 % of all its oil spills are caused by vandalism , theft or sabotage by militants and only a minimal amount by deteriorating infrastructure . `` We had 132 spills last year , as against 175 on average . Safety valves were vandalised ; one pipe had 300 illegal taps . We found five explosive devices on one . Sometimes communities do not give us access to clean up the pollution because they can make more money from compensation , '' said a spokesman . `` We have a full-time oil spill response team . Last year we replaced 197 miles of pipeline and are using every known way to clean up pollution , including microbes . We are committed to cleaning up any spill as fast as possible as soon as and for whatever reason they occur . '' These claims are hotly disputed by communities and environmental watchdog groups . They mostly blame the companies ' vast network of rusting pipes and storage tanks , corroding pipelines , semi-derelict pumping stations and old wellheads , as well as tankers and vessels cleaning out tanks . The scale of the pollution is mind-boggling . The government 's national oil spill detection and response agency -LRB- Nosdra -RRB- says that between 1976 and 1996 alone , more than 2.4 m barrels contaminated the environment . `` Oil spills and the dumping of oil into waterways has been extensive , often poisoning drinking water and destroying vegetation . These incidents have become common due to the lack of laws and enforcement measures within the existing political regime , '' said a spokesman for Nosdra . The sense of outrage is widespread . `` There are more than 300 spills , major and minor , a year , '' said Bassey . `` It happens all the year round . The whole environment is devastated . The latest revelations highlight the massive difference in the response to oil spills . In Nigeria , both companies and government have come to treat an extraordinary level of oil spills as the norm . '' A spokesman for the Stakeholder Democracy Network in Lagos , which works to empower those in communities affected by the oil companies ' activities , said : `` The response to the spill in the United States should serve as a stiff reminder as to how far spill management in Nigeria has drifted from standards across the world . '' Other voices of protest point out that the world has overlooked the scale of the environmental impact . Activist Ben Amunwa , of the London-based oil watch group Platform , said : `` Deepwater Horizon may have exceed Exxon Valdez , but within a few years in Nigeria offshore spills from four locations dwarfed the scale of the Exxon Valdez disaster many times over . Estimates put spill volumes in the Niger delta among the worst on the planet , but they do not include the crude oil from waste water and gas flares . Companies such as Shell continue to avoid independent monitoring and keep key data secret . '' Worse may be to come . One industry insider , who asked not to be named , said : `` Major spills are likely to increase in the coming years as the industry strives to extract oil from increasingly remote and difficult terrains . Future supplies will be offshore , deeper and harder to work . When things go wrong , it will be harder to respond . '' Judith Kimerling , a professor of law and policy at the City University of New York and author of Amazon Crude , a book about oil development in Ecuador , said : `` Spills , leaks and deliberate discharges are happening in oilfields all over the world and very few people seem to care . '' There is an overwhelming sense that the big oil companies act as if they are beyond the law . Bassey said : `` What we conclude from the Gulf of Mexico pollution incident is that the oil companies are out of control . `` It is clear that BP has been blocking progressive legislation , both in the US and here . In Nigeria , they have been living above the law . They are now clearly a danger to the planet . The dangers of this happening again and again are high . They must be taken to the international court of justice . '' The US and Europe ignore it This article appeared on p20 of the Main section section of the Observer on 00.04 BST on Sunday 30 May 2010 .

But our thirst for oil is the real issue Science will solve this crisis , but the real cause is America 's demands and our refusal to pay oil 's true price Barack Obama examines tar balls from the spill on a Louisiana beach last week . Photograph : EPA As this piece is written , act one of the Gulf of Mexico tragedy continues , agonisingly , to unfold . We , the people of the region , keep hoping to leave behind the terrifying explosions and ghastly loss of human life , the dread invoked by black jets billowing endlessly from below and the floating oil spreading over an ever-growing area . We want to move on to act two , which will feature many dirty shovels , corpses of birds and people crying over the loss of a landscape they love . Act three has yet to be written ; it will employ an enormous cast of lawyers and last for decades , but in that time there will be some healing , we hope . That 's what we need to happen as soon as possible , but we ca n't seem to get the damned thing plugged up . I am told that Britons like to measure areas by comparison to the size of Wales . The oil spill stretching across the Gulf is now far bigger than Wales ; it 's about the size of Scotland and growing by more than 1,500 square kilometres -LRB- 580 square miles -RRB- a day . It was my observation , in satellite images of this inexorable spread , that led me to conclude in early May that the rate of release being cited by BP and repeated by our coastguard 1,000 barrels a day was preposterous . After initial pressure , the rate was upped to 5,000 barrels per day still too low by my estimation by at least a factor of five . BP , however , refused to make any effort to estimate the flow , claiming this could jeopardise its response efforts , which could not possibly be any greater , it avowed . At this point , three weeks into the calamity , BP had yet to release any video images of the oil gushing from the stricken well . Pressure from journalists eventually pried loose a single , 30-second clip , along with a statement from BP professing surprise that anyone was even interested and the certainty that no one looking at the images could possibly tell what the flow rate was . Not so , it turned out . Several scientists were able to estimate flow rates at between 40,000 and 100,000 barrels a day . Suddenly a great many people were highly interested in video and other information . Threat of congressional subpoena a very powerful writ in our system forced BP to produce more video and eventually the live feed from the bottom we can now see at bp.com . The gusher video went viral . Now here 's the remarkable thing . Through all this , Doug Suttles , head of BP America , appeared day after day on TV insisting that 5,000 barrels a day was the real number . In fact , he said , this number was at the heart of all its engineering calculations for stopping the leak with the dome , the top hat , the top kill , the junk shot and , in last resort , the LMRP cap whatever that is . BP , in the words of Suttles , felt deep and sincere concern for the people of Louisiana , and everywhere else where the oil might drift . When a CNN team videoed Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal and other dignitaries afloat in an oil-drenched marsh , Suttles was quickly on the air to profess BP 's determination to clean up that `` 30 acres '' of polluted wetland . When several fishermen working on a response team were hospitalised by fumes , he was quick to note the potential danger of `` volatile organic compounds '' and just as quick to claim that BP had looked for , but failed to find , any of these nasty VOCs . My personal experience of the oil spill has been quite different . Last Wednesday my colleagues and I encountered several square kilometres of oil about a centimetre thick ; it was 12 miles off the Mississippi delta and more than 50 miles from the leaking well . It comprises several thousand cubic metres poised to come ashore from this patch alone . There are many more like it . Working to sample it without a skimmer in sight by the way we would have been overcome by fumes had we not donned respirators . Next day , on boats and planes , we easily documented not 30 acres of oiled marshland , but more than 1,000 in only a portion of the vast , vulnerable delta . What baffles me is not that BP should seek to minimize the magnitude of the spill . After all , some of our laws would make it liable to penalties of $ 1,000 per barrel released . Any company would seek to avoid such exposure . What 's puzzling is why the company 's spokespeople cleave to statements that are so readily refuted . Casting BP executives as cardboard cut-out villains does not get us very far though . Whatever the courts may find about BP 's culpability the real cause is our demand for oil and our refusal to pay its true price . Right now , everyone in America wants to do something to fight the spill . However , if you suggest that perhaps we should double the price of fuel and use the revenue to rebuild our transportation network , the general response is suspicious silence . Facile comparisons do not do justice to this still unfolding drama . If the climate scientists are even partly right , this could be a dress rehearsal for greater crises : humans instigating vast change we then struggle to control . Amid such struggles , minimizing the spill rate for PR purposes does not stop the leak ; engineering stops the leak . Expunging oil from your publicity photos does not clean the beach or tell you how badly damaged was the ecosystem ; science does that . In the struggle between spin and science , we must demand that science wins . cents Ian R MacDonald is Professor of Oceanography , Florida State University Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@observer.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : BP 's behavior in the Gulf is appalling .

Photograph : Win McNamee\\/pool\\/EPA BP has failed to stop the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico using so-called top kill and junk shot techniques , prompting an exasperated response from Barack Obama . After three days of pumping drilling mud over the leak and an attempt to plug the flow by blasting tyres , golf balls and other debris at it , BP admitted defeat last night . In its latest attempt to contain the worst oil spill in US history , it is to launch a four - to seven-day operation that will involve more oil leaking into the Gulf even if it works . Obama described the setback as `` enraging '' and `` heartbreaking '' , as documents emerged showing that BP engineers were concerned about the safety of the Deepwater Horizon rig months earlier than the company has admitted . Papers obtained by the New York Times show that issues were raised as far back as last June . The problems involved the well casing and blowout preventer , considered critical pieces in the chain of events that led to the disaster . On 22 June last year , BP engineers were worried that the casing the company wanted to use might collapse under high pressure . `` This would certainly be a worst-case scenario , '' Mark Hafle , a senior drilling engineer at BP , warned in an internal report . `` However , I have seen it happen so know it can occur . '' The company went ahead with the casing , but only after getting special permission because it violated safety policies and design standards , the New York Times reported . Hafle , testifying before a panel in Louisiana on Friday about the cause of the rig disaster , rejected the notion that BP had taken risks . He declined to comment on the leaked report . Last night BP admitted the best hope of stemming the flow completely could take a further two months , using relief wells . BP 's chief operations officer , Doug Suttles , admitted : `` We have not been able to stop the flow This scares everybody , the fact that we ca n't make this well stop flowing , the fact that we have n't succeeded so far . '' He added : `` Many of the things we 're trying have been done on the surface before , but have never been tried at 5,000 ft. '' The next approach , which also has never been attempt at this depth , involves robot submarines cutting the leaking pipe , placing a cap over it and then pumping the oil to the surface . `` We 're confident the job will work but obviously we ca n't guarantee success , '' Suttles said . He explained that if the operation succeeded it would contain most , but not all , of the leaking oil . The spill is the worse than the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster and has dumped up to 40m gallons -LRB- 150m litres -RRB- into the Gulf of Mexico , according to government estimates . Obama , who is facing mounting criticism about the government 's response , showed his frustration last night . `` It is as enraging as it is heartbreaking , and we will not relent until this leak is contained , until the waters and shores are cleaned up , and until the people unjustly victimised by this manmade disaster are made whole , '' he said . It has been 40 days since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded , killing 11 workers , and unleashing an environmental catastrophe . Oil has washed up on a vast stretch of beaches and poisoned wildlife in the ecologically sensitive area .

The rig 's convenient registration under the flag of the Marshall Islands has been raised as a safety issue in Congress . Photograph : KPA\\/Zuma\\/Rex Features Political ripples from the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster have traveled as far as the north Pacific , where authorities of the remote Marshall Islands have been found to be the ones technically responsible for scrutinising safety standards on the doomed BP rig . The rig , which was owned by Transocean , but under lease to BP when it exploded and sank on 20 April , is regarded as an ocean-going vessel in legal terms . In common with 34 other Transocean oil rigs , Deepwater Horizon was registered under the flag of convenience of the Marshall Islands , a country of barely 65,000 people halfway between Hawaii and Papau New Guinea . That status means the Marshall Islands ' shipping registry was responsible for ensuring compliance with quality standards for construction , equipment and operation on the rig . The island nation is also obliged to investigate any accidents that occur on its maritime vessels , including the loss of the Deepwater Horizon , which caused the biggest oil spill in US history . At hearings convened by the US coastguard and oil industry regulators in New Orleans , the Marshall Islands is listed as the `` substantially interested state '' in the disaster . Questions have been raised in the US Congress about why Transocean registers its rigs in a country 7,000 miles from Washington with a gross domestic product of $ 133m 700 times less than BP 's market capitalization . Jim Oberstar , a Democratic congressman from Minnesota , suggested last week that the move was to scrimp on safety inspections : `` Coastguard inspection of a US-flagged mobile offshore drilling unit takes two to three weeks , but the safety examination of a foreign flag offshore drilling unit , such as Deepwater Horizon , takes four to eight hours . '' During a hearing on Capitol Hill , Judy Chu , a Democratic member of Congress , from California , asked why Transocean had its headquarters in Switzerland , where it had a dozen or so employees , and why it registered its rigs in the Pacific : She said it raised the question of `` whether such companies seek to avoid safety regulations by flagging the vessel outside the US '' . The Marshall Islands , in common with a handful of other small nations , including Panama , Liberia and the Bahamas , actively markets its `` flag '' as a convenient registration . In January , 2,012 vessels weighing a total of 52m tonnes operated under its flag . The International Transport Workers ' Federation claims such flags are simply a way of avoiding taxes , paying cheap registration fees and enabling ship owners to employ cheap labor . Transocean admitted there was a `` financial tax benefit '' in registering its rigs in the Marshall Islands . But the company 's co-general counsel , Rachel Clingman , said there were practical issues , too . The lawyer said registering in the US would mean rigs being captained by a US citizen and needing to be physically inspected by the US coastguard each year . `` When the rig is traveling around the world and is sometimes in the middle east or far east , that becomes a logistical issue . '' The Marshall Islands , a string of 29 atolls and five islands economically dependent upon US aid , were once best known as a testing ground for US nuclear bombs . Local industries include fishing , handicrafts and the production of coconut oil . The country 's shipping registry is administered by a private firm , International Registries Inc , which has its headquarters in Reston , Washington DC . A spokeswoman , Laura Sherman , said Marshall Islands representatives had been in the Gulf of Mexico since the rig exploded . She said the islands had a commitment to `` working with shipowners , operators and other industry stakeholders to ensure the safety and security of passengers and crews , their cargos and their ships , along with the protection of the marine environment '' .

As anger and despair grew in the coastal communities of Louisiana , BP began preparations to cut a leaking drill pipe on the ocean floor and attach a containment cap intended to capture at least some of the 12,000 to 19,000 barrels of crude spewing from its Macondo well every day . The oil company , which has come under withering attack for its handling of the crisis , acknowledged there was `` no certainty '' of success in the effort , which will take four to seven days and which some experts say could make the leak worse . A White House adviser said the US government was `` prepared for the worst '' after efforts to halt the leak by pumping mud , golf balls , tyres and other debris into the well were halted without success yesterday . Carol Browner , the administration 's energy czar , said there may be no solution until two relief wells being drilled into the oilfield by BP are complete later in summer . `` There could be oil coming up till August when the relief wells are done , '' she said . `` This is probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country . '' At the weekend , as the failure of BP 's latest attempt became clear , President Barack Obama vented his frustration at the situation . `` It is as enraging as it is heartbreaking , and we will not relent until this leak is contained , until the waters and shores are cleaned up , and until the people unjustly victimised by this manmade disaster are made whole , '' Obama said in a statement . Another two months of leakage from the site of BP 's sunken Deepwater Horizon oil rig would mean that the spill , which already eclipses the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska , would cause even more damage to marshland wildlife habitats and to the livelihood of shrimpers , fishermen and tourism workers in southern states . Oil already stretches over a distance of 130 miles by 70 miles . Browner said : `` We are prepared for the worst . We have been prepared from the beginning . '' As the crisis moved to its fifth week , both BP and Obama faced attacks for failing to come up with a solution . Billy Nungesser , president of Plaquemines parish , Louisiana , called for immediate funding to build a network of sand barriers to protect the coastline . `` It 's time for BP to step up to the plate do n't wait for the president , '' said Nungesser . `` Every time that oil takes out a piece of the marsh , a piece of Louisiana is gone forever . '' Oil has been leaking from a broken drilling pipe on the ocean floor since the rig caught fire and sank on 20 April , killing 11 offshore workers . At the weekend , BP abandoned a `` top kill '' operation to fix the leak after engineers were unable to stem the pressure of oil with thousands of tonnes of drilling mud . `` We 're disappointed that oil is going to flow for a while and we 're going to redouble our efforts to keep it off the beaches , '' BP 's managing director , Bob Dudley , told CNN . `` We 're moving to a containment operation . '' BP 's new plan involves using underwater robots and a diamond wire-cutter to create a clean cut through the leaking pipe , then attach a `` riser '' allowing oil to be pumped to the ocean surface and collected by a ship . Experts say it will be difficult to create a watertight seal on a high-pressure gushing pipe at a depth of 1,500 metres -LRB- 5,000 ft -RRB- . Former US secretary of state Colin Powell joined calls for the military to take command of the operation from BP . Powell said the problem was beyond the capacity of BP to solve and the government should bring in `` decisive force '' . He said : `` The military brings organization , it brings control , it brings assets .

Why top kill attempt failed , what BP will do next and more on the Deepwater Horizon oil spill crisis Sunday 30 May 2010 22.52 BST A video image released by BP shows equipment being used to try and plug its gushing oil well , a manoevre known as ` top kill ' that failed . Photograph : Associated Press Why did top kill fail ? `` Top kill '' was BP 's attempt to plug the oil leak by pumping huge quantities of mud into the blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- that sits on the seabed . Two high pressure pumps were used to force mud into the BOP , with the aim of pushing the oil and gas back down the well shaft . BP hoped this would halt the flow for long enough for it to pump cement into the shaft , sealing it . Top kill started last Wednesday night , and during the operation BP made three separate attempts to block the well , using a total of 30,000 barrels of heavy mud . It also fired a mixture of waste material into the BOP in an attempt to block the leak point . Early signs were encouraging a webcam pointing at the site showed that mud , rather than oil , was leaking out of the well pipe . But ultimately the pressure forcing the oil upwards proved greater than the force of the mud , which was delivered at a pressure of 6,800 pounds per square inch . BP 's chief operating officer , Doug Suttles , said it decided to pull the plug on top kill after its `` best and brightest people '' agreed it was not working . Oil industry experts had warned that the pressure of the mud might fracture the rock around the well , dissipating the pressure and letting the oil and gas surge back up . Top Kill 's failure has crushed hopes of an early end to the disaster . At the moment the pipe which would normally deliver oil from the wellhead to a rig floating on the surface is bent , running from the well to the sea bed , where it is broken and spewing oil . BP plans to sever the pipe at the well and then lower a container on to the BOP on the ocean floor . This container , called the lower marine riser package -LRB- LMRP -RRB- cap containment system , is `` an engineered containment device with a sealing grommet '' . BP hopes oil and gas will collect in the LMRP and then be taken to a tanker on the surface . How long will the new operation take ? Cutting the pipe and attaching the LMRP is expected to take between four and seven days . Both BP and the US government have tried to play down expectations . Barack Obama called it `` not without risk '' , while Suttles said it would only capture some of the escaping oil as there will not be a tight seal between the LMRP and the BOP . Philip Johnson , associate professor of engineering at Alabama University , has warned that the flow of oil will increase once the bent pipe is removed . Suttles , though , has said that pressure data from the BOP suggests there will not be a significant impact . What if LMRP does n't work ? BP could try and cover the leak by dropping a second BOP on to the existing one . As a BOP is much heavier than a LMRP cap , this might succeed . BP says it is still generating new ideas , partly thanks to more than 28,000 suggestions from the public . `` We 've taken bits and pieces from the ideas that have come into us , '' a spokesman said . Previous attempts to control the flow of escaping oil have included using robot submarines to try and activate the well 's built-in safety mechanisms . These failed to activate on 20 April when an explosion ripped through the Deepwater Horizon rig , and BP 's robots were unable to make them work either . BP then lowered a large container , similar but bigger to the LMRP , over the site , hoping to collect the oil and gas and transport it to the surface . This dome quickly became clogged with icy crystals . BP also pushed a riser insertion tube tool into the leaking pipe , to collect oil . This was only a partial success , collecting an average of 2,010 barrels of oil per day . Dispersants were used to break up the oil slick , but BP was ordered to cut some of their use by the White House after fears that these toxic chemicals were causing further damage to marine life in the Gulf . What else could BP try ? It has started drilling two more wells to intercept the existing shaft . That will allow it to inject concrete deep into the seabed and permanently stop the leak . Some experts believe this is the only certain way of stopping the disaster . The first relief well is already over 12,000 ft deep , but it is likely to take until the end of July to complete . The second well was paused last week so that its BOP was available in case BP tries the BOP-on-BOP procedure . Could these relief wells hit problems ? The most obvious risk is the weather . Hurricane season officially starts on1 June , and a serious storm could force BP to suspend drilling -LRB- as well as upset efforts to protect the US coastline from the spill -RRB- . Johnson believes hurricanes are `` a threat '' , but that BP should be able to complete the drilling before the serious storms arrive in August and September . `` You can stay on site through many storm conditions , but in the worst cases you have to pull up the well . The reality is that a big storm this early is not likely . '' How bad is the spill ? US researchers believe BP 's shattered well is leaking between 12,000 and 25,000 barrels of oil per day . If it continues at that rate until a relief well is completed , up to 2.275 m barrels -LRB- or 95.5 m US gallons -RRB- will have entered the Gulf of Mexico . That is nearly 10 times as much as in the Exxon Valdez disaster , and close to the Ixtoc spill in 1979 , the largest accidental spill in history , which leaked around 3m barrels . The all-time worst oil spill occurred in 1991 when Iraqi soldiers torched Kuwait 's oil fields , causing an estimated 11m barrels -LRB- 462m gallons -RRB- to leak . How much has BP spent on this crisis ? BP said the cost of the spill response , containment , relief-well drilling , grants to the Gulf states , compensation claims and federal costs had hit $ 930m -LRB- # 642m -RRB- . The final cost is unclear one analyst suggested BP could be liable for $ 60bn of civil penalties if it is found to have acted with `` gross negligence '' . How much damage has been caused on the mainland ? Rear Admiral Mary Landry of the US coastguard reported that around 105 miles of Louisiana coastline have been contaminated . Local fisherman fear their livelihoods will be damaged for many years , even if the LMRP container works .

Photograph : Jae C. Hong\\/AP The White House says the BP oil spill is probably the greatest environmental disaster the US has faced , but the true impact on surrounding ecosystems could take months or even years to emerge . Experts say the unprecedented depth of the spill , combined with the use of chemicals that broke the oil down before it reached the surface , pose an unknown threat . `` It 's difficult to marshal resources to do a thorough job of charting what the impacts are , '' Jeffrey Short , an environmental chemist who worked on the effects of the Exxon Valdez spill , told Nature magazine . `` It 's especially difficult when weird things happen to catch the scientific community bysurprise . That 's clearly the case here . '' Louisiana , the nearest state to the leaking well , some 42 miles offshore , has been the most impacted . The state 's governor , Bobby Jindal , said more than 100 miles of its 400-mile coast had so far been polluted . State officials have reported sheets of oil soiling wetlands and seeping into marine and bird nurseries , leaving a stain of sticky crude on cane that binds the marshes together . Billy Nungesser , president of Plaquemines parish , said he had seen dying cane and `` no life '' in parts of Pass-a-Loutre wildlife refuge . Oil debris , in the form of tar balls and surface sheen , has also been reported ashore in outlying parts of coastal Mississippi and Alabama . Tar balls found on Florida beaches a fortnight ago did not come from the BP spill , tests showed . A quarter of US waters in the Gulf of Mexico are closed to fishing , hitting the livelihoods of shrimpers , oyster-catchers and charter boat operators . `` Every fish and invertebrate contacting the oil is probably dying . I have no doubt about that , '' said Prosanta Chakrabarty , a Louisiana State University fish biologist . In the six weeks since the explosion that killed 11 workers and started the leak , wildlife officials say at least 491 birds , 227 turtles and 27 mammals , including dolphins , have been found dead along the US Gulf coast . Many of these were not related to the spill ; only 28 of the dead birds were covered in oil . More marine creatures , including birds and mammals will be affected by surface oil , and scientists are also concerned about possible underwater clouds of dispersed oil . Researchers say they have found at least two sprawling underwater plumes of what appear to be oil or oil derivatives , each hundreds of metres deep and stretching for miles . A plume reported last week by a team from the University of South Florida was headed toward the continental shelf off the Alabama coastline , waters thick with fish and other marine life . No major fish kills have yet been reported , but federal officials said the impacts could take years to unfold . `` This is just a giant experiment going on and we 're trying to understand scientifically what this means , '' said Roger Helm , a senior official with the US Fish and Wildlife Service . David Hollander , an oceanographer at the University of South Florida who helped discover one of the plumes , said : `` It may be due to the application of the dispersants that a portion of the petroleum has extracted itself from the crude and is now incorporated into the waters with solvents and detergents . '' He said there could be knock-on impacts on organisms further up the food chain . `` We think there could be both short-term and long-term implications .

Photograph : Stephane Jourdain\\/AFP\\/Getty Images While work continues to try to staunch the flow of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , an avalanche of class action lawsuits is descending upon BP in courthouses from Texas to Louisiana , Alabama , Mississippi and Florida . The suits include claims for loss of earnings , loss of enjoyment or property , or for bereavement suffered by families of the 11 workers killed when BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig caught fire and sank on 30 April . BP has pledged to meet all `` legitimate claims '' . But after the failure of the company 's attempted `` top kill '' fix at the weekend , financial analysts fear the cost could become astronomical if oil continues to flow into the Gulf for weeks to come . Estimates of the potential cost of the spill vary widely . Including the clean-up , compensation and fines , UBS has suggested BP could face a bill of $ 12bn -LRB- # 8.25 bn -RRB- . Jason Kenney , an analyst at ING Commercial banking , increased his estimate of the cost from $ 5.3 bn to up to $ 22bn if the spill continues until August . Among the most harrowing claims is a suit filed by survivors and bereaved family members from the blast that sank Deepwater Horizon . Rhonda Burkeen lost her husband , Aaron , on the rig , where he worked as a crane operator . Another plaintiff , Bill Johnson , was Burkeen 's supervisor , who escaped the accident but suffered smoke inhalation and traumatic stress . Johnson escaped on a lifeboat , but was kept alongside the rig , with colleagues , for hours as a fire raged . The lawsuit says : `` The company made the decision to keep these men there for over 10 hours alongside the blazing rig as the men stared at the rig , knowing their friends were on it . '' The rig , leased by BP from a Swiss-registered firm , Transocean , was covered by a Lloyd 's insurance policy . Lloyd 's said last week it expected to meet claims of between $ 300m and $ 600m arising from the loss of the offshore platform . Faced with clean-up and compensation bills , BP is seeking up to $ 700m from Transocean 's insurers . This claim , filed on 14 May , has gone down badly with insurers , who say they are only responsible for damage to the rig not for any leak below the surface of the water . An array of potentially costly lawsuits are landing at BP 's feet . One suit is filed in the name of Kimberly and Do Nguyen , who run a seafood business called The Shrimp Guy . It seeks damages on behalf of all Mississippi businesses engaged in `` wholesale , retail and\\/or delivery '' of seafood caught in the Gulf of Mexico , accusing BP of failure to `` prevent or mitigate risk '' of an oil spill . In common with many similar lawsuits , the claim alleges that BP ignored evidence of a broken seal on its well , 50 miles off the US coast , and that it and Transocean were aware of failures in the power source of a blowout preventer that was supposed to seal the well in an emergency . A class action lawsuit on behalf of restaurant owners has been filed under the name of the Smiling Fish Cafe , known for its locally caught seafood , in Santa Rosa Beach , Florida . It says pollution has made produce costlier and harder to come by , and tourism is under threat . `` May is the beginning of the summer season , when visitors and locals alike flock to Florida 's coastal seafood restaurants to enjoy the sea 's bounty , '' it says . The Sprinkle Net Shop , which sells and repairs equipment used by fishermen in Mobile county , Alabama , claims its business and thousands like it have been hit by BP 's `` negligence '' . And a trio of Mississippi businessmen say their recently completed 16-room luxury fishing lodge , intended for upscale tourists , has been rendered `` practically worthless '' by the spill . Mark Lanier , a Houston-based lawyer for one group of plaintiffs , said the litigation against BP would make the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska look like `` an oil leak in a car '' . `` Honestly , this is a monstrosity , it 's a tragedy , '' he told Texas Lawyer magazine . He said it might become the biggest legal battle in US history . `` This is going to be , in my estimation , the largest tort we 've had in this country .

After the failure of the ` top kill ' repair of the oil leak , BP have admitted that the last-ditch attempt to cut into the pipe is extremely risky . Photograph : Gerald Herbert\\/AP Under immense pressure to plug its catastrophic American oil leak , BP is preparing for a hazardous last-ditch salvage operation that risks making the gush of crude into the Gulf of Mexico even heavier if its robotic submarines fail in an inch-perfect exercise to cut through a broken pipe a mile beneath the ocean 's surface . After the failure of a `` top kill '' effort to stuff the leak with mud and rubbish , BP 's managing director , Bob Dudley , stressed the difficulty of a new plan to pipe spurting oil to a ship on the ocean 's surface , describing it as highly challenging for engineers who will be asked to perform `` the equivalent of open heart surgery on television for everyone '' . The under-fire company faced calls from Louisiana lawmakers to make an immediate $ 1bn investment to protect threatened wetlands and estuaries on the Louisiana coast . The White House 's energy tsar , Carol Browner , warned that the giant , rapidly expanding oil slick caused by an explosion on BP 's Deepwater Horizon oil rig was `` probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced '' . Since becoming severed from BP 's destroyed offshore rig on 30 April , a broken drilling pipe known as a `` riser '' , which carries oil from an underground seam through the ocean floor , has been kinked downwards in the water . BP is deploying diamond-rimmed saws to cut through the pipe below this kink , in the hope that it can create a sufficiently clean break to attach a cap capable of siphoning oil to the ocean 's surface , known as a `` lower marine riser package '' . Experts worry that by removing the bend in the pipe , any remaining resistance to the flow of oil into the ocean will be eliminated . Philip Johnston , an engineering professor at the University of Alabama , said : `` This operation is scary for BP . `` When they cut the riser the rate of flow from the well , which is already truly horrific , will get significantly bigger . If they ca n't then get the cap on , it will make things worse . '' BP 's chief operating officer Doug Suttles told a press conference on Saturday that he could not guarantee the attempt would work , and even if it did it would only capture `` the majority '' of the oil . Following the first Gulf war in 2001 , a similar capping procedure was used to extinguish the well fires lit by the retreating Iraqi army . However , it has never been attempted 1,500 metres -LRB- 5,000 ft -RRB- below sea level . President Obama admitted that cutting the riser pipe `` is not without risk '' , saying : `` That is why it was not activated until other methods had been exhausted . '' On the Louisiana shore , dozens of shrimpers , fishermen , holiday-home owners , restaurateurs and hoteliers have filed lawsuits against BP for the damage to their earnings caused by the slick . Local people expressed fury at the British company 's apparent inability to stem the flow . Claude Marquette , a retired doctor in his boat at the fishing port of Venice Marina , said : `` It 's been a screw-up from day one . Nothing was at the ready and no one was in a position to respond . '' Father Gerry Stapleton , a priest at St Patrick 's Catholic church in nearby Port Sulphur , said : `` Even the government seems powerless and all the experts . If these people ca n't stop it , then who in the name of God can ? '' There is particular acrimony that BP 's initial estimate of the leak at 5,000 barrels of oil a day dramatically understated the scale of the flow , which is now put at 12,000 to 19,000 barrels a day . Ed Markey , the Democratic chairman of a congressional energy committee investigating the disaster , said BP was `` either lying or they were incompetent '' . Speaking on CBS 's Face the Nation talkshow , Markey described the leak as criminal and added : `` I have no confidence whatsoever in BP . '' The waters affected by the spill are among the most sealife-rich around the US . In 2008 , commercial fishermen landed 600m kg of finfish and shellfish in the Gulf of Mexico , generating $ 659m . Oyster fishermen worry that not only the oil but the chemical dispersants used to break up the slick will poison their harvest for months and years to come . Mary Landrieu , a Democratic senator for Louisiana , said BP should immediately commit $ 1bn to safeguarding the coastline : `` While we may not be able to plug the leaking well right away , there is nothing that should stop us from getting help to the Gulf coast immediately . '' Obama ordered government and contractor clean-up resources in areas affected by oil to be tripled . The Washington Post termed the leak `` the well that will not die '' . Many critics of the response to the crisis have urged the president to put the armed forces in charge , taking over operations from BP . But Mike Mullen , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , said that the military did not have the necessary expertise . `` It 's really not for us to lead right now because of the technical challenges , '' said Mullen . `` The technical lead for this in our country really is the -LRB- oil -RRB- industry . '' Even if BP succeeds in its latest effort to siphon oil , the operation faces a meteorological hazard in the hurricane season , which starts at the beginning of June . David Summers , a professor of mine engineering at Missouri University of Science and Technology , said it would be impossible to leave a containment vessel collecting oil on the open sea if severe weather sweeps into the Gulf . As it attempts a seal , BP will need to pump large volumes of warm water towards the leak to avoid the formation of ice crystals , which stymied a previous attempted fix . Summers said : `` This may be the best option they 've got but because they 're going to be dragging through the flow of oil as they cut , it 's going to be difficult to achieve a smooth , straight cut . '' If BP can not halt the flow , oil will continue to gush until two relief wells are ready to intercept the flow of oil by intersecting with the original bore beneath the ocean floor . One of these has reached a depth of 3,600 metres -LRB- 12,000 ft -RRB- , while the other is down to 2,500 metres , but they need to go as far as 5,500 metres before they can tap into the oil , which may not happen until August . By then , the slick on the ocean 's surface , estimated at 18m to 40m gallons of oil , could have doubled in size .

Photograph : Reuters BP has challenged widespread scientific claims that vast plumes of oil are spreading underwater from its blown-out rig in the Gulf of Mexico . The denial comes as the oil giant prepares for a new operation to put an end to the worst oil spill in US history which could see the leak get worse before it gets better . The company 's challenge to several scientific studies is likely to put it further at odds with an increasingly angry Obama administration , which has accused it of playing down the size of the leak in an effort to limit possible fines . BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , said it had no evidence of underwater oil clouds . `` The oil is on the surface , '' he said . `` Oil has a specific gravity that 's about half that of water . It wants to get to the surface because of the difference in specific gravity . '' Hayward 's assertion flies in the face of studies by scientists at universities in Florida , Georgia and Mississippi , among other institutions , who say they have detected huge underwater plumes of oil , including one 120 metres -LRB- 400ft -RRB- deep about 50 miles from the destroyed rig . BP 's claim is likely only to further anger environmentalists and the White House , which has grown increasingly suspicious of the company 's claims to be frank and transparent on developments . The president 's environmental adviser and director of the Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy , Carol Browner , has accused BP of misstating the scale of the leak . `` BP has a vested financial interest in downplaying the size of this , '' she said on CBS television . `` They will pay penalties at the end of the day , a per-barrel per-day penalty . '' Ed Markey , chairman of the House of Representatives environment committee , has also accused BP of underplaying the scale of the disaster and suggested that it may have a criminal liability . `` The fine that can be imposed upon them is based on how many barrels -LRB- pour in to the sea -RRB- . It could wind up in billions of dollars of fines , '' said Markey . `` They had a stake in low-balling the number right from the beginning . They were either lying or they were incompetent . '' The Politico website reported that the Obama team was incensed that the company failed to inform it for a day and a half after suspending the failed `` top kill '' operation to plug the spill using rubber tyres and mud . Obama is expected to hold his first meeting today with the leaders of an oil spill commission he established to make policy recommendations about US offshore oil drilling . The commission will be similar to those that looked into the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986 and the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979 . Also today , US attorney general Eric Holder will meet federal prosecutors and state attorneys general in New Orleans . It will be Holder 's first trip to survey the damage before what legal experts believe will be a criminal investigation into the disaster . The dispute between the administration and BP comes as the company readies its latest effort to contain the flow of oil in to the sea , following the failure of top kill . The new plan involves an intricate operation to cut the top off the damaged riser that brought oil to the surface of the destroyed rig . The intention is to create a flat surface to which to attach a valve that would divert the oil into a pipe and on to a ship . But slicing the top off the damaged pipe may result in oil flowing into the sea at a faster rate until the new valve is fitted . Even if successful , the operation would only limit , not entirely stop , oil from flowing into the sea . If this measure failed , BP 's best hope of halting the oil would remain the drilling of a relief well that would ease the pressure on the damaged one . But the US government has warned that the spill could continue into August . The attempts to stop the oil flow have been given added urgency by the start of the hurricane season tomorrow . Forecasters are predicting an unusually high number of storms over the next six months . If the oil is still spread across the sea , a hurricane is likely to disperse it over a much wider area and push it deeper into marshlands and other inland areas , making the environmental disaster even worse . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is predicting between eight and 14 hurricanes this season , with perhaps a similar number of smaller storms . The US military has ruled out taking charge of the operation to stem the flow of oil from the blown-out BP rig . The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , Admiral Mike Mullen , today said that military chiefs had looked at the available equipment and concluded that `` the best technology in the world , with respect to that , exists in the oil industry '' . A day earlier , the former US secretary of state , Colin Powell , said the military should step in because the crisis was now `` beyond the capacity '' of BP to stop .

Photograph : Daniel Beltra\\/Greenpeace\\/EPA As oil continues gushing from the ocean floor into the Gulf of Mexico , with no sign of stopping until a new well is finished this August , scientists , environmentalists and local residents are beginning to reckon with the reality of a massive annihilation of sea creatures and wildlife . Dead animals are already washing up on shores . Birds have been found dying in pools of oil and dispersant , which have taken over their marshland habitats . Several species in the Gulf of Mexico are already endangered , including the Kemp 's Ridley and Leatherback sea turtles , the Sperm Whale , and birds such as the Piping Plover and the Gulf Sturgeon , according to the Arizona-based Centre for Biological Diversity -LRB- CBD -RRB- . Assistant Professor Michael Blum of Tulane University 's Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology warns that some species may be at risk of extinction . `` There are ... hundreds of shorebirds and marine mammals that are acutely sensitive to oil . You could potentially lose whole species , have extinction events . Brown pelicans were just taken off the endangered species list . On this threshold , a big dieback and mortality event , they would be pushed back into a situation where they could be endangered , '' Blum said in an interview . `` A lot of the species of most concern - sea turtles and dolphins - migrate , use our breeding grounds or they 're a very important feeding ground , '' he explained . While there are no dolphin species whose populations exclusively migrate through the Gulf , Blum said those dolphins not impacted by the Gulf would be in such low numbers that they may not be able to reproduce at an adequate rate to avoid extinction . The EPA admits the impact of the oil spill - and the unprecedented use of toxic dispersants to break up the oil - on wildlife is unknown . `` We 're still deeply concerned about the things we do n't know . The long-term effect on aquatic life is unknown , '' EPA Secretary Lisa Jackson said in a conference call with reporters this week . The agency says will require rigorous autopsies and necropsies to determine whether the animals are in fact dying because of the oil and no other reason . It says soil and air sampling do not show dangerous levels of contaminants so far . `` They 're saying it 's really not clear - it 's a safe thing to say . As a scientist , one does n't want to overreach and reach erroneous conclusions , '' Blum said . However , he added , `` from a real world perspective , going down , seeing what 's happening and understanding the ecology of the system , we 're facing immediate effects of exposure . '' `` Certainly when oil washes up against the shoreline you have immediate toxic effects on almost anything . If you 're a fish , you get oil on your gills and ca n't breathe . If you 're a crab , same story . If you 're a plant , you get suffocated , it reduces photosynthesis , '' he said . Jackson , who has toured the Gulf Coast twice since the disaster began , told reporters , `` It 's clear oil is piling up in marshes . It 's quite a bit . '' She referred to the oil slick that has been reaching some shores and marshlands as `` the goop '' . `` We 're sampling the goop . There 's lots of speculation of what could be in this goop , we 'll look for dispersant chemicals as well as what else might be in there , '' Jackson said . '' BP has thrust upon us one of the greatest environmental challenges of our time . '' The Gulf marshlands are a breeding ground for many animals . Young shrimp , for example , mature in the marshlands , and then migrate to the ocean where they become food for fish . In three or four years , if there are no adult shrimp to migrate out , the entire food chain could be affected . `` Really , there are cumulative effects over time . There 's immediate shock to system , immediate toxicity and immediate mortality - birds , dolphins , marine mammals oiled . The mortality is relatively small in comparison to the potential effect that may accumulate over time . Things are not as bad now as they likely will become , '' Blum said . Watchdog groups complain that the drilling plans submitted by oil companies like BP to the U.S. government reveal a cavalier attitude towards the risk posed to animals in the Gulf . `` One of the exploration plans I read said , if there is a spill , the wildlife can probably just navigate around it . So the burden is really on the wildlife , '' said Miyoko Sakashita , CBD Oceans Director . `` Some animals have more keen sense and have stayed away . But there have been studies of sea turtles that go right through it , '' Sakashita said in an interview . `` Even if they can avoid the spill while it 's a plume in the water , that removes it from the habitat . '' The extent of the impact on Gulf Coast animals will depend on many factors , scientists say . It now looks like the spill will continue until August , although it is not clear whether the spill will continue at its current rate , or spew faster . It will also depend on whether BP or the U.S. government can keep the oil away from the coast , using techniques like `` booming '' - the placing of barriers in the water - or possibly using tankers to suck up the oily water , separate out the oil , and return the clean water into the ocean . Meanwhile , concerned citizens across the U.S. are taking matters into their own hands by sending absorbent materials like human hair and nylon stockings for use in soaking up the oil . Justin Fredericksen , a hair stylist at Mint Salon in Atlanta , got tired of feeling depressed about the disaster and decided to do something : last weekend , he organised local hairdressers to offer free cuts for customers who donate their hair to the cause . Despite the relief efforts , if a hurricane were to hit the Gulf this storm season - which is predicted to be very active - it would bring much of the oil onto the shore . Blum says it 's easier to separate oil from water than it is to separate oil from the marshlands , which he described as a `` sponge '' . Locals worry a hurricane this season could be the nail in the coffin for marshlands already teetering on the brink of destruction . cents This story is part of a series of features on biodiversity by IPS , CGIAR\\/Biodiversity International , IFEJ and UNEP\\/CBD , members of Communicators for Sustainable Development .

Photograph : Gerald Herbert\\/AP The public relations strategy for dealing with a disaster such as the Gulf of Mexico spill , now officially the worst in US history , was always going to be about damage limitation . With each failure to stem the flow , BP 's credibility has taken another blow . But at times , BP 's response has made the situation worse . In an interview with the BBC a month ago , chief executive Tony Hayward attempted to shift the blame for the accident to the US owner of the sunken rig , Transocean . `` This was not our accident This was not our drilling rig ... This was Transocean 's rig . BP press officers briefing journalists that week repeated the line that `` this was not our accident '' . Never mind that investigations into what caused the accident had barely started , with BP , Transocean and the company in charge of cementing the well , Halliburton , all pointing the finger at each other . Weeks later , after BP gave details of its own preliminary findings into the cause of the accident , a more contrite Hayward said : `` A number of companies are involved , including BP , and it is simply too early and not up to us to say who is at fault . '' But the damage had been done , as BP appeared to be trying to duck responsibility . Duncan John , a partner at StrategicFit , a strategy consultancy for the energy industry , praised BP for spelling out how likely each of their attempts to halt the spill were to work . But warned : `` Communication over the extent of their responsibility and the consequences may run the risk of aggravating an already sceptical public if not carefully handled . '' Last month , Hayward also made some ill-advised comments in an interview with the Guardian which received widespread coverage around the world . Asked about the amount of oil and dispersant flowing into the gulf , he responded : `` The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean . The amount of volume of oil and dispersant we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume . '' While technically correct , the comments made the company appear aloof and unconcerned about the environmental damage being done . In the same interview , he also said that if all other attempts failed , he could `` guarantee '' that the flow of oil would stop in three months with the completion of a relief well . At that stage , oil had not reached land in large quantities . But pressed about the damage already done to the marine environment , he said : `` No , that 's the point you seem to be missing ... The containment exercise on the surface is proving to be extraordinarily effective . '' Independent scientists have since found vast underwater plumes of oil , including one 120 metres -LRB- 400ft -RRB- deep about 50 miles from the destroyed rig . Hayward , who has a PhD in geology , said on Monday that BP had no evidence of such an underwater slick , arguing that because oil is lighter than water it will rise to the surface . For BP , seeing is believing , it seems . Last month , it flew a group of journalists , including the Guardian , in a helicopter over the Gulf of Mexico . The plan had been to fly over the site of the accident itself to see the clean-up efforts , but the pilot had to turn back half-way because there was n't time . BP officials on board insisted there was no oil to see anyway , as all the oil was being dispersed by hundreds of thousands of gallons of chemicals , which regulators have since restricted because they could be making the pollution worse . The official estimated flow rate of 5,000 barrels per day , a figure repeated by BP , increased last week to between 12,000 and 19,000 barrels . The revision was partly based on new video footage of the leak from the seabed which BP only released following pressure from scientists and the US Congress . Civil penalties are charged on a per barrel basis up to $ 4,300 each so BP 's liabilities are in direct proportion to the size of the leak . BP has said the effort to protect the shoreline of Louisiana is run jointly by itself , the US Coast Guard , and the much-maligned US offshore regulator , the Minerals Management Service -LRB- MMS -RRB- . When it comes to the hugely complex attempts to stop the flow of oil 5,000 feet below the surface , BP is running the show . With anger in the US mounting over BP 's failure to stem the leak , President Obama has been under pressure to take control of the operation . But he knows only the industry not governments has the technical knowledge required . This means Obama has little choice but to rely on BP , the company he has been heavily critical of , to try and fix the mess it may have had a hand in creating . Matthew Lockwood , from the centre-left thinktank , the Institute for Public Policy Research , says the spill underlines the dilemmas faced by governments in the era of big energy companies . The enthusiasm and can-do attitude of the 2,500 BP staff seconded from all around the globe to handle the disaster are not under question but this is not their job and the company is not an environmental organization , despite attempts to rebrand it as `` Beyond Petroleum '' . Hayward on Sunday alluded to the role BP has unwillingly adopted : `` I 'm sorry . We 're sorry for the massive disruption it 's caused their lives . There 's no one who wants this over more than I do . I 'd like my life back .

Photograph : Pablo Martinez Monsivais\\/AP Shares in BP plunged as much as 20 % at one stage today wiping another # 14bn off the company 's market value after the oil producer failed over the weekend to stop its catastrophic oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico . BP has now lost # 44bn of its value since 20 April , when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded . By 2.30 pm the shares had staged a partial recovery from early lows of 420p , after their biggest fall in 18 years , but were still trading 14 % lower at 423.1 p. City experts believe the combination of the continuing leak and the prospect of huge future legal costs and political damage in the US could be disastrous for the company . Dougie Youngson , oil analyst at Arbuthnot , said : `` This situation has now gone far beyond concerns of BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward being fired , or shareholder dividend payouts being cut it 's got the real smell of death . This could break BP . `` Given the collapse in the share price and the potential for it to fall further , we expect that it could become a takeover target particularly if its operating position in the US becomes untenable . '' Hayward has come under fire in the US for his handling of the crisis and drew further criticism when he appeared make an insensitive remark when asked about the impact of the spill . `` I 'm sorry . We 're sorry for the massive disruption it 's caused their lives . There 's no one who wants this over more than I do . I 'd like my life back , '' he said . BP 's next move to stop the leak involves deploying remote-controlled submarines to carry equipment and cut small pipes 5,000 feet -LRB- 1,524 m -RRB- below the surface of the water , ahead of placing a containment cap over the leak . It should take four days to complete , although the spill could worsen before then . BP has spent almost $ 1bn -LRB- # 700m -RRB- so far attempting to plug the leak , but said it was `` too early '' to quantify other potential costs and liabilities associated with the incident . The total bill could rise to as much as $ 12bn , according to UBS . Tony Shepard , an analyst at Charles Stanley , said : `` With the prospect of several more months of pollution , BP and the oil industry will come under increasing pressure . This environmental catastrophe will have global implications for the whole industry in terms of new deepwater drilling regulations . '' The company has received as many as 30,000 claims , mostly from businesses in the US states of Texas , Louisiana , Alabama and Florida , which involve loss of earnings or bereavement suffered by families of the 11 workers killed when the rig caught fire . Speculators rushed to buy protection against a potential default of BP credit , sending its price to $ 170,000 to protect $ 10m of debt a $ 68,000 jump from the previous day , according to Markit . Investors demand a premium of 148 basis points on average to buy BP 's bonds over government debt , according to Bloomberg News . That 's almost double the 77-basis point spread on notes sold by industrial companies with similar credit ratings .

Photograph : Lee Celano\\/Reuters Juan Antonio Dzul was a teenager when the Ixtoc 1 oil rig collapsed in June 1979 in the Gulf of Mexico , 70 miles from the fishing town of Champot n where he grew up and still lives . The memory of the huge spill that followed is etched on his mind . `` The oil covered the reefs and washed up on the shore . Fish died and the octopuses were buried under the oil that filled the gaps between the rocks where they live , '' he recalled in a phone interview . `` Even today you can find stains on rocks a few centimetres deep , and if you stick something metal in them the smell of oil still escapes . '' Champot n was one of the first and worst-hit areas reached by the estimated 3m barrels of oil that poured into the sea over the next nine and a half months . The Ixtoc disaster is still by far the largest peacetime spill , as well as a lesson-packed forerunner of the disaster in progress , as the Deepwater Horizon also exploded and sank after a blowout preventer failed . The parallels are most striking in the methods that failed to cap the damaged well head beneath . `` They tried to put a funnel on top of it , injected mud and saltwater and cement , but everything they tried to put in the well was forced out by the pressure , '' says Abundio Juarez . He was one of the top engineers in the state-owned company , Pemex , that was exploring the Ixtoc deposit at the time , although he was not directly involved in the control effort . He says the company also tried golf balls . `` We sent divers down and today they have robots , but the only solution then , and now , is a relief well and that takes time . '' Pemex also used booms and skimmers , and dumped chemical dispersants on the slicks . That , the scientists say today , helped reduce the amounts reaching the shore but sent encapsulated oil down to the sea bed with some initially devastating effects , particularly for shrimp larvae . Meanwhile , the oil was washing up all along the gulf , a foot deep in some places , as it was pushed northwards by prevailing winds and currents until it finally crossed the Texas border two months later and eventually coated almost 170 miles of US beaches . The beach that caused most international concern in Mexico was Rancho Nuevo , a key nesting ground for critically endangered Kemp 's Ridley sea turtles which had already lumbered up the sand in their hundreds to lay eggs . By the time the eggs hatched , the oil was lapping at the shore . Had an emergency US-Mexican operation not airlifted them over the spill to cleaner waters beyond , a generation might have been wiped out . But although Ixtoc was a big disaster , it did not develop into the long-term catastrophe that scientists initially thought was inevitable . `` This is not to say there were no consequences . Just that the evidence is that these are not as dramatic as we feared , '' says Luis Soto , a marine biologist from the National Autonomous University of Mexico . `` After about two years the recuperation was well on the way . '' Wes Tunnell , now at the Texas Harte Research Institute , took samples before and after the oil arrived in Texas that showed an immediate 80 % drop in the number of organisms living between the grains of sand that provide food for shore birds and crabs . `` Sampling a couple of years after the spill indicated the populations were back to normal , '' he says . Six years after Ixtoc 1 exploded it was hard to find any evidence of the oil , he says . `` It is rather baffling to us all . We do n't really know where it went . '' But although their message is hopeful , those who studied the Ixtoc disaster warn against assuming the gulf is automatically heading for another quick comeback . Ixtoc 1 stood in just 50 metres -LRB- 165ft -RRB- of water , while Deepwater Horizon was drilling 1,500 metres below the surface . It is also likely that the quantity of chemical dispersants being used today is significantly larger , potentially blocking the work of the oil-eating micro-organisms . But what worries Tunnell most is that over-fishing may have reduced the ability of the gulf to bounce back . `` It was much more resilient 30 years ago than today . My fear is it is reaching a tipping point . '' "}, {"uid": "160", "dct": "2010-06-02", "dates": [null, null], "text": "Gulf oil spill : Will Deepwater sink the 101-year-old BP ? Mud-smeared BP logos , boycotts , and an almost halved market value indicate deep disgust over the handling of the oil slick Wednesday 2 June 2010 17.37 BST Crosses erected this week on Grand Isle , Louisiana , flagging up the damage from the Deepwater Horizon rig spill . Photograph : Patrick Semansky\\/AP At a BP service station in downtown Manhattan , the British company 's green and yellow logo has been defaced with huge brown smears of mud . Protesters clad as oil - soaked mermaids have occupied garage forecourts , anti-BP demonstrations are taking place from Los Angeles to Florida , and a boycott BP campaign is creating a buzz on the internet . BP 's name is , quite simply , dirt . Americans are disgusted with the once proud London-based energy company . As political leaders threaten criminal prosecution and possible seizure of the company 's assets , and environmentalists bay for blood , BP 's stock is plummeting : it has fallen by a third since the Deepwater Horizon rig caught fire on 20 April , causing the worst oil slick in US history . In financial circles , questions are growing about whether BP can salvage its reputation in the US and whether the company can survive as an independent entity at all . `` Ultimately , we 've got no idea how much this accident is going to cost , '' said Dougie Youngson , an energy analyst at Arbuthnot Securities . `` People have been throwing around numbers like $ 10bn , $ 15bn , $ 20bn , but the reality is we just do n't know . They 've made five attempts to plug this leaking well and they 've all failed . '' Youngson believes there is a real possibility the Deepwater disaster could destroy BP , leading to a break-up of the 101-year-old company , which employs 80,000 people , operates 22,400 petrol stations and generated $ 239bn of revenue last year . He said : `` The longer this situation goes on , the more realistic that becomes . '' The US interior secretary , Ken Salazar , has warned that BP 's `` life is very much on the line '' . The company 's market value has dropped from $ 122bn to barely $ 80bn . John Kilduff , an energy analyst turned hedge-fund manager at Round Earth Capital , told CNBC television : `` It 's questionable whether they can continue to do business in the United States . '' Seemingly aware of its rock-bottom public image , BP this week hired Anne Womack-Kolton , once press secretary to the former vice-president Dick Cheney , to bolster its public relations effort in the US . A CBS poll found that 70 % of Americans disapprove of the way BP has handled the oil spill . And the worst has yet to come : so far relatively little oil has washed up on the US coast ; in the weeks ahead , images of stricken birdlife , clogged marshland and blackened beaches are likely to be ubiquitous . James Hoopes , a professor of business ethics at Babson College , in Massachusetts , said it was hard to imagine a worse public relations fiasco . `` This has to be one of the all-time disasters for corporate reputation . The most graceful course of action for BP would be to hang its head for a very long time and admit it has some deep issues to deal with . '' The company 's predicament is far worse than Exxon 's battering in 1989 when the Exxon Valdez tanker hit a reef off Alaska . Not only is BP a foreign company with little claim to US loyalty but it is a repeat offender : memories are raw of BP 's Texas City refinery blast in 2005 which killed 15 workers after serious safety lapses , and of the damage caused to the Alaskan wilderness in 2006 by leaking BP pipelines which , the firm admitted , had not been maintained adequately . `` Is BP dishonest , is it ill-intentioned ? '' `` I do n't think there 's any evidence to suggest those things . But the ethical lapse concerns a lack of caution and lack of responsibility in handling what is an inherently risky business . Accidents happen but there is evidence to suggest that BP is unusually accident prone . '' As of Tuesday , some 257,000 people had signed up to a Facebook page advocating a boycott of BP . Additionally , a consumer advocacy group , Public Citizen , is calling for Americans to avoid filling up at BP petrol stations for three months to punish the company . Tyson Slocum , director of the Public Citizen 's Energy Program , pointed out that BP had pleaded guilty to two environmental charges arising from its Texas City and Alaskan difficulties , before the Deepwater spill took place . With valuable , tangible , property around the world , BP is not in danger of simply evaporating like Enron , Arthur Andersen or Lehman Brothers all asset-poor business that had little left after they lost their reputations . Theoretically , the collapse in BP 's share price could make the firm cheap . Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell have been mooted as possible eventual purchasers . The Obama administration , which wants to cut US dependence on foreign oil money , would have a significant say ; it hands out exploration licences and is unlikely to be keen on Russian , Chinese or Middle Eastern control of strategically important American resources . Not everybody thinks BP is doomed . Charles Maxwell , an energy analyst at the US broker Weeden & Co , says he does not consider Deepwater Horizon fatal for BP . `` While you 're right in the melee , the battle rages harsh and hot and fierce around you , but there will come an end to it . They 'll drill a relief well and it will work , I 'm sure . '' Maxwell said reputational damage would fade since consumers barely distinguished between brands . He said that BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , who succeeded Lord Browne of Madingley as chief executive in 2007 , had not had enough time to repair the damage wreaked by his predecessor . To start regaining consumer trust , BP needs to show a more human face to America , said Dan McGinn , a communications expert at TMG Strategies , who suggested Hayward and his colleagues should `` emote '' more freely . `` Do n't make it so technical , so mechanical . Give us a sense of passion , that you feel people 's suffering . '' Corporate giants have rebounded from catastrophes before . The tyre maker Firestone , which seemed terminally tarnished in 2000 when it was accused of covering up flaws in products linked to hundreds of deadly accidents , turned around its reputation . And General Motors , which filed for bankruptcy just a year ago , is back on its feet , winning market share and praise for new models . `` What we do know is that you can suffer extraordinary damage in a short period of time but you can also recover , '' said McGinn . He added that the worst sins , in the eyes of the public , were not accidents themselves but a sense of gross incompetence , a perception of cruelty or veneer of sheer arrogance . `` If it comes across that you not only do n't understand but do n't care about the consequences of your actions , that 's unforgivable to Americans .

If we find evidence of illegal behavior , we will be extremely forceful in our response , '' Holder said . He added that `` nothing is off the table at this point '' on the range of charges prosecutors could pursue , including straightforward criminal charges if they find false statements were made .

The company is a major constituent of the FTSE , accounting for around 7 % of the entire index , meaning that each 10p change in its share price moves the FTSE 100 by nearly 9 points . Its stock market misery also spells bad news for many of Britain 's pension funds , which invest heavily in BP shares . So far the group has lost around a third of its market value some # 40bn since being thrown into turmoil after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank on 20 April , killing 11 workers . After six weeks of failures to block the well or divert the oil , BP is now using robotic machines to cut into the twisted pipes of the well . Engineers are trying to break away the broken riser pipe , and then position a cap over the well 's opening .

The failure of the `` top kill '' operation in which 30,000 barrels of mud were pumped into the well over three days means oil is likely to keep leaking until a relief well is dug and BP can pump concrete into the well shaft . This could take until the start of August , well into the hurricane season . City experts are now speculating that BP could soon find itself fending off predators . City commentator David Buik of BGC Partners pointed out that the plunge in BP 's value will have been felt in pension pots across the country , and questioned whether the company 's management will survive . `` Tony Hayward has been an excellent CEO until this disaster and would appear to have been unlucky .

'' Hayward will tell institutional investors this week that BP 's annual dividend will not be cut , according to a report in the Times , despite the rising cost of the Deepwater Horizon disaster . The BP dividend was worth $ 10bn last year , about a sixth of the overall FTSE 100 dividend payout to shareholders . The damage to BP 's market capitalization dwarfs the $ 1bn cost , to date , of the clean-up operation . These costs will continue to stack up until the oil leak is finally stopped , after which BP will face compensation claims and possible fines from the US government . Some City analysts argue that traders have over-reacted by driving BP 's share price so low . Gordon Gray and James Evan of Collins Stewart said today that BP now looks undervalued versus its peers in the oil sector , unless the final cost of the liability reaches $ 40bn . `` We can not say with any confidence that an ultimate liability of this order of magnitude is not within the realms of possibility , '' they said , in a research note titled `` Value in the shares ? It 's not possible to say with confidence . '' President Obama announced a moratorium on certain off-shore drilling projects after the Deepwater Horizon explosion . Some commentators believe oil companies may find it harder to extract oil from sites far below the surface , as every one of BP 's efforts to stop the flow of oil into the sea has failed .

Photograph : Dave Martin\\/AP BP 's woes over the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster increased today when the company 's latest attempt to contain the spill foundered as a result of a saw getting stuck in the pipe from which the oil was gushing . Remote-controlled equipment on the sea bed , a mile beneath the surface in the Gulf of Mexico , positioned a diamond-edged saw against the bottom of the damaged pipe from which up to 19,000 barrels of oil are spewing daily . Engineers were hoping to make a clean cut across the pipe to allow a custom-built cap to be put on top , to siphon the oil to tankers on the surface . But after the saw jammed , a second device had to be taken down from a nearby ship , further delaying efforts to contain the spill , which is now in its fifth week . Admiral Thad Allen , leader of the federal response to the disaster , said : `` Anybody that has ever used a saw knows every once in a while it will bind up . That 's kind of what 's happening there . '' But later a source close to the operation said the operation to free the saw had been a success and the operation was continuing . BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , said today that the oil industry might have to change the way it operated in extracting deep-water oil . He told the Financial Times : `` We have been driving safe , reliable , operations through the company within the existing industry paradigm . What this causes us to question is whether that paradigm is right for the future . '' He conceded that BP had not been fully prepared to deal with the deep-water blow-out on 20 April . `` What is undoubtedly true is that we did not have the tools you would want in your tool kit . '' BP 's survival as an independent company is now being openly discussed in the City . Its share price continued to tumble today following the failed well-capping . Analysts are wondering whether merger talks as happened between BP and its arch rival Shell in 2007 might arise again as BP 's ability to pay dividends is questioned , and its public credibility in America , which provides 40 % of its income , plummets . BP 's share price fell 3 % in early trading on top of the double-digit falls seen on Tuesday , and it has now lost a third of its value -LRB- equating to # 44bn -RRB- since the Deepwater Horizon explosion . `` If BP 's share price continues to fall , it could become a takeover target , '' said David Buik , a financial commentator at the brokerage BGC Partners in London . `` There are so many imponderables over whether its liabilities would be capped or not . '' He said Hayward 's position seemed vulnerable . Hayward 's handling of the crisis has come under scrutiny following a series of gaffes . On Wednesday , he was forced to apologise for saying : `` I want my life back '' . He said the remark had been `` hurtful and thoughtless '' especially to the families of the 11 men who died in the well explosion . To add to the oil company 's problems , the wind has shifted and is now blowing the huge oil slick towards Florida . Authorities there have been laying booms along the threatened shoreline , anticipating the arrival of oil by the end of the week . Oil slicks have already polluted barrier islands off Alabama and Mississippi , and more than 100 miles of coastline in Louisiana . Speculation about BP 's future intensified after the US attorney general , Eric Holder , announced a criminal investigation of the disaster , though he did not specify BP by name . Analysts agreed that doubts about BP 's prospects were inevitable while the crisis continued . Kim Fustier , oil analyst with Credit Suisse , in London , said the risk of a dividend cut was clearly rising since potential spill liabilities could reach $ 37bn . But Fustier was not willing to comment on whether BP was a possible takeover target . Shell , which announced a $ 4.7 bn cash purchase of the US shale gas producer East Resources last week , said it never responded to that kind of speculation . The previous chief executive of BP , Lord Browne of Madingley , revealed in a recent autobiography entitled Beyond Business that he took BP to the brink of a merger with Shell six years ago only to be thwarted at the last minute by opposition from a handful of his own board members . `` We missed the boat . We estimated that a merger could create synergies of around $ 9bn a year in three to five years ' time . '' But there were also reports that Hayward had held similar discussions in 2007 when BP 's share price had been weakened by the Texas City refinery fire , in which 15 workers died . The plunging value of BP is a blow to British pension funds as it is estimated to provide # 1 in every # 7 paid in dividends by FTSE-100 companies . BP is also a big provider of revenue to the exchequer . It said last night that it paid $ 6.3 bn in global corporate income tax , of which $ 1.1 bn -LRB- # 690m -RRB- was in the UK . BP expects to pay about $ 4bn in 2009 in production taxes globally , of which # 130m would be in Britain . Duncan Exley , of lobby organization FairPensions , cautioned investors : `` Social and corporate governance issues have a history of precipitating crises which damage our economy and our investments .

Photograph : KPA\\/Zuma\\/Rex Features Last night 's announcement that the US is launching a criminal investigation into the Gulf of Mexico disaster capped off BP 's worst day in a torrid six weeks since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank on 20 April , killing 11 workers . The firm 's shares plummeted by 13 % today , wiping # 12bn off the company 's value , as financial markets reacted to the news that oil is likely to continue spewing into the Gulf of Mexico for at least two more months . It was the worst one-day fall for 18 years for what was once Britain 's most valuable company . Political pressure is also mounting from the US , where BP 's ongoing failure to stem the leak has led for calls to Barack Obama to take a more hardline approach , and some commentators are predicting the oil giant could face an operating ban in the country . Robert Reich , the former labor secretary under Bill Clinton , today called for BP 's US operations to be seized by the government until the leak had been plugged . A group called Seize BP is planning demonstrations in 50 US cities , calling for the company to be stripped of its assets . The stock plunged 15 % , or $ 6.43 , to close at $ 36.52 at the end regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange . The criminal investigation announced by the American attorney general was launched just hours after Obama promised to prosecute any parties found to have broken the law in the lead up to the disaster . The president dropped several threatening comments into a 10-minute address from the White House to mark the start of an independent commission to look into the causes of explosion . City experts advised clients to sell shares following BP 's admission over the weekend that the much vaunted `` top kill '' attempt to bung up the well had failed . Dougie Youngson , oil analyst at Arbuthnot , said : `` This situation has now gone far beyond concerns of BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward being fired , or shareholder dividend payouts being cut it 's got the real smell of death . This could break BP . `` Given the collapse in the share price and the potential for it to fall further , we expect that it could become a takeover target . '' BP is the largest oil producer in the Gulf of Mexico , and its production growth plans for the next decade are dependent in part on finding new deepwater reserves . BP said today that its costs from the disaster had risen to $ 990m -LRB- # 675m -RRB- . Although it is impossible to quantify the full financial impact of the disaster , it seems set to run into the tens of billions of dollars , and the costs will mount as long as the leak continues . BP will attempt a riskier way of stopping the leak this week , but this could result in the amount of oil increasing and the chances of success appear slim . It hopes to plug the spill in two months , when the first of two relief wells are completed , but this operation could be hampered by the imminent hurricane season . Today Obama called the oil spill the `` greatest environmental disaster of its kind in our history '' and said `` if laws were broken leading to this death and destruction , my solemn pledge is we will bring these people to justice '' . He added that for years the relationship between the oil companies and their regulators has been `` too cosy '' and said `` we will take a comprehensive look at how the oil and gas industry operates '' . The justice department is expected to pursue a dual-track approach in its investigation of BP and the other main entities involved : Transocean and Halliburton . One track will explore whether the company broke rules in the days and months before the explosion , and the other will look at whether it contravened any environmental laws . So far the Obama administration has moved cautiously on the legal side of the oil disaster , aware of the awkwardness of issuing criminal proceedings against a company upon which the federal government continues to remain deeply dependent for the shutting off of the stricken well and the clean-up operation . But as political pressure has mounted , and Obama himself coming under fire for being insufficiently aggressive , the administration has shown renewed willingness to take on BP . The US Department of Justice will look for violations of the Clean Water Act , the Endangered Species Act , the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 . Holder said that `` nothing is off the table at this point '' with regard to the range of charges prosecutors could pursue , including traditional criminal charges if they find false statements were made . `` As our review expands , we will be meticulous , we will be comprehensive , and we will be aggressive , '' Holder told reporters . `` We will not rest until justice is done . '' However , he did acknowledge that the government 's first priority was to stop the gushing well and clean up the oil . As for BP , it has taken steps to beef up its PR operation , in an attempt to limit the damage to its reputation . The company has recruited as head of the firm 's US media relations Anne Womack-Kolton , the former press secretary to Dick Cheney .

Senators have demanded that BP suspends its dividend . Photograph : Dave Martin\\/AP BP 's under-fire chief executive Tony Hayward has admitted that the company was not adequately prepared to fight the Deepwater Horizon oil leak , as pressure mounted on the company not to pay its annual dividend to shareholders . Hayward told the Financial Times it was `` entirely fair '' to criticise BP for not being better equipped to fight a leak 5,000 feet below the surface . He said the oil giant needed to develop new techniques for such crises , rather than using decades-old methods . `` What is undoubtedly true is that we did not have the tools you would want in your toolkit , '' said Hayward in an interview with the FT. . His comments came as US politicians demanded that BP should suspend dividend payments to shareholders while it battles the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . In an open letter to Hayward who recently told the Guardian his job was on the line Democratic senators Charles Schumer and Ron Wyden said it would be wrong for BP to pay investors a dividend until it knows the full cost of the disaster . `` We find it unfathomable that BP would pay out a dividend to shareholders before the total cost of BP 's oil spill clean-up is estimated , '' they wrote . The letter was written hours after it emerged that Hayward was telling BP 's major shareholders that it planned to maintain dividend payments despite the ongoing environmental catastrophe off the coast of Louisiana . `` While we understand the need to reassure shareholders that the disaster in the Gulf will not substantially impact BP 's long term financial health , we are concerned that such action to move money off of the company 's books and into investors pockets will make it much more difficult to repay the US government and American communities that are working around the clock to stem the damage caused by this devastating oil spill , '' explained Schumer and Wyden . The two senators had previously lobbied Transocean , owner of the Deepwater Horizon rig that exploded on 20 April , against paying dividends to its own shareholders . Shares in BP rose by over 4 % this morning to 448p , indicating that traders remain confident that the the annual dividend will be paid . BP is part way through its latest attempt to cut the amount of oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico , by cutting the pipe that rises from the sea bed and placing a cap on top . This procedure hit problems yesterday when a robot-operated saw temporarily stuck , and even if it succeeds it will not capture all the oil . The company told the stock market this morning that it will pay the $ 360m -LRB- # 244m -RRB- cost of building six sand barriers to protect Louisiana 's delicate marshes . This will push BP 's total bill to date to around $ 1.4 bn , including the cost of trying to stop the leak , mopping up oil that reaches the shoreline and compensating those affected by the disaster . The final cost is unclear , though , with President Obama insisting the company was responsible for the Deepwater Horizon leak and will be made to pay for it . Although some City analysts believe BP can cover these costs , others calculate that the company may be forced to sell some assets especially if it plans to maintain its dividend . Douglas Ober , chief executive officer at Petroleum & Resources , suggested that BP 's 26 % stake in the Prudhoe Bay oil field in Alaska might have to be sold . Mining giant BHP Billiton has also named as a potential bidder for BP 's interests in the Gulf of Mexico . Other experts believe BP , whose market capitalization has fallen to around # 82bn , could be a takeover target . BP has received thousands of suggestions on how it could fight the leak , from industry experts and concerned members of the public . One , filmmaker James Cameron , was disappointed that his offer of help was not better received . Cameron has significant experience of underwater filming using remote-operated submarines , having directed Titanic . Cameron attended a meeting with scientists and government officials yesterday to brainstorm ways of reducing the damage cauuse by the massive oil spill , and also revealed last night that BP had turned down his offer of help . `` Over the last few weeks I 've watched , as we all have , with growing horror and heartache , watching what 's happening in the Gulf and thinking those morons do n't know what they 're doing , '' Cameron told the All Things Digital technology conference in California , according to Reuters , who added it was not explicitely clear who `` those morons '' referred to . Public anger against BP is growing in America as the crisis enters its seventh week . BP garage signs have been smeared with mud , and a Boycott BP campaign appears to be gathering pace .

Photograph : Suzanne Plunkett\\/Reuters Tony Hayward , BP 's embattled chief executive , will risk incurring further wrath in the US over the Gulf oil spill tomorrow by defying calls from politicians to halt more than $ 10bn -LRB- # 6.8 bn -RRB- worth of payouts due to shareholders this year . He will hope to appease City investors by promising in a conference call with analysts to stick with BP 's dividend policy amid mounting concern about a plunging share price . BP declined to comment on its strategy tonight but it is understood that Hayward will say he is confident the company can pay for liabilities resulting from the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion now estimated by analysts at $ 20bn to $ 60bn as well as rewarding investors . The move follows demands from senators Charles Schumer and Ron Wyden in a letter to Hayward all dividends be halted until the cost of the clean-up is known . Analysts warned that committing to the dividend risked further political opprobrium in the US , with Alex Stewart from Evolution Securities fearing it could force Hayward to make a U-turn next month . BP reports its results on 27 July , when it will announce the size of its next quarterly payout , but it is expected to spend more than $ 10bn in total dividends this year . `` The problem they have is that the oil is likely to be still flowing by the time they announce results , '' said Stewart . `` It 's not going to look good paying about $ 3bn in -LRB- quarterly -RRB- dividends to shareholders if at the same time local fishermen are having their livelihoods destroyed in the Gulf . '' However , BP 's dividend is of crucial importance to the City and to the pensions of millions who depend on payouts from profitable companies to boost their retirement funds . Together with rival Shell , BP accounted for 25 % of the total dividends of # 50bn paid in the UK market last year . Any cut in the dividend could result in investors selling BP shares , further weakening the company , which has lost nearly 30 % of its value since the disaster began . Crude oil has been leaking from a well at the bottom of the sea since 20 April and BP has been unable to stem the flow despite various attempts to halt it , including the `` top kill '' method of pumping mud and debris into the hole . Hayward 's handling of the crisis has been called into question , and he chose Facebook to apologise for his latest gaffe : saying he wanted his life back . His position has become more troubled since he said in an interview with the FT today that it was `` entirely fair criticism '' that BP was not fully prepared for the oil leak . Analysts were today openly questioning the future of Hayward as chief executive , and whether his company could be taken over and broken up . Bookmaker Paddy Power is now offering even odds that Hayward will be forced to leave his post by the end of this year , meaning two successive chief executives would have left earlier than originally intended . Hayward 's predecessor John Browne departed following the Texas City fire which claimed 15 lives .

President Obama must act before history repeats itself yet again A beach is closed on Grand Isle , Louisiana , due to the oil spill . Photograph : Win McNamee\\/Getty BP 's out-of-control geyser in the Gulf is now the biggest oil spill in US history . Though the Exxon Valdez was a comparatively finite disaster with the tanker carrying 54m gallons of crude oil the Deepwater Horizon debacle continues to spew oil like a vindictive beast lodged in the bottom of the sea . While this catastrophe may seem like a singular event , its unfolding parallels the political path carved by the Exxon Valdez oil spill with uncanny similarity . It turns out we 're actors in an eerily familiar play . The script was written in 1989 when the Exxon Valdez rammed the rocky reefs , piercing a hole in its hull and disgorging 11m gallons of oil into Alaskan waters . A careful examination of the Exxon Valdez aftermath reveals a recognisable pattern . Big Oil 's initial response is to downplay the ecological damage until contradicted by firsthand reports of environmental horror . The oil company then vows to do whatever it takes to control the spill , with public-relations officials promising to pay for the clean-up costs and all `` legitimate '' claims . The firm deploys the environmentally dodgy dispersant Corexit and locals voice concern over its toxicity . Groups across the political spectrum express frustration over the lack of a clean-up plan and criticise the president for not asserting leadership . The blame game heats up , fuelled by cosy relationships between government and industry . A key difference is that in the case of the Exxon Valdez a supposedly sloshed sea captain made for a convenient cookie-cutter villain who we could blame although he was later found not guilty of drunkenly driving the tanker . The denouement in Alaska featured `` human error '' as the culprit , with Exxon dragging out litigation for nearly two decades . In 2008 , with an assist from the US supreme court , Exxon finally settled with claimants for a fraction of the original jury award . With the BP calamity , there 's no handy hoodlum who we can blame for the fiasco . Because we have no such go-to target this time , we actually have an opportunity to reconsider the whole Big Oil shebang . Clearly it 's the system that 's at fault . Not that BP has n't acted reprehensibly . BP now means Beyond Pinocchio . It 's not so much that BP is lying as it 's consistently not telling us the whole truth . For instance , the oil company initially alleged that 1,000 barrels a day were flowing from the ruptured well , before upping the estimate to 5,000 barrels . Now we know it 's more like five times that amount , with numerous scientists estimating much higher flow rates after watching video footage of the gusher , footage BP long suppressed using flimsy reasoning . Democratic congressman Ed Markey , chairman of a House energy committee investigating the oil spill , said BP were '' either lying or they were incompetent '' . But if BP has demonstrated incompetence , it has also shown penny-pinching stinginess . Dating back nearly a year , internal BP records documented safety problems involving the very blowout preventer and well casing that were pivotal in the oil rig explosion . Partly to save money , BP opted for the `` best economic case '' , choosing an oil well casing that was riskier . In other words , plump profit margins trumped public safety . Now BP executives are impersonating global-warming sceptics , denying the presence of underwater oil plumes that academic scientists are viewing with their own eyes . Forget peak oil this is about peak profit . President Obama clearly needs a jumpstart . Here 's a five-step plan that will help us learn from history rather than mindlessly replicate it . Take over the show . Two weeks after the Exxon Valdez spill President Bush Sr put the federal government in charge . Obama needs to do the same , sparing no expense and funneling all bills directly to BP . A recent poll found a whopping 73 % believes BP is doing a `` poor '' or `` very poor '' job responding to the crisis . Critics may say the US government could n't do better than BP , but surely it could n't do any worse . Create an independent working group to cap the spill and mitigate its repercussions . Obama needs to immediately gather the best and brightest scholars , scientists , and practitioners to engage this national-security emergency . People with ties to the oil industry need not apply . He should form a new-wave brain trust , like John F Kennedy 's response to the Cuban Missile Crisis , only this working group should toil transparently , offering daily public briefings on its progress . Craft an expedited system for processing claims . This catastrophe is already causing a landslide of litigation . BP says they 'll pay for all `` legitimate '' claims but so did Exxon before its phalanx of lawyers stretched the reparation process into 2008 . The administration should also provide legal services for people along the Gulf coast so they do n't get hoodwinked into taking short-term payouts while forfeiting the possibility of heftier compensation down the road . Revamp the all-too-cosy relationship between the oil industry and the government 's Mineral Management Service . Back in 2009 BP assured the MMS that because of its superior `` proven equipment and technology '' any oil spill would be contained before harming fish habitats and apparently MMS officials believed the implausible claim . MMS has never canceled an oil lease sale based on its own environmental risk assessment . New oversight systems are needed immediately so other massive oil platforms in the Gulf such as BP 's Atlantis , which some allege was set up without complete engineering documents do n't suffer a similar fate . Put forth a real-deal plan for a clean-energy economy . President Obama himself said the BP tragedy `` underscores the urgent need to develop clean , renewable sources of energy '' . There 's a word for spouting virtuous environmental rhetoric that 's disconnected from on-the-ground follow-through , and that word is greenwashing -LRB- like , say , calling your company `` Beyond Petroleum '' -RRB- . If Obama actually wants to create a clean energy economy , then an obvious first step would be to get rid of subsidies for Big Oil and swerve them toward solar and wind projects that could actually use a boost . That 's what subsidies are for to help fledgling industries , not line the pockets of companies turning record profits . Obama need not fritter away this opportunity to rethink the entire energy system instead of simply tinkering with it . We need a sea change , if you will , and it 's hard to imagine a better opportunity than this crisis .

Photograph : Larry Downing\\/Reuters BP has managed to place a cap on the shattered end of the deepwater wellhead in the Gulf of Mexico but it will be several hours until engineers will know how successful this latest attempt to halt the worst oil spill in US history has been . The oil giant is hoping for some good news as president Barack Obama is due in the region later today on his third visit since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded , having postponed his scheduled trip to Australia and Indonesia for the second time in as many months . News that BP engineers have successfully manoeuvred a cap into position comes as the oil giant 's embattled chief executive Tony Hayward prepares to update investors on the potential financial impact of the disaster this afternoon . He is expected to ignore calls from Washington to put the firm 's payments to shareholders on hold while the full cost of the oil spill is calculated and pledge to retain the company 's dividends payments , worth more than $ 10bn -LRB- # 6.8 bn -RRB- . Senators Charles Schumer and Ron Wyden sent a letter to Hayward earlier this week demanding that payments to investors be halted during the clean-up . The White House has already sent a preliminary bill for $ 69m to BP and `` other responsible parties '' but that is likely to be a very small fraction of the final cost . Overnight the US coastguard gave an update on moves to stem the flow of oil into the sea . `` The placement of the containment cap is another positive development in BP 's most recent attempt to contain the leak , however , it will be some time before we can confirm that this method will work and to what extent it will mitigate the release of oil into the environment , '' said Admiral Thad Allen . `` Even if successful , this is only a temporary and partial fix and we must continue our aggressive response operations at the source , on the surface and along the Gulf 's precious coastline . '' The placement of the cap follows work on Thursday which saw BP 's robot submarines cut away the well pipe after two days of trying . BP hopes to be able to use the cap to siphon off some of the escaping oil and pump it into collection ships on the surface 1.6 km above the shattered well . Oil experts have warned , though , that the cap will not be able to capture all the oil gushing from the shattered well . Hayward said that the next 12 to 24 hours will determine whether the capping operation will succeed . `` It 's an important milestone , '' he said at a briefing in Houston overnight . `` This is simply the beginning . '' Speaking to US TV networks today , chief operating officer Doug Suttles said he hoped that the cap could capture at least 90 % of the oil . But BP does not expect to completely halt the escape of 19,000 barrels of oil a day until August , when it hopes to have completed two relief wells . Shares in BP rose as much as 4 % today to 450p , making it the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 . Obama telephoned Australia 's prime minister Kevin Rudd and Indonesia 's president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to express his `` deep regret '' over the cancellation of his trip , during which he would have addressed a joint sitting of the Australian parliament .

By `` commander of the federal response to the disaster '' , I mean the coast guard admiral Thad Allen . But his commander , of course , is Barack Obama . And from his perspective , the underwater well is n't the only thing leaking . His poll numbers are , daily . The reason can be summed up in one word , a word that describes a quality we have n't seen nearly enough of in recent presidents , and a quality that more voters are starting to worry Obama lacks . Back in 1988 , the Democrat Michael Dukakis ran for president against George HW Bush by saying that the election was `` about competence , not ideology '' . As campaign slogans go , it lacked a certain poetry , and besides , it did n't do him much good : a -RRB- the liberal base was put off because everyone knew that Dukakis was speaking in code and trying to tell average Americans that he was n't some acid-flinging leftie ; and b -RRB- he lost . Competence as a theme went into storage . We went through two presidencies , one more-or-less incompetent -LRB- Bush Sr 's -RRB- and one more-or-less competent -LRB- Bill Clinton 's -RRB- . Then came George W Bush , whose reverse-Midas touch made a mess of virtually everything , from Iraq to Katrina and culminated in the worst financial meltdown in eight decades . Twenty years after Dukakis , competence was looking pretty desirable . In those heady days of November 2008 , many US liberals convinced themselves Obama 's election meant average Americans were ready for a turn to the left . As I suspected then , and as time has confirmed , this was n't so . The independent , middle-of-the-road voters who chose Obama over John McCain were n't crying : `` Give us liberalism . '' They were pleading : `` Give us competence . '' The verdict so far ? As Obama 's poll numbers suggest , not terrible , but not so hot . The administration 's biggest accomplishment , the passage of the health bill , was seen by all but liberals as the Democrats choosing ideology over competence , and thus was n't and is n't very popular . On the plus side , the economy is picking up , the employment figures are improving , and there are signs that consumers are aware . There has been progress , however unspectacular , in Afghanistan and Iraq . And while the administration has not yet produced any diplomatic breakthroughs of note , neither has it precipitated any major crisis . The record has been good enough barely so that continued economic improvement and a diplomatic accomplishment or two will show voters that the guy is doing what they elected him to do . But this oil spill , especially if it lingers until August , could change everything . This is not the moral equivalent of the Katrina catastrophe in which , let us recall , some 1,500 Americans died . Most Americans seem to grasp this . However , people are desperate for action as more and more of the Gulf coastline comes under threat . And since surely no more than 2 % of them even know who Tony Hayward BP 's chief executive is , they quite understandably turn to the guy they do know : the president . Much discussed in recent days here in Washington is Obama 's inability to `` connect '' with the frustrations and concerns of Joe Sixpack . It 's a valid criticism . Obama appears to see himself as a mediator and conciliator , who vacuums up all -LRB- non-crazy -RRB- viewpoints and tries to express a consensus . This is a valuable skill , and at his best moments , he 's put it to use either publicly or behind the scenes to nudge public opinion or get legislation passed . It 's a style of leadership that has its place . The spill requires a different style of leadership . It requires a leader who can give voice to what regular people are feeling in their bones . Obama has little instinct for that . `` let 's keep our heads here '' . There are times , though , when outrage is needed . But even more than executive outrage , what we really need here is a solution of some kind . If BP 's new attempt to cap the leak does n't work , and if oil starts washing up on beaches and properties in a dramatic way that is , if this disaster takes on a more urgent , more human dimension then it really could become Obama 's Katrina . Especially , let 's face it , if the ooze and the calamity spread to the electorally pivotal state of Florida , which is just on the precipice of happening . People are also looking for BP to be punished . Late this week , demonstrations began emerging outside BP petrol station-convenience stores across the country . But Washington has to do more . Congress is considering a bill raising BP 's liability cap from the current $ 75m -LRB- # 51m -RRB- to $ 10bn , but it 's debating and dithering as usual . Earlier this week the US attorney general , Eric Holder , surveyed the damage , met with state law-enforcement types in the region and launched a criminal investigation aimed at BP . This marks a much tougher posture from the government , which , for public relations purposes , is much needed . And yet , at the same time , the government still needs to work closely with BP on fixing the problem . Ratcheting up the rhetoric and launching a federal investigation in that context are delicate matters , though not impossible ones . Anyone who does n't hate him has to feel a little badly for Obama . First , he got smacked with the financial crisis , leaving him to spend his first two years in office -LRB- if not more -RRB- cleaning up somebody else 's mess . Then this , a uniquely perverse situation so lacking in precedent that there does n't even exist a federal agency designed to deal with it . But hey he ran for the job , and he asked for it . He can still be the kind of transformative president he wants to be . But first things first . Gain voters ' trust . There 's an old American saying in urban politics that there 's not a Democratic or Republican way to pick up the garbage . Nor to clean up an oil spill . Just get it done .

Eventually , this would add to the acidification of the oceans and contribute to global warming , which itself is likely to trigger more hurricanes of a greater intensity . Both of these outcomes would be particularly detrimental to the area in question . The greater tragedy is that through our great oil companies we seem to be intent on extracting every last drop of this wretched fossil fuel before adapting our economy along truly sustainable lines . Perhaps spreading this particular batch of oil out for micro-orgnisms to deal with is the least damaging option . cents In arguing there can be no undersea oil clouds associated with the spill because `` oil has a specific gravity that 's about half that of water . It wants to get to the surface '' -LRB- BP clashes with scientists , 1 June -RRB- , Tony Hayward , BP 's chief executive , displays an alarming ignorance of the properties of his product . True , seawater has a specific gravity of about 1.03 g\\/cubic cm whereas that of crude oil is about 0.8 g\\/cubic cm -LRB- less than but not half that of water -RRB- . But significant fractions of crude oil consist of asphaltenes and other complex substances with specific gravities around 1.4 g\\/cubic cm , ie greater than seawater . These heavier fractions will almost certainly separate and so be retained at depth . cents The BP spill has become an embarrassment , possibly damaging the British business community as a whole . I 'm outraged that BP claims to be doing all it can , when , as a specialist company in natural cotton absorbents that not only absorb spillages of hydrocarbon , but also allow in-situ bioremediation when contamination reaches the shores , I know they are not . We approached BP four years ago . Our efforts and any attempts to follow up proved to be a waste of time , as we encountered only arrogance and lip service . We believe that BP is using polypropylene booms in the Gulf : polypropylene is an oil derivative . There are miles of cellulose booms available : why is BP ignoring the more natural approach ?

Photograph : Larry Downing\\/Reuters BP is to hive off its Gulf of Mexico oil spill operation to a separate in-house business to be run by an American in a bid to isolate the `` toxic '' side of the company and dilute some of the anti-British feeling aimed at chief executive Tony Hayward , the company said today . The surprise announcement was made during a teleconference with City and Wall Street analysts in which Hayward attempted to shrug off the personal criticism saying words `` could not break his bones '' . BP has faced mounting anger in the US over the accident on 20 April when the Deepwater Horizon rig blew up and sank with the loss of 11 oil workers ' lives . The Macondo well continues to spew out oil although a containment cap was placed on top of the leak today . Hayward said it would take a further 48 hours to know whether it was successful . Responsibility for the leaking well and the clean-up strategy will placed in the hands of Bob Dudley , one of the company 's most able directors . Dudley , a US citizen , has been looking for a suitable role in the company since he was thrown out of Moscow in a battle with the Russian shareholders of the TNK-BP joint venture in the middle of 2008 . Hayward said the clean-up business would be run separately by Dudley with his own staff but the finances and budget would come from the main BP group . The BP chief executive said the purpose of the split was to allow Dudley to concentrate on the Gulf problem while he and other directors were not distracted from keeping the main business on track . Hayward stressed , however , that his priority was sorting out all the wider fallout from the rig disaster and he apologised repeatedly for the loss of lives and ongoing damage to the beaches of the southern United States . `` Everyone at BP is heartbroken by this event , by the loss of life and by the damage to the environment and to the livelihoods of the people of the Gulf coast , '' he said . `` It should not have happened and we are bound and determined to learn every lesson to try and ensure it never happens again . We will stand by our obligations . `` We will halt this spill and put right the damage that has been done . We will rebuild the confidence of the American people and the world in BP . '' The spill has brought verbal attacks on BP from everyone up to Barack Obama , who said yesterday during his third trip to the gulf region : `` What I do n't want to hear is , when they 're spending that kind of money on their shareholders and spending that kind of money on TV advertising , that they 're nickeling and diming fishermen or small businesses here in the gulf who are having a hard time . '' In the face of such criticism , Hayward insisted that he had a `` thick jacket '' , adding : `` They 've thrown some words at me , but I 'm a Brit . Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me . '' He denied there was tension between him and BP 's new Swedish chairman , Carl-Henric Svanberg , saying both he and the wider board had been extremely supportive . Svanberg has been accused of keeping himself out of the line of fire but has denied that , saying it was important for the purpose of a clear message that one person took the main role in explaining actions of the company . Svanberg also ignored demands from two US senators that the company should halt the payments of any dividends to shareholders until the extent of its clean-up liabilities were known . The chairman said no decision would be taken on future dividends until they had to , but stressed his belief that the company was in good financial shape , indicating it could do both . He said : `` We fully understand the importance of our dividend to our shareholders . `` Future decisions on the quarterly dividend will be made by the board , as they always have been , on the basis of the circumstances at the time . '' `` This was not our accident This was Transocean 's rig . 4 May `` The Gulf of Mexico is a big ocean . The amount of oil and dispersant we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume . '' 14 May `` No one wants this over more than I do . I would like my life back .

Photograph : Jae C. Hong\\/AP 1.53 pm : Afternoon all , and welcome to our live coverage of the latest development in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill - BP 's conference call with its biggest investors . Chief executive Tony Hayward will be joined with Fergus MacLeod , head of investor relations . We 're expecting BP to confirm whether or not it will be paying a dividend to shareholders , defying opposition from US politicians . We should also hear the very latest information about BP 's efforts to limit the damage and stop the leak . 2.01 pm : A quick recap before we get going : Overnight BP managed to fit a cap , or container , onto the riser pipe that is leaking oil on the seabed . We do n't know how successful this operation has been yet - BP 's COO was talking about it eventually capturing 90 % of the leak . However , the live feed from the seabed still shows oil gushing into the ocean . 2.03 pm : And we 're off -- and Carl-Henric Svanberg , BP 's chairman , is also on the call -LRB- he 's been criticised for not taking a more public profile since the Deepware Horizon rig blew up -RRB- . Svanberg starts by telling shareholders that he is `` keenly aware of the gravity '' of the disaster in which 11 people died . `` We deeply regret , and are sorry , for this tragic accident and the aftermath , '' he says . 2.05 pm : Svanberg explains that oil production is an inherently risky business , and people trusted BP to get it right . `` We must regain that trust , '' he says , and pledges that BP will be a `` good citizen '' in every territory where it operates . The BP chairman also talks about ensuring BP 's long-term presence in the business world . He also touches on the issue of the dividend - `` We know how important it is to shareholders . '' 2.09 pm : After promising to `` meet obligations to shareholders '' who rely on its dividend , Svanberg hands over to Tony Hayward . Both men are taking a very sombre tone . `` Everyone at BP is heartbroken by the event , '' says Hayward . `` It should not have happened - we are bound and determined to learn lessons to ensure it never happens again . '' Hayward is now running through the events of the last seven weeks - saying BP has organised an `` armada '' of vessels , and 60,000 staff and contractors , to try and control the spill -LRB- this was n't enough to keep the oil off the beaches , of course -RRB- . He touches on today 's capping operation - he says it will capture `` the majority '' of the oil . Apparently it will be refined in mid-June , and BP hopes to set up a better system by early July that will make it `` more robust in the event of hurricanes . '' BP 's embattled CEO also promises to be transparent with the US government , and insists that the leak will eventually be stopped . `` Ultimately , doing the right thing will prevail . '' 2.12 pm : It 's too early to say where the fault lies - a lot remains unknown , says Hayward . He explains that BP has drawn up a four-point plan : 1 -RRB- It will be `` transparent with the US government and the US people '' in what it does and says 2 -RRB- It will meet responsibilities to those who have suffered economic harm 3 -RRB- It will make good `` in full '' the environmental impact of the disaster 4 -RRB- It will invest in creating a safe Gulf of Mexico oil industry . This photo gallery gives a grim reminder of that environmental impact . 2.17 pm : So what 's the long term solution ? Hayward says the oil industry needs a `` paradigm shift '' . `` We need better safety technology . For example , the Blow Out Preventor , which this incident has shown is not failsafe . '' 2.18 pm : Some analysts have argued that the crisis may force BP to be broken up - Hayward is trying to calm these fears . He confirms that BP has now spent more than $ 1bn on the clean-up , and warns that the eventual damages claims will be `` sizeable '' . Hayward also announces that BP are going to spin off the Gulf of Mexico situation into a new division -LRB- called Bad BP , perhaps -RRB- . It will be run by Bob Dudley , a well-respected BP executive who used to manage its Russian arm -LRB- until he fell foul of the Kremlin -RRB- . '' I do n't believe we could have a better person to lead this organization , '' says Hayward . `` This will remain my number 1 priority for as long as necessary '' `` I wish to apologise both personally , and on behalf of the whole of BP for what has happened . '' 2.25 pm : Over to questions from analysts -LRB- as this is a financial call , journalists do n't get to take part , alas -RRB- . An ING analyst goes first , and congratulates Hayward on his leadership during the crisis -LRB- not sure you 'd hear that on a press call -RRB- . He wants to know more details on the total cost of the crisis . Tony Hayward has apologised today for the catastrophic Deepwater Horizon oil leak , and vowed to help make the industry safer . Photograph : Gerald Herbert\\/AP Hayward says it 's simply not possible to say , but hands the question over to Byron Grote , BP 's chief financial officer . He explains that BP is going to break out the Deepwater Horizon costs as a separate item on its financial results , so we 'll be able to see how much it is costing . 2.28 pm : Morgan Stanley wants more information about the dividend -LRB- which makes up about a seventh of the overall dividend payment from FTSE 100 countries -RRB- . Hayward refers to Svanberg , who declines to give a firm answer on this issue . `` Our first responsibility is to fix this disaster ... but we need to strike a balance with our obligations to shareholders , '' he says . Is that a hint that the dividend is going to be cut ? 2.32 pm : Now Bank of America\\/Merrill Lynch , who wants more details about the `` paradigm shift '' on safety that BP admitted is needed . Hayward explains that today , the odds of a Blow Out Preventor failing is somewhere between one in 100,000 and one in 1,000,000 , and that needs to be made even less likely . 2.35 pm : My colleague Terry Macalister is following the call too . Here 's his early thoughts : The chairman is on the call ... wow ... responding to criticism of his absence ? Hayward is stressing multiple `` technological '' failures ... but not mentioning human failures that others have pointed out . 2.39 pm : Barclays Capital wants to know what assessment BP has made on the Clean Water Act , the US legislation that covers water pollution ? `` Clearly we will be liable to fines under the Clean Water Act . That 's a certainty , '' admits Hayward . He does not like to speculate on how big a fine it might be . Under the Act , any fine would be much larger if BP were found guilty of gross negligence . One expert recently estimated BP could be hit by a $ 60bn fine , although that is a very worst-case scenario . 2.43 pm : More from Terry Macalister : While BP chairman says the dividend will remain under review there is lots of stressing from Tony Hayward about the financial buoyancy of the company ... ... Tony Hayward sounds calm and lucid - but tired and forgot one of the analyst 's questions . Setting up a new organization set up to look after spill is a good idea ! Tony Hayward can keep the main business on track while Bob Dudley -LRB- ex-boss of TNK-BP -RRB- is an American citizen which should play better in US . Dudley was effectively kicked out of Russia but dealt very well with a highly charged political situation in Moscow . Right man for the job and good counter to Hayward whose `` Britishness '' seems to have been counting against him . 2.45 pm : Investors are asking for more details about exactly what went wrong on the Deepwater Horizon before it exploded on 20 April , but Hayward is n't biting . This must wait for the official investigation , he says . He does defend BP 's action , though , insisting that all procedures carried out on the rig had been approved by safety authorities first . 2.53 pm : Now the call moves onto the threat caused by the hurricane season . Wo n't a large storm make it impossible for BP to keep collecting oil -LRB- assuming that this week 's capping work is a success -RRB- . Hayward touched on this point earlier -LRB- 2.09 pm -RRB- , and now fleshes out BP 's plans . The key , apparently , is that BP has developed a new and better way of collecting the oil that will be corralled by the container system and then transported to the surface in a pipe . This new system , which will be working by mid July , is much more hurricane resistant . It is based on a `` submersible riser '' which will offer `` very rapid connect and disconnect capabilities '' . In other words , if the oil tanker collecting the oil is driven back to port by a hurricane , it will then be much quicker for it to reconnect once the weather is calmer . Hayward says reconnecting could happen in `` perhaps 24 hours '' , down from around 10 days . Those numbers also indicate that an early hurricane could scupper BP 's efforts to collect oil , if it arrives before this system is working . 2.57 pm : Now a US-based analyst wants to know BP 's views on senators Charles Schumer and Ron Wyden , who called on BP to suspend dividend payments . Good question , says Hayward -LRB- who is sounding a bit cheerier than at the start -RRB- and one for my boss . BP chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg simply says that he needs to understand the senators ' concerns better . He 's got until late July , when BP 's next financial results are due . 3.00 pm : It 's hard for those of us in London to understand how much much fury there is in America to BP right now . For a flavor , my colleague Matthew Weaver recommends this video , in which Andrew Revkin from Pace university and David Roberts discuss the prospects of the US government forcing BP into temporary receivership or even nationalisation . The clip has just been uploaded but it was recorded on 1 June so it 's bit out of date , but it gives you an idea of the increasing anger at BP in the US . 3.06 pm : Final question for Tony Hayward , and it touches on the issue of his popularity -LRB- or otherwise -RRB- . Hayward acknowledges that he has been the public face of BP during the crisis , which he claims has helped his colleagues get on with the job of fixing the leak . `` So far I 'm unscathed ... no-one has physically harmed me . '' `` They 've thrown some words at me , but I 'm a Brit . Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me , or however the saying goes . '' And with that , the call 's over . 3.10 pm : So a quick summary . cents We 've heard apologies from BP 's two top men for the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico , cents BP remains confident that the cap fitted overnight may work well , and collect a lot of the oil that has been spilling into the sea cents There is no official decision on dividend payments yet cents The oil giant is splitting off its clean-up operations into a new division , run by Bob Dudley . cents It has also built a better way of collecting oil from the striken well , to help it cope with hurricanes cents It is braced to be fined by the US authorities , but still can not say how much this disaster will cost Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : This article was published on guardian .

Photograph : Tannen Maury\\/EPA Engineers trying to contain the oil spill from the stricken BP Deepwater Horizon well in the Gulf of Mexico have expressed optimism over the `` containment cap '' placed over the broken well , although it remains uncertain just how effective the method will be in capturing all of the oil . Latest estimates released today suggest that about 10,000 barrels of oil a day are being caught in the device that was placed over the leaking pipe using remotely operated equipment . The oil is being collected in the funnel-like cap and then ushered up to the surface , where it is collected in a tanker called the Discoverer Enterprise sitting above the wellhead . In a familiar pattern in the crisis , now in its 48th day , a notably more upbeat impression of the containment operation was given by BP than by the US government . BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward told the BBC that , once the production flow was up to full speed , he would expect the proportion captured `` to be the majority , probably the vast majority of the oil '' . But Thad Allen , the US coastguard admiral who is co-ordinating the response of government agencies in the Gulf , gave a much more cautious assessment . He told Face the Nation on CBS : `` I 'm hoping we catch as much oil as we can , but I 'm withholding any comment until production is at a full rate . '' Behind Allen 's caution lies fears that the procedure could come a cropper as it did when a containment cap was first attempted over the leaking well : this was the result of icy hydrates forming from the mixing of oil and water , a process that clogs up the cap . To prevent that happening again , methanol is being pumped into the cap in an attempt to stop the formation of the slush , while the pressure of the oil is slowly being increased through the use of vents on the side of the cap . The final success of the process will not be known until all the vents are closed . The current rate of extraction of 10,000 barrels a day compares with the US government 's worst-case scenario which estimates that up to 25,000 barrels a day of oil could be spewing from the well . Even if the cap proves to be largely successful in siphoning off the outpouring oil , Allen stressed that the damage of the oil that has already escaped would be long term . He said the spill was not monolithic , but was in fact hundreds of thousands of smaller spills spreading across a 200-mile radius . `` We are in the middle of a long-term campaign , '' he said . `` We are fighting on three fronts : the sub-sea , the surface area above the well where the oil is coming up , and when it gets to shore we are fighting the battle there . '' Two relief wells are being drilled down into the well to `` bottom kill '' it that is , to intercept the oil beneath the ocean bed and stop it rising up by blocking it with heavy mud . The first relief well has now reached 7,000 ft beneath the sea bed and the other 3,000 ft beneath it , but neither is expected to intercept the well board until August at the earliest . The multiple efforts under way to drill the relief wells , spread dispersants below and on the sea surface and operate the containment cap is reflected in a hive of activity around the Deepwater Horizon site . According to Allen , up to 20 vessels are deployed at any one time in a one-mile radius of the wrecked well . As oil continues to come ashore on beaches in Alabama and the Panhandle of Florida , clean-up operations are being stepped up . More than 400 fishing vessels are laying container booms and skimming oil from the surface off Alabama . Unemployed people are being used in Alabama , Mississippi and Florida in the clean-up operation in a new scheme launched on Saturday . Some 400 jobless individuals were put to work over the weekend . The aim is to train up to 4,500 workers across the three states . In his BBC interview , Hayward admitted that safety standards in deep-sea drilling were not up to scratch . The BP chief executive said : `` It 's clearly unacceptable that it 's occurred , so what has to happen on the part of the industry and certainly BP is to move safety standards to a completely different level .

But far from shifting into a brave new world of clean renewable energy , the company has continued to pursue oil and gas in ever more difficult and dangerous locations . Enlightened investors have long argued that this is a high-risk strategy and so it has proved . The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has wiped more than # 40bn off the company 's value and it is under attack from President Obama for its plans to pay a dividend . Humourists in the City say the initials should now stand for Battered Pensions . This spill should not have been completely unexpected ; it was all too conceivable . So was the explosion at the company 's Texas City refinery in March 2005 and the Prudhoe Bay leak in Alaska the following year . As Richard Ward , chief executive of Lloyd 's of London , pointed out , we now have to ask ourselves whether the environmental and economic costs of our continued reliance on oil are proving too great . Some of our politicians have argued that green technology offers a way of reinventing the UK economy so that it is no longer so dependent on financial services or , for that matter , mega-corporations such as BP . Businesses , including BP , have the financial firepower to lead the green energy agenda and at the same time secure their own long-term economic gain . So far , the signs are not good . The current chief executive , Tony Hayward , shut down the group 's alternative energy HQ last year and imposed swingeing budget cuts . He has also taken the company into controversial tar sands projects , despite a protest vote from shareholders .

The company , and its chief executive Tony Hayward , have been much criticised over its response to the spill . Photograph : Dave Martin\\/AP The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has now cost BP $ 1.25 bn -LRB- # 870m -RRB- , as its much-criticised chief executive vows to spend `` what it takes '' to fix the Deepwater Horizon disaster that has caused growing anger across America . The energy company continues to spend tens of millions of dollars a day trying to stop the leak , mopping up oil on the surface , and compensating some of the people affected by the spill . It has also been instructed by the US coastguard to pay the $ 360m cost of building six sand booms off Louisiana to divert oil from the coastline , taking its committed spending over the $ 1.6 bn mark . BP continues to insist that it can fix America 's worst ever environmental disaster . Tony Hayward , BP 's embattled chief executive , tweeted on Twitter this morning that `` Our top priority is the Gulf . I will not be diverted away from that . We will spend what it takes to make it right . '' Hayward , who was dubbed `` the most hated and most clueless man in America '' last week , is handing responsibility for running the clean-up operation to its American director , Bob Dudley . This may assuage some of the fury vented at the British company , which faces calls for its US assets to be seized . Official estimates put the leak anywhere between 12,000 and 25,000 barrels of oil a day , and it is not clear how successful the containment cap will be . BP has said it collected around 10,000 barrels on Sunday and hopes to eventually capture most of the leak , but the US coastguard is being much more cautious . `` I 'm hoping we catch as much oil as we can , but I 'm withholding any comment until production is at a full rate , '' said Thad Allen , the US coastguard admiral . Oil from the stricken wellhead has now reached the beaches of Alabama and Florida , widening the environmental damage caused by the spill , despite 2.2 m ft -LRB- 6.7 km -RRB- of containment boom being deployed . There are also 2,600 boats involved in the response effort . BP said it has paid compensation totalling $ 48m to 18,000 individuals out of a total of 37,000 compensation claims . President Barack Obama , who has also been criticised for his approach to the catastrophe , said yesterday it was `` brutally unfair '' that ordinary fishermen and shopkeepers were seeing their businesses damaged by the spill . `` If laws were broken , those responsible will be brought to justice , '' Obama said yesterday . `` We will make sure they pay every single dime owed to the people along the Gulf coast . '' The City continues to be reassured by BP 's efforts , and its refusal so far to cut its dividend . The company 's shares were the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 this morning , up as much as 11p or 2.7 % at 444p . Later today a congressional committee will gather in Louisiana to hold a session into the local impact of the disaster . The Committee on Energy and Commerce will hear from Natalie Roshto and Courtney Kemp , whose husbands were killed when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on 20 April , along with representatives from businesses and the Institute of Marine Mammal Services .

Photograph : Lee Celano\\/Reuters The White House has warned BP it faces `` many billions of dollars '' in fines for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster , easily dwarfing the clean-up cost , which has already topped the billion dollar mark . The steady escalation in costs for BP was seen as further evidence yesterday that the gusher in the Gulf of Mexico continues to exceed the administration 's and BP 's worst-case scenarios for an oil spill . `` We are adapting to an enemy that changes , '' Thad Allen , the coast guard commander overseeing the response told a White House briefing . `` We are no longer dealing with a monolithic spill . '' The break-up of the slick into a massive collection of smaller spills was challenging efforts to keep the oil offshore , and crude was now attacking the shoreline from Louisiana to Florida . `` I do n't think any plan envisioned it would get out that far and disaggregate , '' Allen said . `` If anything is taxing our resources , it 's the breadth . '' BP confronted a parallel escalation yesterday . Since the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig on 20 April , the oil giant has been forced to pay out an increasing sum for clean-up costs and compensation to those put out of work or business because of the spill . As of yesterday the spill had cost BP $ 1.25 bn -LRB- # 870m -RRB- . But the White House , in moves to deflect public anger said BP could expect a final bill for much more . `` There will be penalties in the many billions of dollars , '' said Robert Gibbs , the White House spokesman . He said the final tab for those penalties would be determined by the volume of oil polluting the Gulf . US law allows for fines of $ 4,300 per barrel of oil . BP was also told to hasten payments to small businesses such as seafood processors and hotels seeking compensation . Barack Obama said BP needed to cut through the red tape . `` What is clear is that the economic impact of this disaster is going to be substantial and it is going to be ongoing , '' he said . `` I do not want to see BP nickel and diming these businesses that are having a very hard time . '' A Washington Post-ABC news opinion poll yesterday suggested the oil spill has linked the fortunes of the government and BP . Some 69 % said the government had done a poor job of handling the spill still behind the 81 % who have a negative view of BP 's performance but an unsettling result for Obama in an election year . The poll said a majority of Democrats were also disappointed with the response . Such anger , especially from liberal Democrats , could grow amid reports yesterday that BP may be able to finance some of its clean-up costs by oil it is collecting through the containment cap over the gusher . The reports overshadowed the encouraging news that BP was collecting 11,000 barrels of oil a day through the containment cap installed last week . But Allen said the effort can not be expanded because the company does not yet have vessels big enough to capture more of the oil . The company said it plans to replace the cap next month with a slightly bigger one that will provide `` a better , tighter fit '' . The only sure way to stop the leak on the ocean floor remains to drill relief wells to 18,000 feet below sea level , and inject heavy mud at high volumes to suppress the flow . But even that process which he said he would not be complete until August will not be the end . Allen said he expected the clean-up to continue for four to six weeks after the oil is capped . Restoration of damaged marshlands and recovery of endangered wildlife could take years . In the meantime , BP is trying to limit further damage to its image . Chief executive Tony Hayward is now ranked as one of the most hated men in America . At a congressional hearing in Louisiana yesterday , members of Congress held up full page newspaper ads from BP with scorn . The oil company is pushing back by buying up phrases such as `` oil spill '' on search engines , ABC news reported . `` We have bought search terms on search engines like Google to make it easier for people to find out more about our efforts in the Gulf and make it easier for people to find key links to information on filing claims , reporting oil on the beach and signing up to volunteer , '' BP spokesman Toby Odone told ABC News .

Photograph : Gabriel Bouys\\/AFP\\/Getty Images Who would have thought when the original accident happened on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig on the 20th April 2010 that the oil spill would still be in full spate over a month later ? We would n't have counted ourselves in that group , but nonetheless have for many years been unconvinced as to BP 's ability to manage environmental , health and safety issues effectively . Henderson 's retail Sustainable and Responsible Investment -LRB- SRI -RRB- funds sold out of BP shares in 2003 on the basis of our views about the company 's ability to deliver strong environmental , health and safety -LRB- EHS -RRB- performance across the business . We were concerned about performance in some of the company 's businesses - for example in January 2002 the company was fined # 1 million following a prosecution by the Health and Safety Executive at its Grangemouth refinery in the UK . In Alaska too , a 2001 review found a serious backlog of safety-critical maintenance , followed by an outbreak of ` whistleblowing ' by concerned employees , including testimony to Congress in March 2002 . These events , while remarkable -LRB- the Grangemouth fine was one of the largest safety fines at the time -RRB- , were not so significant to raise concerns across the market more broadly . However , as SRI investors , we did take notice - seeing them as symptomatic of underinvestment more broadly in the company 's aging assets . Of course in retrospect these events presaged the calamitous events at Texas City in 2005 when 15 people lost their lives , and perhaps of the events that are now unfolding in the Gulf of Mexico . The US Government for example announced at the beginning of June that it will investigate alleged infringements of EHS regulations at the Horizon oil rig . Perhaps a more direct indicator of the likelihood of an accident was the fact that the company has for some time been increasingly focused on operations in highly complex and difficult environments including deep-water -LRB- such as in the Gulf of Mexico -RRB- , the Arctic and of course unconventional resources such as the Canadian oil sands . The ` easy ' oil is now more or less the exclusive domain of national oil companies such as Saudi Aramco , with international oil companies like BP relegated to extreme environments where they operate at the limit of their technical capacities . The specific events in the Gulf of Mexico were clearly unpredictable , but perhaps it was inevitable that an accident like this was going to happen . What is more , underlying demand for oil is not likely to weaken in the short to medium term , and so we can expect international oil companies to continue to exploit difficult to access resources in frontier environments with the inevitable challenges that this will continue to pose .

Interviewed on US television yesterday , Obama also suggested that if Tony Hayward had been working for him , the BP figurehead would have been relieved of his duties by now . The president was appearing on NBC 's Today Show in an apparent attempt to show active engagement in dealing with the Gulf oil spill , while distancing the US government from responsibility for the leak . Polls have shown mostAmericans believe Obama has handled the crisis poorly . Hayward 's past comments include : '' I want my life back '' ; asserting that the Gulf was '' a very big ocean '' ; and that `` the environmental impact of this disaster is likely to be very , very modest '' , . The president was unequivocal when asked about such comments by the show host , Matt Lauer , saying : `` He would n't be working for me after any of those statements . '' The interview , snippets of which were released last night by NBC , is due to air in the US later today . The president defended his talks with Gulf fishermen and oil spill experts , saying their purpose was not academic rather , they were an exercise in asserting where the presidential boot should be administered , `` so I know whose ass to kick '' . Yesterday , Obama met with Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen and the president 's cabinet for a briefing on the oil spill , which began with the Deepwater Horizon explosion that killed 11 workers . After the meeting , Obama sought to reassure the nation that the Gulf coast would `` bounce back '' from the spill , but not without time , effort and reimbursement from BP . In the NBC interview , Obama strongly defended his role in dealing with the crisis , including his three visits to the region since the spill began . `` I was down there a month ago before most of these talking heads were even paying attention to the Gulf , '' Obama said , adding he has talked to a variety of `` experts '' on the oil spill , as well as the fishermen . `` I do n't sit around just talking to experts because this is a college seminar , we talk to these folks because they potentially have the best answers so I know whose ass to kick , '' the president said .

His efforts to play down the Deepwater Horizon disaster have backfired . Photograph : Patrick Semansky\\/Associated Press Tony Hayward `` would n't be working for me after any of those statements , '' said President Obama . This sounded like a blunt message to BP 's board to sack its chief executive since Hayward is , in a sense , working for Obama as well as the company 's shareholders . The president 's swipe at Hayward 's gaffes is also fair . The chief executive 's `` I want my life back '' comment was a bad slip but the line about the environmental impact being likely to be `` very , very modest '' was a straightforward blunder . But would sacking Hayward achieve anything substantial ? At this point , it might distract from efforts to contain and plug the leak . That judgment , however , would have to be reversed if the oil plumes reported by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration turn out to be substantial . Last week , Hayward was disputing the existence of the plumes . If he 's wrong , it 's a more serious matter than a few inept media interviews . Either way , in the long run , it looks increasingly hard for Hayward to survive this crisis . If the US president continues to demand his scalp , BP 's board has to ask whether rebuilding the company 's reputation would be best served by a change . BP 's shares today fell 5 % , briefly slipping below 400p for the first time since the disaster .

Many commentators point the finger at BP and the United States government . This focus is understandable but gives an incomplete picture of how moral responsibility is distributed in this kind of case . Getting a better idea of distribution is important for blame and punishment but also for prevention : we do n't want this to happen again . Ascribing responsibility here can be knotty , owing to the wide range of actors involved in oil production . What BP does in this context depends on other corporate actors . Oil companies tend to work with subcontractors , which increases the parties involved . BP works with Transocean , Halliburton , Cameron International , and other outfits . It will be difficult to evaluate if and to what extent they share responsibility for the disaster . But apart from the companies at large and their managers , there 's a category that usually remains out of sight : the engineers and other people directly involved in well control and related operations before , during , and after an accident . Research on a near disaster with a platform in the Norwegian Sea , the Snorre A blowout , shows that it is useful to pay attention to the capabilities people should have in order to deal successfully with a crisis . Ger Wackers and I have argued that in the Sorre A case , the crew managed to recover the platform partly by using their imagination to try to understand what was happening and decide what to do . For instance , the crew had to improvise when trying to control the well . Improvisation is intrinsic to good engineering and management : it 's not free-floating fantasy but depends on knowledge , skills , and experience . If we want to prevent similar disasters , then , companies and regulators need to support structures that promote the exercise of imagination by those who are involved with the operation and management of oil platforms . They need to invest more in the people need to cope with such crises . However , there 's more than the management and engineering side of the disaster . Responsibility spills over to the financial and business dimension of oil production . As previous contributors have argued , multinationals such as BP seem to go for fast growth and shareholder returns , making profit without carrying the real environmental and other costs of their actions . These financial choices and ways of doing business can be detrimental to safety right down to drilling rig level . Mix continuous underinvestment in maintenance and safety with insufficient regulation and you get an accident that is waiting to happen . Moreover , and perhaps most important , we should not only consider responsibility for oil production but also for oil consumption . Business and finance are not isolated from our own choices . Companies such as BP can only do what they do because we want what they sell . We 're all too happy with cheap oil . As citizens , many of us support politicians and political parties who continue to stimulate oil production and the related financial and economic structures . Politicians generally pay lip service to green economics but let people do business as usual . So far , President Barack Obama is no exception , and neither are most leading politicians in the UK and the rest of Europe . But who voted for them ? As consumers , we continue to depend on oil in various ways and therefore maintain the oil-hungry system that makes oil companies drill in deep water and undertake other risky activities . Addicted to oil , we are directly responsible since we continue to drive cars with combustion engines and travel by plane . Indirectly we also rely on oil as we buy goods and services that depend on oil for their production and transportation . If we discuss oil production disasters , therefore , we should also discuss how we live . Safety is not the main issue here , sustainability is . If we are eager to blame BP and the US government for the disaster and their shortcomings in dealing with it , we should remind ourselves that these actors can only operate and govern in this way because we , as citizens and consumers , support them and help maintain the structural environment in which they operate . The oil stain is a local problem ; the responsibility stain spreads out all over the world . This brief analysis is not a substitute for more precise legal investigations and public inquiries that will follow in the wake of the disaster . However , it can inform these investigations by reminding us that the problem is not just far away in the Gulf . The real disaster is of a global nature , and has firm roots in our lifestyle and the political choices we make as individuals and as a society . Their spill , therefore , is also our responsibility .

BP 's plan stated : ` Due to the distance to shore and the response capabilities that would be implemented , no significant adverse impacts are expected ' . Photograph : Win Mcnamee\\/Getty Images A BP contingency plan drawn up to deal with a catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico was riddled with errors and miscalculations , including the naming of a long-deceased scientist as a recommended expert on wildlife contamination . Running to 582 pages , BP 's Regional Spill Plan for the Gulf was approved by the US government last year . But an analysis by the Associated Press has found that it made false assumptions about the extent , direction and consequences of any possible spill from deepwater drilling off the coast of Louisiana . Under a heading of `` sensitive biological resources '' , the document lists walruses , sea otters , sea lions and seals as potential victims of an oil spill , although none of these are found in the Gulf region . According to the plan , even in the event of a leak 10 times worse than the present one , oil would not reach the shore because drilling operations are too far out to sea : `` Due to the distance to shore -LRB- 48 miles -RRB- and the response capabilities that would be implemented , no significant adverse impacts are expected . '' Yet oil has already contaminated marshland on the Louisiana coast and tar balls have appeared on beaches as far away as Florida . Officials have been obliged to ban tourists from swimming on several miles of contaminated beaches in north-west Florida and Alabama . The plan lists a firm called Marine Spill Response Corp as a group able to supply equipment to respond to a spill . But the website listed for the company links to a defunct Japanese-language web page . BP maintains in the document that it can scramble sufficient vessels to pick up as much as 20m gallons of oil from the water each day an assumption that now appears highly optimistic . And a method of calculating the volume of a spill based on the darkness in color of the sheen of contaminated seawater produces an underestimate , with internationally accepted formulas delivering figures as much as 100 times higher . Among the liaison people listed in the event of an emergency is Bob Lutz , named as a wildlife expert at the University of Miami . But AP says Lutz , a sea turtle expert , left Miami two decades ago to head the marine biology department at a university in Boca Raton , and died four years before BP 's plan was approved .

Photograph : Susan Walsh\\/AP The battle to bring BP to account for the Gulf of Mexico disaster intensified as senior politicians in the US gathered to co-ordinate their approach to the oil spill , hours after beleaguered chief executive Tony Hayward was summoned to Washington . Nancy Pelosi , speaker of the House of Representatives , met with seven committee chairmen to discuss how to proceed in the fight with ` big oil ' . Following the meeting , she declared that Congress will write and pass legislation by August that addresses the consequences of the Deepwater Horizon explosion on 20 April . Dubbed the `` spill bill '' , this could include new controls on off-shore drilling , higher fines for spillages , and more compensation for those affected . Pelosi 's meeting was seen as an attempt to bring more order to the Democratic party 's response to the ongoing catastrophe . At least fifteen house and Senate committees have held , or are planning , hearings into the disaster . Four separate meetings are scheduled to take place today alone . This has led to fears of a turf war , as politicians scrabble to be seen to be taking a tough line on BP ahead of this autumn 's mid-term elections . `` You have all of the house , a third of the Senate and a very motivated White House eager to look responsive , '' Kevin Book , an analyst with ClearView Energy Partners , told Bloomberg , flagging up how many lawmakers face re-election . But the scale of the investigations into the Deepwater Horizon disaster has also yielded benefits . For example , the energy and commerce committee has already held five hearings and obtained a slew of documents from the companies involved with the Deepwater drilling . The house select committee on energy independence and global warming forced BP to release live footage of the leak from its robot submarines . And the Senate committee on energy and natural resources exposed rifts between BP , rig operator Transocean and contractor Halliburton , when senior executives all tried to pin the blame on each other . Tuesday 's meeting also gave a taste of the fury that many in Washington feel against BP . Edward Markey , chairman of the house energy and environment subcommittee , claimed that BP was `` either lying or they are grossly incompetent '' as he castigated the company for underestimating the amount of oil spewing into the ocean following the Deepwater Horizon explosion . Up to now , BP has been represented at many of these hearings by Lamar McKay , its head of American operations . That will change next week , though , when Hayward appears before the energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations . It wrote to Hayward yesterday , inviting him and another BP employee to a hearing next Thursday . The subcommittee will grill Hayward about the causes of the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion . `` The subcommittee anticipates that its members may have questions requiring technical knowledge of the Deepwater Horizon rig operations , well design , and safety measures and , accordingly , we ask that you be accompanied by a BP employee or official with sufficient knowledge to answer these questions under oath , '' said the committee in a letter to Hayward released last night . Earlier this week Democratic congressman Anthony Weiner showed how little respect many on Capitol Hill have for BP . He told TV viewers that the company was essentially lying about the disaster : `` Whenever you hear someone with a British accent talking about this on behalf of British Petroleum they are not telling you the truth . That 's the bottom-line , '' Weiner said . There is also evidence that the sheer amount of scrutiny may be overwhelming BP . Politicians in Mississippi had invited BP , Transocean and Halliburton to appear at a hearing at its state capital this week , but the three companies declined . BP reportedly explained that its key officials would be tied up in Washington instead . BP 's shares fell another 3.7 % today to 393p , on fresh fears that the company will be forced to scrap its dividend . They have now lost almost 40 % of their value since the Deepwater rig exploded , wiping nearly # 50bn off BP 's market capitalization . Later today the house transportation and infrastructure committee will hold a hearing called Liability and Financial Responsibility for Oil Spills under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and Related Statutes . The house science and technology committee will discuss the need for better methods to fight oil spills , at a meeting titled Deluge of Oil Highlights Research and Technology Needs for Oil Recovery and Effective Cleanup of Oil Spills . The house energy and commerce committee will probe the current situation in the Gulf of Mexico at a hearing called Beneath the Surface of the BP Spill : What 's Happening Now , What 's Needed Next . And the Senate environment and public works committee will examine The Big Oil Bailout Prevention Liability Act of 2010 , a bill under which the maximum cap for damages would be raised to $ 10bn -LRB- # 6.9 bn -RRB- from $ 75m .

Photograph : Jae C. Hong\\/AP The political and financial pressure on BP escalated sharply yesterday as the US government demanded compensation for thousands of oil industry workers laid off as a result of a freeze on drilling in the Gulf of Mexico . The demand sent the company 's shares plummeting on Wall Street amid worries over long-term survival prospects . In an unexpected addition to BP 's already huge liabilities from America 's worst ever oil spill , the White House said it would press the company to pay the salaries of staff laid off as a result of a six-month moratorium imposed by the Obama administration on exploration activity in the Gulf . The freeze means a halt to work on 33 existing oil rigs , affecting thousands of jobs . The warning , together with fears that the gush of oil in the gulf could be even worse than estimated , sent BP 's American shares down 15.8 % in a late fall on the New York Stock Exchange , pushing them to their lowest level since 1996 . This was despite hopeful news from BP 's operation to plug the undersea leak as it was revealed that the company collected 15,000 barrels of oil on Tuesday . As many as 15 Congressional committees are investigating the oil spill and at one of many hearings yesterday , the US interior secretary , Ken Salazar , said he would ask BP to repay the salaries of workers laid off by the moratorium on drilling . The White House press secretary Robert Gibbs later went further , saying the freeze is `` a result of the accident that BP caused '' . He added : `` It is an economic loss for those workers and those are claims that BP should pay . We believe it 's an economic damage caused by this , not unlike losing business at your bait and tackle shop . '' There were signs last night that BP was heading for a showdown with the administration over the issue . A BP source told Reuters that `` at some point a line has to be drawn '' . As it struggles to stem the oil gushing from its ruptured undersea well , BP has dispatched a giant oil tanker , the Loch Rannoch , from its North Sea operations off the Shetland Islands to the Gulf of Mexico . The ship will help to increase the capacity to collect oil from 18,000 barrels per day to 28,000 a capability which , if required in full , would exceed the US government 's top estimates of the scope of the spill , which range from 19,000 to 25,000 barrels per day . `` We continue to make progress , '' said Thad Allen , the US coastguard admiral overseeing the operation . `` I 'm not going to declare victory on anything until I have absolute numbers . '' Earlier , Allen had shown impatience with BP 's handling of compensation claims from shrimpers , fishermen , property owners and tourism workers . To date , BP has made interim payments of $ 5,000 to many of those lodging claims which has been dismissed as inadequate by victims ' lawyers . In a letter to BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward , Allen said : `` We need more detail and openness from BP to fulfil our oversight responsibilities to the American people and ensure that you are meeting your commitment to restore the gulf coast . '' In Washington , political scrutiny on the oil company is increasing . Nancy Pelosi , speaker of the House of Representatives , has met with chairmen of seven committees to co-ordinate a fight with so-called `` big oil '' . She pledged legislation by August to address the causes and consequences of the Deepwater Horizon disaster , which began when a BP oil rig caught fire and sank on 20 April , killing 11 workers . Anger boiled over at one hearing as a Texan shrimper , Diane Wilson , interrupted evidence by interior secretary Ken Salazar to a senate committee by walking to the center of the room and pouring a beaker of amber-coloured oil over her hair , face and body to protest at the possibility of a cap on BP 's liability . She told senators : `` With this BP disaster , I am seeing the destruction of my community and I am outraged . '' The dive in BP 's shares on Wall Street raises the prospect of a fresh slump when London Stock Exchange opens this morning . BP 's stock has already fallen by 40 % since the explosion . The firm is under pressure from the Obama administration to halt dividend payouts to investors . Each of the rigs affected by a freeze on drilling employs between 180 and 280 workers . But the International Association of Drilling Contractors maintains that as many as 46,000 jobs depend on these deepsea drilling operations .

Photograph : Lee Celano\\/Reuters Out on the water , it starts as a slight rainbow shimmer , then turns to wide orange streamers of oil whipping through the waves . Later , on the beach , we witness a vast , Olympic-sized swimming pool of dark chocolatey syrup left behind at low tide , and thick dark patches of crude bubbling on the sand . The smell of the oil on the beach is so strong it burns your nostrils , and leaves you feeling dizzy and headachey even after a few minutes away from it . According to marine biologist Rick Steiner , my companion on a boat ride through the slick , this is the most volatile and toxic form of crude oil in the waters and lapping on to the beaches of Grand Isle , the area at the heart of the slowly unfolding environmental apocalypse that has engulfed Louisiana , and is now moving eastwards , threatening Mississippi , Alabama , and the Florida Panhandle . Fifty-three days after BP 's ruptured well began spewing crude oil from 5,000 ft below the sea , the wholesale slaughter of dolphins , pelicans , hermit crab and other marine life is only now becoming readily visible to humans . So too is the futility of the Obama administration 's response effort , with protective boom left to float uselessly at sea or in the case of the Queen Bess pelican sanctuary which we visit trapping the oil in vulnerable nesting grounds . Steiner , 57 , a marine biologist from the University of Alaska and a veteran of America 's last oil spill disaster , the Exxon Valdez , says he is in the Gulf of Mexico `` to bear witness '' , and for days he has been taking to the beaches and the waters in a Greenpeace boat gathering evidence . The first casualties on Steiner 's tour appear minutes after our boat leaves the marina and moves through Barataria Pass , prime feeding ground for bottlenose dolphins . Several appear , swimming , eating , even mating in waters criss-crossed by wide burnt-orange streamers of oil . All are at risk of absorbing toxins , from the original spill and from more than 1.2 m gallons of chemicals dumped into the Gulf to try to break up the slick , says Steiner . `` They get it in their eyes . They get it in the fish they eat and it is also possible when they come to the surface and open their blowhole to breathe that they are inhaling some of it , '' he says . The Greenpeace crew turn up the throttle and the boat pulls up to the orange and yellow protective boom around Queen Bess island , which was intended as a haven for the brown pelican . These birds , until recently , were on the federal government 's list of endangered species and were doing OK but now that recovery appears to have been abruptly reversed . A dark tideline of oil encircles the island , and has crept into the marsh grasses , where the pelican nest . Many , if not most , of the adult birds had patches of oil on their chest feathers . Nearly all are doomed , says Steiner , if not now , then at some point in the future . `` The risks in here to birds are not just acute mortality right here right now , '' he says . `` There is mortality we wo n't see for a month or two months , or even a year . '' He points out a pelican standing so still it looks like it 's been made out of a slab of chocolate , another frantically flapping its spread wings to try to shake off the oil , and then another manically pecking at the spots on its chest . `` He could be a candidate for cleaning , and he may survive , '' Steiner says . `` He obviously wo n't if he 's not cleaned . '' Rescue teams have plucked hundreds of birds from the muck . But stripping oil from the feathers of stricken birds is a slow and delicate operation , and there is no assurance of the birds ' survival . About a third of the rescued birds have died so far . As we pull up to Queen Bess island , two crew boats are at work shoring up the two lines of defense for the island : an outer ring of orange and yellow protective boom intended to push the oil back out to sea , as well as an inner ring of white absorbent material that is supposed to suck up any of the crude that gets through . Since oil began lapping at the Louisiana coast , the government has set down 2.25 m ft of containment boom and 2.55 m ft of absorbent material . But local sports fishermen on Grand Isle complain response crews bungled the protection zone for Queen Bess because they only put a portion of the island behind the orange and yellow barrier boom . That turned the boom into traps which pushed even greater quantities of oil onshore . Steiner agrees : `` I would say 70 % or 80 % of the booms are doing absolutely nothing at all . '' The efforts on the beaches seem equally futile . By day workers in white protective suits march along the sands of the state park on the eastern end of Grand Isle , trying to suck up the oil . But as the tide goes out there is only more oil to be found , and dozens of dead hermit crab that have struggled to flee to shore . Steiner says he has seen it all before , after the Exxon Valdez went aground in 1989 , and then in other oil spills he has monitored around the world from Lebanon to Pakistan . There is , he says , a drearily familiar pattern . `` Industry always habitually understate the size of a spill and impact as well as habitually overstate the effectiveness of the response . '' In the case of the Exxon Valdez , he says , the environmental impacts persisted for months or years after the tanker went aground . That catastrophe , which saw 11m gallons of crude dumped into the pristine waters of Alaska , occurred within the space of six hours . This spill is much worse . BP 's well on the ocean floor has been spewing greater volumes of crude oil into the water for 53 days . Even by the administration 's most optimistic forecasts , it will keep gushing until August , and the clean-up could last well into the autumn . `` This is just the start . It is going to keep coming in even if they shut the damn thing off today , '' says Steiner .

The oil spill could be down to BP 's failings , but bankruptcy would destroy livelihoods and pensions on both sides of the Atlantic Barack Obama walks away after making a statement to the media flanked by co-chairs of BP oil spill commission . Photograph : Mark Wilson\\/Getty Images As each day goes by , the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico becomes more gruesome . Oil-drenched birds and turtles wash up along the shoreline , pristine beaches are polluted by balls of tar and an oily slick laps at Louisiana 's ecologically fragile marshland . Understandably , Americans are livid . But has the bloodlust directed at BP gone too far ? Egged on by catch-all protest coalitions , a `` seize BP '' campaign is organising demonstrations in major cities calling on the US government to snatch the British company 's US assets . A `` boycott BP '' action group advocates shunning BP service stations . Placards abound with slogans such as `` God bless America go to hell BP '' and `` BP billionaire polluters '' . The wife and children of BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , are under police protection following threats . Urged by political strategists to act more angrily , Barack Obama shed his uncharacteristic cool this week and declared that if it was up to him , BP 's boss would be fired . The White House now wants BP to pay not only for cleaning up the Gulf , but also for the cost of jobs lost on 33 other oil rigs because of a government-imposed six-month moratorium on offshore drilling . And the US department of justice is threatening legal action to halt BP 's dividend payouts to investors . Anthony Weiner , a usually sensible Democratic congressman , declared : `` Whenever you hear someone with a British accent talking about this on behalf of British Petroleum , they are not telling you the truth . '' With something close to relish , financial pundits are mooting a BP bankruptcy . A New York Times columnist , Andrew Ross Sorkin , guessed that the cost of the gulf disaster could reach a staggering $ 40bn -LRB- # 27bn -RRB- , making corporate collapse a real possibility -LRB- calmer industry experts put the cost at $ 5bn to $ 15bn -RRB- . A prominent , albeit retired , oil analyst , Matthew Simmons , has been touring television studios to declare that the oil spill was `` entirely BP 's fault '' and that the company will be bust within months . Predictions of doom are self-perpetuating in business and BP 's stock price has duly plummeted by 40 % . The company 's market value has fallen by nearly # 50bn , even though BP makes a profit of more than # 11bn annually . Perhaps it 's time , though , to pause for breath . It is n't yet clear exactly what happened on the Deepwater Horizon platform in the hours leading up the catastrophic fire on April 20 that sent the rig under water , killed 11 people and left BP 's Macondo spewing oil . This accident may well be down to BP 's failings but should n't we wait until we know for sure before we become not only judges but executioners ? Of the 126 people working on the Deepwater Horizon , only eight were BP employees . BP had a 65 % share in the well , while a partner , Anadarko , had 25 % . The rig was owned and operated by a US firm , Transocean . A failed blow-out preventer was made by another US firm , Cameron , while Halliburton , the oil services firm once run by Dick Cheney , carried out cement work that was supposed to seal the well . BP was calling the shots on the project and it is tempting to rush to judgement on the British firm , given its dismal US record . Neglect and lax safety oversight caused an explosion at BP 's Texas City oil refinery in 2005 , killing 15 workers . The following year , poor maintenance prompted BP 's pipelines in Alaska to spring a leak , sending oil gushing into the Arctic wilderness . There have been allegations , as yet unproven , that BP was cutting corners on the Deepwater rig perhaps by filling the well with unstable water , rather than drilling mud . Nevertheless , there are plenty of questions outstanding . Just this week , a US congressional committee asked Transocean to explain apparent poor staffing on the rig on the night of the gulf disaster . There were 18 employees on shift that evening , the lowest number in a fortnight of records , and there were no engineers , electricians , mechanics or subsea supervisors . BP is n't allowed to suggest that others might share responsibility that amounts to `` finger pointing '' , which prompts howls of political outrage . Irrespective of liability , it is worth pondering whose interests a BP bankruptcy would serve . Although based in London , the company has been effectively Anglo-American since its 1998 merger with Amoco it employs 80,300 people , of whom 29,000 are in the US . Some 40 % of its shares are held in the UK , while 39 % are held in the US . A collapse of BP would destroy livelihoods , damage pension funds and wipe out savings on both sides of the Atlantic . For critics of `` big oil '' , that 's hardly a cause for tears . But BP 's failure would n't dent America 's reliance on fossil fuels even slightly . Ironically , the real beneficiaries would be other big oil companies . The US government is n't likely to let a Russian , Chinese or Middle Eastern buyer pick up the assets of a crippled BP . The richest , most likely buyer of valuable remnants would be ExxonMobil , which , lest we forget , is a company that defines hardline . Until very recently , Exxon spent millions funding groups that deny global warming . Of all the major energy companies , it has been the slowest to invest in renewable energy in 2007 , it made a profit of $ 40bn but put just $ 100m into a research project on wind , solar and green technology . And before the Gulf of Mexico disaster , Exxon was the worst oil-spiller in US history . BP has n't done itself many favors . Initially , the company woefully underestimated the scale of the spill . And BP 's chief executive has produced a string of cringeworthy remarks . The company was ill-prepared for such an unprecedented disaster but has finally made some progress in plugging the leak . Yet BP has consistently promised to foot the bill for cleaning up the gulf and to meet all valid compensation claims . Many will argue that BP deserves to die , and anger is entirely understandable . But critics should be careful what they wish for . America is a nation with a tradition of due process and everybody even `` big oil '' is entitled to a fair trial . cents This article was updated at 1pm on 10 June 2010 Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Has US bloodlust for BP gone too far ? | Andrew Clark This article was published on guardian .

Photograph : Lee Celano\\/Reuters The oil spill off the Gulf of Mexico is even worse than previously thought , with twice as much oil spewing into the ocean than earlier estimations suggested , figures show . Latest estimates from scientists studying the disaster for the US government suggest 160-380 million litres -LRB- 42-100 million US gallons -RRB- of oil have already entered the Gulf . Most experts believe there is more oil gushing into the sea in an hour than officials originally said was spilling in an entire day . It is the third and perhaps not the last time the Obama administration has had to increase its estimate of how much oil is gushing . The revised figures suggest the disaster will be far more costly for BP , which has seen its stock plummet since the 20 April explosion that killed 11 workers and triggered the spill . Shares tumbled almost 7 % to a 13-year low yesterday over fears that the US department of justice could block the company 's dividend , due next month . This morning the shares bounced , rising 7 % . If the flow continues , it will easily become the worst oil spill in peacetime history . The Exxon Valdez disaster of 1989 involved a comparatively minor 41m litres of oil . `` This is a nightmare that keeps getting worse every week , '' said Michael Brune , executive director of the Sierra Club , the biggest grassroots environmental organization in the US . `` We 're finding out more and more information about the extent of the damage Clearly we ca n't trust BP 's estimates of how much oil is coming out . '' Trying to clarify what has been a contentious and confusing issue , US officials gave a wide variety of estimates last night . US Geological Survey director , Marcia McNutt , who is co-ordinating the figures , said as much as 8m litres a day could have been flooding into the Gulf , twice as much as the US government has ever conceded to up to now . The estimate was for the flow before 3 June when a riser pipe was cut and then a cap placed on it . No estimates were given for the amount of oil gushing from the well after the cut , which BP said would increase the flow by about 20 % . Nor are there estimates since a cap was put on the pipe , which already has collected more than 11m litres . The estimates are incomplete and different teams have come up with different numbers . A new team from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute came in with even higher estimates , ranging from 3.8 m litres to 8m litres a day . If the high end is true , that means nearly 400m litres have spilled since 20 April . Even using other numbers that federal officials and scientists call a more reasonable range would estimate that about 238m litres have spilled since the rig explosion . By comparison , the worst peacetime oil spill , 1979 's Ixtoc 1 in Mexico , was about 530m litres over 10 months . The Gulf spill has not yet reached two months . The new figures mean Deepwater Horizon is producing an Exxon Valdez-size spill every five to 13 days . Previous estimates had put the range roughly between 1.9 m and a 3.8 m litres day , perhaps higher . At one point , the federal government claimed only 160,000 litres were spilling a day and then it upped the number to 795,000 litres .

Photograph : Andrew Yates\\/AP The government moved to quell suggestions of indifference to the BP oil disaster today when both David Cameron and the chancellor , George Osborne , spoke to BP 's chairman , Carl-Henric Svanberg , urging all sides to find a constructive solution to the environmental crisis . Cameron and Osborne are involved in a delicate balancing act , facing calls to stand up to Barack Obama 's criticisms of BP and the anti-British sentiment on which the US president seems to be trading . At the same time , Cameron can not afford to wreck the so-called special relationship by being seen to attack Obama on an issue that is causing the president political trouble . After meeting the BP chairman in Downing Street , Osborne said : `` We are all concerned about the human and environmental impact and as the prime minister has said , we understand the concerns of the US administration . `` The prime minister is also clear that we need constructive solutions and that we remember the economic value BP brings to people in Britain and America . '' Cameron will speak to Obama tomorrow in a long arranged conversation , but there has been alarm in Tory circles after it emerged that only the climate change secretary , Chris Huhne , had been in touch with the US administration to discuss the crisis . Cameron told Svanberg it was in everyone 's interest for the company to remain financially strong and stable . BP has assured the government it is planning to suspend the planned # 10bn dividend next week , and start the next phase of its clean-up campaign next week . The conversation with the BP chairman took place after Cameron returned from Afghanistan . Number 10 said in a statement : `` The prime minister explained that he was frustrated and concerned about the environmental damage caused by the leak , but made clear his view that BP is an economically important company in the UK , US and other countries . He said it is in everyone 's interests that BP continues to be a financially strong and stable company . Mr Svanberg made clear that BP will continue to do all that it can to stop the oil spill , clean up the damage and meet all legitimate claims for compensation . '' Outside Number 10 , Svanberg said : `` I think we have done everything we can to try to fill the well and we have said we would do everything expected from us in cleaning up the beach , taking care of all the claims and learn from this and make deep-sea drilling an even safer place . '' BP directors will hold a special board meeting on Monday to decide whether to cut the dividend or take some other kind of initiative as a `` peace offering '' to Barack Obama before a meeting at the White House on Wednesday . The public position of the oil group remains that no decision is likely on payouts to shareholders until much nearer July 27 , when the half-yearly financial figures and the forthcoming dividend policy must be given . But privately there is increasing acceptance that the political heat is so intense that BP could need to make some kind of gesture , and earlier rather than later . Options being considered include putting the dividend into an escrow or trust fund until the full scale of the spill liabilities are known . The BP board meeting will include the chief executive , Tony Hayward , in Houston and other members via teleconferencing from different parts of the world . A common line will be hammered out which will serve as a strategy position that Svanberg and Hayward will be able to present to Obama in Washington 48 hours later . But sources said BP would be in `` listening mode '' when its executives meet Obama in what is expected to be a difficult encounter , given that the US president has made personal attacks on Hayward and the company which have unnerved the financial markets and sent the BP share price spiralling downwards . Earlier , the deputy prime minister , Nick Clegg , warned that a row between Britain and the United States over the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico risked turning into a futile and destructive bout of `` megaphone diplomacy '' . Clegg told an audience in Madrid : `` I do n't frankly think we are going to reach a solution to stop the release of oil into the ocean any quicker by allowing this to spiral into a tit-for-tat political and diplomatic spat . '' Anger is mounting in the City that Obama has singled out BP rather than US contractors such as Halliburton for criticism . There is also concern that Cameron has not defended the British company more robustly . The mayor of London , Boris Johnson , accused the Obama administration of indulging in `` anti-British rhetoric '' . He told the BBC that huge numbers of British pensioners , whose retirement funds invest in BP , were losing money because of the continued attacks on the company . New figures show that twice as much oil is spewing into the ocean than earlier estimates had suggested .

Now , he is reduced to supplying fuel and water to BP clean-up crews Dean Blanchard says he has lost $ 15m worth of sales in the past 50 days . Photograph : Leslie Rose Of all the folks in Louisiana spoiling for a fight with Tony Hayward , none perhaps brings more gusto to the challenge than Dean Blanchard , the local shrimp king . The outer walls of the trailer office of his seafood empire are plastered with homemade signs reading '' BP = Bayou Polluter '' and `` President Obama : BP took my business and my money . '' The frontroom is painted shrimp pink , and Blanchard is working himself up imagining what he would like to do to the BP chief executive if he ever got the chance : fist fight , public wrestling match , jail time ? `` He took away everything I love most in the world . I am going to hunt that son of a bitch down like a ` coon , '' he said . `` He wants his life back after all he has done to us ? The hell with him . '' Then he speculates about peeing in the Queen 's water fountain . `` What do you think would happen to me ? I 'd go to jail for that , and it would be relatively minor environmental damage . '' He may not immediately look the part in his faded shorts and blue vest and the jumble of buildings around the docks , but in the shrimp world , Blanchard is Hayward . BP ranks in the top three oil companies ; Blanchard says his are the third biggest shrimp docks in the world , with some 6,000 fishermen bringing him their catch . His company accounts for about 11 % of the US shrimp supply . In the pre-spill era , that would have put Hayward and Blanchard on near equal footing , he reckons . Oil and shrimp were the two poles of existence in this part of Louisiana . Offshore rigs and refinery tanks are as ubiquitous as fishing trawlers . Blanchard had a foot in both worlds . One grandfather got rich on shrimp , establishing the business he now operates near BP 's local command center . The other grandfather got rich from oil . Now , with the gusher on the ocean floor and fishing banned in much of the Gulf , there is just oil clean-up . At the Sand Dollar marina , redeployed fishermen and shrimpers , hauling containment boom through the water instead of nets , share space with the coastguard and national guard . The money is only a fraction of what it would be for a successful shrimp season and 2010 was shaping up to be a banner year . `` Every 10 years , when you get a cold winter , you get a really good shrimp crop , '' Blanchard said . `` We were licking our chops . '' On a good run , a big shrimp boat could earn $ 1m -LRB- # 686,000 -RRB- a day . The going rate for fishing for oil is $ 3,000 , less for smaller boats not a lot once divided among captain and crew . Several of the men say they have yet to be paid . Blanchard says his losses are on a far grander scale . `` I 've lost $ 15m worth of sales in the last 50 days . That would have been $ 1m in my pocket , '' he said . A few of the big freezer boats are still going out , but Blanchard says he is reduced to selling BP fuel and water for its contract clean-up crews , and renting out dock space . By his terms , it 's a pittance and he has no idea when he will get back to work . `` What I make off of BP I could make in eight hours , '' he said . He is equally scathing of BP 's oil clean-up strategy . `` I could take two 32oz Big Gulp cups from the 7-Eleven and do more than what they are doing , '' he said . Blanchard is far from the only angry man in town . The mayor , David Camardelle , was in Washington this week to testify before Congress . He nearly broke down . `` The shrimp died . It 's a ghost town . The boom does n't work , '' he said . Around the corner from his operations , a family has erected 101 simple white crosses memorialising what has been lost to the spill . There is sea food industry , with crosses for tuna , shrimp and oyster catches , but also `` beach sunrises '' , `` seafood gumbo '' , `` redfish rodeo '' , `` family time '' , `` porch sitting '' and `` dog on beach '' . And for all his bluster , Blanchard is overwhelmed by the loss . `` I think I did everything right , and here this idiot came and did n't know how to run his business and put me out of my business . People used to respect me in this town . Now I wake up in the morning and I do n't know what to do .

Photograph : Ben Stansall\\/AFP\\/Getty Images Nick Clegg today warned that a row between Britain and the US over the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico was in danger of turning into a destructive bout of `` megaphone diplomacy '' . `` I do n't frankly think we are going to reach a solution to stop the release of oil into the ocean any quicker by allowing this to spiral into a tit-for-tat political and diplomatic spat , '' said Clegg , speaking in the Spanish capital , Madrid . The deputy prime minister , responding to a question on Barack Obama 's increasingly strident criticism of the British oil company , added : `` I am not going to start intervening in a debate which clearly risks descending into megaphone diplomacy . '' Anger at Obama singling out BP for criticism rather than US contractors such as Halliburton is mounting in the City . There is also concern that the prime minister , David Cameron , has not defended the British firm more robustly . Cameron is to discuss the oil spill in a telephone conversation with the US president tomorrow . London 's Conservative mayor , Boris Johnson , has accused the US of indulging in `` anti-British rhetoric '' and told the BBC that huge numbers of British pensioners , whose retirement funds are invested in BP , were losing money because of the continued attacks on the company . Pressure on the embattled oil firm grew as estimates from US government scientists suggested that twice as much oil as thought was spewing from the broken vent , the third time the Obama administration has had to increase its estimate . Clegg said Britain 's coalition government would avoid a spiralling war of words with Washington on the issue . `` I , and the whole of British government , want to only play ... as much as we can , a constructive role , which is to find a solution to what is a huge environmental disaster , '' he said . `` It is an ecological catastrophe . It does need to be dealt with . '' The row comes as BP said it may delay or reduce payouts to shareholders following pressure from Obama . The company 's board of directors is considering deferring the payment or offering shareholders a portion of the dividend , which is due to be announced on 27 July . `` We are considering all options on the dividend , but no decision has been made , '' the BP boss , Tony Hayward , told the Wall Street Journal . Previously , Hayward had said BP would continue to `` meet our obligations to our employees , and to our other stakeholders , including hundreds of thousands of shareholders , and millions more in mutual and pension funds , who rely on their investment in BP as part of their financial security and in many cases their retirement income '' . Reports suggest BP will seek to establish an agreement with the White House that could see payouts held in `` escrow '' until the company 's liabilities for the clean-up are fully realized . Other suggestions have included scrapping the dividend for one quarter or paying it in shares rather than cash , according to reports . BP 's dividends are the biggest single contributor to FTSE shareholder income form , accounting for around # 1 of every # 7 handed to investors last year . The firm 's chairman , Carl-Henric Svanberg , told investors a decision on the dividend would be made next month , while reassuring analysts that the company 's cash deposits were substantially large enough to afford the payment . Obama and senior US politicians have been vocal in their anger at any potential dividend payment before the total cost of the disaster is known . Earlier this week , the president said Hayward `` would n't be working for me '' after the BP chief 's remark that `` the environmental impact of this disaster is likely to be very , very modest '' . Hayward has stressed that retaining investor confidence is important to ensure that BP remains financially strong enough to pay for a clean-up operation that some have predicted will last for years . The chief executive of Britain 's National Association of Pension Funds said investors might be receptive to a suspension of dividends to protect the BP 's long-term future . `` BP 's current difficulties should n't have an immediate or serious impact on those saving into a pension scheme or on those who have retired , '' Joanne Segars said .

HuffPost claims : BP has exerted no small effort in keeping the press at arm 's length from the story .

Then there 's this video evidence from ABC reporter Matt Gutman being niggled by silly questions from a BP manager while filming a short item from an Alabama beach .

We 're not exactly sure why that is . '' In one incident last week , a reporter and photographer from the New York Daily News were told by a BP contractor they could n't go on to a public beach on Grand Isle , Louisiana , one of the areas most heavily affected by the spill . The contractor summoned a local sheriff , who then told the reporter , Matthew Lysiak , that news media had to fill out paperwork and then be escorted by a BP official to obtain access to the beach . `` It 's just irrational , '' observed Lysiak , talking to the New York Times . Michael Oreskes , senior managing editor at the Associated Press , told the Times the situation was not unlike the embedding of reporters with the military in Afghanistan . `` There is a continued effort to keep control over the access , '' he said . `` And even in places where the government is cooperating with us to provide access , it 's still a problem because it 's still access obtained through the government .

BP has consistently played down the size of the spill . But with each new technique it deploys to siphon off more oil , the scale of the disaster and BP 's hopelessly optimistic estimates become ever more apparent . The new figure of between 20,000 and 40,000 barrels dwarfs the original estimate by US authorities based on information provided by BP and endorsed by the oil company that the spill was just 1,000 barrels of oil per day . As recently as the end of last month , the official estimate was still as low as 5,000 barrels . This was only revised following the release by BP under pressure from scientists and the US Congress of new video footage of the leak at the sea bed . The most accurate way to measure the size of the spill is against the amount BP is collecting in its attempts to contain the leak . If next month BP starts to collect 50,000 barrels of oil per day , this will confirm that the original estimates massively understated the scale of the environmental catastrophe . Democrat Ed Markey has accused BP of lying about the size of the spill to limit the financial impact on the company , an allegation that BP not surprisingly denies . The company faces fines of up to $ 4,300 for each spilt barrel . BP has always admitted publicly that the official estimates were impossible to verify but in private briefings to the press it has quoted the figures with more certainty . When the Guardian challenged BP on the accuracy of the 5,000-barrel estimate last month , Kent Wells , a senior vice-president based in Houston , admitted that there was no way of knowing for sure how much oil was spewing into the Gulf . `` It could be 1,000 barrels or 5,000 barrels , '' he said , but at no point did he specify that the amount could be higher than the official estimate . If oil has been flowing at the top end of the current estimate 40,000 barrels per day a total of 2m barrels will have gushed into the Gulf to date . This would make it eight times worse than the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 . The Gulf of Mexico spill is currently about a fifth of the size of the 1990 Persian Gulf spill caused by Saddam Hussein blowing up the Kuwaiti oilfields . In August , the first of two relief wells is expected to be completed , which BP hopes will mean the leaking reservoir can be plugged permanently .

Photograph : Saul Loeb\\/AFP\\/Getty Images BP could suspend its dividend payout to shareholders over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , the energy giant has confirmed . The company said its board would meet on Monday to consider withholding the latest tranche of a # 7bn annual payout . The move comes as David Cameron and Barack Obama prepare to discuss the crisis this afternoon . A BP spokesman admitted there had been `` a lot of political pressure '' on the company , and said that suspending the dividend was `` an option that 's up for discussion '' . `` No decision has been made on it , we are looking at options , '' he said . `` There 's a board meeting on Monday , but they are not necessarily going to take a decision on it then . '' Scientists have said that the amount of oil gushing out of the ruptured well , which bores a mile deep into the seabed , is far higher than previously estimated . Up to 40,000 barrels a day , over a period of weeks , could have escaped before containment efforts were implemented , the US Geological Survey calculated . The US president was due to phone Cameron at 4pm -LRB- UK time -RRB- , before taking his fourth trip to the Gulf coast to assess the response to the spill and meet affected residents on Monday and Tuesday , the White House said . There have been claims that Obama 's hard line on BP is jeopardising both its share price and British pensions . Cameron has been under pressure from senior figures , such as the London mayor , Boris Johnson , to defend BP and stand up to his US counterpart . Cameron yesterday told the BP chairman , Carl-Henric Svanberg , that it was `` in everyone 's interests that BP continues to be a financially strong and stable company '' . But the prime minister acknowledged Obama 's anger , adding that he too was `` frustrated and concerned about the environmental damage caused by the leak '' . Svanberg has been summoned to the White House for talks with Obama on Wednesday .

Photograph : Saul Loeb\\/AFP\\/Getty Images The anger is palpable in the southern Louisiana towns where livelihoods are being slowly and inexorably choked by oil . Pickup trucks with '' BP sucks '' scrawled on their panels bounce along the roads . Anti-BP rallies are planned this weekend in communities too small to rate a petrol station but which now sport giant billboards advertising law firms touting for people who want to sue the oil giant for compensation . Locals in Plaquemines , a long spit of marshy land between the Gulf of Mexico and Mississippi , complain that BP has been too slow in hiring fishermen and shrimpers to help fight the spill , as promised . `` Fifty days into it and they are still trying to get out the booms and set up their equipment , '' said Therese Creppel , who owns a seafood restaurant and is now struggling to find oyster and shrimp for her menu . Gripes about the delays and aggravation involved in filing compensation claims dominate the airwaves of local radio stations . Creppel has put in her own call to BP seeking compensation , but is worried the oil company could collapse under the financial and political pressures now engulfing it . `` Someone told me right at the very beginning that this is going to bankrupt BP , '' she said . `` I did n't believe it then , but now it 's a little scary . '' But it is not only the locals who are afraid . The oil washing up on the shores of America 's deep south is proving toxic to more than the local wildlife . Both President Barack Obama and Britain 's prime minister , David Cameron , are finding to their cost that a crisis for a globalised company like BP carries collateral damage . The urgent question for both men now is of who will be damaged more by the collision of politics and big business that is testing the UK 's special relationship with the US to its limit . The crisis is as much about money as it is about the environment . In Plaquemines , where rigs and refineries line the roads , there is as much anger at Obama for putting a moratorium on offshore drilling as there is at BP for provoking the six-month timeout in the first place . Almost everybody has someone who has worked in the industry and there is as much talk about fears that the offshore industry might migrate elsewhere as a result of the crisis as there is about the black tide washing into the marshes . Gary Sercovich and his sons hire out crew boats to BP that are normally used to service the stricken Deepwater Horizon rig . Now they ferry workers and containment booms to the source of the gusher , a new , more lucrative business . Sercovich , while upset about the lasting damage from the spill , is almost zenlike as to its cause . `` It was bound to happen one day , '' he said . `` We are used to oil spills here , only not as gigantic as this , of course . '' For Obama , who will make his fourth trip to the site of America 's greatest environmental disaster tomorrow , no other issue not Iran 's nuclear ambitions , not Middle Eastern turmoil , not two active wars nor the looming November elections now so dominates his time . Accompanied by top staffers , he will stay overnight in the Gulf for the first time . In a world where every single minute of a president 's time is accounted for , it is a huge investment of political capital . Obama 's advisers hope the TV cameras and huge pool of White House reporters that follow his every movement will portray him as someone in control of the situation . They are desperate to avoid a growing comparison between his reaction to the spill and President George W Bush 's complacency over Hurricane Katrina in nearby New Orleans . Until now the president has largely confined himself to withering attacks on BP 's management , an approach that has savaged the reputation of the company and its share price , which has fallen 39 % since the rig exploded on 20 April , killing 11 men . There is little doubt that it has been a deliberate White House strategy to lash out at BP , not only because the company clearly has much to answer for , but also because it provides a useful political foil . The oil giant is easy to portray as foreign even though it is a fully-fledged global business with huge numbers of operations and employees in America . Much has been made of Obama and others referring to the firm as British Petroleum , though it long ago dropped the moniker . The attack was its sharpest when Obama who had faced protracted calls to show more anger at BP staged a carefully choreographed appearance on NBC 's Today show . Obama said that he had been far from cool in his response and had been speaking to experts on oil spill '' ... so I know whose ass to kick '' . The words immediately created headlines across America . `` It was the ass heard round the world , '' remarked Los Angeles Times White House correspondent Alex Wagner . It was not the first use of bellicose language by the Obama administration . Earlier Obama 's press spokesman , Robert Gibbs , said : `` We will keep our boot on the throat of BP . '' The Obama administration 's anger at BP may be strategic but it taps into a sentiment bubbling up across the nation . BP chief executive Tony Hayward has been portrayed in the US media as a comic villain . Not only does he have a clipped English accent familiar to Americans from the portrayal of many Hollywood villains , he has a talent for foolish statements , not least his bleating comment at the height of the crisis that `` I want my life back '' . On a visceral level , the anger has been displayed in vandalism at BP petrol stations . A public boycott of BP stations has been organised and sales have dropped by as much as 25 % at some outlets . In Pennsylvania , the consumer backlash against BP is so strong that a chain of convenience stores is changing its branding at three of its stations . Democracy for America , a liberal grassroots group , has organised an `` Anyone but BP '' campaign that has had a huge impact across the nation . `` BP had the resources to drill and create this horrible disaster , now they have the responsibility to clean it up . But they wo n't do it on their own . They need to know we will make them pay one way or another , '' said Levana Layedecker , the group 's communications director . Robert Reich , a labor secretary under President Bill Clinton , has gone as far as to call for Obama to take BP 's North American operations over in a manner similar to that of stricken insurer AIG at the height of the financial crisis . `` We have a national emergency on our hands , '' Reich said . `` No president would allow a nuclear reactor owned by a private for-profit company to melt down in the United States while remaining under the direct control of that company . The meltdown in the Gulf is the environmental equivalent . '' While BP does make a convenient target , other companies can consider themselves fortunate not to be caught up in the crisis . Of the 126 people working on the Deepwater Horizon rig , only eight were BP employees . The oil giant may have a 65 % share of the well , but its partner , Anadarko , has a 25 % share . The rig was owned and operated by offshore drilling company Transocean , which leased it to BP . Dick Cheney 's former company , Halliburton , played a crucial role in carrying out cement work that was supposed to cap the doomed well . The failed blowout preventer was made by an American firm , Cameron . There is a bewildering array of potential bad guys to blame , not just one single villain . But that argument is unhelpful to those looking for a simple narrative to explain such an overwhelming catastrophe . By the end of last week the narrative had taken a new direction , as British politicians accused Obama of anti-British sentiment . `` I do think there 's something slightly worrying about the anti-British rhetoric that seems to be permeating America , '' said Boris Johnson , the mayor of London . `` I would like to see a bit of cool heads rather than endlessly buck-passing and name-calling . '' The former chairman of the Tory party , Lord Tebbit , accused Obama of displaying a `` despicable '' attitude . `` The whole might of American wealth and technology is displayed as utterly unable to deal with the disastrous spill so what is more natural than a crude , bigoted , xenophobic display of partisan political presidential petulance against a multinational company ? '' One of Britain 's top business figures , John Napier , the chairman of the insurance company RSA , waded into the row , calling on Obama to act in a `` more statesmanlike way '' . In an open letter to the US president , Napier said Obama 's comments were `` coming across as somewhat prejudicial and personal '' . Napier wrote : `` There is a sense here that these attacks are being made because BP is British . There is no doubt that BP , as a UK plc , is totally committed to do everything possible to contain the oil leak and meet all its obligations in the USA . '' This weekend BP is under pressure to cancel its dividend until the scale of its liabilities is clear . The oil giant 's official position remains that no decision is likely on payouts to shareholders until closer to 27 July , when it releases half-year figures . But privately its executives recognize the company will be forced to to take a decision much earlier . At a BP board meeting tomorrow three options will be considered cut the second-quarter dividend , which is due out in September , defer it , or issue dividend payments as `` scrip '' , effectively an IOU to shareholders , rather than cash . The company could opt to put the dividend into an escrow or trust fund until the full scale of its liabilities , which some analysts believe could total $ 40bn , is known . Given what is at stake , it is no surprise that BP is now adopting a more humble tone , pledging to `` listen very carefully '' to what Obama tells its executives when they meet in Washington this Wednesday . But canceling , or even cutting the dividend , the most generous paid by a UK company and a significant source of income for pension funds , will bring problems for Cameron . It has become a totem of national pride . As Lord Jones , a government trade ambassador and former trade minister , put it last week : `` Pension fund beneficiaries will be saying : ` Are you standing up for us , Mr Cameron ? ' '' Some in the rightwing press have adopted a similar line , dismayed by Cameron 's initial response , a statement in which he said he understood the US government 's frustration because the Deepwater explosion was a `` catastrophe '' for the environment . `` Stand up for your country , Mr Cameron , '' screamed the Daily Mail . `` Cameron fails to back BP in fight with Obama , '' concluded the Daily Telegraph . Tim Montgomerie , editor of the ConservativeHome blog , believes the `` BP saga '' highlights Cameron 's fraught relationship with newspapers that have historically been allies of the Tories . `` He never really sealed the deal with the Mail and the Telegraph can be pretty hostile as well , '' Montgomerie said . `` Cameron is stuck on 37 % in the opinion polls . There has been no honeymoon effect from entering government . Tony Blair was on about 55 % to 60 % at this stage . Cameron has very little support in the media . I think partly it is his failure to win the election . Fairly or unfairly , the right feels as though he stuffed them once by not winning the election , then he stuffed them again by giving away too much to the Liberal Democrats . '' Others believe it may be a case of naked self-interest rather than ideology that is at work . `` There is a feeling that under Andy Coulson -LRB- Cameron 's spin doctor -RRB- the administration has favored News International the Times and the Sun , '' said one senior figure working for a rightwing newspaper . `` There is a feeling that the Mail and Telegraph have been treated as second class citizens and now they do not feel loyalty . '' But even on the right of his own party there is discord over what Cameron should do . `` Let 's separate our interests as a democratic nation from those of a company , '' said Douglas Carswell , Tory MP for Harwich and Clacton . `` This was a major catastrophe it was environmental vandalism . We ca n't wrap ourselves in the flag now .

Photograph : Dan Anderson\\/EPA The following correction was printed in the Observer 's For the record column , Sunday 20 June 2010 We reported below that `` private companies , councils and public bodies have invested hundreds of billions of pounds of their pension funds into the company '' . According to National Association of Pension Funds estimates , the amount invested in BP by UK pension funds is 1.5 % of total assets , which are in excess of # 800bn . President Barack Obama moved to defuse a growing political row over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill yesterday by assuring the prime minister that he was not trying to blame Britain for the catastrophe . In a 30-minute phone call , the US president took the extraordinary step of insisting he had not been trying to undermine the value of BP when criticising the company . He had reacted furiously to delays by BP in capping the leak , which has been described as the worst environmental disaster in US history . Obama , who has been criticised for calling BP `` British Petroleum '' despite the fact the company dropped the name more than a decade ago , insisted his anger had nothing to do with national identity . In a revealing statement , Downing Street said : `` President Obama said to the prime minister that his unequivocal view was that BP was a multinational global company and that frustrations about the oil spill had nothing to do with national identity . The prime minister stressed the economic importance of BP to the UK , US and other countries . The president made clear that he had no interest in undermining BP 's value . `` The president and prime minister reaffirmed their confidence in the unique strength of the US-UK relationship . '' Government officials insisted the discussion had been amicable and the two men had even bet each other a beer over the result of the England-US World Cup encounter . The prime minister has been under intense pressure from senior figures in his own party and parts of the press to stand up for his country and defend the British-based company . Boris Johnson , the London mayor , was among those who complained that the tone of the attacks on BP were `` anti-British '' . Cameron had resisted calls to respond to the attacks , instead saying he understood Obama 's anger and was `` frustrated and concerned about the environmental damage caused by the leak '' . One Tory backbencher , Douglas Carswell , said there had been an act of `` environmental vandalism '' and now was not the time to `` wrap ourselves in the flag '' . Eleven men were killed following an explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig . Scientists have said the amount of oil gushing out of the well is far higher than previously estimated . The US Geological Survey has calculated that as many as 40,000 barrels a day could have been escaping before containment efforts were put in place . Obama , also under political pressure , reacted furiously and insisted he would have fired BP 's chief executive had he employed him . Tony Hayward was criticised for saying the leak was `` relatively tiny '' compared to the size of the ocean . BP shares have fallen by 40 % since the explosion and could be hit again if the company decides to suspend its quarterly dividend payout . The company is the biggest dividend-payer in the UK and has been expected to pay more than # 7bn over the year . Private companies , councils and public bodies have invested hundreds of billions of pounds of their pension funds into the company because it is normally considered a safe bet . The company reiterated yesterday that no decision had been made on the dividend . Various options will be discussed at a board meeting tomorrow . Ed Miliband , the Labor leadership candidate and shadow climate change secretary , said the lesson was that the world had to be serious about weaning itself off a chronic dependence on oil . The environmental group Greenpeace had called on local authorities to reconsider the heavy reliance of their pension funds on BP in the months leading up the accident . They argued it was wrong to invest public money in the company because of its involvement in risky projects . One of the councils that had invested most in the company was West Yorkshire , which had ploughed in 3.35 % , or # 197m , of its pension fund . Charlie Kronick , senior climate advisor for Greenpeace , said the lessons of the Gulf spill were that `` chasing the last drops of oil '' carried huge risks and the likelihood of accidents and unreliable dividends was likely to rise . But Ros Altmann , an expert on pensions policy , pointed out that all investments carried risks . `` If you do n't want your pension to be at risk of a BP-style or bank-style disaster , buy gilts . You have to take some risks to make some returns , '' she said .

In the US , it has more than the loss of human life , livelihoods and tourism to answer for . And so do the government inspectors who allowed the corporation to put profit before safety . If the criminal investigation of BP and those who signed off on the drill-site inspection sheets and safety assurances shows wilful fraud and deception , dereliction of duty , bribes or who knows what else , there is one additional set of criminal charges that should be added to the list : cruelty to animals . For this is the largest case of cruelty to animals in US history . There is no shortage of photographs of the animals that have died and are still dying slowly , painfully , drenched in oil . It is hard for anyone to see the gulls and pelicans , blinking up through a thick coat of muck that prevents them from flying , eating , taking a drink of water or escaping the burning heat along the Gulf coast . It is even too much to come across video that shows a huge rubber-gloved hand gently plucking a tiny crab out of a puddle of black glop . Only the outline of body tells you what it is , although its struggles tell you it is still alive . For most of the animals , any help is too late . It is suspected that even if wildlife rescuers contain a bird in time , before much oil damage has been done , the terror of being handled by a predator , of being force-fed , doused , scrubbed and rescrubbed , is too much for their pounding hearts to endure . Even if they survive the trauma of being cleaned and re-cleaned , most will likely die after their release . One also has to ask : `` Where can they be released ? '' Many birds mate for life ; others are lost without their flocks . Their nesting and feeding grounds now lie under the oil slick , their friends and family are dead or dying . What is there for them to return to ? And what of the turtles , dolphins and , dare I write it , the whales ? Cetacean experts do not expect whales to totally escape this slick . Once killed for their oil , will they now be killed by ours ? Whether or not BP is charged with cruelty , there are many things that we can do other than just pointing a finger . Some suggestions are to provide less support to oil companies by consuming less oil , to buy fewer plastic goods -LRB- the beaches of Hawaiian atolls are inches deep in discarded plastic that floats in from all over the world -RRB- , and to follow recommendations issued by the UN this month by going vegan to save the waterways , forests and ozone layer . Paul McCartney 's Meat-Free Monday project is getting institutions and individuals to look at the environmental devastation caused by factory farming and to do something about it by reducing meat consumption . In taking responsibility , our new government would do well to announce that we , too , are to embrace at least that one baby step . BP and the US government can never truly make amends with cash payouts . How do you `` make it up '' to those suffering and dying in agony out there at this very moment ? But , before we look away from the photographs of the umpteenth oil-coated heron , let 's do something positive and make some personal choices ourselves so that none of the oil companies can claim consumer demand as a reason for misbehaving . It 's just a thought . Time for a ban .

Nansen Saleri , a Gulf drilling expert , said he hoped BP would meet its August timetable for capping the blown-out well , but made it clear success was not certain . `` I know it is a frightening assessment but everyone should be prepared for a worst-case scenario , and that could mean a Christmas timeframe , '' said Saleri , chief executive of the consultancy group Quantum Reservoir Impact . `` The probable outcome is much better but the technological challenges are enormous . '' The futures of BP and of wildlife around the Gulf of Mexico are largely dependent on the rapid success of two `` relief '' wells that are being drilled in an attempt to halt anywhere between 20,000 and 40,000 barrels of oil a day that is flowing out of the stricken Macondo subsea hole . Saleri , who dealt personally with four blowouts during a career with Saudi Aramco and Chevron , said the BP fire and spill was the worst he had seen . He believes it may cause more damage than the Ixtoc I blowout 30 years ago , which is regarded as the most damaging of its kind . BP faced renewed pressure to do more to contain the Gulf of Mexico spill as the US and Britain played down diplomatic tensions over the crisis . The British foreign secretary , William Hague , said relations between the US and UK were `` outstanding at every level '' . He said it was up to BP under pressure in the US to suspend its dividend to help pay for damage to decide on its payout to shareholders . David Cameron and Barack Obama talked at the weekend , when Cameron expressed his sadness at the `` human and environmental catastrophe '' . Tony Hayward , the BP chief executive , will be grilled about the disaster in the US on Thursday when he appears before a special Senate hearing . On Wednesday , Hayward and the BP chairman , Carl-Henric Svanberg , will meet the president at the White House to explain BP 's response . According to reports , Obama will tell the pair he wants BP to establish a special account to meet damage claims by individuals and businesses hurt by the spill . The prospect of a lengthy timescale to cap the well reinforces the views of Carlos Morales , the head of exploration at Petr leos Mexicanos -LRB- Pemex -RRB- . The company was the operator of the Ixtoc I well in 1979 , when 3.3 m gallons of oil spilled into the Gulf . It took nearly 10 months to bring the blowout under control . Morales is now sharing technical information with BP in an attempt to help it block the Macondo leak . He has warned it could take `` four to five months '' for a relief well to cap the spill . Hurricanes also pose a problem . The hurricane season in the Gulf began this month , and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted it will be `` active to very active '' , with up to 23 named storms and up to 14 hurricanes on the way . Saleri said a bad storm could `` really complicate '' the environmental impact of spilled oil and delay relief drilling by two weeks every time a hurricane strikes . BP is also aware that the relief wells could be as unstable as the original one . Experts admit no one can rule out another blowout such as the one that sent the original rig , Horizon Explorer , to the bottom of the ocean . The British company has warned in a regulatory filing that a blowout on one of the relief wells could release a further 240,000 barrels of oil a day , although Hayward has since discounted the chances of this . `` The relief wells ultimately will be successful , '' he said .

Photograph : Larry Downing\\/Reuters Barack Obama flies into the Gulf tomorrow to try to take charge of an environmental disaster that is spreading beyond human control , with a stinking tide of oil from BP 's ruptured well now advancing on the white sand beaches of Alabama and Florida . Obama 's visit is his fourth since the gusher began , but the first so far to Mississippi , Albama , and Florida , which are now joining Louisiana on the frontline of the spill . Several miles of Alabama 's beaches were splattered with a thick sludge of oil at the weekend , with a slick now three or four miles off the Florida resort of Pensacola . Two barrier islands off Mississippi were also covered in oil . In Panama City , Florida , 190 miles from the ruptured well , a steel tank was discovered , oozing oil , that appeared to come from the sunken Deepwater Horizon rig . Obama 's two-day visit is the latest attempt by the White House to assert the president 's mastery over the spill crisis a difficult case to make given that BP and his administration admit the oil will continue to spew until at least August . He also has a tricky task of balancing public pressure to get tough on BP with economic and diplomatic concerns . That task will be put to the test on his return from the Gulf with a television address from the Oval Office on Tuesday night , and a meeting with BP 's chairman , Carl-Henric Svanberg , on Wednesday . At Alabama 's Orange Beach , at the western edge of a stretch of highrise hotels and condominiums that some call the Redneck Riviera , the oil was washing up in thick lumps faster than the hundreds of cleanup workers could shovel it up . `` This absolutely sucks , '' said Carolyn Kerin , coming off the beach with her three children . Two red flags were flying , indicating that swimmers would face fines and penalties not that Kerin would let her children in the water anyway . `` Ewww , '' she said . Was she impressed with Obama 's handling of the crisis so far ? `` I do n't think he did everything he could do . I think he was way too slow to act like he was serious . '' Further down the beach , opinion was divided . A man held up a sign for TV cameras reading : `` We 've been BPeed on . '' Overhead , a propeller plane flew a banner reading : `` Look Obama 54 days and still nothing . '' The summer holidays have just started here and normally the beaches would be a crush of umbrellas and tanned bodies , with traffic jams stretching for miles . But this weekend , the car parks were packed with pickup trucks and tractors from the cleanup crews . The sands were mainly empty , barring the workers in their rubber boots and gloves shovelling up the clumps of oil that washed up to 3.5 metres -LRB- 12ft -RRB- up the beach , and dumping the stuff in plastic rubbish bags . But the oil was landing ashore as fast as they could clean . A few workers admitted they had cleaned the exact same patch of sand earlier in the day . `` It is a liquid and it is very difficult to pick it up mechanically and pick it up physically , '' Alabama 's governor , Bob Riley , told CBS television today . `` We are trying to find something to coagulate it today so we can pick it up . '' Others also had problems to attend to . At 3pm yesterday , Judy Robertson was so jittery , walking up to each new arrival to ask if they were with the wedding party she was organising . The event planner has had three brides cancel and that was before any of the oil reached the beach . Now she said she was expecting a wave of lost bookings . Looking down the beach at a tractor pulling bundled up bags , she said : `` My grandkids are not going to know what a beach is if it continues like this . We are not going to be able to swim here . It 's going to destroy our economy . '' Robertson , like many of the people in this solidly Republican part of the country , was never a supporter of Obama . `` To me he 's not presidential material , '' she said . Obama 's earlier attempts to show his control over events , including the threat to `` kick ass '' , may have made Robertson dislike him even more . `` That 's what teenagers say . It 's not official . He talks like he 's just some worker on a beach , '' she said . Striking the right balance will be a difficult challenge for Obama during his visit . This was hostile territory even before the oil spill . On the ground a lot of people accuse their fellow Americans of rushing to New York 's aid after 9\\/11 while ignoring hurricane Katrina and this latest tragedy to befall the Gulf . `` It 's like we are Haiti , '' said one popular US radio host . BP is also less than willing to act as Obama 's fall guy . As preparations got underway for the White House visit the oil company was moving to mollify local opinion , with BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , appearing in local TV adverts to offer a personal apology for the spill . `` The gulf spill is a tragedy that never should have happened , '' he said . `` We will get this done . We will make it right . '' The governors of Mississippi and Alabama want reassurances that Obama will continue to support offshore oil drilling , and are pressing him to end his six-month moratorium on new projects . Florida 's governor , however , wants the president to introduce an outright ban . But all three want assurances from Obama that BP will make good on its promise to pay for the spill cleanup and any economic losses . Such fears have heightened in recent days , with Louisiana 's treasurer warning that BP could face bankruptcy . The governors are also trying to stave off the collapse of their tourist industries . `` Most of the experience of coming to the Gulf coast is still as great as it 's ever been , '' Riley said . `` Rent a condo , play golf . '' Or take souvenirs of the spill . At Orange Beach , a few people came with cameras to take snaps of the sludge . Kevin Kaullen , an environmental engineer from near San Diego , California , arrived with battles to take samples of the water . Otherwise the idea of helping Alabamans out by taking an eco-disaster holiday was not finding many takers , even among neighbouring Louisianans , who are going through their own economic pain owing to the spill . On a local talk radio station , a host mused about how much of a discount on a condo it would take to make a beach holiday without an actual beach experience an attractive proposition . `` A 40 % discount ? '' `` I do n't think I would go for 40 % . It would have to be at least 60 .

It said the total bill had jumped by $ 350m in the last week , including payments of $ 25m each to the states of Florida , Alabama and Mississippi to help them fight the environmental damage of the disaster . About 51,000 compensation claims have been submitted , of which 26,500 have been paid . The oil multinational admitted , though , that it was `` too early to quantify other potential costs and liabilities associated with the incident '' . BP 's board of directors will meet today to discuss whether to bow to criticism and suspend its dividend payment for the current financial quarter . Barack Obama continued to pile pressure on the company over the weekend , calling for funds to be placed into an escrow account , where they would be ringfenced and used to pay compensation to those affected by the spill . Obama will visit the Gulf region today , his fourth trip to the region , in an effort to persuade the American people that he has a grip on the catastrophe . On Wednesday he will meet BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , in what may be a tense encounter - Obama recently said he would have sacked Hayward . But the real drama will come on Thursday , when Hayward appears at a congressional hearing . He has been summoned by the House energy and commerce sub-committee to answer questions about the Deepwater Horizon explosion . Shares in BP fell by 2 % this morning to 384p despite the phone call on Saturday between David Cameron and Obama , which had eased fears that BP was becoming a target for anti-British sentiment . Downing Street said Obama had insisted he had no desire to damage the value of BP . BP also reported that it had now collected about 127,000 barrels of oil since fitting a container on to the wellhead 10 days ago . This oil has been syphoned up to the surface into a tanker , rather than being released into the ocean . But it only represents a fraction of the total leak , which is now estimated to be as much as 40,000 barrels a day . The containment system will be modified within the next few days , which should increase the amount of oil that can be collected .

Photograph : Mandel Ngan\\/AFP\\/Getty Images BP is facing a bill of up to $ 34bn from the Gulf of Mexico disaster after US senators demanded the oil company deposited $ 20bn into a ring-fenced account to meet escalating compensation costs . The sum dwarfs many analysts ' previous estimates , shared by BP , that put the cost of the clean-up effort and payment of damages to affected communities , such as fishermen , closer to a total of $ 5bn . Shares in BP nose-dived by more than 9 % today as investors took fright at the demand by the 54 Democratic senators , who represent a majority in the US upper house . The company is now worth almost half what it was before the accident of just under two months ago . BP already faces up to $ 14bn in civil penalties , payable under US environmental law , assuming the leak is plugged in August . These punitive damages are directly linked to the size of the spill already estimated at being up to eight times worse than the Exxon Valdez disaster in 1989 with BP liable for up to $ 4,300 for each barrel-worth spilt . Senate leaders insisted the $ 20bn ring-fenced account should be exclusively for `` payment of economic damages and clean-up costs '' and should not be seen as a cap on BP 's other legal liabilities . With punitive damages pending too , the theoretical total of $ 34bn is equivalent to more than half the corporation tax paid by all British companies last year . Tony Hayward , chief executive of BP , and other directors of the company , will meet Barack Obama at the White House on Wednesday prepared to offer concessions in the hope of taking the sting out of mounting political attacks on the company . BP will be in `` listening mode '' , willing to cut its next dividend , worth about $ 2.5 bn , possibly paying the cash into the clean-up fund . It will also reiterate its commitment to paying all legitimate claims arising from the disaster . But the company does not believe that the demand by the senators to stump up $ 20bn is justified . Executives were also alarmed by the White House 's insistence last week that BP must pay the wages of rig workers laid off by other firms because of the six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling in the gulf . If pursued , the company fears it would be exposed to potentially limitless claims from anyone affected by the disaster , which would eventually bankrupt the company . The company hopes that President Obama 's statement , following the meeting with BP , will draw back from the demand . Hayward , who was in Houston today overseeing the spill response , hosted a conference call with his board to discuss BP 's next move . The company had indicated that it would wait as usual until close to its next results announcement , on 27 July , to decide whether or not to pay its next quarterly dividend . But it is now set to announce its intentions sooner , perhaps as early as Thursday . It is understood BP could use the dividend as a bargaining chip in its talks with the White House . Obama today risked the wrath of families of 9\\/11 victims by comparing the gulf spill to the 2001 terrorist attacks , as pressure intensified on the White House to show greater urgency over the crisis . Ahead of a trip to Louisiana and a televised address to the nation tomorrow , Obama said the spill , the worst environmental disaster in US history , would , like the 2001 terror plots , continue to influence the country for decades to come . Some people who lost relatives in the 9\\/11 attacks rejected the comparison . `` I think he 's off-base , '' said Jim Riches , a former New York fire department deputy chief , whose son died at the World Trade Centre . `` These were 9\\/11 murders not something caused by people trying to make money .

What about our accents ? Our lovely British accents ? Thanks to the BP link , they 've been destroyed too . Do n't know about you , but whenever I 'm around Americans , I tend to exaggerate my Britishness in a pathetic bid to win their approval . Those days are gone . The first time I visited the US , I ran into trouble at immigration . Half the group I was traveling with decided to get drunk on the plane , which probably would 've been fine with all the other passengers if it had n't been for the unrelenting cackling and yelping and removal of trousers . I was fairly drunk too , incidentally , but only because I was so terrified of flying I 'd decided to blot out the whole of reality by glugging myself into an inflight coma . From my slumbering perspective the flight was a warm 15-minute snooze . To the other passengers it must 've felt like a 30-year sentence in baboon prison . Upon arrival , we were identified as troublemakers and hauled off one-by-one for a comprehensive bothering . Instantly I realized my only hope of avoiding instant deportation was to behave like a minor royal not an aloof , chilly posho , but a genial gosh-what-a-wonderful-country-you-have Hugh Grant-type , one who smiles a lot while using slightly formal language . I apologised profusely by saying , `` I apologise profusely . '' The officer started out prickly one of his opening gambits was , `` You could be spending the night in jail , wiseguy '' , which simultaneously impressed and scared me but several minutes of profuse apologies and crikey-I 'm - sorry delivered in an embellished British accent appeared to disarm him , and I was released without being subjected to gunfire . That 's my recollection , anyway . Perhaps he just got bored with watching me grovel . But from that point on , my dial was set to 150 % British for the duration . I said `` Good day '' to receptionists and `` I beg your pardon '' to waiters . At one point I think I even said `` Toodle pip '' to a cabbie . Incredibly , rather than calling me a dick , they said they loved my accent . The US was a magic country where strangers liked me on the strength of my voice alone , unlike cold anonymous London where , rather than break their stride , pedestrians would blankly step on your face if you were dying on the pavement , quietly tutting at the blood on their shoes . On a subsequent trip I discovered mockney was just as useful , and deliberately roughed my accent down in gas stations or bars , saying `` blimey '' and `` bloke '' and `` bleedin ' ` ell '' , even if I was only asking the way to the toilet -LRB- sorry , `` bog '' -RRB- . This was even more popular than my Little Lord Fauntleroy act . Thank God I ca n't do a Liverpudlian accent . I 'd probably have adopted a Beatles persona in record shops . But now , as a company with the word `` British '' in its name pisses apocalyptic quantities of oil into the ocean , and CEO Tony Hayward pops up on the news to make tactless statements in a British accent , anglophilia is shrivelling . Things must be bad when gimpy Cameron has to reassure us that BP wiping its arse on the Gulf of Mexico wo n't disturb the `` special relationship '' between the US and the UK . Of course it will . Never mind that BP is an international company . Never mind that 39 % of its shares are held in the US , that half its directors are American . It 's got the word British in the title , and that 'll do . It genuinely feels like our fault . Like you , I 've never supervised the offshore drilling policy of a major oil company , but I ca n't help feeling responsible . It 's like watching a news report in which someone with your surname has been caught having sex with a hollowed-out yam . The disgrace is shared , however irrationally . And to be honest , the Americans are thus far admirably restrained about the whole thing . If a company called Texan Gloop belched a carpet of black gunk over Norfolk , we 'd be surrounding the US embassy and burning sarcastic effigies of Boss Hogg within minutes . And that 's just Norfolk : flat earth and windmills . Having vandalised Louisiana and laminated thousands of pelicans , the BP spill now threatens to disfigure the Miami coastline , corrupting its relentlessly cheery blue-and-yellow color scheme with a sea of rainbow black . Congratulations , people of Britain . Even though , strictly speaking , it is n't your fault . Clearly a rebrand is in order if we 're to maintain any national pride whatsoever . Trouble is , BP 's already had one : 10 years ago it changed its name from British Petroleum to BP following a merger with a US oil company . Since that 's not enough to dissociate it from Britain , Britain itself will have to change its name . It 'll still need to feel quintessentially British , mind . For the tourists , like . How about London Kingdom ? Let 's face it : to recoup our cultural value , it 's either that or we all head over there and start cleaning the mess up ourselves , while muttering `` blimey '' and `` gosh '' and doing our best to be charming . If you 've got a fly-drive holiday booked , start practising that Hugh Grant act now . Chances are you 'll need it .

'' Obama said he could not predict whether the US would make a complete transition from an oil-based economy within his lifetime . `` Now is the time for us to start making that transition and investing in a new way of doing business when it comes to energy , '' he said . `` I have no idea what new energy sources are going to be available , what technologies might drive down the price of renewable energies .

Photograph : Dave Martin\\/AP As names go , the First Exploitation Company sounds like an inspired slight dreamed up by an angry anti- oil campaigner . In fact , it was the original title , coined in 1903 , of the troubled company we now know as BP . But then , public relations have never been its strong point . Over the course of a century BP , in its various guises , has managed to outrage everyone from revolutionary nationalist leaders in the Middle East to Britain 's supposedly closest ally . Now Barack Obama has ensured that BP is Public Enemy No 1 in the United States -LRB- tonight , he will make his first address to the nation direct from the White House to stress the point -RRB- . In the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon disaster , BP is being freely compared in the US to those poster boys of corporate malfeasance , Enron and Worldcom . Beleaguered chief-executive Tony Hayward may not be Bernie Madoff , but hate mail and threatening phone calls have been directed at him and his family . Hayward is now reportedly undergoing training in front of a so-called `` murder board '' of legal experts to prepare him for the aggressive questioning he will face from the Congressional Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee in Washington on Thursday . BP 's share price is tumbling , as its expected liabilities from the spill estimated at anywhere up to $ 40bn -LRB- # 27bn -RRB- climb so high that the financial markets are giving the company 's debt a `` junk '' rating . Speculation over BP 's future has ranged from filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to a possible takeover by one of its giant rivals , Exxon Mobil or Chevron . BP has come close to collapse before , and is a repeat offender in the US after earlier major accidents in Texas and Alaska . Internal company documents published last week by news website ProPublica revealed high-level concern that safety and environmental policies were being ignored . A BP report into the 2005 Texas City disaster , when a massive explosion at a refinery killed 15 workers , concluded there had been `` apparent complacency toward serious safety risk '' . But as well as accidents , an absence of diplomacy also dogs BP 's history . The company started out as a money-making scheme for William Knox D'Arcy a man who , according to BP 's own account , already `` led the self-indulgent life of a rich gentleman '' . He sought oil in Persia , modern-day Iran , helping to create many profound faultlines in the geopolitics of oil that we still live with today . The company 's first big break came when Winston Churchill , as first lord of the admiralty , persuaded the British navy to switch from coal to oil for its fuel , and chose what was by then known as Anglo-Persian Oil Company because he could not be sure of its foreign competitor , Royal Dutch Shell . -LRB- Current baiting of BP in the US about its British identity throws up an ironic footnote from this period : the name British Petroleum actually came from a German oil company working in Britain , which was expropriated during the first world war and resold . -RRB- From the outset , the company has never been slow to play hardball . In the early 1920s , it pushed its Persian refinery at Abadan too hard . The result was strikes by local workers and a crippling fire that slashed production . The British government was forced to bail the company out . After the second world war and still puffed with colonial arrogance , the company came up against a new and formidable force in Iran . Mohammad Mossadegh , son of a rich land-owning family , was a colorful character too openly emotional for British tastes , and seriously underestimated as a result . Compared with oil deals elsewhere in the region , Mossadegh thought Iran was being ripped-off . On becoming prime minister in April 1951 , he complained to US president Harry Truman that Iran `` was being ruined by the political intrigue of the British government and BP '' , and immediately nationalised his country 's oil industry . The international response was a boycott of Iran . But that was n't enough ; after prime minister Churchill overruled his ill foreign secretary Anthony Eden in 1953 , approval was given for a CIA-organised and funded coup against Mossadegh . BP is rather shy about publicising these events . In more than 1,700 pages of the official company history , the coup is described in just two sentences one of which merely mentions that the events can be read about elsewhere . The memory of such troubling events drove the newly anointed British Petroleum Company to diversify throughout the second half of the 20th century , dramatically increasing its oil extraction from Kuwait , Qatar and Iraq . It looked for oil in Malta , Papua New Guinea and Australia . It searched in Alaska , the Caribbean and the Rocky Mountains with little success , but had more luck in Nigeria and beneath the sands of Libya . In 1965 , it became the first company to strike oil in the North Sea . The discovery five years later of the Forties oilfield however the largest in the North Sea was triggered by an almost Monty Pythonesque fit of pique on the part of a BP company executive . Harry Warman thought the location for exploratory drilling , McNutt 's Half Dome , had a silly name and was a waste of time . He demanded they relocate , and BP got lucky striking enough oil to produce ridiculous riches , for a generation at least . This era of the oil industry , however , would live fast and die young : just over two decades later , in 1999 , UK oil production peaked , then began to decline at the rate of around 7 % per year . So the now multinational BP decided to try to become more than just a company that made a great deal of money by helping to liquidate the planet 's natural resources . It went for a makeover , promising it would go `` Beyond Petroleum '' in the new millennium . The PR company Ogilvy Public Relations Worldwide wrote admiringly about how `` the newly rebranded , global BP sought to position itself as transcending the oil sector '' . The company promised to go green and `` think outside the barrel '' . Ten years on , however , its executives are more likely to be found crying at the bottom of one . Far from going Beyond Petroleum , BP remains a company mired in the thick of it . Everywhere in this story , there is the whiff of the end of empire . But the last to acknowledge it are often those on the inside looking out . BP can either wither on the vine as an oil company or , this time , genuinely re-invent itself . For the imminent decline of global oil production is likely to make the recent banking crisis feel like an old-style Thanksgiving party . The only thing preventing that has been the oil industry 's blas reassurance that it could use enhanced techniques to safely exploit `` marginal '' fields such as where the Deepwater Horizon ultra-deepwater rig had been working . Those reassurances are now a giant stain on America 's Gulf coast . How we handle our declining global oil resources is , of course , a question of collective survival . Everything from our food and transport systems to the toothbrushes we use each morning depend on the sticky black stuff . And then there is the fact that , in the first quarter of 2010 , # 1 in every # 4 of dividends paid to UK shareholders came from just one sector oil and gas . BP alone accounts for about 12 % , or # 1 in every # 8 , of British pension payments . Our future has become hard-wired to BP 's . The problem is that Tony Hayward , apart from regularly saying the wrong thing at the wrong time , has turned his back on the green energy revolution . In a presentation he gave in 2008 , and acquired by Greenpeace , he revealed that the company allocated 93 % -LRB- $ 20bn -RRB- of its total investment fund for 2008 to the development and extraction of oil , gas and other fossil fuels . Solar power was allocated just 1.39 % -LRB- $ 0.3 bn -RRB- . The company 's own greenhouse gas emissions at that stage were about the same as the whole of Portugal . In June 2009 , it closed the London HQ of BP Alternative Energy , its renewables operation . Solar plants in the US and Spain were also closed , and it pulled out of virtually all wind power initiatives outside of the US . For the sake of a liveable environment and stable , flourishing economy , we now need a rapid transition away from our dependence on oil . This is happening already at a local level in Britain , with the flowering of the transition town movement , built around fossil fuel `` descent paths '' . And at a national and international level , proposals such as the green new deal aimed at the low-carbon re-engineering of everything from energy infrastructure to housing , transport and agriculture create vast opportunities for companies and governments that have the wit to see that change is necessary , inevitable and desirable . Should they fail this challenge , however , then the legacy of the First Exploitation Company seems certain to be environmental degradation and economic instability for generations to come .

Photograph : Christopher Furlong\\/Getty Images The Gulf of Mexico disaster was always going to hit BP in the pocket . But as the costs of the spill keep rising , it could end up finishing off the British oil giant . Until now , the City has fretted over the fate of BP 's dividend , supposed to be $ 10bn , due this year . Tony Hayward , BP 's chief executive , has stuck to the line that the company is able to meet all its obligations to its shareholders and to the clean-up effort . Even last week , the question had been not whether BP had deep enough pockets to keep making the dividend payouts , but whether it could afford to politically . But as the size and scope of BP 's liabilities grow with each passing the day , it is now no longer a question of whether BP can or should pay its dividend . It is increasingly whether it can survive . On Sunday , 54 Democratic senators demanded that BP pay $ 20bn into a ring-fenced account to make sure it met all its obligations for the clean-up and damages . The figure stunned the company , which backs most analysts ' estimates that these costs are likely to be nearer to $ 5bn . The point is , unlike with the financial crisis two years ago , there is not going to be a bail-out for BP . As Barack Obama has made clear , US taxpayers will not pay for the clean-up or compensation . Fund managers are already speculating that BP could attempt to draw a line under its liabilities by hiving off its US business in an attempt to save the rest of the group . Yesterday , the US investment bank Citigroup even published research in response to `` inquiries from clients '' over how plausible such a restructuring would be . The note concludes that it would not be easy , and BP insists that it is not planning such a move anyway . But the fear that the company may cut and run whether justified or not goes some way to explaining the demand that it deposits such a large amount into a ring-fenced account . The thing is , no one not BP , not the US senators knows how much this will end up costing the company . The fishing industry in the Gulf brings in $ 660m revenue each year . This pales into insignificance compared to the $ 65bn-a-year tourist industry in Florida , which has already been hit as oil pollutes its beaches , leaving them deserted . Tourism and fishing could suffer for years . BP says nothing has changed to justify a $ 20bn bill , but this is disingenuous . In less than a month , the size of the size has gone from 5,000 barrels per day to between 20,000 and 40,000 barrels . If BP estimated that the clean-up and damages would cost around $ 5bn , but the size of the spill has at least quadrupled , then the $ 20bn demanded by the US senators does not look unreasonable . This $ 20bn does not include civil penalties , where BP is liable for up to $ 4,300 for every barrel spilt if it is found to have acted negligently . If 40,000 barrels per day keeps flowing until August , when a relief well is hopefully completed plugging the leak for good , and BP does not improve on its current collection rate , this could add a further $ 14bn to the bill . In some respects , the estimates by senators , analysts and BP are irrelevant . Like the Deepwater Horizon oil rig , the US and BP are in unchartered territory . As Hayward recently remarked , the US is a world-leader in pursuing damages . But it is not in Obama 's interests for the company to go bust ; he will want it to remain a cash cow not for its shareholders , but to make good the damage which has been done however much or however long it takes .

Photograph : Jonathan Ernst\\/Reuters 10am ET : We 're live at the House of Representatives ' energy and environment subcommittee on Capitol Hill , where this morning top executives from oil companies are appearing to discuss the subject of , well , supposedly America 's energy future but in fact will be largely about the BP oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico . Just to make sure that the five executive are n't too comfortable today , the committee is tastefully showing a giant video screen with the famous live feed from the Deepwater Horizon 's riser gushing oil into the Gulf of Mexico . Marvin Odum , president , Shell Oil company of America First up , the congress members will read their opening statements . 10.20 am ET : Chairman of the committee , Ed Markey of Massachusetts , is pulling no punches in his opening statement . It 's not going to be a fun day for these oil men . Markey has gone through the response plans submitted by the oil companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico . And he 's savage : `` The plans cite identical response capabilities and tout identical ineffective equipment . In some cases , they use the exact same words . '' In particular , Markey picks out the references to protecting walruses in the response plans . Walruses `` have not called the Gulf of Mexico home for three million years , '' Markey notes , dripping with sarcasm . He also points out that two other plans are so close to BP 's failed blueprint that they list a phone number for the same long-dead expert . Oh hey , Republican committee member Joe Barton , of Texas , attacks President Obama for criticising BP 's efforts to stop the spill and clean up the oil . Because , you know , BP really wants to fix this and we should n't be rude to them . 10.30 am ET : Sad news : Tony Hayward , BP 's chief executive , will not grace Congress with his presence today . He 's busy cleaning walruses or something . Instead , the lucky BP exec who drew the short straw is Lamar McKay , the president and chairman of BP America . And he looks thrilled to be here . 10.47 am ET : Fancy that , Republican congressman Roy Blunt repeatedly refers to BP as `` British Petroleum '' during his statement . Unrelated fact : Roy Blunt is running for a Senate seat in Missouri . 11am ET : The executives are reading through their prepared statements to the committee . You can find all the statements , from oil execs and the politicians , here . 11.13 am ET : Lamar McKay , the chief executive of BP America , is reading his statement : Before addressing the main topic of today 's hearing , I would like to reiterate the profound sorrow and deep regret that all of us at BP feel for the loss of life and the oil spill resulting from the explosion and fire aboard the Transocean Deepwater Horizon rig on April 20 . This is very personal , both to me and to BP . I am from Mississippi , and spent summers on the Gulf Coast growing up . I have many relatives and friends in the area . The Gulf Coast states have hosted BP and its heritage companies for decades . Thousands of our employees , contractors and their families call the Gulf Coast states home . I would like to make one thing very clear : BP will not rest until the well is under control and we discover what happened and why , in order to ensure that it never happens again . As a responsible party under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 , we will carry out our responsibilities to mitigate the environmental and economic impact of this incident . As for the rest of his statement , in summary : we need to keep drilling for oil but we also do other stuff you know . Like natural gas and ... all sorts really . -LRB- Note McKay 's reference to the `` Transocean Deepwater Horizon rig '' right there . 11.35 am ET : Hooray , the reading out of statements ends , and questioning and the fun begins . Ed Markey 's back on , and now he 's showing slides comparing the covers of oil spill response plan : `` The pictures are the same ! All that has changed is the color . '' Lots of shuffling of feet amongst the oil execs , who probably have n't felt this way since they were six years old . And Markey 's still going on about the Gulf of Mexico 's phantom walruses , which appeared in BP 's response plan but not , sadly , in the Gulf itself . `` There are not any walruses in the Gulf of Mexico , '' Markey points out , again , forcefully . `` It 's unfortunate that walruses were included , '' replies ExxonMobil 's chief executive Rex Tillerson . He looks like he means it and appears to avoid rolling his eyes . 11.45 am ET : Markey is in top form . Now he 's ribbing the companies for their cut-and-paste oil response plans again : `` The only technology you seem to be relying on is a Xerox machine , '' he says with grim humor . 11.50 pm ET : Markey is also hitting the oil execs for their inclusion , among their cutting and pasting , of an expert named Dr Peter Lutz , a professor of marine biology in Florida . BP listed Dr Lutz as a consultant in its 2009 disaster response plan and even included his contact details , including his phone number . Which is great , except that Dr Lutz inconveniently died . So he wo n't be answering the phone . -LRB- Maybe that explains why BP 's response has been so poor they are still waiting for Dr Lutz to get back to them ? -RRB- `` It seems to me when you included Dr Lutz 's phone number in teh plan , you have not taken the plan seriously , '' says Markey . Exxon 's Tillerson pulls on a suitably grave face in response , and intones that just because Dr Lutz 's happens to be dead , `` that does not mean the importance of his work died with him '' . Wow , that wins today 's award for chutzpah . Yes , while it 's true that Dr Lutz 's work lives on , his usefulness as a consultant is somewhat diminished by his death . Cue Monty Python Dead Parrot sketch . Noon ET : Now this is interesting : Rex Tillerson , chief executive of ExxonMobil , is subtly -LRB- and not very subtly -RRB- sticking the knife into BP 's back and twisting it . In summary , ExxonMobil would have done everything that BP did , except the opposite way around . Or , to put it another way , BP have been rubbish . `` Clearly there were some things going on at this well in the days and hours prior to the loss of control , '' Tillerson says , primly . I think the Twitter hashtag for that last answer from Tillerson would be #ExxondancingonBPsgrave Later , Henry Waxman , the chair of the full House energy and commerce committee , asked all the executives whether they thought BP made mistakes and what their companies would have done differently . Now you mention it , they do think BP may have made one or two minor horrendous errors . And they all would have done things differently . `` A number of the design standards that I would consider to be industry norms were not followed , '' says Tillerson , who clearly does n't believe in the adage about not kicking someone when they are down . In fact the Tillerson family motto seems to be : kick them harder . 12.15 pm ET : More bad news for the Obama administration : a new poll by the Associated Press finds that a majority of Americans disapprove of how President Obama has handled the Gulf oil disaster although far more blame BP . Some 52 % say they do n't approve of Obama 's handling of the spill , while 83 % disapprove of BP 's performance . The silver lining for Obama is that it does n't seem to have affected his overall job performance rating it remains unchanged at 50 % . 12.30 pm ET : Often , committee hearings such as this produce a new hero for the American people . Today one man has stepped forward : John Shimkus , Republican of Illinois . `` I have 3,000 followers on Facebook ! '' -LRB- Actually you have friends on Facebook , you have followers on Twitter , but hey . -RRB- He 's asked them to submit questions for him to ask . This is the terrifying face of the future of politics . Sadly , none of the questions are from a Sarah P of Alaska . 12.36 pm ET : More competition for today 's chutzpah award , from Lamar McKay of BP America , in response to questioning about the inadequacy of BP 's response plan : `` I understand everyone 's frustration with how long this is taking , but the spill response has actually been pretty effective in terms of dealing with it underwater . It 's unfortunate we ca n't get it stopped at the source right now , we 're doing everything we can to do that . '' The technical term for such a statement in the oil industry is `` bollocks '' . Really , if McKay believes that to be true then BP 's senior management still have no grasp of the public anger towards them . To say that BP 's spill response `` has actually been pretty effective '' is a nonsense . Meanwhile , the excellent Kate Sheppard of Mother Jones is covering these hearings , and she 's got a piece up detailing how the oil executives have been careful to stress that Deepwater Horizon was an unfortunate one-off catastrophe -LRB- is n't that what everyone said about the first world war ? -RRB- and that drilling for oil needs to continue : The heads of four of the country 's largest oil companies told a House panel Tuesday morning that the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon and subsequent oil disaster was merely a fluke their companies operate safely and are adequately prepared to deal with any accidents that may occur . 12.54 pm ET : Representative Bart Stupak you may remember him from such healthcare debates as the Stupak amendment has been laying into the oil companies for their identikit disaster plans . Stupak 's opening statement this morning was interesting , you can read it right here , but he 's noticed something different about ExxonMobil 's plan : I have been examining the oil spill response plan of ExxonMobil , the largest oil company in the United States . This document is over 500 pages long . In many respects , it is virtually indistinguishable from BP 's response plan and the response plans of the other major companies . But there is one major difference between ExxonMobil 's plan and the other response plans : the section dealing with the media . BP , Shell , ConocoPhillips , and Chevron have plans with short media relations sections . ExxonMobil has an entire 40-page appendix devoted to how to respond to the press . The media section in the ExxonMobil plan directs public affairs personnel to `` maintain on camera skill proficiency . '' Also , they need to ship in some walruses to cover up that whole `` no walruses in the Gulf of Mexico '' snafu . 1.11 pm ET : Sorry for the delays to the liveblog , we had a software update going on that meant everything ground to a halt for a bit . So , like General Petraeus before another congressional committee today , let 's get back on our feet . 1.19 pm ET : Wannabe senator Roy Blunt of Missouri is quizzing BP over how much cash it has on hand to meet the billions of dollars worth of claims and costs it faces . Interesting question , since in his address this evening President Obama is expected to announce he wants to BP to deposit several billion to cover it . Lamar McKay of BP America says he believes the the company can pay up but he says that he ca n't say how much BP has available right now . Also , McKay says no decision has been made on whether the company will pay its annual dividend to shareholders anytime soon . That would be worth $ 10bn . Interesting : McKay says no one at BP has been sacked as a result of the disaster yet , although some staff members have been placed on `` administrative leave '' . That 's a good subject for further questioning . 1.29 pm ET : Democrat Jay Inslee from Washington observes that BP 's executive pay was $ 36m last year which is more than three times the company 's annual budget for research into how to reduce the risk of catastrophic blowouts . 1.45 pm ET : Just to catch up , let 's not forget turncoat-loser Parker Griffiths of Alabama , the Democratic party congressman who switched to the Republican party over healthcare reform , and then got dumped from a great height in the primaries by Alabama 's Republican voters . Griffiths thinks the treatment of the oil executives by the nasty politicians has been `` disrespectful '' in the extreme . Griffiths goes on to lecture his colleagues for their `` childlike , petulant , accusatory questioning . '' But since both parties hate Griffiths , no one cares what he thinks . 1.57 pm ET : Completely irrelevant , but does n't Lamar McKay of BP America look just like the vile Todd Packer from The Office -LRB- the US version -RRB- ? Thinly-related fact : Tony Hayward of BP was born in Slough , the site of the UK version of The Office . 2.06 pm ET : There was some strong stuff coming from Lois Capps , a Democrat from California , who had the cunning plan of making McKay of BP eat his own words . First , she brought up some previous testimony of McKay from last year , in which he confidently stated : `` Today 's off-shore oil-drilling technology bears about as much resemblance to what was available in the 1960s as a rotary dial telephone does to an iPhone . '' Capps then showed photos of the types of booms used to clean up the oil spills off Santa Barbara -LRB- her district -RRB- back in in 1969 and the booms now being used in the Gulf of Mexico . Suffice it to say they look very similar . She asks : What 's BP 's plan to clean up the inevitable accidents from your offshore rigs , the rest of them that are operating out there , which are drilling in even harsher and more difficult conditions ? What is it going to look like , 10 , 20 , or 40 years from now , when there 's another huge spill , to see booms being lined up in the defense of our coasts ? Is that what we 're going to see then ? We will still be relying on thousands of workers mopping up beaches by hand ? McKay chunters on about better sub-sea prevention but Capps cuts off him off abruptly to point out that she 's talking about the effects on the surface on the environment . 2.20 pm ET : Anthony Weiner of New York wants to discuss BP 's trustworthiness , or lack thereof . `` I do n't understand on any level why you guys should be in charge of anything . '' Good question , and one you should raise with President Obama , perhaps ? Weiner , though , has had enough : `` Why should there be any decision-making ability on your part at all here ? That 's one thing my Republican friends , who want to criticise the administration for not doing enough , maybe we agree on . Maybe we need to have BP involved a heck of a lot less , with anything to do with our environment , anything to do with our citizens . '' 2.23 pm ET : Well that takes the prize for most bizarre statement of the day the remarks by Republican congressman Joseph Cao of Louisiana , whose congressional district borders on the Gulf of Mexico , to BP 's Lamar McKay : `` In the Asian culture , we do things differently . During the samurai days , we just give you a knife and ask you to commit hara-kiri . '' Congressman Cao is Vietnamese-American . Cao 's colleague , the veteran Republican from Florida 's sixth district Cliff Stearns , was n't quite so dramatic . He merely told McKay : `` I think you should be resigning as the CEO of BP America . '' Which is pretty mild by comparison . But he got a round of applause . 2.39 pm ET : Chairman Markey brings this hearing-cum-root canal to a close , banging his gavel and declaring the Gulf oil spill to be `` the worst environmental disaster in our history '' . All in all , a hearing that produced heat rather than light , but that 's most often the case in these situations . What was interesting was seeing the other oil companies graciously allow BP to be hung out to dry , and declare that they would never have allowed such a thing to happen , other than when they were lamenting the awful luck and unfortunate , one in a million twist of fate that caused the spill . If I was a BP executive I 'd be tempted to send ExxonMobil a bouquet of dead flowers and a note saying `` Thanks for all your help , pal . '' But BP 's got bigger things to worry about .

Photograph : Jim Young\\/Reuters BP is being accused by a US congressional committee of ignoring warnings , violating its own industry guidelines , and choosing risky procedures in the hope of cutting costs and saving time in the days leading up to the catastrophic explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig . Tony Hayward , BP 's chief executive , was served notice on Monday by the committee on energy and commerce that it intends to subject him to the most rigorous inquisition the company has yet faced in the 56-day-old crisis . A letter from the committee 's chairman , Henry Waxman , said `` time after time , it appears BP made decisions that increased the risk of a blowout to save the company time or expense '' . Hayward 's hearing will take place on Thursday , towards the end of a crucial week in which the tensions between US politicians and BP are likely to escalate . Barack Obama will tonight make his first address to the American people from the Oval Office , underlining the scale of the catastrophe now unfolding in the Gulf of Mexico and vowing to hold BP to account for the environmental damage wrought by its eight-week-old oil spill . Obama is expected to use the speech to outline plans to force the firm to set up an independently monitored multibillion-dollar fund to compensate victims of the spill . He will also lay out a detailed timeline of how the worst of the calamity could be contained . Hours before the broadcast , the energy and environment sub-committee of the House of Representatives will call senior BP officials in front of it to answer questions on the company 's handling of the crisis . Then tomorrow , Obama will hold his first meeting with a team of top BP staff led by the chairman , Carl-Henric Svanberg , and expected to include Hayward who has so far avoided a face-to-face encounter with the president . But it will be the forensic questioning of Hayward in front of Thursday 's committee on energy and commerce upon which BP 's fate now potentially hangs . Waxman 's advance letter runs to 14 pages and contains damaging allegations gathered during previous hearings . Five days before the 20 April explosion , the letter contends , BP was warned by its own drilling engineer that this was a `` nightmare well '' . Yet the firm went on to make five crucial decisions that the committee alleges put profit before safety . BP , at this point , was up against the clock , attempting to complete drilling so that the Deepwater Horizon rig could be moved to another location , avoiding overrun costs . The five accusations levelled at BP by the committee are : cents That it adopted a cheap design for the well , choosing a single casing rather than a more sophisticated design , despite the fact that its own analysis found strongly in favor of the latter . `` The decision appears to have been made to save time and reduce costs , '' the letter says . cents BP went with the cheapest option of using just six `` centralisers '' , which hold the casing in the center of the borehole , despite being advised by its contractors Halliburton to use 21 . Halliburton warned that the well had a `` SEVERE gas flow problem '' and that using six centralisers would risk the success of the procedure . cents BP decided not to carry out an acoustic test designed to measure the efficacy of the cementing of the well to block off gas flows . The test would have cost $ 128,000 and taken an extra 12 hours . An independent engineer who gave evidence to the committee said it was `` unheard of '' not to perform the test and slammed the decision as being `` horribly negligent '' . cents BP failed to check the proper workings of the new well system by circulating drilling mud from its bottom to the surface . Halliburton suggested the lack of a full test was due to BP 's desire for speed . cents The firm did not install a critical piece of equipment that locks the wellhead and the casing at the level of the sea floor . The absence of the `` lockdown sleeve '' has been identified as one possible cause of the explosion . Waxman 's letter concludes that BP must answer to the committee for possible `` carelessness and complacency '' that `` inflicted a heavy toll on the Gulf , its inhabitants and the workers on the rig . The new offensive by Congress came as Obama began a two-day visit to the stricken region . After he had landed in Gulfport , Mississippi , he likened the environmental impact of the Deep Horizon explosion to the impact on the national psyche of 9\\/11 . In an interview with the website Politico , he said : `` In the same way that our view of our vulnerabilities and our foreign policy was shaped profoundly by 9\\/11 , I think this disaster is going to shape how we think about the environment and energy for many years to come . '' The comparison drew some angry responses from families of the victims of the 9\\/11 attacks . BP has now passed a 72-hour ultimatum set for it by the Obama administration to come up with a more focused plan for how to bring the spill under control . Worst-case scenarios , estimated by US government scientists , suggest that up to 40,000 barrels of oil could be spewing out into the Gulf each day , with only 15,000 barrels currently being collected by a cap placed over the wrecked well . The company has outlined a series of methods it intends to implement that it claims will see the amount of captured oil rise to up to 80,000 barrels a day by mid-July . The Democrat congressman is famous for in 1994 forcing chiefs of tobacco giants to swear under oath that nicotine was not addictive . He will seek the same killer punch against Tony Hayward on Thursday , when BP 's CEO appears before a panel of the House energy and commerce committee . Expect him to press Hayward hard on whether BP put profit before safety . With a long track record of holding power to account from the nuclear electricity industry to the US government over torture Markey has become a leading critic of BP 's handling of the Deepwater Horizon crisis . `` They are either incompetent or they are lying , '' he has said of BP chiefs . Today the Democratic congressman will call BP America 's president , Lamar McKay , as well as the bosses of rival oil companies in front of his House energy and environment sub-committee . Likely line of questioning : why BP 's estimates of the size of the spill have been so massively wide of the mark . Barack Obama 's press spokesman , who has been `` kicking ass '' on the president 's behalf , has been accused of whipping up anti-British feeling by referring to British Petroleum rather than BP , the firm 's rebranded name . He has also used such fruity language as : `` We will keep our boot on the throat of BP '' . Gibbs says the administration is just focused on what 's right . The US coastguard admiral who Obama put in charge of the clean-up operation last week issued BP with a 72-hour ultimatum to come up with solid plans on how to contain the leak . Allen has been careful in his criticisms of BP until now , saying it has generally been co-operative .

Weiss President Barack Obama has made four trips to visit gulf state communities affected by the BP disaster and now plans to give his first-ever Oval Office speech to the nation this Tuesday evening to address the issue . This manmade calamity threatens the nation 's economy , health , and environment . This is also a crucial moment in the BP catastrophe , which threatens to swamp his domestic agenda . But it also provides an opportunity for President Obama to demonstrate leadership by tackling all the aspects of this crisis , including taking charge of the clean up , getting more help from BP , providing long-term public health and economic recovery , and adopting an oil - use and pollution-reduction reform agenda to minimize the likelihood of another catastrophe . Americans are legitimately frustrated and furious about the oil disaster , which has gone on for 55 days and counting . The public has grave concerns about BP 's inability to stop or slow the gusher of oil contaminating the gulf . Opinion polls also show that respondents have an unfavorable view of the government 's handling of the disaster . This is undoubtedly due to the government 's inability to get BP to staunch the flood of oil , even though BP has far more advanced technology and oil blow-out experience than the federal government . President Obama must use his speech to make a compelling and passionate case for comprehensive clean-up measures as well as an oil reform program . This is essential to galvanize public demand for immediate steps to reduce damage from the disaster , as well as more active support for longer-term oil use and pollution reductions . The president should also announce dramatic actions to respond to the oil crisis in the gulf , in the following ways , some of which he has already begun : Take charge of the clean up : Appoint the remaining commissioners to the Bipartisan Demand more help from BP : Stop BP , Transocean , and Halliburton from spending money on their own or American Petroleum Institute lobbyists , ads , or campaign contributions , and instead dedicate all funds to clean up and compensation Provide health and economic aid to people in the gulf region : Establish a Gulf Recovery Fund , a nongovernmental , nonprofit corporation designed to oversee long-term economic recovery in the affected states Prevent future blowouts and disasters : Adopt most of the protective safeguards for deepwater rigs required by other nations Create a federal research program to develop more reliable `` fail safe '' leak prevention hardware and oil containment technologies Reduce oil use and pollution : Implement fuel economy standards and other measures to produce a Power cars with electricity by enacting the Invoke the Trade Expansion Act to levy a small fee on imported oil and use that revenue for public transit , high-speed rail , and other clean infrastructure Adopt a shrinking limit on global warming pollution from oil-based transportation fuels , coal-fired power plants , and other very large sources These measures should be promptly adopted by BP , the administration , or Congress . The president may lack authority to enforce some of the measures aimed at BP . These efforts will require presidential `` jaw boning '' to convince BP to comply , such as when President John F. Kennedy convinced the steel industry to reverse its inflationary price increases . When President Obama took office , he inherited major problems , including a plunging economy , major industries on the brink of collapse , and two wars . The BP oil disaster 15 months into his term was not of his making , either , but was the result of the Bush-Cheney policies to let big oil police itself . Despite the fact that the BP oil disaster is '' Cheney 's Katrina , '' President Obama made it clear that he will `` ultimately take responsibility for solving this crisis . I 'm the president and the buck stops with me . '' Tuesday 's nationwide address provides an opportunity for President Obama to do more than take responsibility . He must firmly put the government -- and not BP -- in charge of all aspects of clean up and recovery . Many in Congress would prefer that the president deal with immediate aspects of the disaster , but basically continue business as usual . But he should ignore the special interests and Washington conventional wisdom . President Obama must use this moment to rally Americans to support a sweeping oil reform agenda that permanently changes the way big oil does business . This means building public demand for standards and investments that deeply cut the $ 1 billion per day spent on foreign oil , ending tax loopholes for big oil companies , and beginning to crack down on global warming pollution . An oil reform agenda would put America back in charge of its energy future . President Obama must use his inspirational skills to rally support for a 21st century clean energy agenda . The fate of the gulf -- and the rest of the nation -- depends on his success .

Affected beaches have been closed for swimming . The US president is to give a televised address to the country tonight , his first from the Oval Office during his presidency , to reassure Americans that the government is in control of the crisis . Obama 's spokesman , Robert Gibbs , said the president was poised to seize the handling of damage claims from BP , if necessary . He would also use the speech to identify a person to lead the recovery effort and discuss reducing the US 's reliance on fossil fuels and imported oil . `` We have to get an independent claims process , '' Gibbs told American television news shows . `` I think everyone agrees that we have to get BP out of the claims processes and , as I said , make sure that fishermen , hotel owners have a fast , efficient and transparent claims process so that they 're getting their livelihoods replaced . '' Asked by Good Morning America what Obama would do if BP refused , Gibbs said : `` The president has the legal authority to compel them to do so , and if they do n't , he will . '' The news came as BP 's credit rating was slashed by Fitch to just two notches above junk status , as the potential cost of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill continued to escalate . Federal authorities have granted the company permission to start burning oil and gas piped up from its broken well as part of a new plan to reduce the amount of oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico . The method involves pumping oil from the busted wellhead to a special ship on the surface , where it will be burned off rather than collected . BP said it hoped to trap as much as 8.3 m litres -LRB- 2.2 m gallons -RRB- of oil daily by the end of June . The announcement comes as Obama is on the second day of a two-day trip to the region before he returns to Washington tonight for the broadcast . Speaking on CNN , Gibbs said the president would address : `` How do we challenge ourselves to create the type of energy approach that does n't increase our dependency on fossil fuels and foreign oil ? '' He said Obama also would touch on regulatory changes to try to prevent this sort of disaster from occurring again and would name someone to head the recovery effort . Obama would also discuss the next steps to contain the leak in the Gulf of Mexico . Gibbs said Obama intended to fulfil his pledge to restore the Gulf after a leak that has spilled oil for nearly two months , fouling US coastlines and killing birds , sea turtles and dolphins . `` This is a tremendously important time , '' Gibbs said . `` The president understands the challenges and will lay out a direct and clear plan to meet them . The president will outline ... a plan going forward to restore the Gulf not to where it was the day this accident happened but to restore this Gulf to where it was years ago , to increase the health and the vitality of the species there , the wildlife and the natural beauty that we all know is the Gulf of Mexico . '' Gibbs said BP 's containment efforts in the Gulf should be capturing about 90 % of the oil leaking from the well by the end of June . `` Right now what we have are physics problems . The top cap can only take so much . They 're adding additional lines ... that will bring more and more of that oil to the surface and out of the Gulf .

Photograph : Saul Loeb\\/AFP\\/Getty Images BP 's credit rating has been slashed by Fitch to just two notches above junk status , as the potential cost of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill continues to escalate . The ratings agency said it was concerned that the balance between long-term and near-term cost payments would become `` skewed much more heavily towards the near-term than previously anticipated '' if the escrow account was created . Fitch also said it was concerned that BP will find it hard to access the capital markets for funding while the full cost of the oil leak remains unclear . `` In addition , Fitch would be surprised if BP did not suspend quarterly cash dividend payments until the operational and financial impact of the incident is clearer , '' it added . Fitch 's downgrade could make it more expensive for BP to borrow , especially if the other ratings agencies follow its lead . The company has around $ 5bn of cash reserves , and has spent more than $ 1.6 bn fighting the spill . It came just a few hours before the head of BP America appears before the House of Representatives committee on energy and commerce , along with four other big oil firms . ExxonMobil , Chevron , ConocoPhillips and Shell are expected to distance themselves from BP by insisting that their own methods are safer . The energy and commerce committee attacked BP last night by accusing it of taking dangerous shortcuts when drilling the well , which has been spewing oil into the Gulf of Mexico for 55 days . The committee said its investigation into the disaster showed a series of mistakes were made in the weeks before the rig exploded . `` Time after time , it appears that BP made decisions that increased the risk of a blowout to save the company time or expense . If this is what happened , BP 's carelessness and complacency have inflicted a heavy toll on the gulf , its inhabitants , and the workers on the rig , '' said Henry Waxman and Bart Stupak , the two top Democratic congressmen on the committee . Waxman and Stupak made their claim in a letter to Tony Hayward , ahead of their showdown hearing with the BP chief executive on Thursday . The committee has already held several hearings into the oil spill , and are convinced they have uncovered crucial evidence that BP staff chose `` risky procedures '' . `` At the time of the blowout , the Macondo well was significantly behind schedule . This appears to have created pressure to take shortcuts to speed finishing the well , '' Waxman and Stupak wrote . They cited BP 's decision to use a cheaper type of steel casing in the well , even though its own review had shown this would offer less protection against a gas leak . The two congressmen also accused BP of ignoring advice from Halliburton , the contractor used to cement the well casing securely into the sea bed , that extra `` centralisers '' were needed to ensure that cementing was a success . They pointed to an email from a BP official that read : `` Who cares , it 's done , end of story , will probably be fine . '' Later today , Barack Obama will address the American people on the disaster . He is expected to say that the US must break its dependence on fossil fuels , and also reiterate his insistence that BP pays full compensation to those affected by the leak .

Photograph : Brendan Smialowski\\/Getty It may have taken 57 days since the start of the disastrous Gulf oil spill , but for Barack Obama and BP today 's events may mark the `` inflection point '' to use current White House jargon in their twin battles to convince the American public the crisis is being managed with competence . Like it or not , BP and Obama are joined at the hip over the Gulf oil spill . Right now , neither can really succeed without support of the other . The only surprise is that the two groups left it this long to get together and discuss their shared interest in the White House 's Roosevelt Room . Although oil continues to spew in vast quantities into the Gulf of Mexico from the Deepwater Horizon rig 's shattered well , today 's meeting between the administration and BP executives injected a fresh tone of assurance , that the victims of the spill would be compensated for their loses and that both BP and the US government grasped the scale of the task facing them . So what changed today ? The sight and sound of the major actors , President Obama and BP chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg , talking openly about the plans for compensation and damages including a new , independently administered $ 20bn fund paid for by BP as well as the suffering being keenly felt in the Gulf of Mexico . For the first time , Svanberg stepped before the cameras this afternoon and took questions from journalists , saying : `` I would like to take this opportunity to apologise to the American people on behalf of all of the employees of BP , many of whom live on the Gulf coast . And I do thank you for your patience at this time . '' Svanberg 's command of English may have let him down slightly in his attempts to make further apologies : `` I hear comments that large oil companies are greedy companies that do n't care but that is not true with BP . We care about the small people . '' More importantly , Svanberg pledged that `` we will repair the damage to this region and the economy '' . For Obama , his aim was to reinforce his concern and to show that the issue of compensation was being treated with top priority : As I traveled across the Gulf , I heard growing frustration over the pace at which claims have been paid . And I also heard concerns about whether BP will make resources available to cover legitimate claims resulting from this disaster . So this discussion today was essential . It helps , too , that BP surrendered to the inevitable and announced that its shareholders will not be receiving any further dividend pay-outs this year . That decision alone will deflect some of the anger directed at the company , as will BP 's agreement to fund the $ 20bn compensation scheme and its administration by the respected mediation lawyer who handled claims arising from the 9\\/11 attacks . Obama 's more aggressive response brought rare praise today from a senior Republican . Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley said while Obama had been `` too late taking charge '' of the crisis , `` it looks to me like , based on his speech last night , his meeting with BP right now , that he 's doing that . '' Following his address to the nation on Tuesday , President Obama emerged after today 's meeting and said that two issues had been discussed : the continuing struggle to halt the oil spill at its source , and BP 's ability to meet the massive claims against it . But money alone is not the only requirement . `` During a private conversation with Chairman Svanberg , I emphasized to him that for the families that I met with down in the Gulf , for the small-business owners , for the fishermen , for the shrimpers , this is not just a matter of dollars and cents , '' Obama said . His measure of BP 's response would be how the company dealt with what Svanberg would later call the `` small people '' . While Obama promised once again to make the Gulf whole , it was Svanberg who voiced the most over-optimistic thought of the day : `` In the long term , I hope we will regain your trust .

Photograph : Pete Souza\\/White House BP will pay $ 20bn -LRB- # 13.5 bn -RRB- into a special clean-up fund for the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster after company executives met Barack Obama at the White House today . BP chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg followed the president 's statement by announcing the company will not pay a dividend this year . The cancellation of dividends , including a $ 2.5 bn payment due to be paid next week , is as a massive blow to BP shareholders . The company accounts for 12 % of all dividends paid out by UK companies and is a cornerstone of most pension funds ' investments . In a statement , BP said that canceling dividends was `` right and prudent '' . Previously declared first-quarter dividends , scheduled to be paid on 21 June , have been shelved as part of the move . `` The board will consider resumption of dividend payments in 2011 , '' BP said . Svanberg said : `` We regret the cancellation and suspension of the dividends , but we concluded it was in the best interests of the company and its shareholders . '' It hopes to resume a pay-out to shareholders next year . Following discussions with the president , the oil giant reached agreement to pay the $ 20bn sum into a trust to be overseen by US officials . The fund means the company has backed down over its plans to continue to pay billions of dollars in dividends to shareholders , but the president maintained it was not a cap . In a televised statement following the discussions , President Obama said : `` I am pleased to announce that BP has agreed to set aside $ 20bn for claims . This $ 20bn will provide substantial assurances that claims people and businesses have made will be honored . This is not a cap . '' The fund will be run independently of BP and the government , and will be administered by Kenneth Feinberg , who previously oversaw the 9\\/11 victims compensation fund . Obama said efforts to contain the leak should capture 90 % of the leaking oil in the coming days and weeks . `` That is still not good enough . We will continue to press BP , '' he added . Obama said : `` We will continue to hold BP accountable , and I 'm confident BP will be able to meet its obligations to the Gulf coast and to the American people . `` I want all Americans to know that I will fight each and every day until the Gulf coast bounces back from this tragedy . For the families in the Gulf , for small business owners , for fisherman and shrimpers - this is not a matters of dollars and cents . `` A lot of this folks do n't have a cushion . I emphasise that when Ken Feinberg talks to shareholders , and has meetings in the boardroom : keep in mind those individuals . `` That will be the standard by which I measure BP 's response . Today was a good start . The standard I will apply is whether or not those individuals , those vulnerable communities , are uppermost in the minds of those concerned . That 's who we 're doing the work for . '' Obama said BP had also agreed to establish a $ 100m fund to compensate unemployed oil rig workers affected by a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling imposed in the wake of the oil spill . The fund is in addition to $ 20bn payout . Earlier this week , BP was still disputing the $ 20bn sum that 54 Democratic senators demanded the company pay into a ring-fenced fund over the weekend . That was before the official estimate of the size of the spill was revised upwards yet again now to 60,000 barrels a day , from 20,000 40 ,000 . The company had been due to make a final decision next month to rubber stamp its estimated $ 2.5 bn quarterly dividend to shareholders . But setting up such a large clean-up fund would scupper the payout . The political pressure on BP has intensified over the past fortnight , as the scale of the disaster becomes clearer and calls for Obama to do more to deal with the crisis have become more vocal . BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , told analysts in a conference call at the beginning of the month that the company would continue to meet its obligations to all its stakeholders . This was intended to reassure investors that BP could afford to pay its dividend and the cost of the clean-up . But hours later , Obama warned the company against `` nickel and diming the folks '' of the Gulf of Mexico hit by the disaster , and criticised BP for still considering whether to make its next quarterly pay out . Last week , BP 's tone on the dividend appeared to soften as even some investors worried that attempting to pay the dividend risked antagonising the White House even more and would lay the company open to further attack .

Photograph : Suzanne Plunkett\\/Reuters The ritual flogging will shortly commence . After intensive coaching in crisis communications , BP 's chairman and chief executive will face hostile questioning tomorrow from 35 members of a congressional committee about the catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . BP 's low-profile Swedish chairman , Carl-Henric Svanberg , and much-maligned chief executive , Tony Hayward , would be well-advised to adopt a supine posture according to experts , who say that such hearings are more of a theatrical forum than a true attempt to extract fresh information . `` They 've just got to sit there and take it , '' said Dan McGinn , a communications adviser at TMG Strategies who has coached business bosses for similar hearings . `` They 've got to express deep regret and genuine humility . Hayward needs to say he accepts responsibility , that this happened on his watch . '' Trying to deflect any portion of blame onto other companies would only inflame political anger , as would any public quibbling over the $ 20bn likely to be set aside for a clean-up . But the examination requires a tricky balancing . Svanberg and Hayward also need to look in command of the situation to avoid any further erosion of confidence among investors . `` I would tell him -LRB- Hayward -RRB- that this is n't about you you 're a prop , '' said McGinn . `` The theatrics , the setup if you 're looking for deep substance , forget it . They 'll just want to pummel and hit BP , to demonstrate to the public and to their districts that they 're tough . '' Members of the congressional subcommittee on energy and environment include Henry Waxman , a notoriously combative Californian who once confronted Lehman Brothers 's boss Dick Fuld with the robust question : `` Your company is bankrupt . You keep $ 480m . Is that fair ? '' Two Louisiana congressmen , Charlie Melancon and Steve Scalise , are likely to be particularly severe , given the environmental damage to the beaches of their home state . US cable news networks have been urging the White House to be angrier towards BP and thehearing , which could go on for much of the day , is the biggest opportunity so far for a showdown . Carl Messineo , organiser of a `` seize BP '' campaign that calls for the company 's assets to be ringfenced , said he wanted to see Svanberg and Hayward brought to book for their `` lies '' in understating the size of the spill , which has risen from early estimates of 5,000 barrels per day to as much as 60,000 . `` I would want to know why they misled the public , '' said Messineo . `` I would like Hayward to explain to the people of the Gulf coast directly why they -LRB- ca n't -RRB- feed their families this week and why they -LRB- ca n't -RRB- make their rent payments . '' Congress has a history of coming down hard on the bosses of scandal-hit companies . In 1994 , the heads of America 's leading tobacco companies were dubbed the `` seven dwarfs '' as they told aghast lawmakers , under oath , that they did not consider nicotine to be addictive . Two years ago , the heads of General Motors and Chrysler were pilloried by congressmen for flying to Washington on corporate jets to plead for a taxpayer-funded bailout . More recently , Goldman Sachs 's chief executive , Lloyd Blankfein , was obliged to explain why his employees had dubbed a contentious mortgage transaction as a `` shitty deal '' in an embarrassing internal email . Charles Maxwell , an oil analyst at stockbroker Weeden & Co , said BP 's chief executive should expect no sympathy in Congress : `` They 're going to pillory BP because they have to take Tony -LRB- Hayward -RRB- down to get their political agenda accepted . '' Did you cut costs and risk danger on the Deepwater Horizon platform ? Running late on its drilling project , BP has been accused of using low-grade concrete and of pumping its well with water , rather than drilling mud , to limit financial overruns , overruling the doubts of contractors including Transocean and Halliburton . Why did n't you come clean earlier on the extent of the spill ? Initial estimates suggested that fewer than 5,000 barrels of oil were gushing into the Gulf of Mexico . But experts now put the figure at anything between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels a day . BP has been accused of wilfully misleading the public . Will you suspend dividend payouts to shareholders ? Barack Obama has sharply criticised BP for paying out returns to investors while the cost of the clean-up mounts . BP 's board is yet to decide on what to do about a $ 2.4 bn -LRB- # 1.6 bn -RRB- dividend due to be paid on 27 July . Are you willing to foot the broader cost of a six-month halt in deepwater drilling ? The White House has suggested BP may be held liable for wages lost by workers laid off by rival oil companies because of a moratorium on drilling following the spill . BP insiders see this as an example of compensation claims running out of control . BP 's CEO Tony Hayward , variously dubbed `` toxic Tony '' and `` wayward Hayward '' , is likely to face demands for his departure from lawmakers enraged by various gaffes , including his remark two weeks ago that he wanted the spill to end so that he could have his `` life back '' .

Authorities are preparing coastal communities to respond to the first sign of black slicks and have brought in Venezuelan experts to advise on damage limitation . Patches of oil were reportedly spotted 100 miles north-west of the island , prompting concern that gulf currents will add Cuba to the list of casualties from the April 20 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion . Should oil reach Cuba it will be the latest twist to decades of toxic diplomatic relations between Havana and Washington . `` In Cuba , we have had small spills involving tankers on our coasts , but we 've never had to confront anything of this magnitude , '' General Ramon Espinosa , vice-minister of the armed forces , told reporters at a government meeting on natural disaster preparedness . `` Nonetheless we are documenting and studying . We are preparing with everything in our power . '' It would be a disaster for Cuba if the spill hit , he added . A relative lack of economic development has kept the north Cuban coast just 90 miles from Florida a haven for manatees , migratory sea turtles and sharks . White sand beaches are an important draw for tourists who provide an economic lifeline to the communist state . Ramon Pardo , head of Cuban civil defense , said Havana was taking all precautions . `` The preparation of the coast , vigilance , creating all necessary conditions , preparing the people who live on the coasts that could be impacted . '' Officials said Cuba would rely on expertise from Venezuela , an ally that has long experience of offshore oil drilling and its environmental consequences , but that it was also willing to talk to the US . Analysts said `` oil diplomacy '' could gift Washington and Havana a rare chance to co-operate but details remain sketchy .

The 18-minute speech was seen as critical to the credibility of Obama 's presidency after criticism that the White House has been slow to grasp the enormity of America 's worst environmental disaster . `` We will fight this spill with everything we 've got for as long it takes . We will make BP pay for the damage their company has caused , '' Obama said . `` And we will do whatever 's necessary to help the Gulf coast and its people recover from this tragedy . '' But he admitted : `` There will be more oil and more damage before this siege is done . '' The bleak acknowledgement was reinforced by the government sharply raising its estimates for the flow of oil to 35,000-60 ,000 barrels a day . The new estimate is the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez every four days , and the sixth increase in the government 's oil flow estimates since the Deepwater Horizon crisis 58 days ago . `` We have directed BP to mobilise additional equipment and technology . In the coming days and weeks , these efforts should capture up to 90 % of the oil leaking out of the well , '' said Obama . `` This is until the company finishes drilling a relief well later in the summer that is expected to stop the leak completely . '' Obama 's priority was to persuade Americans that he is up to the challenge of dealing with the environmental disaster , as well as softening the economic impact for the tens of thousands who make a living from affected industries . The key message in the speech was his promise to ensure that BP follows through on its obligations to compensate locals and businesses who have lost revenue because of the spill . `` I will meet the chairman of BP and inform him that he is to set aside whatever resources are required to compensate the workers and business owners who have been harmed as a result of his company 's recklessness , '' Obama said . `` This fund will not be controlled by BP . '' But administration officials briefing reporters before the speech admitted BP has yet to sign on to Obama 's plan . Lamar McKay , the president of BP 's US subsidiary , was also noncommittal about the plan during testimony before Congress earlier yesterday . Obama 's two-day swing through Gulf states was his fourth visit to date . It came as executives from BP and other oil giants were subjected to a grilling on offshore oil drilling by a congressional committee . But Obama 's claim to have a plan to capture 90 % of the oil from the gusher in the Gulf was undermined by a stroke of bad luck . A lightning strike on the vessel collecting the oil from the well forced the suspension of operations for nearly five hours yesterday . BP had only been able to collect about 15,000 barrels of oil a day with the containment cap a fraction of the oil flowing from the well according to the newest estimates . Obama is to meet BP 's chairman , Carl-Henric Svanberg today to discuss setting up the independently-managed fund to pay those claims . White House officials also moved to allay concerns in the wake of BP 's plummeting share price that the company has the resources to cover the costs . The credit rating agency Fitch yesterday downgraded BP 's debt to just two levels above junk status as its liabilities from the disaster continue to escalate . Obama is planning to order the company to deposit up to $ 20bn -LRB- # 13.5 bn -RRB- into a ringfenced fund to pay for the clean-up operation and damages . Fitch is the first major rating agency to downgrade BP 's credit worthiness from AA , one of the best ratings . Yesterday , traders reported that the cost of insuring BP 's debt against default soared as a result of the downgrade , while shares in London closed almost 4 % down . Sky News also reported yesterday that BP has been talking to banks about securing an extra # 5bn in funding to ensure it can meet White House demands to set up the clean-up fund . Supporters of climate change legislation had been looking to Obama to use his speech to make a strong push for energy reform . But while Obama did call for passage of a climate change law , he did not push for putting a price on carbon as they had been hoping . The speech was seen as a last chance to try to push through climate change proposals , which were left behind by epic battles in Congress over health care earlier this year . cents This article was amended on 16 June 2010 . The word chance was mis-spelt in the original . This has now been corrected .

Photograph : Bryan Bedder\\/Getty Images As Robin Hood , Kevin Costner stole from the rich to give to the poor . As an unnamed , be-gilled seafarer in Waterworld , he fought with outlaw `` smokers '' for a greater cause . The actor 's latest role , as savior of the Gulf of Mexico , goes some way towards combining the two , after his oil-water separation machines , in which he has personally invested $ 20m -LRB- # 13.5 m -RRB- , were contracted by BP to help in the Gulf clear-up effort . The 32 centrifuge machines , which a Costner-funded team of scientists have spent the past 15 years developing , are to be deployed to help tackle the spill , now believed to be gushing 40,000 barrels a day into the Gulf . The devices , manufactured by Ocean Therapy Solutions , are carried to the spill area by barges before separating the oil and water . The largest of the machines , the V20 , can clean water at a rate of 200 gallons a minute , according to the company 's website . Once separation has occurred , the oil is stored in tanks . The water is then more than 99 % clean of crude . `` This is the key , '' Costner told CNN on Tuesday . `` It 's certainly a way to fight oil spills in the 21st century . '' The actor has been developing the machinery since the early 1990s with the help of a team including his brother , a scientist . `` It may seem an unlikely scenario that I 'm the one delivering this technology at this moment in time , but from where I 'm sitting , it is equally inconceivable that these machines are not already in place , '' he said . The actor gave testimony to the house of representatives science and technology committee last week , when he urged members to force oil rigs to have clean-up equipment on site . `` We 've legislated life preservers . We legislated fire extinguishers , '' Costner said . `` We legislated lifeboats and first aid kits . It seems logical that as long as the oil industry profits from the sea , they have the legal obligation to protect it , except when they find themselves fighting for life and limb . '' BP spokesman Bill Salvin confirmed the company has contracted with Costner and Ocean Therapy Solutions to use the machines . `` We recognized they had potential and put them through testing , and that testing was done in shallow water and in very deep water and we were very pleased by the results , '' Salvin said .

Andrew Clark follows his defense of his company 's handling of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill Protesters stand behind BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , as he arrives on Capitol Hill to testify before the House Oversight and Investigations sub-committee on the Deepwater Horizon oil spill . Photograph : Haraz Ghanbari\\/AP 10.45 pm : So , after seven and a half hours , BP 's chief executive is leaving Congress . It 's been a very testy hearing with a lot of frustration from lawmakers . Tony Hayward 's responses have fallen a long way short of informative - he 's stuck rigidly to his line of refusing to comment on the precise cause of the Deepwater Horizon disaster until BP 's internal investigation is over . But here 's a brief summary of some of the key points from today 's hearing : - Hayward says he 's `` devastated '' by the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster . But he insists he 's seen no evidence of reckless behavior by BP . He says : `` There 's nothing I 've seen in the evidence so far that suggests that anyone put costs ahead of safety . If there are , then we 'll take action . '' - BP is stressing the failure of a blowout preventer , which was made by a US company , Cameron , as a central element in the disaster . Hayward said the device was supposed to be `` failsafe '' and that the industry needs to look at the design of such equipment urgently . - A Texas Republican , Joe Barton , drew some attention away from Hayward by offering a bizarre apology to BP for the White House 's `` shakedown '' in forcing the company to set up a $ 20bn `` slush fund '' for spill victims . After condemnation from both sides of the House , Barton apologised for apologising to BP . - Hayward admits to being detached from operations on the doomed well - he told lawmakers that his only awareness of the operation of the Macondo well was when he was briefed that the company had struck oil in April . - The BP boss stonewalled criticism of the design of the well , saying the methods used were common in the Gulf of Mexico . He denied any dispute on the Deepwater Horizon rig between BP staff and those of its contractor , Transocean . But he insisted on waiting for the results of an internal investigation before apportioning any blame . - Overall , Hayward 's appearance can hardly be called a success . The committee 's chairman , Bart Stupak , admonished him for evasiveness that `` increased the frustration '' of the American people over the catastrophic spill . 10.30 pm : Finally , we 're drawing to an end . Chairman Bart Stupak says he ca n't allow things to go on until midnight . He thanks Hayward for coming voluntarily but adds that members are `` frustrated '' by the `` evasiveness '' of the BP boss 's answers with too many answers of the '' `` I do n't know '' genre . Bang , bang goes the gavel . Everybody gets up and Hayward is being guided out by a sizeable posse of security guards . 10.27 pm : Diana DeGette , a Colorado Democrat , wants to know if BP is committed to reimbursing long-term healthcare costs accrued by Gulf residents because of the spill . Hayward says the company will do so if the independent adjudicator , Ken Feinberg , rules that it should . `` $ 20bn is a very large sum of money to pay claims , '' says Hayward . DeGette is n't very satisfied . She wants to know whether , in Hayward 's opinion , healthcare costs are reasonable . Hayward says he 's not going to give an opinion - that 's why BP has appointed an independent adjudicator . 10.17 pm : Meanwhile , outside the committee room ... Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has pondered , in an interview with the Wall Street Journal , whether the Gulf spill will lead to the `` annihilation '' of BP . He hopes not , saying Russia wo n't re-evaluate its dealings with BP , but says the disaster will lead to a re-thinking of oil exploration around the world . This is a wake-up call , '' Mr. Medvedev told the WSJ . Of BP 's fate , he added : `` Certainly , we are not indifferent to their future . ... Hopefully , they can absorb the losses . '' 10.12 pm : Welch , a Democrat from Vermont , says Hayward has answered `` 65 times '' to reasonable questions today that he does n't know the answer . Do n't know if he 's counted or guessing . Either way , Welch is n't impressed and says Hayward 's appearance will only erode confidence in BP that had begun to build following Wednesday 's agreement to set up a $ 20bn compensation fund . 10.10 pm : Congressman Peter Welch : `` Mr Hayward , can you point to any single bad decision that was made with respect to Deepwater Horizon ? '' Hayward : `` I 'm not prepared to point today , after a half-complete investigation , to what was or was not a bad decision . '' The BP boss says there were many components - including the casing , cementing , blow-out preventer - involved in the accident . All involved in the well agreed to continue drilling . 10.05 pm : Bruce Braley , an Iowa Democrat , is asking about the bereaved families who lost workers on the Deepwater Horizon . What should widows tell their children about how their fathers died ? Hayward : `` Based on what I know , this was a tragic accident involving many failure mechanisms . That is the reality . That is why this happened . '' Braley asks if blame is shared by other companies involves . Hayward : `` I do n't believe now is the time to try and apportion blame . I believe now is the time to try and understand what happened . '' The BP boss adds that he does n't believe it 's time for `` finger-pointing '' . 9.55 pm : Congressman Michael Burgess wants BP to open up a freephone 1-800 number for ideas on how to clean up the Gulf . `` We have a lot of ingenuity in America , '' he declares . Burgess says lots of clever people are watching television feed of the leaking underwater pipe : `` It 's driving people crazy to watch that thing bubbling in the Gulf . '' 9.52 pm : Hayward admits the Macondo drilling operation was running behind schedule . He says operating the Deepwater Horizon well cost about a million dollars a day . But he adds that the `` important thing '' from an economic point of view was that BP had made an oil discovery in the area and that it wanted to secure the well . 9.50 pm : Michael Burgess , a Republican from Texas , is asking about reports of an argument between Transocean engineers and BP 's `` company man '' , Donald Vidrine , on the rig . Hayward denies that there was any such dispute : `` It is my understanding that that account has been contradicted under oath at the marine board investigation and that there was no heated discussion or skirmish . '' The BP boss says a Transocean tool pusher testified that there was never any row between staff from the two companies in the hours leading up to the disaster . 9.46 pm : Committee chairman Bart Stupak is having a rather complicated -LRB- and possibly pedantic -RRB- argument with Hayward about whether the blowout preventer can be called a `` failsafe mechanism '' if it is n't failsafe . I 'm not sure if this is going to get anywhere . 9.41 pm : This morning 's `` apology '' to BP by Joe Barton continues to create uproar - it 's been condemned by the White House and by Republican leader John Boehner . Reuters has a story on it here . Barton has truly done BP a favor by stealing some of the heat away from Hayward . The White House press secretary Robert Gibbs just tweeted : `` Who would the GOP put in charge of overseeing the energy industry & Big Oil if they won control of Congress ? Yup , u guessed it - JOE BARTON '' 9.33 pm : Joe Barton asks Hayward to offer one or two suggestions of things that can be done to prevent a similar accident in the future . `` I believe the most important one is to take the failsafe mechanism that is the blowout preventer and design it so that it is genuinely failsafe , '' says Hayward , who says it 's `` clear '' that the current design basis of blowout preventers in deepwater drilling is `` not as failsafe as we 'd believed it do be '' . He says this is an `` important lesson for the industry to grasp '' . 9.31 pm : Hayward is asked when BP 's internal investigation is likely to be completed . He declines to give even a rough timeframe , saying : `` One of the most important elements of this is the blowout preventer . it remains on the seabed and it needs to be examined . '' BP has repeatedly stressed the crucial role of the failed blowout preventer in today 's hearing . This piece of kit , made by the US firm Cameron , seems to be at the center of any effort by BP to get other firms to shoulder a portion of the blame for the Gulf disaster . 9.26 pm : Henry Waxman 's moving in for the kill . He finds it shocking that when the potential consequences of a mistake on a rig are so enormous , Hayward seems so `` removed '' from the operations on the Deepwater Horizon platform . Where were the best minds in BP paying attention : `` You were oblivious and so were other BP officials . I think this was a fundamental mistake in management . '' Hayward says the focus of top executives was safety . What his team can do is ensure the right people are in places , the right processes are in place , that proper equipment and safeguards are in place : `` I believe the right people were making decisions . '' 9.24 pm : Everybody 's had a turn to ask questions now . A few members have quick `` follow-ups '' . So we 're nearing the end . Hayward looks doleful , like a dog that 's been repeatedly kicked . 9.22 pm : Hayward says the `` integrity rating '' of the failed Halliburton blowout preventer in the oil well was `` of the order of ten to the minus five , ten to the minus six '' . He says : `` That is to say , it was designed to fail between one in a hundred thousand and one in a million times . '' Castor expresses surprise that this is considered an `` acceptable risk '' . 9.18 pm : Karhy Castor , a Democrat from Florida , wants to start out by expressing the `` anger and frustration '' of all the mom and pop businesses of her state at this `` sucker punch '' , which she reckons is a consequence of BP placing `` profit over safety '' . No jumping to conclusions there , then . 9.15 pm : The New York Times points out that a satirical website has sprung up , www.joebartonwouldliketoapologize.com , to celebrate Republican congressman Joe Barton 's apology to BP for the White House 's `` shakedown '' - and for his subsequent apology for his apology . The site notes that Barton would also like to apologise to Osama bin Laden , Kanye West and to the England football team for depriving them victory last week . 9.11 pm : A cheap shot ? Congressman Jay Inslee says BP 's investment on `` safer offshore drilling technology '' is about $ 10m annually - about 0.0033 % of BP 's revenue : `` That does n't sound like an adequate prioritisation . How does it compare to your compensation ? '' Hayward is n't taking this lying down : `` In what respect ? '' He adds that his comp was $ 6m . 8.57 pm : Hayward is asked if he thinks Obama 's six-month moratorium on offshore drilling is reasonable He replies : `` I believe it is prudent for the industry to take stock of what has happened here before it moves forward . '' Congressman Charles Gonzalez wants to know when it would be appropriate to lift the moratorium . Hayward vaguely says it should be lifted when everybody understands the causes of the spill . 8.49 pm : Scalise is frustrated : `` If it 's not you that 's blocking it , you need to go tell somebody that it 's being blocked . Because it 's being blocked . '' He says Louisiana does not have the luxury of time on sand barriers or on things like salvage of seafood . Hayward : `` I understand your concern and your anger . '' 8.47 pm : A Louisiana Republican , Steve Scalise , has a prop - he holds up a picture of an oiled pelican . He wants to know why it 's taking so long to enact Bobby Jindal 's plan for sand barriers protecting the Louisiana coast . Hayward blames the federal government , saying `` ultimate approval '' lies with the administration . 8.44 pm : Eliot Engel , a New York Democrat , wants to know how the US can be certain that what happened at the Macondo well wo n't happen at BP 's hundreds of other wells in the Gulf of Mexico . `` The other wells have all been completed and are secure , '' says Hayward . Engel asks if that 's the same type of assurance that Hayward gave when he promised a `` laser-like '' focus on safety . Much heat , no light . Engel hits out : `` I , like everyone else here and everyone else in America , am thoroughly disgusted . I think you 're stalling , I think you 're insulting our intelligence and I really resent it . '' 8.39 pm : Stearns wants to know if Hayward was briefed about Halliburton warning of gas surges in the Macondo well . Hayward says he was n't informed of this . `` I had no prior knowledge of this well prior to the incident whatsoever , '' says the BP boss . Stearns wonders if Hayward would have been fired if he was the captain of a ship that crashed into New Orleans , killing 11 people and spilling lots of oil . Has anybody at BP been fired as a result of this incident ? Hayward : `` Not so far . '' 8.36 pm : A comedian . Cliff Stearns , a Republican from Florida , says Hayward does n't seem to be able to answer many questions - so he has an easy one : `` Is today Thursday ? '' Hayward -LRB- unamused -RRB- : `` It is Thursday . '' Getting serious , Stearns asks if the oil spilt on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico is a consequence of BP 's reckless behavior . `` It is a consequence of a big accident . '' Stearns : `` Yes or no - reckless behavior or not ? '' Hayward : `` There is no evidence of reckless behavior . '' Stearns : `` You 're saying BP has had no reckless behavior ? '' Hayward : `` I have seen no evidence of reckless behavior . '' 8.33 pm : Welch asks about resignation . He wants to know if Hayward still enjoys the confidence necessary to act as chief exec , given the loss of $ 100bn in shareholder value , the suspension of BP 's dividend and the damage caused to the Gulf . Hayward replies : `` I 'm focused on the response . I 'm focused on trying to eliminate the leak , trying to contain the oil on the surface , defending the beaches , clean up the spill and restore the lives of people on the Gulf Coast . That 's what I intend to do . '' 8.30 pm : BP 's boss goes a little further in defending decisions on the Deepwater Horizon . Asked about the small number of centralisers keeping the drilling pipe in place , Hayward says `` more does n't always mean better '' . And asked by congressman Peter Welch about the use of saltwater , rather than heavier drilling fluid , to flush out the well , Hayward says : `` The procedure that was used to displace mud was a procedure not uncommon in the industry . it was a procedure approved by the Mineral Management Service . '' 8.27 pm : Good stuff from Peter Welch , a Democrat , who lists , one by one , all of BP 's past accidents in the US . Is it true that BP 's Texas City refinery blew up in 2005 , killing 15 people ? Is it true that BP 's pipelines leaked in Alaska the following year ? Is it true that BP was fined $ 370m by the US department of justice ? `` That is correct , '' Hayward glumly replies to each one . 8.24 pm : Hayward is accused of a `` real detachment , a real disconnect '' by Betty Sutton , a Democrat . She says : `` When push came to shove on the Deepwater Horizon , the company 's concern appeared to be the bottom line . '' She wants to know who was responsible for decisions on the rig : `` Mr Hayward , as the leader of the company , do n't you have to take responsibility ? '' Hayward : `` I am absolutely responsible for the safety and reliable operations of BP . That is what I have said all along . '' 8.20 pm : Texas Republican Joe Barton asks : `` Based on what you now know , do you agree that this accident was preventable ? '' Hayward : `` I believe that all accidents are preventable , absolutely . '' Then , bizarrely , Barton apologises for his earlier apology to BP . Barton , something of a conservative maverick , said at the beginning of the hearing that the oil company was the victim of a White House `` shakedown '' and had been obliged by the Obama administration to set up a $ 20bn `` slush fund '' for compensation . Barton now says he believes BP was responsible and should be brought to account for the accident - and that he apologises if anything he said earlier had been `` misconstrued '' . 8.12 pm : Christensen notes that Hayward has described BP as `` a responsible party '' for the accident , not `` the responsible party '' . Does he think there are others ? Hayward : `` The government has named four responsible parties - BP , Transocean , Mitsui and Anadarko . '' Mitsui and Anadarko were minority shareholders in the well , where BP had a 65 % stake . Transocean owned and managed the rig that was leased for the operation . 8.09 pm : A piece of masterly understatement . Donna Christensen , a delegate from the US Virgin Islands , asks Hayward if he surprised somebody did n't take a decision to shut down the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform earlier . `` I think in the light of what we now know , it is perhaps surprising that someone did n't say that they were concerned , '' replies the BP boss . 8.05 pm : Hayward is asked if BP should n't have had `` failsafe mechanisms '' in case of a massive oil leak . He says Halliburton 's faulty blowout preventer , which was supposed to cut off oil in the event of the accident , was intended to fill this role . `` We believed that the blow-out preventer was the ultimate failsafe mechanism . That clearly was n't the case in this instance . '' Hayward says blowout preventer failed three times - when it was activated from the drilling rig , when the drilling rig separated from the blowout preventer and when undersea robots tried to activate it a day later . That 's another clear signal by BP that it feels contractors share the blame for the accident . 7.59 pm : Did BP force Deepwater Horizon rig workers to sign legal disclaimers before allowing them to go home after the explosion on the platform ? Hayward says his company was n't responsible , appears to blame Transocean : `` I think it 's inappropriate and it was nothing to do with BP '' 7.57 pm : Jan Shakowsky , a Democrat , notes that Hayward says he was `` personally devastated '' by the Deepwater Horizon disaster : `` Probably not as devastated as the widows that testified for our committee . '' She quotes one of the widows , Natalie Roshto , who says two BP execs came to her husband 's memorial service and `` never extended a hand , a hug , never extended a word of sorrow '' . Were only interested in where they were sitting . `` I 'm devastated by the accident , absolutely devastated , '' says Hayward . `` I feel great sorry for the people who werte impacted by it . But the people who were killed by the accident were not employees of BP , they were employees of Transocean and other contractors . '' Hayward says Transocean and the other companies involved made it clear to BP that they wanted to deal with the families themselves . 7.51 pm : Hayward says he 'd be `` very surprised '' if his chief operating officer , Doug Suttles , or head of exploration and production , Andy Inglis , were involved in decisions about the design of the leaking Macondo oil well . The BP boss is playing a dangerous game by declaiming all responsibility for what went on at the rig . He 's not exactly inspiring confidence in his senior leadership team . Mike Doyle , a Pennsylvania Democrat , reminds Hayward that he 's not running a department store , he 's running an oil company with `` life or death '' decisions . Doyle wonders if running an oil company might be a good career option - it pays better than being a Congressman and does n't seem to involve much work : `` Those of you at the top do n't seem to have a clue what was going on at this rig . '' 7.46 pm : Diana DeGette , a Democrat , draws a bit of blood by highlighting an email in which a BP engineer responded to concerns about the design of the Macondo well by glibly remarking : `` Who cares , it 's done , end of story , it will probably be fine . '' Hayward says : `` I think that email is a cause for concern . I 'd like to understand the context it was sent . As I 've said before , if there 's any action that people put cost ahead of safety , we will take action . '' The BP boss denies being told by lawyers to evade answering Congressional questions . 7.41 pm : Did anybody inform Hayward about a now notorious internal BP memo back in April describing the Deepwater Horizon drilling operation as a `` nightmare well '' ? `` They did not , '' says Hayward , who says the first he knew of it being a `` nightmare well '' was when investigators from the Congressional committee drew the memo to his attention . 7.37 pm : Does Hayward think BP was `` shaken down '' by the White House to set up its $ 20bn compensation fund , an Iowa Democrat , Bruce Braley , wants to know . Hayward does n't exactly say no , but neither does he say yes . He says of the meeting at the White House : `` We came together to figure out a way of working together to figure out a way to resolve a very , very serious situation . '' So , Braley asks , is the $ 20bn pot of money a `` slush fund '' as Republican Joe Barton has controversially described it ? Hayward says the fund is `` a signal of our commitment to do right '' , to make sure that fishermen , charter boat captains , property owners are made whole . He adds : `` I certainly did n't think it was a slush fund , congressman . '' 7.31 pm : Strongest semi-rebuttal from Hayward so far : `` There 's nothing I 've seen in the evidence so far that suggests that anyone put costs ahead of safety . If there are , then we 'll take action . '' Phil Gingrey , a Republican from Georgia , wonders whether , if Hayward was physically present on the rig , he would have made the same decisions concerning the design and the casing of the well . Hayward : `` I 'm not a drilling engineer so I 'm not actually qualified to make those judgements . better people than I were involved in those decisions in terms of the judgements that were taken . '' Gingrey : `` With all due respect , Mr Hayward , I think you 're copping out . You were the captain of the ship . '' Frustrated , the congressman adds that the buck stops on Hayward 's desk : `` It seems like your testimony has been way too evasive . '' 7.28 pm : A Democrat , Ed Markey , is tackling Hayward on the contentious issue of underwater plumes of oil . To date , BP has been sceptical about the presence of `` plumes '' , insisting that the spilt oil is largely on the ocean surface . Markey cites BP 's own water sampling and asks : `` Are you now , once and for all , prepared to conceded that there are subsurface plumes ? '' `` There 's oil in very low concentrations , 0.5 parts per million , distributed throughout the column , '' says Hayward . `` Some of it is related to this spill , other parts are related to other oil in the water . '' Markey asks if he 's therefore saying that he does n't recognize the term `` plume '' . Hayward : `` I 'm not an oceanographic scientist . What we know is ... '' Markey interrupts : `` I 'm going to take that as a continuing ` no ' from you and your testimony continues to be at odds with all known scientists . '' 7.19 pm : under questioning from Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn , Hayward says BP has sought help from all over the place - both our `` immediate peers and competitors in the Gulf of Mexico and globally from around the world and across America '' . Several hundred organizations are involved - the Brazilian energy firm Petrobras , academic institutions , many of the `` greatest minds in this country '' . 7.16 pm : We 're off again ! And Hayward has just been sternly ticked off by chairman Bart Stupak for his evasive answers . Stupak says Hayward was briefed on the topics he 'd be facing and ought to be able to offer much more informative responses . 6.07 pm : Key points from the first chunk of questioning : cents Tony Hayward says there are seven areas under investigation in a probe into the cause of the Deepwater Horizon disaster : cementing , the casing of the well , pressure measurements , well-control procedures and three issues surrounding a failed blowout preventer . cents As for decisions taken in the run-up to the accident , Hayward refuses to draw judgement until investigations are complete . He repeatedly declines to answer questions about alleged cost-cutting decisions with the refrain : `` I ca n't answer that question because I was n't there . '' cents Congressmen are getting irritated and frustrated with Hayward , who was accused by Henry Waxman of `` kicking the can down the road '' and acting as if he has nothing to do with the company . cents The BP boss says the only knowledge he had of the Macondo well was in mid-April , when he was informed by the head of the company 's exploration division that BP had made an oil discovery . He had no other `` prior involvement '' until the disaster . 5.58 pm : Another break . The committee is adjourned for an hour for a further six congressional votes . Bart Stupak tells us they 're the last votes of the day and that when they 're done , we 'll be able to complete the grilling of Hayward without further interruption . Bang , bang , gavel , gavel . 5.55 pm : What about a decision not to fully circulate mud in the well was that to save money and time ? `` I ca n't answer that question because I was n't there . '' How much money and time was saved by not circulating the mud ? `` I 'm afraid I ca n't recall . '' Hayward offers the same response to every question : he was n't party to individual decisions . He does n't know how much money each alleged corner-cutting saved . 5.53 pm : Michigan congressman John Dingell is interested in the decision to use single casing for the well , not a `` tie-back '' method . Was this decision to save money : yes or no ? Hayward says he was n't involved in the decision and `` ca n't possibly know '' the precise reasoning behind it . What about the decision to use only six centralisers to keep the bore in the middle of the well , not the 21 recommended by Halliburton ? Hayward : `` I was not involved in that decision so it 's impossible for me to answer that question . '' 5.49 pm : This is shaping up to be extremely testy . Hayward is rigorously sticking to his line that he is n't going to make judgments on what happened on the Deepwater Horizon platform until investigations are complete . John Sullivan , a Republican from Oklahoma , suggests that the accident would n't have happened if Exxon or Chevron were operating the rig . Do n't they have more rigorous procedures ? `` I do n't think we can make that judgment , '' says Hayward flatly . 5.44 pm : Waxman says it appears to him that BP knowingly risked well failure to save a few million dollars . Does n't Hayward feel any sense of responsibility for these decisions ? Hayward : `` I feel a great sense of responsibility for the accident . '' Waxman : `` How about for the decisions that made the accident more likely ? '' The BP chief executive replies that we still need to determine what were the critical decisions . Says he ca n't `` pass judgment '' on these decisions at this stage . He says : `` I 'm not prepared to draw conclusions about this accident until such time as the investigation is concluded . '' He says this is an `` investigative committee '' . Accuses Hayward of `` stonewalling '' and of refusing to co-operate : `` I 'm just amazed at this testimony . Mr Hayward , you 're not taking responsibility . You 're kicking the can down the road and acting as if you have nothing to do with this company . '' 5.41 pm : Hayward is asked about allegedly risky decisions concerning the cementing design of the well , and whether BP ignored warnings . He replies : `` I was n't involved in any of the decision-making . It 's clear that there was some discussion among the engineering team and an engineering decision was taken . '' Waxman says it 's `` clear that you do n't want to answer our questions '' and asks whether Hayward has n't been involved in engineering throughout his career . Citing an internal document , he accuses BP of using a more dangerous well design called a `` long string '' to save $ 7m . The BP boss is n't having it . Says the document also says the `` long string '' design would best serve the long-term integrity of the well and that the `` long string '' design is n't unusual in the Gulf of Mexico . So far , Hayward is being surprisingly feisty . 5.36 pm : Now it 's Henry Waxman 's turn . He 's not taking any nonsense . Wants to know `` yes or no '' whether Hayward has kept his commitment at the time of his appointment to focus `` like a laser '' on safety . Hayward says he 's made a lot of progress and starts saying he 's `` distraught '' by the Gulf spill . Waxman snaps : `` I do n't want to know whether you 're distraught . I want to know whether you 've kept your commitment . '' 5.33 pm : Hayward : `` With respect , sir , we drill hundreds of wells around the world . '' Congressman Burgess : `` I know , that 's what 's scaring me . '' 5.32 pm : Under questioning by Texan congressman Michael Burgess , Hayward defends the design of the Macondo well , saying there are `` many wells '' in the Gulf of Mexico with `` the same casing design and the same cementing procedures '' . First sign that he is n't going to take this lying down . He 's not willing to be pressed further on the cementing : `` I 'm not prepared to speculate on what may or may not have made a difference until such time as the multiple investigations are concluded . '' Asked how much he knew of what was happening on the Deepwater Horizon rig , he continues : `` The only knowledge I had of the Macondo well was in mid-April when I was notified that we had made a discovery . That was my only prior involvement in the well . '' 5.29 pm : The BP boss tells the committee that his oversight of safety in the company is through a `` group operating risk committee '' , which meets on a bimonthly basis and which reviews safety throughout the global organization . He says this arrangement is mirrored lower down the business . 5.27 pm : Hayward is asked if he expects to be BP chief executive for much longer . He replies that he 's focused on carrying out his responsibilities BP 's `` highest priority '' is to stop the leak and clean up the oil on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico . 5.26 pm : Stupak asks whether should there be a ban on companies operating in the US if they have `` miserable '' safety and environmental records . He cites BP 's Texas City refinery disaster and the Gulf spill . Hayward does n't answer directly , just says he 's devastated by the accident and that he 's focused on `` safe , reliable operations '' . Says he 's made progress in changing BP 's culture but that there 's more work to do . 5.24 pm : Stupak : every one of those seven areas dealt with saving money and saving time . Should n't leadership at BP be held accountable ? In reply , Hayward keeps repeating vaguely that since he became chief executive , he has focused on `` safe , reliable operations '' and that investigations are ongoing . 5.22 pm : Stupak wants to know if BP managed the risk on the well properly , whether BP cut corners and why rival oil companies said they would have done things differently . Hayward : We 've launched an investigation which has identified seven areas cement , casing , integrity pressure measurements , well-control procedures and three areas around the failed blowout preventer . That investigation is ongoing . 5.18 pm : Stupak bangs his gavel and we 're back moving . 5.12 pm : Hayward 's back in the room and congressmen are beginning to trickle back to their seats , so we 'll be up and running again soon . So a round-up of the main points so far : cents BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , told Congress he was `` personally devastated '' by the Deepwater Horizon disaster . cents Proceedings were disrupted by a protester smeared with an oil-like substance who yelled that Hayward should `` go to hell '' and should be `` tarred with a brush '' . cents A Democratic congressman , Peter Welch , called on Hayward to resign . cents Energy committee chairman Henry Waxman said that in 30,000 documents and emails , there was no sign that BP 's top brass paid `` the slightest attention '' to clear safety problems at the Macondo well . cents But a maverick Republican , Joe Barton , broke ranks to declare BP was the victim of a `` shakedown '' by the White House . He claimed the company had been forced to set up a $ 20bn `` slush fund '' to clean up the Gulf and compensate victims . 4.34 pm : Hayward says it 's simply too early to say what caused the `` incident '' . There are multiple investigations going on . BP will emerge `` stronger , smarter and safer '' . Bart Stupak is adjourning the hearing until 12 noon -LRB- 5pm UK time -RRB- so members can go and vote . So after two hours , nothing of substance has been extracted from BP 's boss . 4.31 pm : My colleague Suzanne Goldenberg , who is in the room , tweets that the protester had a black oil-like substance on her hands and appeared to be hurt as she was wrestled to the ground by cops . She was screaming : `` You need to be charged with a crime . You need to go to jail . '' 4.29 pm : The protester has been thrown out , amid quite a furore . Scores of photographers descended on her and she did n't go quietly . The chairman , Bart Stupak , bangs his gavel , says he knows that emotions are running high but that the hearing will be conducted with `` proper decorum '' . Tony Hayward begins to read his pre-prepared statement , which can be found here . He emphasises that he was `` personally devastated '' by the death of 11 men on the Deepwater Horizon rig . 4.26 pm : A furious interruption . A woman dressed in green has stood up and is yelling that Hayward needs to be `` tarred with a brush '' and should `` go to hell '' . She is shouting very loudly and is being bundled to the ground by Congressional police . It takes about half a dozen officers to subdue her and drag her out of the room . 4.25 pm : Opening statements are finally over . Now Hayward is being sworn in . He stands , raises his right hand and swears to tell the truth . The BP boss is asked if he wants to be represented by a lawyer . He says : `` I do not . '' 4.22 pm : Betty Sutton , a Democrat from Ohio , informs us that she feels `` physically sick '' when she sees pictures of oil gushing into the Gulf . Before any quizzing of Hayward , she 's already decided that the disaster is a result of BP 's recklessness and `` come what may , cross that bridge when it comes to it '' attitude , which is `` outrageous and unacceptable '' . 4.19 pm : First demand of the day for Hayward to resign . Peter Welch , a Democrat from Vermont , says the Gulf accident is `` not an aberration '' for BP , it 's business as usual : `` It 's deja vu again and again and again . '' Welch wants to know whether a CEO of a company that 's incurred $ 370m in environmental fines and who 's presided over the destruction of $ 100bn of shareholder value and the suspension of a dividend can still command confidence . He asks : `` Is it time , frankly , for that CEO , to consider submitting his resignation ? '' Not wishing to nitpick but the $ 370m in fines imposed by the US department of justice in October 2007 were for the Texas City disaster and Alaska oil spill , which happened under Hayward 's predecessor , John Browne . 4.14 pm : Hayward looks tired and bored . He 's slumped forward with his arms on the table in front of him and he keeps blinking extraordinarily slowly . 4.13 pm : A voice from the Caribbean . Donna Christensen , delegate from the US Virgin Islands , says BP are n't the only ones at fault the company could n't have cut corners on safety `` without the complicity of government agencies and regulators '' . But she ca n't ignore the fact that if different decisions had been made by BP , the 11 men who died on the Deepwater Horizon rig might still be alive . I like her Caribbean accent . 4.03 pm : An hour on the clock and Hayward still has n't been allowed to utter a word . We 're still on windy opening statements members of Congress essentially addressing their constituents on television . Not much seeking-after-truth going on yet . 4.01 pm : Parker Griffith , an avuncular-looking Republican from Alabama , offers a quirky bit of philosophy to try to put the oil spill in perspective . `` You 're never as good as they say you are or as bad as they say you are , so this hearing will go back and forth , '' he tells Hayward . Then Griffith goes off on a rather eccentric tangent , declaring : `` The greatest environmental disaster in America is cigarettes . 60,000 Americans this year will die from cigarette-related diseases so if we 're talking about the environment , let 's not leave that out . '' He adds : `` This is not going to be the worst thing that ever happens to America . '' 3.55 pm : It 's quibbling , really , at this point but several bloggers have pointed out that some of the committee members persist in referring to BP as `` British Petroleum '' a name that was dropped after BP merged with the American firm Amoco in 1998 . John Sullivan , an Oklahoma Republican , seemed to delight in rolling `` British Petroleum '' over his tongue . No doubt he picked up the habit from the White House 's spokesman , Robert Gibbs . 3.50 pm : The committee is playing a video of testimony from the widows of two of the 11 men who died on the Deepwater Horizon platform calling for BP 's top brass to be held accountable for their actions . One of them talks of how her family was destroyed : `` My family can never , and will never , be adequately compensated for our loss . '' 3.45 pm : For the record , Hayward was paid # 4.01 m in salary , bonus and share awards last year , up from # 2.85 m in 2008 . 3.44 pm : First mention of Tony Hayward 's pay package . John Dingell , a Michigan Democrat , thinks it 's too high . `` Last year , Mr Hayward enjoyed a splendid 41 % pay raise even as BP 's profits dropped 45 % . I just happen to be a poor Polish lawyer from Detroit but it seems to me this is a curious response to a drop in profits . It makes me wonder what the compensation package of our witness will be this year . '' 3.40 pm : A bit of grandstanding from congressman John Sullivan , a Republican from the oil state of Oklahoma . He reckons the government is using the disaster to put oil companies `` out of business '' as part of a dangerous leftie agenda motivated by global warming . `` The administration is exploiting this disaster to advance its disastrous cap and trade energy policy , '' says Sullivan , who says carbon trading will `` cripple the economy '' and make unemployment lines longer . Hayward remains diplomatically expressionless . 3.37 pm : Many of the committee members ' chairs are still empty . Seems not everybody turns up to listen to opening statements from each lawmaker . Hayward is sitting at a table alone , facing the lawmakers . He looks a tad lonely . 3.33 pm : Ed Markey , chairman of the panel 's climate change subcommittee , takes issue with Joe Barton for describing BP 's $ 20bn clean-up fund as a `` slush fund '' . `` It was the government of the United States working to protect the most vulnerable citizens that we have in our country right now - the residents of the Gulf . It is BP 's spill but it is America 's ocean and it is American citizens who are being harmed . '' Markey says victims of the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska had to wait `` years '' for compensation , while certain claims from the 1984 Bhopal disaster in India were only settled this week . Markey says people ca n't wait for things to drag through the courts . 3.26 pm : Stupak is picking off some of BP 's less admirable public statements including Hayward 's often quoted remark that he wanted the spill halted so he could have his life back . `` We are not small people but we wish to get our lives back , '' says the Michigan Democrat . `` For the Americans who live and work on the Gulf coast , it may be years before they get their lives back . '' He adds : `` Mr Hayward , I 'm sure you 'll get your life back and with a golden parachute back to England . But we in America are left with the terrible consequences of BP 's reckless disregard for safety . '' 3.22 pm : A Guardian article is being displayed by the committee 's chairman , Bart Stupak ! The Democrat is interested in a town hall hearing held by Hayward in Houston shortly after he became chief executive in 2007 at which he ordered a streamlining of management to speed up decisions . The Guardian piece , which is here , was subheaded `` oil company has become too cautious '' and Stupak is worried about BP 's corporate culture . 3.15 pm : Suddenly a change of tone . BP has a sympathiser in Joe Barton , a Republican from Texas . He says there 's a system `` built on British traditions '' in the US that when people or corporations do bad things , they 're held responsible . However , Barton says he 's `` ashamed '' of what happened in the White House yesterday : `` I think it 's a tragedy of the first proportion that a private corporation can be subjected to what I would call a shakedown , in this case a $ 20bn shakedown . '' Barton describes BP 's government mandated clean-up fund as a `` slush fund '' created at the behest of the US attorney general . There 's no question BP made mistakes , says Barton , but there 's a `` due process '' system that ought to be followed . Stressing that he 's speaking personally , rather than for the Republican party , Barton offers a rather remarkable apology to BP : `` I apologise . I do not want to live in a country where every time a corporation does something wrong , it 's subject to a political process that amounts to a shakedown . '' 3.10 pm : Waxman continues : `` BP 's corporate complacency is astonishing . '' One of BP 's contractors , Halliburton , warned of gas flow problems , an engineer on the project dubbed it a `` nightmare well '' . Waxman says there 's a `` complete contradiction between BP 's words and deeds '' . He says `` BP cut corner after corner to save a million dollars here , a few hours or days there , and now the whole Gulf of Mexico is paying the price . '' Tousle-haired Hayward is looking grim . The smile has disappeared . 3.08 pm : Henry Waxman , the moustachioed , bespectacled Californian renowned for taking no prisoners , is giving the first opening statement . He starts by commending BP for setting up its $ 20bn clean-up fund . He says that when Hayward became CEO of BP , he promised to focus `` like a laser '' on safety . But complains that in 30,000 documents , there 's no sign that Hayward looked closely at risks on the Deepwater Horizon well : `` There 's not a single email or document that shows you paid the slightest attention to the dangers at this well . '' 3.03 pm : Stupak is banging his gavel and asking photographers to clear off so looks like we 're ready for the off . 3.03 pm : Hayward 's in the room now , making his way to his seat with the ever-present slight smile that seems to infuriate BP 's critics . He 's being mobbed by photographers . A few protestors are in the room , holding up pink signs with slogans such as `` BP kills '' . The session is scheduled to run for five hours so we 're potentially in for a bit of a marathon . The hearing is being chaired by Bart Stupak , a Democrat from Michigan , who heads the energy panel 's subcommittee on oversight and investigations . 2.57 pm : There 's no shortage of advice out there for BP . In the Wall Street Journal , Daniel Henninger muses that the company is looking a little `` beaten up '' by the Obama administration . He says he ca n't recall a previous president with `` this depth of visceral , antibusiness animosity '' . A New York Times editorial says BP is `` beginning to ante up '' and that its $ 20bn fund is a step in the right direction . And in Reuters ' Breaking Views column , Neil Collins suggests there 's only one man up to the job of chairing BP and winning over angry Americans - the former prime minister Tony Blair . 2pm : It 's showdown time for BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , who faces a public grilling today from 35 members of the House energy and commerce committee . It 's set to be an extremely tough session for the BP boss , who has variously been dubbed `` toxic Tony '' and `` wayward Hayward '' for his occasionally tone-deaf public statements in response to the company 's catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . Lawmakers are understandably disgusted by the environmental damage wreaked since BP 's Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded and sank on April 20 . With Congressional elections just five months away , politicians are n't likely to extend much sympathy to BP , despite the company 's commitment on Wednesday to set up a $ 20bn fund for the clean-up and compensation costs . Hayward 's written evidence , which you can read here , seems to strike a suitable contrite note . Hayward says he was `` personally devastated '' by the oil rig 's explosion , which claimed 11 lives . He adds : `` I fully grasp the terrible reality of the situation . '' Anyone can help and contribute to project . "}, {"uid": "1294", "dct": "2010-06-17", "dates": [], "text": "BP oil spill : can you fix it ? The slick 's growing , things are getting desperate .

Photograph : Bryan Bedder\\/Getty Images A Hollywood superstar riding in to save the day ? Who could resist a storyline like that ? So it has come to pass with the news that the Oscar-winning actor Kevin Costner has just signed a deal to help beleaguered BP clean up its oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . The oil giant has signed a letter of intent to purchase some of Costner 's oil-cleaning machines , which he introduced with much fanfare to the world 's media last month . After investing $ 20m -LRB- # 13.5 m -RRB- of his own money in an effort to develop the technology , Costner says the machines will now be dragged out into the Gulf of Mexico on barges and set to work on the oil slick as soon as possible . Here 's what the machines , which are built by Ocean Therapy Solutions , are said to be able to do : The machines are taken out into the spill area via barges , where they can separate the oil and water . The machines come in different sizes , the largest of which , the V20 , can clean water at a rate of 200 gallons per minute . Depending on the oil to water ratio , the machine has the ability to extract 2,000 barrels of oil a day from the Gulf . Once separation has occurred , the oil is stored in tanks . The water is then more than 99 % clean of crude . Hats off to Costner and his colleagues at Ocean Therapy Solutions for investing so much money and effort in developing these machine , but before we all get too carried away by the good news let 's also invest in a much-needed reality check . The machine can clean 200 gallons of water a minute , says the manufacturer . That sounds impressive , but just how much water is there in the Gulf of Mexico ? According to the US Environmental Protection Agency , the volume of water in the gulf the ninth largest body of water in the world is 643 quadrillion gallons . We do n't get to deal with quadrillions too often in our everyday lives , so let 's put it another way . We 're talking about 643,000,000,000,000,000 gallons of water . So let 's do the maths . Just how long would it take Costner 's machine to rid the Gulf of Mexico of its oil ? Well , if we accept that there are 60 minutes in an hour , 24 hours in a day , and 365 days in a year , then we arrive at the conclusion that it will take the V20 give or take - 6.1 BILLION years to clean up the Gulf of Mexico . Just in guess you are seeking some context : the age of the Earth is estimated to be 4.54 billion years . Ok , I accept that 's being a little unfair . Not all the Gulf of Mexico has -LRB- yet -RRB- been affected by the oil spill . Let 's be generous and say that only one hundredth of the volume of water in the gulf has somehow been tarnished with oil . But that 's still a clean-up time of 60 million years . -LRB- Remember that the current legal limit for oily discharge from a ship is 15 parts of oil to one million parts of water - or 15 parts per million so let 's assume any concentration of oil to water worse than this is unacceptable and requires some form of cleaning . -RRB- Costner says that he will be supplying not one but 32 of his machines to BP . Again , every little helps , but we 're talking about a leak that some experts now say has a flow rate as high as 2.5 million gallons of oil a day . Costner says his machine can get water 99 % free of crude oil . That 's the equivalent of 10,000 parts per million . No matter how you look at it , the sums just do n't seem to add up . These machines appear to be a tokenistic effort at best , a distraction at worst . They might have their uses in , say , lagoons where the water is contained to some extent , but I fail to see how they can have a meaningful impact in the open sea , unless dispatched in their tens of thousands . And that then leads to another interesting question : how much oil would you need to power them all ?

Photograph : Pete Souza\\/White House Press office Fifty-eight days into an environmental disaster which has so far spewed the equivalent in crude oil of 14 Exxon Valdez tankers , and amid rhetorical blunders about `` kicking ass '' , Barack Obama took charge of the oil spill crisis yesterday . The decisive moment arrived behind closed doors and after four hours of negotiations when the US president wrung an agreement from BP executives to put $ 20bn -LRB- # 13.6 bn -RRB- into an independently managed compensation fund . It came hours after one of the lowest points in his presidency , when administration officials admitted the flow of leaking oil could now be 60,000 barrels a day , and commentators savaged his first Oval Office address for lacking specifics . The broad outline of the deal including the figure of $ 20bn had been worked out in advance , but it took hard bargaining before BP would agree to not put a cap on the fund , and to set aside an additional $ 100m for rig workers made unemployed by the pause in offshore drilling . `` There were sticking points , '' Carol Browner , the White House energy adviser said and with the developments yesterday , the suggestion was that it took Obama himself to get them unstuck . She refused to elaborate . Obama was joined in the negotiations by the vice-president , Joe Biden , and five cabinet secretaries , including the homeland security secretary , Janet Napolitano , the interior secretary , Ken Salazar , and the energy secretary , Steven Chu . The White House chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , was in attendance , as were legal advisers . The BP delegation was led by the chairman , Carl-Henric Svanberg , with the chief executive , Tony Hayward , relegated to a secondary role . The oil company also brought a Clinton-era justice department official , Jamie Gorelick . The president was initially scheduled to attend only the first 20 minutes of the meeting in the Roosevelt Room . But he held a private 25-minute conversation with Svanberg in the Oval Office . Obama , who has been criticised for seeming emotionally detached from the crisis , told reporters he had asked Svanberg to keep in mind that many in Louisiana were still struggling to recover from Hurricane Katrina . `` For the small business owners , for the fishermen , for the shrimpers , this is not just a matter of dollars and cents ; a lot of these folks do n't have a cushion , '' Obama said . Svanberg apparently told the president he would keep those people in mind when speaking to the board of BP . Browner also insisted that the deal did not win BP immunity from fines or other punitive measures . `` Nothing was taken off the table with respect to enforcement of the laws , '' she said . The deal brought the first real praise for Obama for his handling of the crisis . Tuesday saw one of the low points for the president after he was accused of failing to rise to the occasion in devoting his first Oval Office address to the spill . `` He looked awkward and robotic , '' said Lynn Sweet , a writer for the Chicago Sun Times who has chronicled Obama 's rise . `` Obama said the right things for the situation but deeds and accomplishments matter , not words . For starters , the underwater gusher is either contained , or it is not . And right now it is not . '' Some suggested that the White House may have inadvertently set Obama up for the negative response by relentlessly promoting the speech and his swing through Gulf states as a turning point . After all that buildup , he failed to offer any new solutions to the spill . Republicans said Obama had missed his last chance to show true leadership in a crisis . `` An Oval Office address is a terrible thing to waste and I think he wasted it , '' said Ari Fleischer , a White House press secretary for George W Bush . Even some fellow Democrats said Obama had failed to rise to the occasion , and there was disappointment from environmentalists at his failure to push proposals on energy and climate change legislation that have stalled in the Senate . But Republicans still accused him of trying to exploit the crisis to advance his energy agenda . `` Somehow he thinks he can use the tragedy in the Gulf as a reason to pass cap-and-trade , '' said James Inhofe , the Oklahoma senator who has dismissed global warming as a hoax .

The much-awaited inquisition of the BP chief executive saw him resort yesterday to the favorite defense of corporate America when hauled up before committees of Congress : `` I do n't recall . '' The strategy may have been legally prudent for Hayward , who was testifying under oath , but it did little to salvage the reputation of a man in the running for title of most reviled executive in America . It also wiped out any goodwill which he may have generated by having started off his testimony with an apology . Seven hours after the executive first walked into the wood-panelled room , the most significant admission the committee could wring out was that , maybe , someone at BP should have realized the drilling of the well was going horribly wrong . `` I think , in the light of what we now know , it is perhaps surprising someone did n't say that they were concerned , '' Hayward said . He also allowed that the well 's safety devices , such as the blow-out preventer , were `` not as fail-safe as we had believed it to be '' . Otherwise , the members of what is actually a sub-committee of the House of Representatives ' energy and commerce committee were repeatedly blocked when they tried to get Hayward to admit any personal and company responsibility for the catastrophe in the Gulf . `` With all due respect , Mr Hayward , I think you 're copping out , '' said Phil Gingrey , a Republican from Georgia . `` You 're captain of the ship . '' Henry Waxman , the energy and commerce committee chairman , accused Hayward of `` kicking the can down the road '' . A Capitol Hill police officer arrests a protester covered in oil who interrupted the congressional hearing . Photograph : Haraz N Ghanbari\\/AP As the day wore on , committee members were even more withering in their attacks . Hayward was told he should quit , mocked for his $ 6m salary , and asked to consider whether a firm with a safety record like BP 's should be banned from America . The discomfort multiplied when Hayward was made to watch a video of Natalie Roshto , widowed by the blowout on BP 's well , and reflect on a photo of a pelican struggling to escape globs of oil . At times , Hayward suggested he was too preoccupied with his other duties as chief executive to follow the progress on the Macondo , which was already known in widening circles as a `` nightmare well '' . `` With respect sir , we drill hundreds of wells around the world , '' he said . `` That 's what 's scaring me now , '' replied Michael Burgess , a Texas Republican . On other occasions , the former geologist disavowed his decades spent in the field for BP , saying he was not involved in , or lacked the technical knowledge of , the crucial decisions in managing the Macondo well . `` I was n't part of the decision-making process on this well , '' he said . `` I am not a cement engineer . '' The evasions , delivered in flat and impassive tones , infuriated committee members . `` I am just amazed at this testimony , '' one said . `` You 're just kicking the can down the road like you have nothing to do with this . '' Members scoffed at Hayward 's claim that he had in his three years as chief executive been devoted to improving safety , pulling out press clippings from 2007 in which he complained of `` excessive caution '' , and having too many people in decision-making . He also got short shrift for saying he was `` distraught '' about what had happened , following a request by Waxman for a `` yes or no '' on whether Hayward had kept to an expressed commitment at his appointment to focus `` like a laser '' on safety . `` I do n't want to know whether you 're distraught ; I want to know whether you 've kept your commitment . '' The anger was fuelled by what Waxman called an astonishing culture of `` corporate complacency '' . The committee reviewed 30,000 pages of documents from BP , but while it was widely known it had a `` nightmare well '' in the Deepwater Horizon , none of those concerns percolated up to Hayward . `` We could find no evidence you paid any attention to the tremendous risks , '' Waxman said . Through the day , that was the theme . Members would read out emails from BP engineers pointing to a disaster waiting to unfold . There were emails acknowledging a problem on the well , and others suggesting BP gleefully over-rode those concerns . `` Who cares , it 's done , end of story , will probably be fine , '' said one email , which authorised a short-cut in positioning the well . `` It appears to me BP knowingly risked well failure to save a few million dollars , '' said Waxman . `` Do n't you feel any responsibility for those decisions ? '' Hayward replied : `` I feel a great deal of responsibility for the accident . '' But if the committee wanted further information on decisions to ignore warning signs , he would be of little help . `` I ca n't pass judgment on those decisions . I am not prepared to draw conclusions about this accident , until such time as this investigation is complete , '' he said . `` I simply was not involved in the decision-making process . I have n't drawn a conclusion . '' There were moments of sympathy for Hayward , and even light relief . Joe Barton , a Texas Republican , said it was shameful BP had been compelled to agree to pay $ 20bn into an independently managed fund for victims of the spill . `` I apologise , '' he said . `` I do not want to live in a country where every time a corporation does something wrong , it 's subject to a political process that amounts to a shakedown . '' Hours later , however , Barton apologised for his apology . Parker Griffin of Alabama , who recently switched from the Democratic to the Republican parties only to lose a primary election , suggested the devastation caused by the spill was as nothing against the dangers of cigarette smoking . `` The greatest environmental disaster in America is cigarettes : 60,000 Americans this year will die from cigarette-related diseases , so if we 're talking about the environment , let 's not leave that out . '' But the tone overwhelmingly was an anger Hayward failed to assuage and may even have inflamed . `` When you operate on our land and in our waters , you are only there because the public trust allowed you to be there , '' said Democrat Mike Doyle . `` You violated that public trust .

Photograph : Haraz Ghanbari\\/AP BP 's out-of-control well will go on spewing oil into the Gulf of Mexico for the next two years or more if all attempts to contain or plug the gusher fail , oil industry experts said today . The estimates , based on new figures supplied by BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , during seven contentious hours of testimony to Congress on Thursday , suggest the potential environmental and economic devastation would far outstrip the damage done so far by the ruptured well , which has been spewing for 60 days . Hayward told a Congressional committee on Thursday the reservoir still held 50m barrels , providing fresh urgency to efforts to contain the oil , or seal off the gusher completely with a relief well . Using the government 's present flow estimates of up to 60,000 barrels a day , BP 's well could go on gushing for two to four years , unless it is stopped . BP and the administration say they are containing a rising share of the oil from the well , and hope to plug the gusher completely by August , when two relief wells will be complete . BP said today that the relief wells were within 60 metres of the ruptured well . The consequences of failure are enormous . `` If it went uncontrolled it could certainly leak for two years and certainly longer than that , said Philip Johnson , a professor of petroleum engineering at the University of Alabama . But he said the leak rate would fall sharply over time once the natural gas in the reservoir is exhausted . `` That is the driving force , '' he said . `` As soon as that is gone , it wo n't leak at any serious rate . '' Hayward 's statement to Congress represents the first definitive word so far from BP on the potential it saw in the Macondo well . BP exploration plans , submitted to the US government , had suggested production in the order of 15,000 barrels a day , a figure confirmed by Hayward to Congress . But the 50m figure cited by Hayward took some industry insiders by surprise . There have been reports the reservoir held up to 500m barrels the figure quoted by Hayward 's questioner , Joe Barton , a Republican from Texas . `` I would assume that 500m barrels would be a more likely estimate , '' said Tadeusz Patzek , the chairman of the department of petroleum and geosystems engineering at the University of Texas at Austin . `` I do n't think you would be going after a 50mbarrel reservoir so quickly . This is just simply not enough oil to go after . '' BP spokesmen said that Barton was referring to recoverable oil rather than the total size of the reservoir . `` We have n't made an assessment of the reserves as far as I know , '' said Toby Odone , a BP spokesman . `` You start evaluating the reservoir once you complete the well . Obviously we did n't get to that point . '' The figure was one of the few kernels of solid information offered up by Hayward , who was widely criticised for stonewalling and obfuscation in his appearance before Congress . The performance did little for BP 's financial position . Its shares fell back today after Moody 's cut the company 's credit rating to A2 . Moody 's said it was concerned about the escalating costs of the oil spill , and warned the $ 20bn -LRB- # 13,5 bn -RRB- compensation fund agreed earlier this week might not cover all of BP 's liabilities . `` This assessment reflects a substantial upward revision of the estimated size of the leak , the continued failure to bring the leaking Macondo well under control , and the mounting costs and claims for damages , '' the ratings agency said . `` Uncertainty over the ultimate cost for massive litigation claims and other contingent liabilities will be an overhang on BP 's creditworthiness that will persist for years to come , '' it added . Ken Feinberg , who was appointed to oversee the $ 20bn claims fund , has promised to turn around claims within 60 days . However , Hayward did get a vote of sympathy from John Hofmeister , a former president of Shell , who has himself testified to Congress on six occasions . He noted Hayward was operating under the threat of criminal investigation , and said he would have taken a similar legalistic approach were he in the same situation . `` It 's not possible for a CEO to know everything that is going on at every level of production , '' he told MSNBC television . `` The Congressmen are very unfair to demand he know what happened at a meeting that took place four or five levels below him .

Photograph : Sean Gardner\\/AP British shareholders are to join a US class action lawsuit pursuing BP for alleged securities fraud over the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster , the Guardian has learned . American lawyers have already filed more than 180 lawsuits related to the spill , mostly against the company over the environmental and economic damage caused across the region . BP shareholders the majority of them based outside the more litigious US have been slower to table their own claims . But Robert Schachter , partner at Zwerling , Schachter & Zwerling , said that several British institutional investors had contacted him about joining the class action his New York-based firm recently filed . He said he was confident that at least one British investor would be named as a plaintiff next month in order to make it more likely that British institutions would share in any payout . However , BP could challenge the right of British and other non-US investors to recover damages through the US courts . Lawyers will allege that BP 's management , led by its chief executive , Tony Hayward , misrepresented the company 's true safety record , thereby artificially inflating its share price . When Hayward took over in 2007 , he promised to focus `` like a laser '' on safety after the 2005 explosion at BP 's Texas City refinery , which killed 15 workers , and the oil spill from a BP-owned Alaska pipeline in 2006 . But US politicians have been hearing evidence that BP engineers did not follow correct drilling procedures before the Gulf of Mexico explosion on 20 April . Hayward admitted last month that the company did not have a proper plan in place to deal with such an accident . BP agreed this week that it would set up a $ 20bn -LRB- # 13.5 bn -RRB- escrow account to fund the clean-up and damages for those affected , such as people working in the fishing and tourism industries . Daniel Becnel from Becnel Law Firm , known as the `` Tort King '' because of his track record securing substantial damages from companies , said that he and other lawyers would pursue those claims against BP not covered by the escrow account in the courts . BP and lawyers such as Becnel are already wrangling over where the majority of these cases will be heard . The oil company wants them to be heard in Houston , where its US operations are based . But Becnel wants most claims to be heard near where those affected live , for example in New Orleans . The amount of oil being captured from the leaking well BP is aiming to collect 50,000 barrels a day by the end of the month could also expose the company to further litigation . BP has promised that all the profits it generates from the collected oil will go towards the clean-up , but it is not clear if this is in addition to what the company has to pay anyway . Camilo Salas , a New Orleans-based attorney , said that the faulty well , which was drilled for exploration purposes , should now be classified as a production well and BP stripped of its licence to operate the lease . This could lead to a further legal battle over the ownership of what is likely to be a huge oil find . BP has beefed up its in-house legal department by hiring the Chicago-based Kirkland & Ellis , one of the largest corporate law firms in the US .

Photograph : Mark Ralston\\/AFP It looks as if the Louisiana Shrimp and Petroleum Festival is still going ahead this year . `` Please join us for our 75th annual festival to be held September 2-6 , 2010 , in picturesque downtown Morgan City , Louisiana , '' says its website . `` This is an event that will prove that oil and water really do mix . '' Morgan City , a small town dependent on both shrimping and the oil trade , lies about 70 miles west of New Orleans and is still untouched by the BP oil slick . But you 'd have thought that the disaster , which threatens the very survival of Louisiana 's seafood industry , would have made Morgan City feel a little uneasy about celebrating `` the unique way in which these two seemingly different industries work hand-in-hand culturally and environmentally in this area of the ` Cajun Coast ' , '' but it does n't seem to have . I 've been staying for a few days with my old friend Julia Reed and her husband John in their magnificent , Greek-revival house in the Garden District of New Orleans , a leafy neighborhood of Victorian merchant palaces far removed from the noise and congestion of the picturesque French Quarter . They had just bought and renovated their house when they precipitately had to abandon it to Hurricane Katrina , which it mercifully survived almost intact . It was in Julia 's book about the experience that I learned of the existence of the Shrimp and Petroleum Festival , an heroic but doomed attempt by Louisianians to persuade themselves that the two main sources of their livelihood are compatible . The importance they attach to both industries explains the fact that there is almost as much anger with President Obama for ordering a moratorium on deepwater oil-drilling , thus threatening the survival of the Louisiana oil industry , as there is with BP for polluting its fishing grounds and oyster beds . A visitor to New Orleans at the moment would n't realize at first that anything was amiss . The oil that is washing up elsewhere on the state 's shores does n't yet encroach on its main city , which , having finally emerged from the Katrina nightmare , is full of life and bustle . But you soon sense the anxiety and anger that people are feeling the `` small people '' , as the chairman of BP misguidedly called them this week . They are not only fearful for their futures ; they feel overlooked and neglected by Washington . New Orleanians are convinced that elsewhere in America such a disaster would not have been allowed to happen ; or that if it did happen , in , say , New York or California , urgent and decisive action would have been taken by the federal government to mitigate its effects . President Bush 's botched response to Hurricane Katrina , and a belief that the Mississippi would never in any case have broken its banks if the levees had been properly maintained , has left New Orleanians drained of confidence in Washington and its ways . Despite President Obama 's four visits to the area , his promise to restore the Gulf Coast to its former glory , and his widely lauded achievement in getting BP to put aside 20 billion dollars to cover compensation claims , an opinion poll yesterday found that most Louisianians think that Bush handled Katrina better than Obama is handling the oil disaster . The president must partly blame himself for this perception . Despite being begged to take control of the clean-up away from the hated BP , he has looked too often like a helpless observer of events . When he said he would fire Tony Hayward , the BP chief executive , if he were working for him , and that he was looking around to see `` whose ass to kick '' , he merely reinforced this impression . Carl-Henric Svanberg 's insistence on Wednesday that he cared about `` small people '' is the latest in a series of gaffes by BP that have convinced Louisianians that the company is arrogant and heartless . -LRB- `` We 're not small people , '' said one New Orleans resident , quoted in the Washington Post . `` We 're human beings . They 're no greater than us . We do n't bow down to them . '' -RRB- Before Svanberg 's `` slip in translation '' Hayward had been the main culprit . When he said `` I would like my life back '' , he seemed to forget that 11 oil rig workers had lost their lives for ever . And it did n't go down well when he said that the `` oil spill '' -LRB- as it is strangely called , even when millions of tonnes of the stuff are involved -RRB- was small compared to the size of the ocean ; or when he said he anticipated getting `` lots of illegitimate -LRB- compensation -RRB- claims '' because `` this is America '' . There is no doubt that BP is hated in New Orleans . The popular Rivershack Tavern has created a new cocktail called `` gold shit '' in honor of the company that `` has ruined our waters '' . A friend of mine filled up his car at a petrol station at which the BP sunburst logo had been clumsily covered up by the shell emblem of a rival oil company . Even so , I ca n't say I have found any evidence that loathing of BP has turned into loathing of the British in general . But it could be there and unspoken , for New Orleanians are habitually polite to tourists , whoever they may be . There was one ugly moment at Felix 's oyster bar on the Rue Iberville when an American friend thought it would be amusing to introduce me as a BP representative . There was a momentary look of murder in the oyster shucker 's eyes , but he must have decided it was a joke , for he was perfectly friendly thereafter . I rewarded him with a large tip . cents This article was amended on 18 June 2010 . The original referred to New Orleans as Louisiana 's capital . This has been corrected .

And no amount of money not BP s $ 20bn , not $ 100bn can replace a culture that s lost its roots . Photograph : Lee Celano\\/Reuters Everyone gathered for the town hall meeting had been repeatedly instructed to show civility to the gentlemen from BP and the federal government . These fine folks had made time in their busy schedules to come to a high school gymnasium on a Tuesday night in Plaquemines Parish , Louisiana , one of many coastal communities where brown poison was slithering through the marshes , part of what has come to be described as the largest environmental disaster in US history . `` Speak to others the way you would want to be spoken to , '' the chair of the meeting pleaded one last time before opening the floor for questions . And for a while the crowd , mostly made up of fishing families , showed remarkable restraint . They listened patiently to Larry Thomas , a genial BP public relations flack , as he told them that he was committed to `` doing better '' to process their claims for lost revenue then passed all the details off to a markedly less friendly subcontractor . They heard out the suit from the Environmental Protection Agency as he informed them that , contrary to what they have read about the lack of testing and the product being banned in Britain , the chemical dispersant being sprayed on the oil in massive quantities was really perfectly safe . But patience started running out by the third time Ed Stanton , a coast guard captain , took to the podium to reassure them that `` the coast guard intends to make sure that BP cleans it up '' . `` Put it in writing ! '' By now the air conditioning had shut itself off and the coolers of Budweiser were running low . A shrimper named Matt O'Brien approached the mic . `` We do n't need to hear this anymore , '' he declared , hands on hips . It did n't matter what assurances they were offered because , he explained , `` we just do n't trust you guys ! '' And with that , such a loud cheer rose up from the floor you 'd have thought the Oilers -LRB- the unfortunately named school football team -RRB- had scored a touchdown . The showdown was cathartic , if nothing else . For weeks residents had been subjected to a barrage of pep talks and extravagant promises coming from Washington , Houston and London . Every time they turned on their TVs , there was the BP boss , Tony Hayward , offering his solemn word that he would `` make it right '' . Or else it was President Barack Obama expressing his absolute confidence that his administration would `` leave the Gulf coast in better shape than it was before '' , that he was `` making sure '' it `` comes back even stronger than it was before this crisis '' . It all sounded great . But for people whose livelihoods put them in intimate contact with the delicate chemistry of the wetlands , it also sounded completely ridiculous , painfully so . Once the oil coats the base of the marsh grass , as it had already done just a few miles from here , no miracle machine or chemical concoction could safely get it out . You can skim oil off the surface of open water , and you can rake it off a sandy beach , but an oiled marsh just sits there , slowly dying . The larvae of countless species for which the marsh is a spawning ground shrimp , crab , oysters and fin fish will be poisoned . It was already happening . Earlier that day , I traveled through nearby marshes in a shallow water boat . Fish were jumping in waters encircled by white boom , the strips of thick cotton and mesh BP is using to soak up the oil . The circle of fouled material seemed to be tightening around the fish like a noose . Nearby , a red-winged blackbird perched atop a 2 metre -LRB- 7ft -RRB- blade of oil-contaminated marsh grass . Death was creeping up the cane ; the small bird may as well have been standing on a lit stick of dynamite . And then there is the grass itself , or the Roseau cane , as the tall sharp blades are called . If oil seeps deeply enough into the marsh , it will not only kill the grass above ground but also the roots . Those roots are what hold the marsh together , keeping bright green land from collapsing into the Mississippi River delta and the Gulf of Mexico . So not only do places like Plaquemines Parish stand to lose their fisheries , but also much of the physical barrier that lessens the intensity of fierce storms like hurricane Katrina . Which could mean losing everything . How long will it take for an ecosystem this ravaged to be `` restored and made whole '' as Obama 's interior secretary has pledged to do ? It 's not at all clear that such a thing is remotely possible , at least not in a time frame we can easily wrap our heads around . The Alaskan fisheries have yet to fully recover from the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill and some species of fish never returned . Government scientists now estimate that as much as a Valdez-worth of oil may be entering the Gulf coastal waters every four days . An even worse prognosis emerges from the 1991 Gulf war spill , when an estimated 11m barrels of oil were dumped into the Persian Gulf the largest spill ever . That oil entered the marshland and stayed there , burrowing deeper and deeper thanks to holes dug by crabs . It 's not a perfect comparison , since so little clean-up was done , but according to a study conducted 12 years after the disaster , nearly 90 % of the impacted muddy salt marshes and mangroves were still profoundly damaged . We do know this . Far from being `` made whole , '' the Gulf coast , more than likely , will be diminished . Its rich waters and crowded skies will be less alive than they are today . The physical space many communities occupy on the map will also shrink , thanks to erosion . And the coast 's legendary culture will contract and wither . The fishing families up and down the coast do not just gather food , after all . They hold up an intricate network that includes family tradition , cuisine , music , art and endangered languages much like the roots of grass holding up the land in the marsh . Without fishing , these unique cultures lose their root system , the very ground on which they stand . -LRB- BP , for its part , is well aware of the limits of recovery . The company 's Gulf of Mexico regional oil spill response plan specifically instructs officials not to make `` promises that property , ecology , or anything else will be restored to normal '' . Which is no doubt why its officials consistently favor folksy terms like `` make it right '' . -RRB- If Katrina pulled back the curtain on the reality of racism in America , the BP disaster pulls back the curtain on something far more hidden : how little control even the most ingenious among us have over the awesome , intricately interconnected natural forces with which we so casually meddle . BP can not plug the hole in the Earth that it made . Obama can not order fish species to survive , or brown pelicans not to go extinct -LRB- no matter whose ass he kicks -RRB- . No amount of money not BP 's recently pledged $ 20bn -LRB- # 13.5 bn -RRB- , not $ 100bn can replace a culture that has lost its roots . And while our politicians and corporate leaders have yet to come to terms with these humbling truths , the people whose air , water and livelihoods have been contaminated are losing their illusions fast . `` Everything is dying , '' a woman said as the town hall meeting was finally coming to a close . `` How can you honestly tell us that our Gulf is resilient and will bounce back ? Because not one of you up here has a hint as to what is going to happen to our Gulf . You sit up here with a straight face and act like you know when you do n't know . '' This Gulf coast crisis is about many things corruption , deregulation , the addiction to fossil fuels . But underneath it all , it 's about this : our culture 's excruciatingly dangerous claim to have such complete understanding and command over nature that we can radically manipulate and re-engineer it with minimal risk to the natural systems that sustain us . But as the BP disaster has revealed , nature is always more unpredictable than the most sophisticated mathematical and geological models imagine . During Thursday 's congressional testimony , Hayward said : `` The best minds and the deepest expertise are being brought to bear '' on the crisis , and that , `` with the possible exception of the space program in the 1960s , it is difficult to imagine the gathering of a larger , more technically proficient team in one place in peacetime . '' And yet , in the face of what the geologist Jill Schneiderman has described as `` Pandora 's well '' , they are like the men at the front of that gymnasium : they act like they know , but they do n't know . In the arc of human history , the notion that nature is a machine for us to re-engineer at will is a relatively recent conceit . In her ground-breaking 1980 book The Death of Nature , the environmental historian Carolyn Merchant reminded readers that up until the 1600s , the Earth was alive , usually taking the form of a mother . Europeans like indigenous people the world over believed the planet to be a living organism , full of life-giving powers but also wrathful tempers . There were , for this reason , strong taboos against actions that would deform and desecrate `` the mother '' , including mining . The metaphor changed with the unlocking of some -LRB- but by no means all -RRB- of nature 's mysteries during the scientific revolution of the 1600s . With nature now cast as a machine , devoid of mystery or divinity , its component parts could be dammed , extracted and remade with impunity . Nature still sometimes appeared as a woman , but one easily dominated and subdued . Sir Francis Bacon best encapsulated the new ethos when he wrote in the 1623 De dignitate et augmentis scientiarum that nature is to be `` put in constraint , moulded , and made as it were new by art and the hand of man '' . Those words may as well have been BP 's corporate mission statement . Boldly inhabiting what the company called `` the energy frontier '' , it dabbled in synthesising methane-producing microbes and announced that `` a new area of investigation '' would be geoengineering . And of course it bragged that , at its Tiber prospect in the Gulf of Mexico , it now had `` the deepest well ever drilled by the oil and gas industry '' as deep under the ocean floor as jets fly overhead . Imagining and preparing for what would happen if these experiments in altering the building blocks of life and geology went wrong occupied precious little space in the corporate imagination . As we have all discovered , after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on 20 April , the company had no systems in place to effectively respond to this scenario . Explaining why it did not have even the ultimately unsuccessful containment dome waiting to be activated on shore , a BP spokesman , Steve Rinehart , said : `` I do n't think anybody foresaw the circumstance that we 're faced with now . '' Apparently , it `` seemed inconceivable '' that the blowout preventer would ever fail so why prepare ? This refusal to contemplate failure clearly came straight from the top . A year ago , Hayward told a group of graduate students at Stanford University that he has a plaque on his desk that reads : `` If you knew you could not fail , what would you try ? '' Far from being a benign inspirational slogan , this was actually an accurate description of how BP and its competitors behaved in the real world . In recent hearings on Capitol Hill , congressman Ed Markey of Massachusetts grilled representatives from the top oil and gas companies on the revealing ways in which they had allocated resources . Over three years , they had spent `` $ 39bn to explore for new oil and gas . Yet , the average investment in research and development for safety , accident prevention and spill response was a paltry $ 20m a year . '' These priorities go a long way towards explaining why the initial exploration plan that BP submitted to the federal government for the ill-fated Deepwater Horizon well reads like a Greek tragedy about human hubris . The phrase `` little risk '' appears five times . Even if there is a spill , BP confidently predicts that , thanks to `` proven equipment and technology '' , adverse affects will be minimal . Presenting nature as a predictable and agreeable junior partner -LRB- or perhaps subcontractor -RRB- , the report cheerfully explains that should a spill occur , `` Currents and microbial degradation would remove the oil from the water column or dilute the constituents to background levels '' . The effects on fish , meanwhile , `` would likely be sublethal '' because of `` the capability of adult fish and shellfish to avoid a spill -LRB- and -RRB- to metabolise hydrocarbons '' . -LRB- In BP 's telling , rather than a dire threat , a spill emerges as an all-you-can-eat buffet for aquatic life . -RRB- Best of all , should a major spill occur , there is , apparently , `` little risk of contact or impact to the coastline '' because of the company 's projected speedy response -LRB- ! -RRB- and `` due to the distance -LRB- of the rig -RRB- to shore '' about 48 miles -LRB- 77km -RRB- . This is the most astonishing claim of all . In a gulf that often sees winds of more than 70km an hour , not to mention hurricanes , BP had so little respect for the ocean 's capacity to ebb and flow , surge and heave , that it did not think oil could make a paltry 77km trip . -LRB- Last week , a shard of the exploded Deepwater Horizon showed up on a beach in Florida , 306km away . -RRB- None of this sloppiness would have been possible , however , had BP not been making its predictions to a political class eager to believe that nature had indeed been mastered . Some , like Republican Lisa Murkowski , were more eager than others . The Alaskan senator was so awe-struck by the industry 's four-dimensional seismic imaging that she proclaimed deep-sea drilling to have reached the very height of controlled artificiality . `` It 's better than Disneyland in terms of how you can take technologies and go after a resource that is thousands of years old and do so in an environmentally sound way , '' she told the Senate energy committee just seven months ago . Drilling without thinking has of course been Republican party policy since May 2008 . With gas prices soaring to unprecedented heights , that 's when the conservative leader Newt Gingrich unveiled the slogan `` Drill Here , Drill Now , Pay Less '' with an emphasis on the now . The wildly popular campaign was a cry against caution , against study , against measured action . In Gingrich 's telling , drilling at home wherever the oil and gas might be locked in Rocky Mountain shale , in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , and deep offshore was a surefire way to lower the price at the pump , create jobs , and kick Arab ass all at once . In the face of this triple win , caring about the environment was for sissies : as senator Mitch McConnell put it , `` in Alabama and Mississippi and Louisiana and Texas , they think oil rigs are pretty '' . By the time the infamous `` Drill Baby Drill '' Republican national convention rolled around , the party base was in such a frenzy for US-made fossil fuels , they would have bored under the convention floor if someone had brought a big enough drill . Obama , eventually , gave in , as he invariably does . With cosmic bad timing , just three weeks before the Deepwater Horizon blew up , the president announced he would open up previously protected parts of the country to offshore drilling . The practice was not as risky as he had thought , he explained . `` Oil rigs today generally do n't cause spills . They are technologically very advanced . '' That was n't enough for Sarah Palin , however , who sneered at the Obama administration 's plans to conduct more studies before drilling in some areas . `` My goodness , folks , these areas have been studied to death , '' she told the Southern Republican leadership conference in New Orleans , now just 11 days before the blowout . `` Let 's drill , baby , drill , not stall , baby , stall ! '' And there was much rejoicing . In his congressional testimony , Hayward said : `` We and the entire industry will learn from this terrible event . '' And one might well imagine that a catastrophe of this magnitude would indeed instil BP executives and the `` Drill Now '' crowd with a new sense of humility . There are , however , no signs that this is the case . The response to the disaster at the corporate and governmental levels has been rife with the precise brand of arrogance and overly sunny predictions that created the disaster in the first place . The ocean is big , she can take it , we heard from Hayward in the early days . While spokesman John Curry insisted that hungry microbes would consume whatever oil was in the water system , because `` nature has a way of helping the situation '' . But nature has not been playing along . The deep-sea gusher has bust out of all BP 's top hats , containment domes , and junk shots . The ocean 's winds and currents have made a mockery of the lightweight booms BP has laid out to absorb the oil . `` We told them , '' said Byron Encalade , the president of the Louisiana Oysters Association . `` The oil 's gonna go over the booms or underneath the bottom . '' The marine biologist Rick Steiner , who has been following the clean up closely , estimates that `` 70 % or 80 % of the booms are doing absolutely nothing at all '' . And then there are the controversial chemical dispersants : more than 1.3 m gallons dumped with the company 's trademark `` what could go wrong ? '' As the angry residents at the Plaquemines Parish town hall rightly point out , few tests had been conducted , and there is scant research about what this unprecedented amount of dispersed oil will do to marine life . Nor is there a way to clean up the toxic mixture of oil and chemicals below the surface . Yes , fast multiplying microbes do devour underwater oil but in the process they also absorb the water 's oxygen , creating a whole new threat to marine life . BP had even dared to imagine that it could prevent unflattering images of oil-covered beaches and birds from escaping the disaster zone . When I was on the water with a TV crew , for instance , we were approached by another boat whose captain asked , '' `` Y ' all work for BP ? '' When we said no , the response in the open ocean was `` You ca n't be here then '' . But of course these heavy-handed tactics , like all the others , have failed . There is simply too much oil in too many places . `` You can not tell God 's air where to flow and go , and you ca n't tell water where to flow and go , '' I was told by Debra Ramirez . It was a lesson she had learned from living in Mossville , Louisiana , surrounded by 14 emission-spewing petrochemical plants , and watching illness spread from neighbor to neighbor . Human limitation has been the one constant of this catastrophe . After two months , we still have no idea how much oil is flowing , nor when it will stop . The company 's claim that it will complete relief wells by the end of August repeated by Obama in his Oval Office address is seen by many scientists as a bluff . The procedure is risky and could fail , and there is a real possibility that the oil could continue to leak for years . The flow of denial shows no sign of abating either . Louisiana politicians indignantly oppose Obama 's temporary freeze on deepwater drilling , accusing him of killing the one big industry left standing now that fishing and tourism are in crisis . Palin mused on Facebook that `` no human endeavor is ever without risk '' , while Texas Republican congressman John Culberson described the disaster as a `` statistical anomaly '' . By far the most sociopathic reaction , however , comes from veteran Washington commentator Llewellyn King : rather than turning away from big engineering risks , we should pause in `` wonder that we can build machines so remarkable that they can lift the lid off the underworld '' . Thankfully , many are taking a very different lesson from the disaster , standing not in wonder at humanity 's power to reshape nature , but at our powerlessness to cope with the fierce natural forces we unleash . There is something else too . It is the feeling that the hole at the bottom of the ocean is more than an engineering accident or a broken machine . It is a violent wound in a living organism ; that it is part of us . And thanks to BP 's live camera feed , we can all watch the Earth 's guts gush forth , in real time , 24 hours a day . John Wathen , a conservationist with the Waterkeeper Alliance , was one of the few independent observers to fly over the spill in the early days of the disaster . After filming the thick red streaks of oil that the coast guard politely refers to as `` rainbow sheen '' , he observed what many had felt : `` The Gulf seems to be bleeding . '' This imagery comes up again and again in conversations and interviews . Monique Harden , an environmental rights lawyer in New Orleans , refuses to call the disaster an `` oil spill '' and instead says , `` we are hemorrhaging '' . Others speak of the need to `` make the bleeding stop '' . And I was personally struck , flying over the stretch of ocean where the Deepwater Horizon sank with the US Coast Guard , that the swirling shapes the oil made in the ocean waves looked remarkably like cave drawings : a feathery lung gasping for air , eyes staring upwards , a prehistoric bird . Messages from the deep . And this is surely the strangest twist in the Gulf coast saga : it seems to be waking us up to the reality that the Earth never was a machine . After 400 years of being declared dead , and in the middle of so much death , the Earth is coming alive . The experience of following the oil 's progress through the ecosystem is a kind of crash course in deep ecology . Every day we learn more about how what seems to be a terrible problem in one isolated part of the world actually radiates out in ways most of us could never have imagined . One day we learn that the oil could reach Cuba then Europe . Next we hear that fishermen all the way up the Atlantic in Prince Edward Island , Canada , are worried because the Bluefin tuna they catch off their shores are born thousands of miles away in those oil-stained Gulf waters . And we learn , too , that for birds , the Gulf coast wetlands are the equivalent of a busy airport hub everyone seems to have a stopover : 110 species of migratory songbirds and 75 % of all migratory US waterfowl . It 's one thing to be told by an incomprehensible chaos theorist that a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can set off a tornado in Texas . It 's another to watch chaos theory unfold before your eyes . Carolyn Merchant puts the lesson like this : `` The problem as BP has tragically and belatedly discovered is that nature as an active force can not be so confined . '' Predictable outcomes are unusual within ecological systems , while `` unpredictable , chaotic events -LRB- are -RRB- usual '' . And just in case we still did n't get it , a few days ago , a bolt of lightning struck a BP ship like an exclamation mark , forcing it to suspend its containment efforts . And do n't even mention what a hurricane would do to BP 's toxic soup . There is , it must be stressed , something uniquely twisted about this particular path to enlightenment . They say that Americans learn where foreign countries are by bombing them . Now it seems we are all learning about nature 's circulatory systems by poisoning them . In the late 90s , an isolated indigenous group in Colombia captured world headlines with an almost Avatar-esque conflict . From their remote home in the Andean cloud forests , the U'wa let it be known that if Occidental Petroleum carried out plans to drill for oil on their territory , they would commit mass ritual suicide by jumping off a cliff . Their elders explained that oil is part of ruiria , `` the blood of Mother Earth '' . They believe that all life , including their own , flows from ruiria , so pulling out the oil would bring on their destruction . -LRB- Oxy eventually withdrew from the region , saying there was n't as much oil as it had previously thought . -RRB- Virtually all indigenous cultures have myths about gods and spirits living in the natural world in rocks , mountains , glaciers , forests as did European culture before the scientific revolution . Katja Neves , an anthropologist at Concordia University , points out that the practice serves a practical purpose . Calling the Earth `` sacred '' is another way of expressing humility in the face of forces we do not fully comprehend . When something is sacred , it demands that we proceed with caution . If we are absorbing this lesson at long last , the implications could be profound . Public support for increased offshore drilling is dropping precipitously , down 22 % from the peak of the `` Drill Now '' frenzy . The issue is not dead , however . It is only a matter of time before the Obama administration announces that , thanks to ingenious new technology and tough new regulations , it is now perfectly safe to drill in the deep sea , even in the Arctic , where an under-ice clean up would be infinitely more complex than the one underway in the Gulf . But perhaps this time we wo n't be so easily reassured , so quick to gamble with the few remaining protected havens . Same goes for geoengineering . As climate change negotiations wear on , we should be ready to hear more from Dr Steven Koonin , Obama 's undersecretary of energy for science . He is one of the leading proponents of the idea that climate change can be combated with techno tricks like releasing sulphate and aluminium particles into the atmosphere and of course it 's all perfectly safe , just like Disneyland ! He also happens to be BP 's former chief scientist , the man who just 15 months ago was still overseeing the technology behind BP 's supposedly safe charge into deepwater drilling . Maybe this time we will opt not to let the good doctor experiment with the physics and chemistry of the Earth , and choose instead to reduce our consumption and shift to renewable energies that have the virtue that , when they fail , they fail small . As US comedian Bill Maher put it , `` You know what happens when windmills collapse into the sea ? The most positive possible outcome of this disaster would be not only an acceleration of renewable energy sources like wind , but a full embrace of the precautionary principle in science . The mirror opposite of Hayward 's `` If you knew you could not fail '' credo , the precautionary principle holds that `` when an activity raises threats of harm to the environment or human health '' we tread carefully , as if failure were possible , even likely . Perhaps we can even get Hayward a new desk plaque to contemplate as he signs compensation cheques . `` You act like you know , but you do n't know .

Photograph : Chris Kleponis\\/AFP\\/Getty BP has come under further pressure after one of its partners said the oil giant should foot the entire bill for the damage caused by the Gulf of Mexico spill . Anadarko Petroleum , which owns a quarter of the ruptured Deepwater Horizon well , refused to accept any blame for the explosion that killed 11 workers and led to the US 's worst environmental disaster . The company 's chairman and chief executive , Jim Hackett , said in a statement BP 's actions probably amounted to `` gross negligence or wilful misconduct '' . BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward , who was grilled about the disaster by Congress for seven hours on Thursday , said he `` strongly disagreed '' with the allegation and expected the firm 's partners to `` live up to their obligations '' . The spat between the two companies came as industry experts warned that the out-of-control well will go on spewing oil into the Gulf of Mexico for the next two years or more if all attempts to contain or plug the gusher fail . The estimates , based on new figures supplied by Hayward , suggest the potential environmental and economic devastation would far outstrip the damage done so far by the ruptured well , which has been spewing for 60 days . Hayward told a Congressional committee on Thursday that the reservoir still held 50m barrels , providing fresh urgency to efforts to contain the oil , or seal off the gusher completely with a relief well . Using the government 's present flow estimates of up to 60,000 barrels a day , BP 's well could go on gushing for two to four years , unless it is stopped . BP and the US government say they are containing a rising share of the oil from the well , and hope to plug the gusher completely by August , when two relief wells will be complete . BP said today the relief wells were within 60 metres of the ruptured well . The consequences of failure are enormous . `` If it went on uncontrolled , it could certainly leak for two years and certainly longer than that , '' said Philip Johnson , a professor of petroleum engineering at the University of Alabama . But he said the rate of the leak would fall sharply once the natural gas in the reservoir is exhausted . `` That is the driving force , '' he said . `` As soon as that is gone , it wo n't leak at any serious rate . '' Yesterday , BP 's chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said Hayward had been relieved of day-to-day control of the spill and that the company 's managing director Bob Dudley would take over . Svanberg admitted the oil rig explosion was a `` tragic one '' which `` should never have happened '' . He denied claims by the Russian president Dmitry Medvedev that BP faced possible `` annihilation '' over the spill . `` I think we have to put everything in perspective , of course this is a huge thing , it is a huge setback for BP -LRB- but -RRB- the company is strong , the company has strong underlying performance , strong cash flow , strong operations , '' Svanberg said . Hayward has pledged that BP will foot the entire clean-up bill but insisted it is `` too early to say '' what caused the massive spill .

Photograph : Spencer Platt\\/Getty Images The Mimosa Dancing Girls strip joint on the edge of New Orleans was probably not what BP chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg had in mind when he promised last week that the company would look after the `` small people '' affected by the Gulf oil spill . But then every day seems to be full of unpleasant surprises for BP . The Mimosa 's owners have just filed a claim for compensation because the fishermen who make up their clientele can no longer afford to frequent the club . BP says that most of the 1,500 claims it is handling across the Gulf each day are from those involved in the fishing industry , unable to work because of the fishing ban . But at BP 's New Orleans claims center , officials say that fishermen no longer make up the bulk of the claimants they see . As well as strip-joint owners , in recent days restaurant waitresses , dock workers , plumbers and electricians have all been through the door . Like the gloops of brown oil that are spreading across the Gulf of Mexico , the economic ripple effects of the disaster are widening . Tourism and the fishing industry are big earners in the region and have been severely hit , but so too have all the other workers who make a living from their custom . Last week BP , under pressure from the White House , agreed to set up a $ 20bn independently administered fund to pay for the clean-up and meet compensation claims . Lawyers say that $ 20bn will not be enough , and this weekend Kenneth Feinberg , the man appointed by US President Barack Obama to run it , warned BP that it would have to pay out more if necessary . The pressure increased still further after one of BP 's partners on the ill-fated drilling operation which caused the disaster accused the company of `` gross negligence '' . Anadarko said that financial responsibility to meet compensation claims lay squarely with BP . Feinberg is set to take control of the 33 claims centres BP administers around the Gulf . The size and number of the payouts will almost certainly increase as a result . Frustration is mounting over BP 's efforts to date . It only increased yesterday after BP confirmed that its chief executive , Tony Hayward , spent the first weekend after his testimony to Congress watching a yacht race at the Isle of Wight . As the public vented their anger on Twitter and Facebook , a BP spokesman defended Hayward , saying he took a break from overseeing efforts to stem the oil spill so he could watch his 52-foot yacht `` Bob '' take part . `` He 's spending a few hours with his family at a weekend . I 'm sure that everyone would understand that , '' he added . A report from a US House of Representatives committee estimated that , as of Tuesday last week , BP had paid just $ 71m out of an estimated $ 600m in outstanding compensation demands . BP says that it has not refused any claim where the right documentation is provided . Darryl Willis , BP 's head of the claims operation for the Gulf of Mexico , admitted to the Observer that about 7,000 applications half those currently in the system have been suspended until claimants can come up with documents which prove that the Gulf spill has affected their livelihoods . Many of the fishermen are poor Vietnamese , who speak no English , and are paid cash in hand . Willis says BP is flexible in seeking proof of loss of income , for example asking for receipts for the fish they have sold in the past instead of insisting on payslips they do n't have . He added that claims centres are `` biased '' towards paying out claims rather than withholding payment . But in the reception of the New Orleans center , a sign also translated into Vietnamese has a stark message for those queuing up : `` BP 's policy is no fraud ! '' Boat captains in particular have criticised BP for scrimping . Typically they bring in $ 20,000 a month at this time of year , but last month only received $ 5,000 compensation cheques for not being able to fish because of the Gulf ban . In some cases BP has agreed to bolster this , but only by as much as $ 2,000 , Willis said . Willis said that there were 35 different categories of claimant , mostly associated with the fishing industry . `` The further removed you are from the fishing industry , this will take more work to substantiate , '' he admitted . He cites the example of a gardener in Alabama who received a payout because most of his customers are fishermen who have time to tend to their gardens themselves now they are n't working . Local attorney Camilo K Salas III said that many people were turning to lawyers to pursue their claims where BP had asked for documentation that is impossible to present . Taxi drivers in New Orleans have clubbed together to hire an attorney to pursue damages against BP for lost earnings . Their attorney wants to wait a few months to see if tourism numbers fall further , so he can file a bigger claim for damages . Lawyers seem to be the biggest beneficiaries of the disaster and are pouring into places like New Orleans to pick up work . Getting a claims process up and running so soon after the accident inevitably led to mistakes . In New Orleans , BP originally based its center in the offices of a local Vietnamese community group . But this alienated another Vietnamese faction , who refused to show up , and BP moved its center . Back at the new center on Michoud Boulevard , one of the BP officials said that a lot of the claimants were very emotional . Remaining compassionate can be difficult , he admitted . `` We 're conscious that after a while you become anaesthetised to the plight of people . '' Anyone can help and contribute to project .

Photograph : Spencer Platt\\/Getty Images BP has been accused by a senior US politician of lying to Congress to reduce its liabilities , after an internal company document showed that the oil giant 's own worst-case assessment of the size of the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico was 20 times its public estimate . In the document , BP attempts to put a figure on the rate of oil spewing into the ocean . It notes that if the condition of the well bore deteriorates to the extent that crucial parts fall off , the rate could reach 100,000 barrels a day . When the company handed the document to Congress , it was claiming the leak was only 5,000 barrels a day , and that at very worst the figure could rise to 60,000 . The document was circulated by Ed Markey , the Democratic head of the House sub-committee on energy and the environment . In a statement , he said : `` This document raises very troubling questions about what BP knew and when they knew it . It is clear that , from the beginning , BP has not been straightforward with the government or the American people about the true size of this spill . '' The congressman , who has hounded BP on its handling of the crisis , said on Sunday 's Meet the Press on NBC : `` First they said it was 1,000 barrels , then they said it was 5,000 barrels , now we are up to 100,000 barrels . '' From the beginning BP had either been lying to limit their liability or were `` grossly incompetent '' , delaying a `` full response to the magnitude of this disaster '' . The document makes clear that the likelihood of the crucial bits of equipment the blow-out preventer and wellhead being removed from the well was low . But the fact that BP itself estimated the worst possible leak in the Gulf at 100,000 barrels a day , in contrast to its own lower public estimates , adds to the growing sense in Washington that the company has not been fully transparent over the scale of the disaster . The renewed pressure on BP came as US rig operators and other offshore oil services companies prepared to go to court tomorrow to try to overturn President Barack Obama 's moratorium on deepwater drilling . The companies claim that the ban will result in more economic damage to the region , as rigs and jobs move overseas . The US government has said that it will not lift the ban until more is known about the causes of the accident , and the industry 's safety procedures are reviewed . It emerged this month that BP 's disaster response plan was so inadequate that it listed a wildlife expert who had died in 2005 . It outlined how walruses would be affected by a spill , even though they do not live in the Gulf . Exxon Mobil , ConocoPhillips , Chevron and Shell used the same firm to prepare their disaster plans , which are identical in huge chunks . US politicians said that the companies were just as unprepared as BP to handle a spill in the Gulf , accusing them of `` Xeroxing '' their disaster plans . BP sought to downplay American anger at BP chief executive Tony Hayward going yachting on the Isle of Wight at the weekend . Photographs of Hayward on board his 52ft yacht , Bob , racing around the Isle of Wight provoked uproar in Washington . The White House chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , joked to ABC 's This Week that `` He 's got his life back , as he would say , '' a reference to Hayward 's much lamented comment . `` I think we can all conclude that Tony Hayward is not going to have a second career in PR consulting , '' he added . US media accused Hayward of `` turning his back '' on the Gulf , reporting that the US BP executive Bob Dudley had taken control of the oil response effort . Hayward will spend more time running the rest of the BP business in the UK and around the world . But Hayward will still spend more than half his time in the US and will continue to oversee the effort , according to company sources .

Photograph : Chris Ison\\/PA Images of the beleaguered BP chief executive , Tony Hayward , attending a yacht race on the Isle of Wight , just 48 hours after a hostile interrogation by a US congressional committee on the Gulf Coast oil spill , have provoked sharp criticism on both sides of the Atlantic . President Barack Obama 's chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , condemned Hayward 's attendance at the event as `` part of a long line of PR gaffes and mistakes '' on ABC television , adding : `` I think that we can all conclude that Tony Hayward is not going to have a second career in PR consulting '' . A YouGov poll on the special relationship between Britain and the US , carried out in both countries , showed most believe criticism by Obama , including his careful dubbing of the company British Petroleum rather than BP , is doing damage . In Britain , 64 % of respondents , and 47 % in the US , believed the president 's handling of the crisis was harming relations and 22 % in both Britain and the US thought Obama was anti-British . In Britain , only 54 % said they now viewed the US favourably , compared with 68 % before the spill dramatically fewer than the 77 % of Americans who felt favourably towards Britain . On both sides of the Atlantic , almost identical numbers blamed BP for the spill , 59 % in Britain and 58 % in the US , but in the US , 57 % believed BP had cut corners to save costs , compared with 26 % in Britain . The images of Hayward at the Isle of Wight race yesterday , 4,500 miles away from the oil still spewing into the waters of the Gulf of Mexico , show a man looking anything but happy and relaxed , collar up against a cold breeze , his face almost hidden by a baseball cap pulled down over dark glasses . He was snapped at the JP Morgan Asset Management Round the Island race , where the 52ft yacht Bob , which he co-owns , finished fourth in its class . Emanuel said the images were clearly another in a long line of public embarrassments he mocked Haywood 's most infamous comment , saying `` he 's got his life back , as he would say '' but added there was more of substance to worry about . `` Beyond that photo , there 's really a substance here that matters . That 's clearly a PR mistake , but he 's made a number of those mistakes . What 's important is : are we capping the well ? Are we capturing the oil ? Are we containing the clean-up ? Are we filing the claims ? Are we also cleaning up the mess ? That 's what 's important . '' On the Isle of Wight , the local Friends of the Earth co-ordinator said Hayward deserved all the criticism . `` I 'm sure that this will be seen as yet another public relations disaster for him from people who have got exceedingly upset about this whole thing . `` Personally I do n't think that the bloke is particularly competent from the results that he has delivered . He obviously does n't have the technical know-how but he should at least be managing the image of the company better . '' Charlie Kronick , of Greenpeace , said Hayward was `` rubbing salt into the wounds '' of people affected by the crisis . `` The whole process has been a disaster but what is far worse is that BP 's recklessness caused the accident in the first place . What has happened in the Gulf of Mexico is as a result of Hayward 's own agenda to go for the marginal , unconventional barrels of oil . `` Clearly it is incredibly insulting for him to be sailing in the Isle of Wight but the fact is that him being there has n't stopped the leak . '' A spokeswoman for BP said Hayward was spending some time with his teenage son , but was still `` very much in charge '' , despite earlier reports that he had been dropped from overall control of handling the crisis . She added : `` We would n't dream of commenting on what the chief executive does in his rare moments of private time .

Photograph : Gerald Herbert\\/AP An oil worker who survived the BP Deepwater Horizon explosion has claimed that the oil rig 's safety equipment was leaking several weeks before it exploded , triggering the huge spill in the Gulf of Mexico . Tyrone Benton says that he spotted a leak on the rig 's Blowout Preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- , the device that is meant to shut the well down if there is an accident . He told the BBC 's Panorama program that both BP and Transocean , who owned the rig , were informed of the leak , and the faulty part a control pod was switched off rather than being repaired . `` We saw a leak on the pod -LRB- and -RRB- we informed the company , '' Benton told the program , which will be broadcast at 8.30 pm tonight . `` They have a control room where they could turn off that pod and turn on the other one , so that they do n't have to stop production . '' Benton added that he was unsure whether the leaking control pod had been turned back on again before a huge gas explosion ripped through the rig on 20 April , killing 11 workers . The failure of the BOP was one key factor that led to the ongoing environmental disaster . The BOP is designed to clamp the well tightly shut , using cutting equipment to slice through the casing , but on 20 April it did not engage . After the explosion , BP sent robot submarines down to the seabed to try to trigger the BOP , but failed . The company has already admitted to a Congressional committee that the robots discovered a leak in the BOP 's hydraulic systems , which meant they could not generate enough force for its giant shears to cut through the pipe . Last week , BP chief executive Tony Hayward repeatedly cited the BOP as a major cause of the disaster , saying it was `` not as failsafe '' as BP had been told . Benton 's revelations will pile even more pressure on BP , at a time when its minority party in the leaking well is refusing to pay its share of the costs . Anadarko Petroleum Corporation argues that BP was `` grossly negligent '' or guilty of `` willful misconduct '' in the way it drilled the Macondo prospect , which some workers described as a `` nightmare well '' . Last week the Congressional committee accused BP of taking `` risky '' decisions to save time and money . And in another development , BP has been accused of lying after internal documents showed that it has estimated that the leak could reach 100,000 barrels a day , much higher than its public forecasts . The cost of the clean-up operation has now broken through the $ 2bn -LRB- # 1.3 bn -RRB- mark , BP told the City this morning . That is just a fraction of the total bill , though , with BP already committed to putting $ 20bn into an escrow account to cover compensation claims . That will not cap its liabilities , though , and there are suggestions that BP is now looking to raise $ 50bn . The company has said it will sell off some of its assets . This has raised concerns in several countries , including Russia , where the TNK-BP joint venture generates around a quarter of BP 's global production . Hayward is to fly to Russia to assure the Kremlin that BP can survive the oil spill disaster , the Financial Times reported today . BP 's chief executive took the decision to meet Russian president Dmitry Medvedev in the next few weeks following a weekend board meeting , and after Medvedev warned that the catastrophe could lead to BP 's `` annihilation '' . BP continues to insist that it will clean up the spill and pay `` all legitimate claims '' , and rejected Anadarko 's claims . `` These allegations will neither distract the company 's focus on stopping the leak nor alter our commitment to restore the Gulf coast , '' said Hayward . `` Other parties besides BP may be responsible for costs and liabilities arising from the oil spill , and we expect those parties to live up to their obligations . '' Shares in BP fell by more than 3 % this morning to 345p , making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 . Swiss bank UBS warned shareholders that it did not expect the company to resume paying dividends until 2012 . Last week it agreed to cancel payments for the rest of this year , but UBS believes that the cost of the Deepwater spill means a longer suspension is inevitable . City sources believe that BP may have to sell its operations in the North Sea as part of its drive to cut spending and raise funds .

Westwell was delivering the speech in place of the oil giant 's beleaguered chief executive , Tony Hayward , who last night canceled what would have been his first public appearance in the UK since the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico began . Westwell 's speech , to oil executives and energy ministers at the World National Oil Companies Congress , was interrupted when two female protesters from Greenpeace , Emma Gibson and Katie Swan , approached the stage holding a banner which read `` Go Beyond Petroleum '' . `` We need to speed up progress and make a push to end the oil age , '' Gibson told the audience , before being bundled off by security . Before the protest , Hayward 's stand-in had apologised for the BP chief executive 's absence , saying : `` He is genuinely sorry he could n't be here , especially with so many friends in the conference . But his schedule is under incredible pressure at the moment . '' Speaking after they had been ejected from the conference , Swan told the Guardian that she and Gibson had gone ahead with the protest despite Hayward 's no-show as it was a chance to address the oil industry . `` We wanted to use the opportunity to speak to BP and push it to change things . BP should n't be drilling in deep water and it should n't extract oil from the Canadian tar sands . '' Swan studied in Louisiana for four years , and was very concerned about the environmental and economic damage caused by the oil spill . `` It looks like irreparable damage has been done . People 's lives will have been changed forever , '' Swan said . Gibson said that BP was in `` severe trouble '' because it had not listened to activists in the past , and had instead pushed on with riskier projects . `` If they had heeded our advice over many years about the need to deliver genuine renewable energy sources , they would not be facing a $ 40bn -LRB- # 24bn -RRB- disaster today , '' she said . Westwell , who arrived through the back entrance at The Grange St Paul 's hotel to avoid journalists , insisted that BP 's commitment to clean up the oil spill would last longer than the press interest in the story . `` When the media has left the Gulf and the headlines have gone elsewhere we will still be there helping , '' he said . Westwell said the company was now capturing up to 25,000 barrels a day in the Gulf of Mexico and described the financial consequences of the spill as severe , but reiterated BP would come through it . So far , BP has spent $ 2bn fighting the spill and compensating victims since the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion on 20 April . Hayward 's non-appearance was the talk of the conference this morning . Paul Gilbertson , one of the organisers , described it as a `` disappointment '' . Hayward has also pulled out of an appearance at the National Portrait Gallery in London tonight where he was due to open an awards ceremony . Hayward is reportedly making a trip to see Russian president Dmitry Medvedev to reassure him that BP remains a robust company . Its joint venture with TNK is responsible for 25 % of BP 's revenues . The BP boss was pilloried for attending a yacht race around the Isle of Wight on Sunday , while the company battles to contain the thousands of barrels of oil spewing into the Gulf of Mexico every day .

The celebrities on offer were decidedly B-list compared with , for instance , the impressive lineup for George Clooney 's Hope for Haiti Now telethon earlier in the year . Headlining this time was Sting , who performed his song Fragile , dedicating it to `` all the people in the Gulf who have lost their livelihoods , and all the animals and birds , and to remember our ecology is very fragile '' . Robert Redford delivered the most politically poignant message of the evening , saying `` had somebody been connecting the dots and ignored the propaganda that was coming out of the company and the consequence of the collusion between government and the oil companies that has been going on for decades , we would have seen this thing coming . It would not be a question of whether this would happen , but when . '' Redford , who worked on oil rigsas a teenager , said the challenge was to find a solution to ensure a disaster like that of the Deepwater Horizon rig never happened again . Cameron Diaz provided some more heavyweight star power . She said that what was going on in the Gulf made her `` mad and sad and sick at heart '' .

Kathy Griffin , the self-proclaimed D-lister , was shown on screen talking to another supposed star . Griffin : That 's right , the surfers are here . Ivanka Trump , famous for being the daughter of the humanitarian legend Donald , said the experience of manning the phone lines and talking to the people affected by the disaster in the Gulf had been `` humanising beyond belief '' . Ryan Seacrest , famous for being the foil to Simon Cowell on American Idol , was busy running a social networking channel for donations which CNN called the Social Suite . `` This is a two-screen experience , '' Seacrest said . `` While watching television you can reach out to the stars on Twitter and Facebook . '' Seacrest breathlessly announced that the search engine Bing had promised to donate $ 10 -LRB- # 6.80 -RRB- every time someone retweeted his own tweet about donating via Twitter -LRB- though he added that Bing had put a ceiling on its largesse of $ 100,000 , which at current rates is about how much BP is spending on the crisis every hour -RRB- .

Photograph : Raj Patidar\\/Reuters Indians have reacted with fury to President Barack Obama 's tough stance against BP , accusing the US of double standards over industrial accidents after the failure to convict Americans involved in the Bhopal disaster of 1984 or to obtain what many view as adequate compensation for victims . The anger goes beyond that of campaigners or activists with some of India 's best-known writers and journalists weighing in . `` It looks like Indian children 's lives are cheaper than -LRB- those of -RRB- fish , '' Chetan Bhagat , the country 's best-selling writer , said . `` Obama should bang his fist on the table . If he can do that for fish , how about our kids ? Or are they only Indians ? '' The Pioneer and Hindustan newspapers ran headlines last week repeating the charge that the US reaction to the Gulf Coast disaster , which has killed 11 people , and to Bhopal , where at least 15,000 died as a result of exposure to toxic gases leaking from a US-owned pesticide plant , was evidence of double standards . `` Everything that Obama has said about BP and the spill was what the US should have said about Bhopal , '' said Suhasini Haider , one of India 's best-known TV journalists who chaired a prime-time discussion comparing reactions to the two disasters . `` There is the question of compensation , the way Obama has gone after senior executives personally . This is the exact opposite of what happened with Bhopal . '' One reason for the anger lies in the timing of the Obama 's address to the American nation on the oil spill , which came a week after the first verdicts in a criminal trial related to the Bhopal disaster . Seven Indian managers at the plant were sentenced to two years in prison and immediately bailed by a court in India . Warren Anderson , the then chief executive of Union Carbide , the American firm which owned the plant through an Indian subsidiary , has never faced trial and attempts by Indian governments to extradite him from the US have failed . `` It seems ridiculous that there are such small punishments for -LRB- Bhopal -RRB- and at the same time we are watching the US getting so agitated about the spill , '' Haider said . Attention in India has focused on continuing investigations by campaigners into the identity of the senior figure who ordered the release of Anderson , arrested when he returned to Bhopal immediately after the disaster . Opposition politicians have sought to blame senior figures in the Congress party , who lead a coalition government in India . There is also a fierce domestic debate about who was responsible for the downgrading of charges against officials investigated after the disaster , the failure to clear the site of the plant of toxic waste and the level of compensation , which has reached only a fraction of the victims . `` It 's the Indian government that must answer why it allowed the US those actions , '' Haider said . Local news reports have claimed that senior American politicians put pressure on the Indian government not to pursue claims for further compensation against Union Carbide , which was eventually bought by another US firm , Dow Chemicals in 2001 . Bhagat told the Guardian that `` nothing -LRB- in the US -RRB- compared to what had happened in India '' where `` politicians and industries are much too close '' .

Lesser\\/EPA BP says it has reinstalled an oil - siphoning cap on its blown-out well in the Gulf of Mexico and has resumed collecting crude after an accident led to oil flowing unhindered into the ocean for several hours yesterday . The political risks from the disaster were underscored by a poll showing Barack Obama 's job performance rating has dropped to the lowest level of his presidency . The Obama administration is appealing a court ruling blocking a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling . The worst spill in US history has been thrust to the top of Obama 's crowded domestic agenda but the Wall Street Journal\\/NBC News poll found half of those surveyed disapproved of his handling of the spill . Overall Obama 's rating stood at 45 % in the poll , down five points from early last month . For the first time in the survey , more people , or 48 % , said they disapproved of his job performance . The administration sought to keep its responses to the catastrophe in play as it appealed against the lifting of a deep-water drilling ban . A judge had said the moratorium was too far-reaching and not adequately justified despite the spill . The government also asked district judge Martin Feldman in New Orleans to put his ruling against the moratorium on hold pending the outcome of the appeal or until the appeals court can consider a request for a stay . The justice department said the temporary moratorium affected only 33 active deepwater drills in the Gulf of Mexico . In addition to the appeal , interior secretary Ken Salazar said he would revise his original order suspending drilling 500ft below sea level to make it more flexible and thus address the court 's concerns . The government imposed a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling after the offshore rig exploded on 20 April killing 11 workers and rupturing BP 's well .

Photograph : Graeme Robertson Flop flop flop . The sound of a bird 's wings batting futilely against the gloopy blanket of black oil echoes across the quarry . Then there is silence . A pigeon has crashed into this dark pool , 100 metres from the turquoise sea on the west coast of Guernsey . It sinks within seconds , resurfaces for a final flap , then joins the other small carcasses lying face down in the swirls of black slime . Since 1967 , this deadly , oil-filled crater on the Chouet headland has acquired a new name : Torrey Canyon quarry . On the morning of Saturday 18 March 1967 , the Torrey Canyon ran aground on Pollard 's Rock between Land 's End and the Isles of Scilly . Over the following days , every drop of the 119,328 tonnes of crude oil borne by this 300m-long supertanker seeped into the Atlantic . Thousands of tonnes despoiled the beaches of Cornwall and thousands more were propelled by winds and currents across the channel towards France . At the time it was the biggest oil spill ever , and the first involving a new generation of supertankers . Looking back , the echoes of the BP disaster unfolding in the Gulf of Mexico are loud and eerie . The slick imperilled a beautiful and popular tourist region . Inertia and dithering were worsened by the buck-passing of multinational companies implicated in the mess . And no one knew what to do . Even BP was involved : British Petroleum chartered the vessel to bring crude to the oil refinery in Milford Haven , Wales . But the Torrey Canyon disaster is not just a history lesson ; it is living proof that big oil spills plague ecosystems for decades . Forty-three years on , the crude from the Torrey Canyon is still killing wildlife on a daily basis . The Italian captain of the Liberian-registered Torrey Canyon was blamed for stranding the tanker on a well-known set of reefs . By nightfall , an eight-mile slick had slipped from its punctured tanks . The following day it was 20 miles long . In the past , tiny coastal oil spills had been cleaned up by mixtures of solvents and emulsifiers . These were called detergents , a deceptively cosy , domestic term for what were highly toxic chemicals . Within 12 hours of the spill , the navy tried to tackle it with them . Handily for BP , it manufactured these chemicals . The government warned that the stricken ship was `` a bomb '' and BP , as one man involved in the clean-up operation put it , `` were making a bomb , literally , both ways '' . More charitably , the Guardian reported : `` British Petroleum , which has the Torrey Canyon on charter but does not own her -LRB- and therefore disclaims any responsibility for the oil pollution -RRB- has sent all the detergent it can lay hands on . '' Torrey Canyon quarry , Guernsey . Photograph : Graeme Robertson The `` sluggish black smear on the Atlantic '' was an eyesore but Dutch experts dispatched by the ship 's owners , the Bahamas-based Barracuda Tanker Corporation , itself part-owned by the American Union Oil company , insisted the ship could be salvaged . The government agreed , and its man in charge of the crisis , Maurice Foley , undersecretary for defense -LRB- navy -RRB- a title that did not suggest the spill was a top priority insisted there was `` no question '' of deliberately destroying the supertanker . Dennis Barker , now 81 and still writing for the Guardian , was dispatched to report on the spill . `` It was the first of those ecological disasters . Nobody knew what to expect . All that sunk in was that a boat was stuck on the rocks . The implications were slow to filter through , '' he says . Barker intercepted Harold Wilson , the prime minister , on the railway platform at Penzance . Wilson had been due to spend his Easter holidays on the Scilly Isles . `` He rather liked to be at the scene of the action but it all seemed a bit slow by the standards of today , '' says Barker . Like everyone , Barker most vividly recalls the smell . He leaned out of a helicopter to inspect `` the greeny , browny gunge '' in the sea below . `` Suddenly I felt decidedly ill and I thought I was going to vomit over the Sun photographer . The stench was indescribable , '' he says . This `` abominable smell of oil '' as the Guardian reported could be smelt at Land 's End on Good Friday . Waves of oil broke on the shores near St Just the following morning , a week after the shipwreck . On Easter Monday , the tanker broke into two pieces . The oil , Barker noted in his reports , was winning . Using detergents to break up slabs of oil on the ocean was `` like trying to pick up quicksilver with boxing gloves '' , he wrote : `` There is this constant feeling that the government has fluffed the issue , and that an early political decision might have worked . '' The government continued to insist it was right to leave salvage attempts to the companies involved . `` Clearly we have no responsibility in law for what has happened , '' observed Foley . Les Hosking from Marazion , Cornwall , remembers the moment the government began bombing the tanker in an attempt to sink it and some of its deadly cargo , and burn off the slick . `` We saw the Buccaneer bombers coming in . They dropped bombs and that did n't do anything , '' says Hosking . The press was critical because a quarter of the 42 bombs missed the target . Other methods also failed . Foam booms to contain the oil slick took ages to assemble and broke up in rough seas . Attempts to burn off the oil by dropping aviation fuel on it also foundered when high tides put the fires out . So , extraordinarily , the authorities dropped Napalm on the slick . `` When that came in there was a sheet of flames , '' remembers Hosking . `` I 've never seen anything like it . The smoke went up into the sky for what seemed like miles . '' The slick contaminated 120 miles of Cornish coastline . An estimated 15,000 birds were killed . Seals and other marine life also perished . An awareness of the environmental damage caused by oil `` had n't reached anywhere near the public consciousness that it has now , '' says Barker today . `` It could have been an emergency from the last war . In an emergency you are not terribly worried about the pigeons . '' Local residents fretted about their livelihoods in fishing and tourism , but were they angry ? `` Obviously there was a lot of anger and distress and then we thought , ` Let 's just get this stuff off our shores ' , '' says Hosking . Although the government got a kicking in the press , the attitude towards the implicated oil companies was strikingly mild compared with today 's blame game . `` If Wilson had been going on at the people responsible like Obama is , he would have been regarded as a bit eccentric or out of order , '' says Barker . In 1967 , BP chartered the vessel but was widely exonerated . There was little hostility towards the ship 's captain . `` Today there would have been a lynch mob after him , '' observes Barker . Residents of Cornwall did not realize it but they got off lightly . A freakish absence of prevailing south-westerlies in the weeks after the disaster kept much of the oil from hitting the mainland . The oil washed up on Britain 's shores amounted to just 15 % of the total that leaked from the Torrey Canyon . The vicissitudes of wind and current deposited more oil on the distant coastline of Brittany . Nineteen days after the disaster , a huge slick hit western Guernsey . The oil lay so thick that 3,000 tonnes could be pumped directly into sewage tankers . `` It was , ` We 've got to clear our beaches , we 're a tourist destination , right , there 's a quarry , let 's put it there . ' It was a decision that had to be made very quickly , '' says Rob Roussel of Guernsey 's public services department . Roussel remembers the oil on the island 's beaches as a boy ; he is now in charge of cleaning up Torrey Canyon quarry . Moving oil to the quarry was a solution that created another problem . This dirty legacy of the Torrey Canyon has refused to disappear . Everybody 's known about it but no one has wanted to do anything about it , '' says Jayne Le Cras , director of operations at the Guernsey Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals . `` Because of its thickness and stillness birds see it as a solid surface , they land on it and then the weight of the oil holds them down . I would hate to know how many are underneath it . '' A family of kestrels is nesting in the quarry wall and short-eared owls breed in adjacent pines trees . When passing walkers hear the flapping of stranded birds they alert the GSPCA but staff ca n't always reach the quarry quickly enough to rescue birds . Last autumn , a GSPCA officer filmed a pigeon struggling in the oil on his phone and posted it on Facebook . The resulting furore helped prompt the authorities into action again . Guernsey 's government says it has spent thousands trying to clean up the quarry . It was cleared in the 80s ; more recently , 160,000 litres were taken to a processing plant in Hull . But each time the oil has been removed more has seeped from the sediment below , which can not be dug out because the quarry was a German armaments dump when they occupied the island during the second world war . Last year , the water level rose and the changing pressure released more crude from the bottom . `` The company that was responsible for the Torrey Canyon should be paying for it under the polluter-pays principle but the international laws were n't in place back then , '' says Roussel . In 1967 , as the cost of the clean-up grew , the British government sought # 3m compensation from the ship 's slippery owners . Eventually , the Torrey Canyon 's sister ship , Lake Palourde , was `` arrested '' when it docked at Singapore . Legend has it that a young British lawyer was only able to board the ship to attach a writ to its mast because the crew believed he was a whisky salesman . The French , also seeking compensation , continued to pursue the company and its ships for many more months . Meanwhile , long after the disaster had slipped off the front pages , Hosking remembers balls of oil , like giant Maltesers , washing up on Marazion 's beach : `` At the time we thought , ` This is it . ' This is Cornwall messed up for the rest of our days . My first thought was , how the hell are they going to get rid of this lot ? Mother nature is a very powerful thing . Eventually , I expect nature did most of it . '' In fact it turned out that human ingenuity was not just powerless against the oil slick ; it made it much worse . Three days after the ship ran aground , Anthony Tucker , then science correspondent of the Guardian , warned that no toxicity tests had been carried out on the detergents being sprayed on the oil and their effect on marine life had never been studied . `` There may be little point in spending many millions of pounds simply to convert an unpleasant but visible marine poison into another kind of poison that is insidious and entirely unknown in its effects , '' he presciently wrote . In the event , the use of detergents turned out to be `` the worst thing possible '' , according to Dr Gerald Boalch , a marine biologist with 52 years ' service for the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom . After the spill , the MBA 's staff devoted all their days to studying it . At first , the chemical sprays seemed to work . `` The detergents made it look good , '' says Boalch . `` We thought at the time it was doing a good job because the oil was disappearing . '' But colleagues conducted lab tests `` and it was realized that it was making the oil more toxic because it was accessible to organisms '' . At sea , the oil was made soluble by the detergents , which then meant it was taken in by more living organisms . On shore , the chemicals destroyed lichens and other beach-life probably for ever , says Boalch . A year after Torrey Canyon , the MBA published its conclusions : it was scathing about the disastrous use of detergents , applied by methods `` that were largely ineffective , uneconomic , and wasteful of effort '' . The Torrey Canyon disaster did have some beneficial consequences . International maritime regulations on pollution were created . A charismatic young botanist called David Bellamy was asked to comment on the disaster and became a television star ; he , and the oil slick , helped raise awareness of pollution . If our growing addiction to oil was not questioned , our methods for tackling spills were . When the supertanker Cadiz spilt crude oil off Brittany in 1978 , Boalch `` insisted '' the authorities should not use detergents . `` They did n't and it recovered much quicker , '' says Boalch now . But the French had already proved wiser than the British when cleaning up Torrey Canyon crude . Rather than bombard the slick with Napalm or toxic detergents in 1967 , they used powdered craie de Champagne humble chalk , which sunk the oil more effectively than expensive , toxic British detergents . `` It would seem that the French were successful in preventing the bulk of this very large oil mass from coming ashore , '' the MBA researchers concluded . In Guernsey , in 2010 , the authorities are also now trying to remove the last of the Torrey Canyon oil in an environmentally friendly way . Last month , they began to pump micro-organisms into the oily water , which is aerated by a small generator running 24 hours a day . This process of `` bioaugmentation '' uses naturally occurring bacteria for whom oil is a food source to break down the oil . The government predicts that the rapidly multiplying micro-organisms will have eaten the oil by the end of the year . Does Le Cras think it will work ? `` Proof is in the pudding , is n't it ? '' `` I hope everything they say comes true . It will be a great day for us when it happens .

The judge , Martin Feldman , was severely criticised by environmental groups yesterday for failing to recuse himself from the case after revealing investment in Transocean , Halliburton , and other firms involved in offshore drilling in financial disclosure forms . The interior secretary was appearing before the committee to introduce the Obama administration 's new head of offshore drilling regulation , Michael Bromwich , and announce a new `` zero tolerance '' regime for corrupt or lax government safety inspectors . Thad Allen , the coast guard admiral who is leading the administration 's response to the spill , told reporters that workers had detected a possible gas leak in the line that was running warm water into the collection device . The waterline is used to prevent the buildup of hydrate crystals around the collection device . Initial reports also suggested that the robot may have inadvertently shut down one of the vents on the collection device , raising the pressure within and forcing gas into the warm waterline . Allen said workers would have to determine whether the device was compromised by the formation of crystals . If so , a new pipe may be needed before they can begin collecting oil again . The removal of the top hat underlined the enormous challenges of containing America 's biggest environmental disaster , just as the Obama administration was hoping to persuade the public it was adopting new safety protocols that would ensure such a spill never happened again . In his public debut , Bromwich , the new head of a reconfigured agency overseeing the offshore oil and gas industry , told the Senate appropriations subcommittee he was launching an investigative unit to root out corrupt government regulators . The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is to replace the Minerals Management Service -LRB- MMS -RRB- , which has been accused of being in the pocket of the oil industry . Bromwich promised a new FBI-style team would conduct internal investigations of the associations between government regulators and industry . `` There will be little tolerance for corruption and cosiness , '' he said . `` There will be zero tolerance for whatever was tolerated in the past . '' The former prosecutor said his team would encourage whistleblowers and act quickly to root out corruption or complacency among agency officials or the companies they were supposed to regulate . Even before the Deepwater Horizon rig went down , the MMS was notorious for cocaine-fuelled sex romps between government officials and oil industry executives . In the Gulf , government inspectors were plied with free football tickets or offered jobs by the very same companies they were supposed to monitor . But Salazar also argued that the MMS had never had the resources it needed to manage Big Oil . He told senators he needs more inspectors to have proper oversight of offshore drilling safety . At present , the agency has 62 inspectors who are supposed to visit 4,000 production wells . Senators delivered a withering review of its performance . `` There was a shameful culture of corruption , '' said Byron Dorgan , a Democrat from North Dakota .

Photograph : Bevil Knapp\\/EPA BP 's embattled boss Tony Hayward is touring City investors in an attempt to restore his tattered reputation and secure his future at the oil company . A series of crucial meetings with shareholders have been arranged for Hayward and BP 's chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg to explain how BP can cope with the multi-billion pound financial damage being wreaked on the business by the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . Hayward is telling investors that he has no intention of stepping down and is spelling out his long-term strategy to pay for the clean up and for the future of the company at a time when some investors fear the business might be wiped out by the disaster . One big investor said Hayward appears to have bounced back from his lacklustre appearance in front of a Congressional committee this month : `` He was very impressive . He has two years to sort out the escrow -LRB- compensation -RRB- fund and the sale of assets . There is no huge urgency . He is planning for the future and we will support him . '' Another major investor said Hayward would be facing questions about the future shape and size of BP whether it might be best in the long term for the company to be broken up or restructured in a way that means local disasters can be ring-fenced from the rest of the group : `` I certainly think that the company needs to have a structure with more effective ` fire breaks ' . '' He added that investors are not pressing for Hayward to be replaced : `` Witch hunting and deciding who to sack should be a very low priority . '' Hayward 's tour of the City did not stop BP 's shares slumping to their lowest level in 14 years . They closed down more than 6 % at 298p and are now less than half their 658p level before the Deepwater Horizon explosion . The disaster has now wiped more than $ 100bn -LRB- # 67bn -RRB- off BP 's stock market value . Investors were reacting to a BP statement that the costs of cleaning up the spill had now reached $ 2.35 bn -LRB- # 1.6 bn -RRB- though that will be a tiny part of the final bill . There were also mounting fears that the hurricane season could hamper clean-up operations . The US national hurricane center said today there was a 70 % chance that a low pressure area in the Caribbean could develop into a tropical storm in the Gulf and the US coast guard said it would begin shutting down BP 's containment operations five days before gale force winds were due to arrive . The company is currently struggling to put back a containment cap on the well which had earlier reduced spill volumes but later was knocked out of place . BP expects to have the new cap in place within a week . Hayward 's City meetings came a day after he held a series of `` town hall '' meetings at BP 's UK offices to tell employees the company was recovering though still in `` intensive care '' . The group has already set aside a $ 20bn compensation fund for those such as local shrimp fishermen in Louisiana who have lost their livelihoods . BP is said to be looking at a possible $ 10bn bond offering in an attempt to strengthen its balance sheet to pay the rising cost of spill liabilities and claims . But David Cameron for the first time raised the spectre of BP becoming bankrupt , saying he feared the destruction of the company . Speaking in advance of a meeting with Barack Obama , he said : `` I think it is in all our long-term interest that there is some clarity , some finality to all of this so that we do n't at the same time see the destruction of a company that is important for all our interests . '' BP is also understood to be in talks with banks to raise a further $ 20bn through loans , with another $ 20bn from asset sales in the coming two years . It has already scrapped shareholder dividends until the end of the year ahead of a dressing down by a frustrated Obama at the White House last week . The company has seen a huge surge in attention from short sellers who borrow stock and sell it on , expecting they will be able to buy it back later at a lower price . With debt expensive and asset sales taking time , broker Nomura said an equity-based fundraising backed by sovereign wealth funds may be a more attractive short-term solution . The oil group also confirmed its two relief wells intended to stop the leaking well completely are set to be completed within three months of the date work began , following concerns by some industry experts that they could take much longer . However , the hurricane season , which runs until the end of November , could yet intervene . The group has so far captured 364,500 barrels of oil through its containment system , but it is estimated that 35,000-60 ,000 barrels a day are continuing to pour from the well , which ruptured after the rig exploded on 20 April , killing 11 workers . Hayward officially handed over day-to-day control of the Gulf of Mexico crisis to BP board director Bob Dudley this week as it set up a new division to manage the spill . Employees are said to have been told that operating results due out next month will be `` very strong '' .

Photograph : Bevil Knapp\\/EPA Endangered sea turtles and other marine creatures are being corralled into 500 square-mile `` burn fields '' and burnt alive in operations intended to contain oil from BP 's ruptured well in the Gulf of Mexico , the Obama administration confirmed today . The killing of the turtles which once teetered on the brink of extinction has outraged environmentalists and could put BP into even deeper legal jeopardy . Environmental organizations are demanding that the oil company stop blocking rescue of the turtles , and are pressing the US administration to halt the burning and look at prosecuting BP and its contractors for killing endangered species during the cleanup operation . Harming or killing a sea turtle carries fines of up to $ 50,000 -LRB- # 33,000 -RRB- . `` It is criminal and cruel and they need to be held accountable , '' said Carole Allen , Gulf office director of the Sea Turtle Restoration Project . `` There should not be another lighting of a fire of any kind till people have gone in there and looked for turtles . '' The Obama administration , confirming the kills , said BP was under orders to avoid the turtles . `` My understanding is that protocols include looking for wildlife prior to igniting of oil , '' a spokeswoman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- Noaa -RRB- said . `` We take these things very seriously . '' The agency this week posted a single turtle spotter on the burn vessels , but government scientists are pressing for more wildlife experts to try to rescue the animals before the oil is lit or at the very least to give them access to the burn fields . `` One ca n't just ride through an area where they are burning and expect to be safe while looking for turtles . We do n't expect that , but we would like to access those areas where we suspect there may be turtles , '' said Blair Witherington , a sea turtle research scientist at Florida 's Fish and Wildlife Research Institute . More than 425 turtles are known to have died in the spill zone since 30 April , Noaa said . Conservationists say the losses could imperil the long-term survival of the creatures . All five species of turtles found in the Gulf are endangered or threatened : the Kemp 's Ridley most of all . But in a video posted on YouTube , Mike Ellis , a skipper from Venice , Louisiana , accuses BP of chasing away a boat of conservationists trying to rescue turtles caught in the oil and weed a few miles away from the leak . `` They ran us out of there and then they shut us down , '' said Ellis . On days when the weather is fine and there is relatively no wind , BP conducts up to a dozen `` controlled burns '' , torching vast expanses of the ocean surface within a corral of fireproof booms . Biologists say such burns are deadly for young turtles because oil and sargassum the seaweed mats that provide nutrients to jellyfish and a range of other creatures congregate in the same locations . The sargassum is also a perfect hunting ground for young sea turtles , who are not developed enough to dive to the ocean floor to forage for food . Once BP moves in , the turtles are doomed . `` They drag a boom between two shrimp boats and whatever gets caught between the two boats , they circle it up and catch it on fire . Once the turtles are in there , they ca n't get out , '' Ellis said . The heartbreak for conservationists is that the convergence of sargassum and oil offers the best chance of finding young turtles before they suffocate on the crude . But it can also be deadly . `` When they breathe and come to the surface , they get a mouthful and a bellyful of toxic substance that is very much like wallpaper paste , '' said John Hewitt , the director of husbandry at the New Orleans aquarium . `` If we do n't remove them and clean them up , in three or four days that probably spells the end of the turtle . '' Since the spill , the aquarium has taken in 90 sea turtles , scrubbing the oil off their shells with toothbrushes and washing-up liquid . Even before the fires , the two-month gusher in the Gulf of Mexico was threatening the long-term survival of sea turtles . `` This is the worst calamity that I have ever seen for sea turtles , '' said David Godfrey , executive director of the Sea Turtle Conservancy . `` This is really the cradle of sea turtle reproduction for the western hemisphere . `` The threat to the turtles could continue well after the gusher is capped . The oil spill is turning vast expanses of the Gulf into a dead zone , killing off the jellyfish , crabs and conches that are the staples of an adult diet . Conservationists are also worried about the survival of the next generation of loggerhead turtles , which are about to climb up on to badly oiled shorelines to begin their nesting season . `` They are doomed '' said Godfrey . Godfrey said his organization was working on plans to dig up about 1,000 nests , or 100,000 eggs , from nesting grounds in the Florida Panhandle and transfer them to hatcheries for safekeeping . `` It is a last gasp measure to save 100,000 young sea turtles , '' he said . `` We need every one of these turtles to survive .

Photograph : Rex Features Shares in BP hit a 14-year low this morning after the oil giant revealed that its bill for containing and cleaning up the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico the worst in US history had climbed to $ 2.35 bn -LRB- # 1.57 bn -RRB- . The shares dropped 6.8 % at one stage and later traded down 6.3 % at 304.5 p , making BP the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 . Five-year BP credit default swaps , which insure the company against debt default , widened 19 basis points to 555 points . The latest cost estimate is up from a previous figure of $ 2bn . It includes $ 126m already paid out in claims to those affected by the disaster , mainly workers in the fishing industry . So far , nearly 74,000 claims have been filed and more than 39,000 payments have been made . The bulk of the cost covers wages paid to 37,000 people involved in efforts to capture oil at the blown-out well in the Gulf and the clean-up operation on the shore . It has emerged that the oil company has ordered clean-up contractors to pay out wages to workers suspected of claiming for work they have not done . Rear Admiral James Watson , the federal on-scene co-ordinator for the oil spill , admitted that there had been `` instances of fraud '' . The oil giant said this morning that work on two relief wells , designed to kill the leaking well , and measures to improve the capture of oil , were on track .

Later today in Washington a team of photographers and videographers will meet at the TEDxOilSpill event , to report their findings after they spent a week documenting the oil spill . But there is some good news for BP , with the news that tropical storm Alex is not expected to inhibit the cleanup operation . There had been fears that the storm could strike the area . This is from the TedxOilSpill website , regarding their Washington event later today . This is a week-long project to document the current situation in the Gulf of Mexico and bring a first hand report back to the TEDxOilSpill event in Washington DC on June 28th . We 'll be working on land , air , and maybe even on boat . Our team is composed of several talented photographers and videographers . In addition to documentation of oil on the water and on the beach , we 're particularly interested in the human side of the equation and will be talking to some of the people most affected by the catastrophe in the Gulf . We 'll also be documenting any and all evidence of media interference by BP , the Coast Guard , or other officials . The list of speakers includes prominent environmentalists such as Andrew Sharpless , from Oceana -LRB- `` the largest international organization focused solely on ocean conservation '' -RRB- , marine toxicologist Susan Shaw and the man behind @BPGlobalPR , Leroy Stick . Tropical storm Alex , which forecasters from the US national hurricane center -LRB- Nhc -RRB- said `` could become a hurricane '' today or tomorrow , is not expected to affect the clean-up operation . Alex , the first named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season , had sustained winds of about 50 mph this morning , when it was lurking some 75 miles west of Campeche , Mexico .

Frustrated by the fallout of the BP disaster , independent owners of local gas stations are fighting to keep customers coming to their pumps . Owners across the country have complained to the oil giant , urging them to do more to combat the public relations nightmare after more than 100 million gallons of oil spilled off the Gulf Coast . Customers have stayed away in droves and defaced BP stations in protest . Owners and some customers say enough is enough . If you spot any interesting articles or videos relating to the oil spill , please get in touch - on Twitter @adamgabbatt or email adam.gabbatt@guardian.co.uk The Miami Herald has reported `` that depression and gloom will come along with the dark goo , '' as a suicide is linked to the Gulf oil spill . The paper claims the oil spill is having a severe mental toll on people in the area , and that the suicide of a boat captain last week is being seen as `` exhibit A for a problem that experts fear is moving faster than the oil slick : a mental toll that will lead to violence , depression and suicide '' . The Herald reports that BP have sent grief counsellors to the area to try and deal with the problem , which it claims is similar to the fallout from the Exxon Valdez spill , when the nearby city of Cordova saw increases in divorces and suicides . More than 150 artists , critics and playwrights , including Hans Haacke , John Keane and Matthew Herbert , have written to the Guardian to complain about BP 's sponsorship of the Tate Britain , 20 years of which is being celebrated in a reception at the gallery tonight . As crude oil continues to devastate coastlines and communities in the Gulf of Mexico , BP executives will be enjoying a cocktail reception with curators and artists at Tate Britain . These relationships enable big oil companies to mask the environmentally destructive nature of their activities with the social legitimacy that is associated with such high-profile cultural associations . We represent a cross-section of people from the arts community that believe that the BP logo represents a stain on Tate 's international reputation . Many artists are angry that Tate and other national cultural institutions continue to sidestep the issue of oil sponsorship . Little more than a decade ago , tobacco companies were seen as respectable partners for public institutions to gain support from that is no longer the case . It is our hope that oil and gas will soon be seen in the same light . The public is rapidly coming to recognize that the sponsorship programs of BP and Shell are means by which attention can be distracted from their impacts on human rights , the environment and the global climate . Thanks to @NnnIqbal on Twitter for the link . The Associated Press is reporting that the admiral in charge of the spill response is heading back to the Gulf coast today , after Mississippi 's governor said he would press BP and the federal government for more help . Adm Thad Allen was expected to be in New Orleans on Monday and talk to the media about the latest on the spill . Allen has received some criticism from local officials who feel he might not be the right man to head the team . He has not responded to the criticism . Jackson County emergency management director Donald Langham says tar balls and a patch of oil were spotted at the St. Andrews beach and at the Lake Mars pier in Gulf Park Estates . There are reports of oil also washing up in Louisiana , Alabama and Florida . The Los Angeles Times reports that a `` BP boycott '' is difficult to enforce as it is so deeply entrenched in the US economy . The article lists the many business interests of the company , including Arco , Safeway supermarkets and the Southern California Gas Company , as it follows a number of drivers trying unsuccessfully to avoid filling up their tanks with BP fuel . The piece also explores the effect a boycott could have on independent businesses , and the moral difficulties of finding a `` good '' oil company . Reuters is reporting that Russia 's top energy official , Igor Sechin , has said BP 's chief executive will soon resign . `` We know that Tony Hayward is leaving his position and he will introduce his successor , '' Sechin told reporters ahead of a meeting with Hayward on Monday . A spokesman for BP said : `` Tony Hayward remains chief executive officer . No change to that position is under discussion . '' Hayward is in Moscow today on a visit to meet Russian officials , including Sechin . I 'll embed the video into the blog when the conference starts . gov\\/gulfresponse , developed by the US national oceanic and atmospheric administration with the US environment protection agency , national coast guard , and the department of interior provides near-real time information about the response effort . You can play with the map to display different information , including the fishery closure area , which is shown above in red . My colleague Mark Tran has sent me a link to a Foreign Policy article which points out there could be some winners from the BP oil spill . Are you a politically stable country with untapped oil reserves that wo n't soon be trapped behind a daunting web of post-spill moratoriums and regulations ? If so , the world 's energy companies would like to have a word with you . Expect newfound interest in Australia 's offshore oil reserves , for instance . But the big winner here is Canada , whose oil reserves , mainly in the form of Alberta 's gargantuan oil sand deposits , are the second largest in the world behind Saudi Arabia 's . The Daily Mail knows what has been going wrong during the BP oil spill Obama has been playing too much golf . He has played at least seven times since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 , creating America 's biggest environmental disaster . Having already racked up 39 games since taking office , Mr Obama is approaching the record as the U.S. President spending the most time on the golf course . Republican Party chairman Michael Steele has called on the President to stop playing until the oil leak has been curbed . Steele said he was outraged ` that President Obama finds himself on yet another golf course as oil continues to spew into the Gulf ' . The TEDxOilSpill conference , looking into BP 's handling of the oil spill , has just begun . Here 's the live stream . The Guardian 's US environment correspondent , Suzanne Goldenberg , is live-tweeting the TEDx event . `` Now up : Philippe Cousteau , grandson of Jacques Cousteau , describing his dive into the oil in the Gulf of Mexico #TEDxOilSpill '' You can follow her @suzyji . The BBC has an article listing the gaffes of Tony Hayward . From taking part in a boat race around the Isle of Wight to describing the environmental impact of the spill as `` very , very modest '' , this list of PR hiccups suggest Hayward would have been better to apply his stonewalling technique used in Congress . `` For every bird that is caught -LRB- and cleaned of oil -RRB- , there are ten more that are n't , '' says Philippe Cousteau at the TEDx conference . Cousteau , who dived into the spill with a film crew , says the worst aspect of the disaster is what we can not see , beneath the surface . `` We have underinvested in our oceans for decades , '' he says . Because we do n't understand the ecosystems in place we have struggled to react well to the spill . `` Understanding if there is water on Mars is not critical to our life on this planet , looking after our oceans is , '' he says , waiting for applause that is rather slow to come . -LRB- To be fair , it is 9am in Washington -RRB- . The organization of petroleum exporting countries -LRB- Opec -RRB- has called on the US to reconsider its ban on new deep-water drilling , despite safety concerns in the wake of the oil spill . Abdalla Salem El Badri , secretary-general of the organization , says offshore drilling is an important source of oil and any ban would be too hasty when the cause of the Gulf of Mexico spill is still unclear . `` We should not really ban it and we should not jump to conclusions , '' he told reporters after meeting European Union officials in Brussels . President Barack Obama last month imposed a six-month ban on Gulf of Mexico . Over 32,000 people like the BP America Facebook group and receive daily updates on the amount of oil collected , and the overall amount of oil recovered . The latest post states from midnight to noon on 27 June nearly 8000 barrels of oil were collected and over 4,000 barrels of oil and 27.4 million cubic feet of natural gas were flared . This post received 467 comments . The group is updated approximately every hour with links to news footage , environmental websites and BP 's own YouTube channel . BP also update their 16,000 followers on Twitter with regular tweets and replies to questions asked , such as the response to @silencematters , which said the 435,600 barrels collected , to date , only reflects the amount of oil and does not include the water . BP oil spill gear a different way for people to express their disapproval of company . My personal favorite has to be `` real slick , Tony . '' Hello , Richard Adams in Washington DC , where the TEDxOilSpill conference is going on all day . As mentioned below , you can follow the TEDxOilSpill conference live video stream right here , and check out the list of speakers here to see what 's coming up . The Guardian 's US environmental correspodent Suzanne Goldenberg is tweeting TEDxOilSpill via the gift of Twitter here or you can follow her at @suzyj . Twitterati may also wish to follow the #TEDxOilSpill hashtage . One of the most interesting things to come out of the TEDxOilSpill conference is the crowd-sourcing of possible ideas to tackle the Gulf spill . Although not all the ideas being suggested are too bright . `` Is it possible to drill a new hole down to the same cavity and start pumping the oil with a new pipe ? '' Ah , yes , that would be the relief wells that BP are drilling . It 's raining oil , or something , in Louisiana My colleague Matthew Weaver offers this Youtube video , via the excellent Kate Sheppard of Mother Jones , who writes : Can it rain oil ? A video shot after a recent storm in River Ridge , Louisiana , which has been making the rounds online in recent days , purports to show exactly that . `` You can see that this is oil , '' the narrator says , sweeping a camera over puddles and patches of road bearing a telltale rainbow sheen . `` Is n't that crazy dude It 's oil everywhere . And it 's thick over there , like we 're seeing in the Gulf . '' The video should be viewed with a healthy dose of skepticism . But it does raise an interesting question . Is such a thing even possible ? Sheppard goes on to discuss the possibilities , involving oil dispersants and toxic run-off , and partly concludes : '' -LRB- T -RRB- here are plenty of serious health concerns posed by the spill and the widespread use of dispersants that have nothing to do with oily rain . '' Some of the best reporting on the oil industry in the US comes from the Houston Chronicle unsurprising , given the concentration of oil companies in the region . Here 's an excellent comment piece by Loren Steffy , who does the sums on how much money BP was trying to save with its ill-fated , cheapskate cost-cutting measures at the Deepwater Horizon rig . All of $ 5m . Last week , I asked a half-dozen independent oil industry experts with experience in offshore drilling to estimate the costs of using more conservative methods . All but one agreed that the added costs would have been between $ 4.75 million and $ 5 million . The lone holdout said it might have cost $ 6.5 million . What 's that old saying about penny wise , pound foolish ? That might just be the most expensive $ 5m `` saved '' in the history of the oil business . There 's more details of the `` savings '' that BP made in a related blogpost here . Contrary to the news we reported here at 12.46 pm below , BP tells AFP : `` Tony Hayward remains chief executive and is not resigning . '' But everyone knows that Tony Hayward wo n't resign until shortly after the day the relief well starts working and stops the gushing oil . So , wild guess , about August 30 . Sorry Tony , too late for Cowes Week . One of the reasons why BP 's disasterous gusher has n't killed more marine life is that the Gulf of Mexico 's oxygen-depleted `` dead zone '' caused by algae blooming thanks to agricultural byproducts flowing out of the Mississippi River has already done that job . So here 's unrelated bad news from researchers , forecasting that the Gulf 's dead zone will be unusually large this year . It has nothing to do with the oil spill , but the spill may affect the dead zone . AP reports : University of Michigan ecologist Donald Scavia says the BP spill could make the dead zone larger because microbes gobble oxygen when consuming oil . But the effect could be offset if the oil limits algae growth . So it 's a lose-lose scenario , really . More talk about BP being broken up , reported by the FT 's useful Alphaville blog , from UniCredit , which thinks BP may have to split off its Gulf and US operations from the company 's operations in the rest of the world . That would put a firewall -LRB- or maybe a blowout preventer ? -RRB- around the profitable parts of the company : In our opinion , the creation of separate US and RoW -LRB- Rest of World -RRB- entities would increase transparency , thus allowing equity and corporate investors to decide BP 's fate . In more details : BP US would define the worst case scenario of asset seizure , ring fence liabilities and vulnerable assets , offer upside potential from leverage to the rump value . BP RoW would be able to operate , invest and pay dividends without the uncertainties surrounding the consequences of Macondo . This thought has been around for a while , and I 'd be surprised if some at BP are n't running the ruler over that thought to see if it fits . The TEDxOilSpill conference reconvenes after lunch you can watch the live video stream -LRB- and there 's really no substitute for watching -RRB- and some over-excitement causes minor embarrassment . Time magazine 's Ecocentric blogger , Bryan Walsh , who 's at the conference in Washington DC , writes : The big news came right before the lunch break . Francis Beland , a VP at the XPrize Foundation , announced that the group would be offering a $ 10 million XPrize for smart ideas on how to handle the oil spill . Except ... sort of not . A few minutes later , the X Prize people tweeted : Want to clarify that while at #TEDxOilSpill we have not launched a new $ 10 Million X PRIZE or Challenge for #oilspill clean up However , we are in the process of developing a multi-million dollar competition to help alleviate the effects of the #oilspill in the Gulf The latest speaker at TEDxOilSpill conference is Susan Shaw , a marine toxicologist and director of the Marine Environmental Research Institute . She 's a specialist in the effects of man-made chemicals in marine mammals along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the US . She tells the conference that she visited the Gulf in May , and actually got her feet wet or , as she puts it , was the only toxicologist `` dumb enough '' to go in the Gulf . As a result , she says , she got a nasty sore throat . In the course of testing herself , Dr Shaw says she discovered she had 113 different compounds and flame retardants in her own blood . Her descriptions of the effects of the toxic dispersants , such as Corexit , are highly disturbing . According to Dr Shaw , the combination of oil and Corexit creates an even more toxic cocktail . Meanwhile , dolphins and other marine life which breathe at surface will also suffer from ingesting chemicals on the surface , and are likely to develop chemical pneumonia , and organ and brain damage . One thing it 's worth mentioning is a very interesting piece in the FT , which suggests that even the two relief wells being drilled by BP are not as cut and dried as many assume : While those in the industry believe the relief wells will eventually stop the oil , they note the scale of the challenge . In addition to the depth , the original drilling process suffered several setbacks because of the difficult geology and pressures . `` Drilling a well thousands of feet into rock to hit a target no more than six inches -LRB- 15cm -RRB- wide is n't exactly a sure thing , '' says Guy LeBas , strategist at Janney Capital Markets . `` There remains a risk that the leak could continue past August . '' -LRB- Some people may not be able to access the article because of the FT 's paywall . -RRB- TEDxOilSpill is running behind schedule , but here 's Leroy Stick , the pseudonym behind the brilliant @BPGlobalPR Twitter account , which has been skewering BP 's lame attempts at public relations since the Gulf spill muscled its way onto the front pages . Stick starts off in the persona of `` Terry '' the BP PR guy and he 's heavily disguised , wearing a ski mask , wig , hat and scarf , with a voice modifier on the microphone . `` Terry '' says that BP has plenty more rigs in the Gulf to worry about , such as the Atlantis rig , and flashes up on screen the Instant Message from the MMS that granted it drilling permission : -LRB- BP -RRB- hey can we drill atlantis pls ? `` Terry '' then describes BP 's PR plan , which he calls `` the ex-wives strategy basically we treat reporters and the media like they are our ex-wives ... The point is , say what you need to say so you can go and enjoy your yacht . '' After `` Terry '' has done , Stick appears , still in a mask but without the other props and speaking in his own voice . I 'm here today because I started a Twitter account I acknowledge that 's ridiculous ... In terms of why I 'm wearing a mask it 's because my identity does n't matter . What most funny about @BPGlobalPr , Sticks says , is that so many people thought it was real to begin with . He finishes with some advice real advice for BP : A few words for BP , my dear friends . Forget your brand , BP , it 's over . Forget about fixing your brand and concentrate on fixing the Gulf . '' And that 's a good place to leave it .

Sechin , Russia 's deputy prime minister and the chairman of the country 's biggest oil company Rosneft , was responding to a question about what would be discussed at the meeting . BP denied that Hayward was close to resigning . `` Tony Hayward remains the chief executive of BP . There are no plans for him to resign , '' a spokeswoman said . Sechin is a close ally of Russia 's prime minister Vladimir Putin , and the leader at least unofficially of the Kremlin 's hardline siloviki faction made up of former KGB officers . A one-time Soviet military intelligence agent , Sechin presides over an impeccable network of sources , both formal and clandestine , all across the oil industry . His comments about Tony Hayward 's imminent departure from BP are unlikely to have been made by accident . The reports further boosted BP 's shares , already up this morning on hopes that the oil giant will be able to plug the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico earlier than thought , to 311.9 p , a gain of 7.3 p or 2.4 % . On Friday the shares crashed to a 14-year low of 304p , down over 6 % . More than # 60bn has been wiped off the company 's market value since the rig explosion on 20 April . Hayward 's visit to Moscow is the first since the oil spill , and comes amid Kremlin worries over BP 's future . Its Russian venture TNK-BP is responsible for a quarter of BP 's global oil output . The Russian ambassador to Britain has said his government wants guarantees from BP that the venture would not be affected by its growing bill for the oil spill . BP said this morning it was now spending $ 100m -LRB- # 66m -RRB- a day on efforts to contain and clean up the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , bringing its total bill to $ 2.65 bn so far . The oil giant spent $ 300m on containing the oil spill in the past three days . Its total bill is up from Friday 's figure of $ 2.35 bn . That includes the cost of trying to cap the well , clean up the environmental damage caused by the leak and pay compensation to those affected . BP has paid out more than $ 128m to fishermen and others . BP said today it remained on track to complete its relief well , which is designed to kill the leaking well , within the three months envisaged in May . But according to reports , the company is now hoping to seal the well by mid-July , rather than early August . There was more good news as the US National Hurricane Centre in Miami said that tropical storm Alex , which has pounded parts of Central America and is heading towards Mexico 's Caribbean coast , was likely to strike well away from the area where BP is trying to stop the oil leak . Barack Obama and David Cameron said that the oil giant should `` remain a strong and stable company '' after meeting to discuss the environmental disaster on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Toronto .

Fish are fleeing the area of the Deepwater Horizon spill , biologists say . Photograph : Sean Gardner\\/Reuters Scientists are confronting growing evidence that BP 's ruptured well in the Gulf of Mexico is creating oxygen-depleted `` dead zones '' where fish and other marine life can not survive . In two separate research voyages , independent scientists have detected what were described as `` astonishingly high '' levels of methane , or natural gas , bubbling from the well site , setting off a chain of reactions that suck the oxygen out of the water . In some cases , methane concentrations are 100,000 times normal levels . Other scientists as well as sport fishermen are reporting unusual movements of fish , shrimp , crab and other marine life , including increased shark sightings closer to the Alabama coast . Larry Crowder , a marine biologist at Duke University , said there were already signs that fish were being driven from their habitat . `` The animals are already voting with their fins to get away from where the oil spill is and where potentially there is oxygen depletion , '' he said . `` When you begin to see animals changing their distribution that is telling you about the quality of water further offshore . Basically , the fish are moving closer to shore to try to get to better water . '' Such sightings and an accumulation of data from the site of the ruptured well and from the ocean depths miles away have deepened concerns that the enormity of the environmental disaster in the Gulf has yet to be fully understood . It could also jeopardise the Gulf 's billion-dollar fishing and shrimping industry . In a conference call with reporters , Samantha Joye , a scientist at the University of Georgia who has been studying the effects of the spill at depth , said the ruptured well was producing up to 50 % as much methane and other gases as oil . The finding presents a new challenge to scientists who so far have been focused on studying the effects on the Gulf of crude oil , and the 5.7 m litres of chemical dispersants used to break up the slick . Joye said her preliminary findings suggested the high volume of methane coming out of the well could upset the ocean food chain . Such high concentrations , it is feared , would trigger the growth of microbes , which break up the methane , but also gobble up oxygen needed by marine life to survive , driving out other living things . Joye said the methane was settling in a 200-metre layer of the water column , between depths of 1,000 to 1,300 metres in concentrations that were already threatening oxygen levels . `` That water can go completely anoxic -LRB- extremely low oxygen -RRB- and that is a pretty serious situation for any oxygen-requiring organism . We have n't seen zero-oxygen water but there is certainly enough gas in the water to draw oxygen down to zero , '' she said . `` It could wreak havoc with those communities that require oxygen , '' Joye said , wiping out plankton and other organisms at the bottom of the food chain . A Texas A&M University oceanographer issued a similar warning last week on his return from a 10-day research voyage in the Gulf . John Kessler recorded `` astonishingly high '' methane levels in surface and deep water within a five-mile radius of the ruptured well . His team also recorded 30 % depletion of oxygen in some locations . Even without the gusher , the Gulf was afflicted by 6,000 to 7,000 square miles of dead zone at the mouth of the Mississippi river , caused by run-off from animal waste and farm fertiliser . The run-off sets off a chain reaction . Algae bloom and quickly die , and are eaten up by microbes that also consume oxygen needed by marine life . But the huge quantities of methane , or natural gas , being released from the well in addition to crude presents an entirely new danger to marine life and to the Gulf 's lucrative fishing and shrimping industry . `` Things are changing , and what impacts there are on the food web are not going to be clear until we go out and measure that , '' said Joye .

Hurricane Alex , upgraded from tropical storm status late last night and expected to hit the coasts of Mexico and Texas later today , is expected to interrupt the company 's efforts for several days to come . Waves as high as 3.6 metres -LRB- 12ft -RRB- are expected to delay the company 's plans to employ a further system to capture more oil from the blown-out oil well until later in the week , while controlled burns of crude on the oil 's surface , flights spraying dispersant chemicals and booming operations were all halted yesterday , officials said . Alex , the first June storm in 15 years to gain hurricane strength in the Atlantic , is expected to make land tonight , bringing 15-30cms -LRB- 6-12ins -RRB- of rain to north-eastern Mexico and southern Texas as well as dangerous storm surges along the coast . The hurricane has winds of 80mph and was located about 255 miles south-east of Brownsville , Texas , at 7am today UK time . It was moving west at 5mph , the US national hurricane center said . Mexico has closed its Gulf coast ports of Dos Bocas and Cayo Arcas which handle around 80 % of the country 's oil exports since Sunday because of strong surf . Although Alex is hampering BP 's clean-up efforts , the company has said the storm is not expected to interrupt plans to drill two relief wells intended to plug the leak by August . A hurricane warning has been issued for the coast of Texas , south of Baffin Bay down to the mouth of the Rio Grande , and along the north-east coast of Mexico .

Photograph : AP How much oil is being lost ? Can they stop the leak ? In the meantime , BP has placed a containment cap on Deepwater Horizon 's failed blow-out preventer which takes some of the oil and gas to a drillship , the Discoverer Enterprise . However , a technical problem has meant the cap had to be removed for a short time and tropical storms or hurricanes could also cause the containment to be paused . Why did top kill fail ? `` Top kill '' was BP 's attempt to plug the oil leak by pumping huge quantities of mud into the blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- that sits on the seabed . Two high pressure pumps were used to force mud into the BOP , with the aim of pushing the oil and gas back down the well shaft . BP hoped this would halt the flow for long enough for it to pump cement into the shaft , sealing it . Early signs were encouraging a webcam pointing at the site showed that mud , rather than oil , was leaking out of the well pipe . But ultimately the pressure forcing the oil upwards proved greater than the force of the mud , which was delivered at a pressure of 6,800 pounds per square inch . BP 's chief operating officer , Doug Suttles , said it decided to pull the plug on top kill after its `` best and brightest people '' agreed it was not working . Oil industry experts had warned that the pressure of the mud might fracture the rock around the well , dissipating the pressure and letting the oil and gas surge back up . What else could BP try ? BP 's two relief wells are designed to intercept the existing shaft . That will allow it to inject concrete deep into the seabed and permanently stop the leak . Some experts believe this is the only certain way of stopping the disaster . The first relief well is already over 12,000 ft deep , but it is likely to take until the end of July to complete . The second well was paused last week so that its BOP was available in case BP tries the BOP-on-BOP procedure . Could these relief wells hit problems ? The most obvious risk is the weather . Hurricane season officially started on 1 June , and a serious storm could force BP to suspend drilling -LRB- as well as upset efforts to protect the US coastline from the spill -RRB- . Hurricane Alex already looks likely to disrupt clean-up efforts . Johnson believes hurricanes are `` a threat '' , but that BP should be able to complete the drilling before the serious storms arrive in August and September . `` You can stay on site through many storm conditions , but in the worst cases you have to pull up the well . The reality is that a big storm this early is not likely . '' A dead sea turtle washed ashore at Pass Christian , Mississippi . More than 425 turtles are known to have died in the spill zone .

The American Power Act launched by Senator John Kerry was initially prepared with new offshore oil fields in mind to increase energy security in the US and appease the oil industry .

TMT , the shipping firm that owns the vessel , had hoped to test a containment boom system designed to direct greater volumes of oily water into the 12 vents or `` jaws '' the ship uses to suck it in , said spokesman Bob Grantham . But choppy seas have made that impossible , and have also prevented a flotilla of smaller skimmers from working offshore along the coasts of Alabama , Mississippi and Florida . `` As was the case yesterday , the sea state , with waves at times in excess of 10 feet , is not permitting optimal testing conditions , '' Grantham said . The skimmers , which have been idle off the coasts since a spell of bad weather last week kicked up by Hurricane Alex , were on the water along the Louisiana coast over the weekend . Officials with the US coast guard are waiting for the weather to improve before sending them elsewhere . `` We 've got our guys out there and they 're docked and ready , but safety is a huge concern for us , especially with the smaller vessels , '' said Courtnee Ferguson , a of the Joint Information Command in Mobile , Alabama . On Sunday , huge barges used to collect oil from skimming vessels were parked at the mouth of Mobile Bay , waiting for waves to subside offshore . The current spate of bad weather is likely to last well into next week . On the shore , beach clean-up crews were making progress on new oil that washed up because of the high tides generated by last week 's bad weather . In Grand Isle , Louisiana , about 800 people were removing tar balls and liquid oil from seven miles of beach , coast guard commander . `` In a day or two , you would n't be able to tell the oil was even there , '' he said . By Wednesday , Ogrydziak said they should have a machine on the beach that washes sand where the oil washed ashore . Crews have also been working to put containment booms thrown around by the storms back into place , he said . So far , weather has not slowed drilling on two relief wells that could be the best hope of finally plugging what has become the worst oil leak in Gulf history . BP officials have said they 're running slightly ahead of schedule on the drilling , but expect weather or other delays . Early to mid-August is still the estimate for the completion of the drilling . The capture and burning of oil and gas at the site of the leaking well has continued without interruption from the weather . But the choppy seas have delayed the operation of another vessel that officials say will roughly double the amount of oil being collected or burned .

Photograph : KPA\\/Zuma\\/Rex Features The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has so far cost BP $ 3.12 bn -LRB- # 2bn -RRB- , the company said this morning as it emerged that the oil giant is demanding that its partners in the well pick up at least part of the bill . Last month , BP sent out demands for almost $ 400m to Anadarko and Japan 's Mitsui Oil Exploration Company , both of whom are minority shareholders in the well . That is equivalent to 40 % of the $ 1bn BP said it spent in May . Anadarko owns 25 % of the well and Mitsui has 10 % . Details of the demands were contained in documents released by a Senate subcommittee last week . BP is demanding payment within 30 days , meaning that the two companies have roughly until the weekend to pay up . Anadarko , however , has refused to accept any blame for the disaster . Last month its chairman and chief executive , Jim Hackett , said BP 's actions probably amounted to `` gross negligence or wilful misconduct '' . If proved in court , that could allow Anadarko to escape its responsibilities under its joint operating agreement . Mitsui , meanwhile , has said it is too early to conclude what happened on the Deepwater Horizon . News that BP is trying to recoup some of its losses comes as the company updated investors on Monday morning about the scale of the salvage and clean-up exercise . Since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on 20 April , the cost of the response to date amounts to approximately $ 3.12 bn , including the cost of the spill response , containment , relief well drilling , grants to the Gulf states , claims paid , and federal costs . The news follows BP 's agreement on 16 June to put $ 20bn into a special clean-up fund for the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster after company executives met Barack Obama . Approximately 44,500 personnel , more than 6,563 vessels and some 113 aircraft are now engaged in the response effort . BP said on Monday that almost 95,000 claims for compensation have been submitted and more than 47,000 payments have been made , totalling almost $ 147m . BP said two containment systems continue to collect oil and gas flowing from the Deepwater Horizon 's failed blow-out preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- and transport them to vessels on the surface . The first cap , installed on 3 June , takes oil and gas to the Discoverer Enterprise where oil is collected and gas flared . The second system , which began operations on 16 June , takes oil and gas to the Q4000 vessel on the surface where both oil and gas are flared . As of 3 July , a total of approximately 25,198 barrels of oil were collected or flared by the two systems and 57.0 m cubic feet of gas were flared . To date , the total volume of oil collected or flared by the containment systems is approximately 585,400 barrels . Preparations continue for the next step in containment operations , BP added , but work on a first floating riser containment system designed to allow more rapid disconnection and reconnection of the system thereby reducing the time that collection is halted by inclement weather has been delayed by heightened sea states caused by Hurricane Alex as it passed through the Gulf of Mexico . It is currently anticipated that the first floating riser system will be available to begin operations towards the end of the week , BP said . Plans also are being developed for additional containment capacity and flexibility . These are currently anticipated to begin operations around mid-to-late July . Work on the first relief well , which started 2 May , continues . The well reached a depth of 17,725 feet on 4 July . The second relief well , which started 16 May , has now reached 13,871 feet . Both wells are still estimated to take approximately three months to complete from the start of drilling . Operations to skim oil from the surface of the water were suspended for approximately three days because of Hurricane Alex. To date , these operations have recovered , in total , approximately 673,497 barrels of oily liquid . In addition , a total of 275 controlled burns have been carried out to date , removing an estimated 238,000 barrels of oil from the sea 's surface . The total length of containment boom deployed as part of efforts to prevent oil from reaching the coast is now almost 2.9 m feet .

The capping procedure , which could take up to 10 days , means that the existing `` top hat '' on the well would have to be removed , allowing oil to flow freely into the sea again . But the plan was approved on Friday by national incident commander Thad Allen and energy secretary Steven Chu . In an email to staff outlining the plan , Hayward struck an optimistic note , saying the oil group would emerge from the disaster , caused by an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig on 20 April , `` as a stronger and safer company in the months and years to come '' . BP 's clean-up costs to date amount to some $ 3.12 bn -LRB- # 2bn -RRB- , including the cost of the spill response , containment , relief well drilling , grants to the Gulf states , claims paid , and federal costs . To recoup some of those losses , in June BP sent out demands for almost $ 400m to its partners in the well Houston-based Anadarko and Japan 's Mitsui Oil Exploration Company . Anadarko owns 25 % of the well and Mitsui has 10 % . Anadarko , however , has flatly refused to pay up . The latest attempt to halt the spill comes after a week of shuttle diplomacy by Hayward , who is searching for a friendly investor to see off a potential hostile takeover from a rival such as Total , Shell or ExxonMobil . After talks with an existing shareholder , the Kuwait Investment Office , about taking a larger stake in the business , the BP boss is understood to have met the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority -LRB- ADIA -RRB- last week . The Libyan Investment Authority was also advised to invest in BP shares by Shokri Ghanem , chairman of Libya 's national oil company .

Work on installing the cap using robots a mile below the surface of the sea was successfully completed last night as efforts intensified to capture all the oil that has poured into the sea since the Deepwater Horizon explosion killed 11 people on 12 April . Tests on the well 's internal pressure will take between six and 48 hours to establish whether the flow has been stopped or leaks remain elsewhere . The developments may mark a turning point in efforts to stop the flow until more permanent measures , including the drilling of two relief wells , can be completed by the middle of next month . BP said : `` It is expected , though can not be assured , that no oil will be released to the ocean for the duration of the test . This will not , however , be an indication that flow from the wellbore has been permanently stopped . '' The company added that the sealing system had never before been deployed at such depths or under such conditions .

Photograph : KPA\\/Zuma\\/Rex Features A commission appointed by Barack Obama to uncover the cause of America 's worst environmental disaster turned its sights today on the clash of wills between BP and the operator of the doomed Deepwater Horizon rig . In the high-stakes world of offshore drilling , there was in-built conflict between oil companies , such as BP , and rig operators , such as Transocean , the commission was told on the opening day of public hearings at a New Orleans hotel . `` There is natural friction between safety and caution and meeting schedules , '' said Larry Dickerson , who is the chief executive of Diamond Offshore Drilling , Transocean 's main rival . `` Our customers push us . '' But he said the rig operator in this case , Transocean should have exercised its power to shut down BP 's well operation before the blowout . `` The drill company is sitting there with its hands on the brake , '' he said . `` They have the responsibility to do that . '' With the spill entering its 13th week , BP said it had successfully fitted a tighter cap over the well , a step towards a containment system that could potentially trap all the leaking oil . The oil company will test the cap and pressures in the well for much of Tuesday , before determining whether it can begin capturing more oil . Kent Wells , a senior vice-president for BP America , told the hearing it would take two or three days to determine the effectiveness of the seal . Bob Graham , the former Democratic senator who is co-chair of the commission , opened the hearings by promising to press hard to shed light on oil industry safety practices as well as government oversight . `` Was the Deepwater Horizon an oil rig that operated outside the normal standards of safety , or was it representative of other rigs ? '' The commission was almost swept off course by the controversy over Obama 's efforts to put a stop to new drilling projects in the Gulf . Many are furious at Obama for seeking a six-month ban on new deepwater drilling . The administration issued a new , more limited ban today . Members of Congress and oil executives argued that the administration had gone too far in restricting drilling , and that the catastrophe in the Gulf was a one-off caused by BP 's recklessness . `` The Macondo well was a highly unstable and volatile well even before the blow-out , '' said Steve Scalise , a Republican member of Congress . However , Cynthia Sarthou of the Gulf Restoration Network noted that Chevron and Exxon had a similar history of safety violations , and Chevron had been fined more than $ 1.2 m in the last 10 years The commission has until 15 December to produce a definitive account of the causes for the explosion , and offer recommendations to prevent a repeat . Graham said he would not be satisfied with a nuts-and-bolts explanation . `` There is almost a cultural issue in the industry and in the government agencies responsible for monitoring industry , '' he said . William Reilly , the commission 's other chairman , who was head of the Environmental Protection Agency when the Exxon Valdez tanker ran aground in Alaska 20 years ago , also promised a far-ranging investigation . `` We will follow the facts wherever they lead and determine the cause and the root cause of the event . '' Other commission members said today the team had deliberately opted for a softly-softly launch to the investigation , hoping to draw attention to the economic and environmental consequences of the spill . That approach won over some locals . Sal Sunseri , owner of a century-old oyster firm , appeared at the commission to say his business was facing ruin . `` What I am focused on is capping the well cleaning it up , '' he said . Determining the causes of the explosion came second . But members of the public were not so easily satisfied . At the end of the day , dozens lined up to demand BP pay up for business losses , a sweeping ban on oil exploration , and for the governent to undertake largescale restoration projects . Drew Landry , a fishermen who said he had been turned away when he volunteered to help with the clean-up , brought a guitar to sing a song he wrote about the spill .

Photograph : AP BP engineers trying to stop the flow of oil into the Gulf of Mexico have fixed a leak in the new containment system and are preparing to start critical pressure tests of the cap , the company has said . Kent Wells , BP 's senior vice-president of exploration and production , said the team had replaced the defective hose and would launch the test later today . `` We landed it this morning , '' Wells said of the replacement hose . `` I 'm expecting that we 'll start up -LRB- the test -RRB- here later this morning , sometime today . '' The cap , installed on Monday , is a crucial step toward a four-vessel oil capture system that is hurricane-ready and can collect up to 80,000 barrels a day . The first of two relief wells is expected to intercept and plug the leak by mid-August . It represents the best hope yet of stopping the oil from leaking into the sea since the 20 April Deepwater Horizon explosion that killed 11 people . Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state , pledged to consider Congressional demands for an investigation into the charges that BP pushed for the release of Abdel Basset al-Megrahi to help it clinch lucrative drilling contracts off the coast of Libya . Tests of the latest containment attempt began with BP shutting off pipes that were funnelling some of the oil to ships on the surface , meaning the full force of the gusher went up into the cap . Deep-sea robots began slowly closing three openings that let oil pass through . Ultimately the flow of crude will be blocked entirely . Engineers watched pressure readings to check whether the well was intact . The first two are simple on-off valves . The third the one with the leaking hose is closed gradually and takes longer . Retired coastguard Admiral Thad Allen , who is overseeing the government response to the disaster , said a committee of scientists and engineers would monitor the results and assess them every six hours . The test would end after 48 hours to evaluate the findings . `` I was gung-ho for this test and I remain gung-ho for this test , '' he said . If the cap works it will enable BP to stop the oil from gushing into the sea , either by holding it back like a stopper or , if the pressure is too great , channelling some through lines to as many as four collection ships . The cap was lowered on to the well on Monday . But before BP could test it the government intervened because of concerns about whether the buildup of pressure from the gushing oil could rupture the walls of the well and make the leak worse . Allen said : `` We sat long and hard about delaying the tests . '' He said the pause was necessary in the interests of the public , the environment and safety until officials were convinced the test could go ahead . Allen said the testing would offer insight into the other more permanent solution to the fix : two relief wells intended to plug the gusher from deep underground . The mapping of the sea floor that was done to prepare for the well cap test and the pressure readings will help determine how much mud and cement will be needed to seal off the well . Drill work was stopped on one relief well because it was not clear what effect the testing of the cap could have on it . Work on the other relief well had already been stopped according to plan . The government estimates 1.5 m to 2.5 m gallons are leaking every day . The latest effort to control the gushing well follows a string of failed attempts by BP to contain the leak , including the use of a giant concrete and steel box that quickly became encased in gaseous ice ; a colossal siphon tube that trapped very little oil ; and an effort to jam the well by pumping in mud and shredded rubber . As of Wednesday , the 85th day of the disaster , 92m to 182m gallons -LRB- 348m to 689m litres -RRB- of oil had spewed into the Gulf since the rig leased by BP exploded .

BP is yet to predict the worst-case scenario over the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico . Photograph : Dave Martin\\/AP Despite BP fighting valiantly to keep reporters and photographers away from the affected areas , the oil is still erupting out of the sea bed , making the waters of the Gulf of Mexico heavy with petroleum and smearing the coastline with black goo . So what is going to happen now the hurricane season has arrived ? The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration claims there wo n't be any oil droplets in any hurricane 's precipitation . But Jeff Masters , the founder of Weather Underground , from the University of Michigan , disagrees . In fact , he claims that the oil droplets in the hurricane-force winds might actually cause '' explosive deepening '' of hurricanes in the Gulf . What will happen when an oil-powered hurricane hits New Orleans and splatters its streets and buildings with crude oil ? What will happen when it 's not just pelicans and turtles that are plastered in black stuff but people ? What about when rice and sugarcane are covered in oil ? How will BP keep the reporters and photographers out of it then ? But BP is aware of the possibility of impending disaster a hurricane might bring . On the BP oil leak response website , Mike Utsler , the BP incident commander , based in Houma , tells us : `` It 's an area that we 've put tremendous planning and preparation , from everything in terms of how we would respond to moving people , first and foremost , to safety , but how we would also protect and manage the equipment that 's so vital to our operations '' So that 's all right then . BP is going to move everybody out of the way of any carcinogenic , petroleum-filled storms that hit the mainland . But wait a minute ! Mike Utsler is n't talking about the people of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . He 's only talking about the people and equipment involved in the cleanup . `` How do we do and manage our people , '' he says `` in such a way that their safety is paramount . '' In fact , BP apparently has a weather team working in conjunction with `` the area command weather experts , as well as of course the hurricane center , and our NOAA colleagues '' so when a hurricane hits New Orleans and plasters the streets and buildings with crude oil , at least BP will have predicted it . But what it 's not predicting , at the moment , is the worst-case scenario . BP does n't actually know how big the oil field they drilled into is . They 're drilling into lower tertiary -LRB- Paleogene -RRB- rock that was laid down at the same time mammals and birds were coming into being : 65-23m years ago . It is one of the deepest wells ever drilled by the oil and gas industry , so as you can imagine , they 're feeling their way in all this . Appearing before a House subcommittee in Washington , Tony Hayward , the CEO of BP , estimated that there might be a modest 2bn gallons down there , which could mean it could go on belching out oil for another four years . On the other hand , when BP originally announced their discovery of the '' giant '' find at its Tiber Prospect , experts estimated the size at 42bn gallons . And since they were talking about `` recoverable oil '' -LRB- which could be only 20 % of the actual oil in the site -RRB- it would mean the site may hold as much as 210bn gallons . In other words , it could go on belching out oil for another hundred years . Could that be enough time for the oil slick to reach the Mediterranean ? Or , heaven forbid , Brighton ? But we should n't blame poor old BP . After all BP did n't know the Deepwater Horizon was going to explode , otherwise there would be 11 oil workers who would still be alive today . And it did n't know -LRB- apparently -RRB- that it was unsafe to replace the heavy drilling mud in the pipes with lighter seawater , as the rig 's chief driller advised them . And of course once it happened , BP did n't know how to stop the oil coming out . But then they 've got more important things to think about , such as the return to their shareholders . And if the Gulf oil spill goes on for another hundred years , polluting the world 's entire ocean system , and the company going into liquidation as a result , that really is something to worry about . Time for a ban .

Photograph : AP\\/Jamahiriya Broadcasting Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state , pledged last night to consider congressional demands for an investigation into allegations that BP lobbied for the release of the man convicted over the Lockerbie bombing as part of an oil - for-terrorist deal . The White House added to the pressure on the British oil firm today as it gave the green light to renewed attempts to close valves on a new , tighter-fitting cap over BP 's fractured wellhead in the Gulf of Mexico . With pressure mounting on BP , Clinton responded to reports that the firm had lobbied the British government for the release of Abdelbasset al-Megrahi to help it clinch lucrative drilling contracts off the coast of Libya . `` I have received the letter and we will obviously look into it , '' she said . At a press conference , four senators demanded BP put its plans to drill in the Gulf of Sidra on hold until the UK and US state department investigations clear the firm of manoeuvring for Megrahi 's release . `` It is almost too disgusting to fathom that BP had a possible role in securing the release of the Lockerbie terrorist in return for an oil drilling deal , '' said Charles Schumer , a Democratic senator from New York . Megrahi was convicted in connection with the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland , in which 270 people died . He was released on compassionate grounds last August after doctors said he was suffering from cancer and it was likely that he had only months to live . The Libyan is still alive after his transfer to Tripoli . The state department has been sympathetic to anger in the US over his release . `` There was an expectation from last August that Mr Megrahi had only a few months to live , '' a spokesman , Philip Crowley , said . `` Every day that he lives as a free man , we think is an affront to the families of and victims of Pan Am 103 . '' BP 's future in America looked precarious as legislation that could ban the firm from offshore drilling projects for seven years cleared its first hurdle . The House committee on natural resources yesterday approved a proposal from a California Democrat , George Miller , that would ban oil companies with a history of violating safety and environmental regulations from new drilling projects . `` One of the things you should bring to this game is a safety record . You have a company that has had an egregious safety record , a fatal safety record , '' Miller said . On paper , companies would be banned if more than 10 workers are killed at any of their facilities or they have been fined more than $ 10m for polluting waters , over the previous seven years . Firms would also have to prove they have paid in full for any damages or cleanup costs resulting from an oil spill . In reality , however , this would only apply to BP . The company is expected to face billions in fines for the Gulf disaster , and had a history of safety and environmental violations well before the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion killed 11 works and ruptured the wellhead in April . Congressional hearings have since focussed on BP 's history in the US , which include more than 700 safety and environmental violations over the last five years compared with fewer than 10 for the other big oil companies . Most of those violations were unrelated to offshore drilling , including a 2005 explosion at a Texas refinery that killed 15 workers and a badly maintained pipeline that spewed 200,000 gallons -LRB- 910,000 -RRB- of oil along Alaska 's North Slope . The ban would not apply to existing leases , and would still allow BP to act as a minority partner on leases . But another amendment , due to be taken up today , would require the US government to consider an oil company 's safety record before awarding offshore contracts rather than choose the highest bidder . `` We allow them to drill no matter what their environmental , safety or public health record may be , '' Bart Stupak , the Michigan Democrat who proposed the amendment , told the Platts Energy forum . `` I think we have to give the secretary the discretion to say : ` Look you have got such a history here . You are not going to be allowed to drill unless you clean up your act ' . '' Stupak said the reports of a Lockerbie bombing link could provoke additional congressional investigations into BP activities . The company is also facing months , if not years , of congressional scrutiny . Stupak added that he expected the investigation to dominate the next chair of the oversight and investigation committee . Claims made by US senators that BP lobbied for the release of Megrahi as part of an oil-for-terrorist deal are not out of the blue . Last September , Britain 's then justice minister , Jack Straw , admitted the UK had been partly motivated by the need to secure fresh oil contracts when ministers tried , in 2007 , to make it easier to release the man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing . Straw accepted in an interview that he had decided in 2007 to drop his plan to exclude Megrahi from a prisoner transfer agreement -LRB- PTA -RRB- which was being negotiated with Libya . Straw 's change of mind followed lobbying by UK oil interests , notably BP , and the Libyan government . Straw was lobbied on 15 October and 9 November that year by Sir Mark Allen , a former MI6 officer , who then worked for BP as a consultant . Libya was stalling on a # 500m-plus oil deal with BP . Documents last year showed Straw originally promised a PTA would only be reached with Libya if Megrahi was excluded . But he later acceded to Libyan demands to include Megrahi . The change followed a warning from BP that not including the bomber could hurt its business interests . When asked in a Daily Telegraph interview last year if trade and BP were factors , Straw said : `` Yes , -LRB- it was -RRB- a very big part of that . I 'm unapologetic about that ... Libya was a rogue state . `` We wanted to bring it back into the fold . And yes , that included trade and subsequently there was the BP deal . '' A spokesman for BP said the oil company had raised concerns with the government about the slow progress in concluding the PTA , but denied mentioning Megrahi . Megrahi was released by the Scottish government last year on compassionate grounds , because a terminal illness meant he only had a short time to live . But since his return to Libya , he has remained alive . In a further complication , some argue that the evidence used to convict Megrahi was flawed , and that he is in fact innocent of the Lockerbie bombing .

Photograph : BP\\/Reuters BP held out hope today that it had finally brought America 's worst oil spill under control , when a senior executive expressed optimism about a new cap that for the first time since April has stopped oil gushing from a deepwater well . The vice-president , Kent Wells , said pressure was holding up inside the cap , indicating that oil was being successfully contained under the 75-tonne device . Valves on the cap were shut late yesterday and pressure will be tested regularly over the next 36 hours . A fall in pressure would indicate another leak . BP is also planning to start drilling again on a relief well that will cut into the compromised well and enable it to be sealed permanently . The BP share price , which has lost almost 50 % of its value since the original blowout on 20 April , rose almost 4 % in London after the developments , although executives and officials were warning that the nightmare was n't over yet . `` I think it 's important that we do n't get ahead of ourselves , '' said the US president , Barack Obama . `` The new cap is containing oil right now , but scientists are doing a number of tests . What they want to make sure is that by putting this cap on , the oil is n't seeping out elsewhere . That could be even more catastrophic . '' BP chief operating officer , Doug Suttles , said engineers would be checking carefully to make sure no oil was escaping from previously undiscovered leaks . It took about two hours yesterday to close off all the valves to the containment cap . But after it was done , there was a welcome sight for Gulf coast residents , many of whose livelihoods have been hammered by the spill : for the first time , video from BP 's live feed on the ocean floor showed no sign of crude billowing out of the crippled well . The new cap is at best a temporary solution . The US coastguard chief , Thad Allen , said engineers might reopen the seal and collect the flow of oil , though he noted that a new , improved containment facility would reduce the amount of crude fouling the Gulf . Obama said : `` Even if it turns out that we ca n't maintain this cap and completely shut off the flow , the new cap allows us to attach many more containment mechanisms so we are able to take more oil up to the surface and put it on ships and it wo n't be spilling into the Gulf . '' Ultimately , BP hopes the relief well can to intercept the main well and seal it off permanently with heavy drilling mud and cement some time in August . Suttles told CNN the relief well was about 4ft away from reaching the main well . But the BP executive also acknowledged that the Gulf would be feeling the effects of the spill for some time , a thought voiced by several others . `` This is like the very early stages of a bone marrow transplant , '' Ed Markey , the Massachusetts Democrat who is leading a congressional investigation into the environmental effects of the spill , told CNN . `` There is still a possibility that the well can not , in fact , take this pressure , but we are all hoping and praying that it will . '' Even if the well does hold , BP and the Obama administration acknowledge there will be tar balls washing up on the beaches of Louisiana , Alabama , Mississippi and Florida for months . Cleansing sensitive Louisiana wetlands of oil could take several more months , if not years , and marine biologists have warned that it could be decades before the full impact of the oil , and the dispersants used to break up the slick , is fully understood . Aside from the cost to BP , which has spent more than $ 3bn -LRB- # 2bn -RRB- on the cleanup , seen its share price plummet and had to set aside $ 20bn , the spill has caused widespread economic harm across the Gulf . Vast areas of water remain closed to fishing and there has been a rash of hotel cancellations during the school holiday season . `` This body has lost a lot of blood , '' Norm Coleman , a former Republican senator , told CNN . `` This is good news but that does n't mean that the pressure is off . '' Obama warned : `` BP is going to be paying for the damage that it has caused and that 's going to involve not only paying for the environmental cleanup , but compensation for the people who have been affected . '' Anyone can help and contribute to project .

Photograph : Ann Heisenfelt\\/EPA BP insisted it was not yet time to celebrate but there was no mistaking the relief today when a 75 tonne containment cap finally stopped the oil flowing from a rogue well in the Gulf of Mexico after three months . The energy group until recently the pride of the British corporate world made clear to investors and the public that a start on rebuilding its future could only be made once the crude had been halted and the environmental damage stemmed . A few days will be needed to ensure that the Macondo nightmare has been ended but it will take years if not decades to sort out the legal claims from the worst ever spill in US history . Management is starting to think about what a `` new BP '' could look like in a world where a reputation for engineering excellence , entrepreneurial daring and marketing razzmatazz has been beaten from its trademark green and yellow to black and blue . The biggest threat is that BP ceases to exist . The financial claims have been put at up to $ 70bn -LRB- # 45bn -RRB- compared with its current stock market valuation of # 75bn . A 40 % fall in the company 's value since the Deepwater Explorer blew up on 20 April leaves BP vulnerable to hungry predators such as ExxonMobil of America or the emerging oil giants of China and Russia . Exxon has sounded out Washington politicians about how they would react to a merger . BP 's vilified chief executive , Tony Hayward , has been touring the Middle East looking for a `` sugar daddy '' in the oil producing nations of Kuwait or Abu Dhabi . The company has also been preparing to offload up to $ 10bn worth of assets to bolster the balance sheet and help pay the claims . The US government has already forced BP to put aside $ 20bn to pay compensate shrimp fishermen and others who have lost their livelihoods in Louisiana and other states . The BP brand is heavily tarnished , if not destroyed . The Gulf spill comes after the Texas City refinery fire and Alaskan pipeline fractures . A ban is in place on all deep water drilling in the Gulf until the causes of the blowout are known , but even if BP is largely exonerated which seems unlikely its ability to operate in America will be constrained . A takeover of the US business seems highly possible leaving a question over what happens in the rest of the world . China National Offshore Oil Corporation is among companies already talking to BP about buying some of its assets in Argentina while TNK in Russia would like others . BP in future will be smaller and presumably more humble , concentrating on its core businesses of exploration and production rather than the lower margin refining and forecourt sales . But would the British government allow the company to be split up and consumed by say China and the US ? BP has been helped by UK ministers in Libya and elsewhere but they never stepped in to save Rolls-Royce cars , Heathrow or Cadbury chocolate . The leak might be capped and the environment safer , but the fight for BP 's future has only just begun .

Photograph : Michael St Maur Sheil\\/Corbis The government was tonight trying to fight off pressure from the European commission to ban drilling in the North Sea in the aftermath of BP 's disastrous Gulf of Mexico oil spill . Gunther Oettinger , the EC energy commissioner , met UK oil companies and industry regulators and made it clear he would like to impose a moratorium on new wells until lessons were learned . The stand-off came as BP took major strides towards finally capping the rogue Macondo well but new criticism rose that Britain gives energy companies an easy ride compared with other countries . The local MP and residents in Hertfordshire expressed fury over the perceived leniency of the judicial system towards oil companies after a relatively tiny # 5.3 m fine was slapped on BP , Shell and Total over the Buncefield oil depot explosion . In addition there was a growing row over US claims that the UK government had helped release a Libyan terrorist to win drilling rights for the UK oil industry . The Department of Energy and Climate Change said the UK was exercising `` utmost caution '' in the North Sea and was recruiting more environmental inspectors to double inspections of drilling rigs . But it made it clear that Oettinger demands for a moratorium would not be heeded . `` There is no current provision within EU law which would enable any EU body to declare a moratorium on new drilling , or deep water drilling , '' said a spokesman . Oettinger told the European parliament last week that `` the precautionary principle should prevail '' adding : `` Any responsible government would at present practically freeze new permits for drilling with extreme parameters and conditions . '' A spokeswoman for the trade body , Oil & Gas UK , said today that the industry was disappointed that Oettinger reiterated his desire for a moratorium . She added : `` It is such a different situation compared to the Gulf of Mexico given the tighter regulations since the Piper Alpha disaster . '' Kevin Myers , deputy chief executive of the HSE , said he wanted Oettinger to produce evidence to back his calls for a further clampdown on UK drilling . Meanwhile the HSE was under fire from Mike Penning , MP for Hemel Hempstead and junior transport minister , for allegedly being compromised over the Buncefield explosion in 2005 which caused hundreds of homes to be evacuated and triggered a similar number of job losses . Penning described the fine as insulting to his constituents caught up in the blast and wants a public inquiry to investigate the accident and particularly the HSE which brought the charges but also had a safety monitoring role at the site which he believes was not carried out properly . Penning and Des Collins , a solicitor representing residents still chasing compensation claims , both compare the # 5.3 m with the billions being demanded from BP in the Gulf of Mexico - before the cause of the Deepwater Horizon is even known . Penning said he would be writing to Dominic Grieve , the attorney general to have the Buncefield decision reviewed . In the US , secretary of state Hillary Clinton said she would look into claims by a group of Democrat senators that BP lobbied the British government to release Lockerbie bomber , Abdelbaset al-Megrahi , to help secure an oil deal with Libya .

Photograph : Mario Tama\\/Getty Images After 87 days , numerous false starts and broken promises , and more than 4m barrels of oil spewed into the ecologically rich waters of the Gulf of Mexico , the moment was almost too sweet to take in : BP 's underwater cameras , dubbed `` spillcams '' , finally broadcast a picture that was clean , calm and absolutely devoid of any billowing oil . Clapping , handshakes and backslaps erupted in the control room in Houston where BP and US government scientists have mingled , fretted and plotted since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on 20 April . At 2.25 pm on Thursday , the last of three valves in the new sealing cap placed over the Macondo well was at last closed , and the dirty cloud of oil and gas that has become a symbol of nature 's ability to bite back against man 's insatiable demand for energy thinned and was no more . Verbally , the reaction of key players was muted . After a textbook example of how not to conduct public relations in a crisis , they have learned to avoid giving any impression of euphoria . Kent Wells , BP 's senior vice-president , emerged barely five minutes after the oil stopped spewing and told reporters that it `` felt very good not to see any oil going into the Gulf of Mexico . What I 'm trying to do is maintain my emotions . '' Pressed to describe the mood , all he would say was `` I 'm very excited , '' but he added swiftly : `` I do n't want to sort of create a false sense of excitement . '' Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer , was equally reserved . `` It 's a great sight , '' he said , but `` it 's far from the finish line . It 's not the time to celebrate . '' Bob Riley , governor of Alabama , one of the states with the worst affected shorelines , was a little more ebullient : `` I think a lot of prayers were answered today . '' Like so often over the last 87 days , it was an agonising last few hours before the oil stopped flowing . On Wednesday night , a leak was discovered in part of the 75-tonne capping stack fixed on top of the broken well , forcing a delay in proceedings . Then yesterday morning engineers felt confident enough to begin shutting off the valves , the first at 10.30 am , the second at 12.30 pm and the last at the magical point of 2.25 pm . President Barack Obama , appearing on the White House lawn today for a brief press conference on the disaster , sounded a positive note . `` For almost 90 days of this environmental disaster , all of us have taken hope from the image of clean water instead of oil spewing into the Gulf . The new cap is good news , '' he said . But he also urged prudence , warning that this was not the time to `` get ahead of ourselves . `` One of the problems with having this camera down there is when the oil stops gushing everybody feels that we 're done , and we 're not . '' Retired coast guard admiral Thad Allen said results were short of ideal in the new cap , but the oil would stay shut in for another six hours at least . He saidthat pressure readings from the cap had not reached the level that would show there are no other leaks in the well . He said the test would go ahead for another six hours before being reassessed to see if BP needs to reopen the cap and let oil flow again . The main issue for the scientists wrestling to control the broken oil well is whether the new containment cap will cause other leaks under the sea floor that could be even more difficult to deal with . Pressure gauges on the cap give the best indication of that high pressures of between 6,000 lb and 8,000 lb per square inch would indicate that the well is holding together and the rate as of lunchtime today was 6,700 psi well within that range . Remote-controlled submarines are also scouring the sea floor with sonar to detect any signs of breaches . So far none have been found . The US government and BP now have to decide whether to keep the well shut off or reopen some of the valves to reduce the pressure . Obama pointed out that even in that case , the new cap would be far more effective at funnelling the oil to up to four vessels on the surface with a capacity of up to 80,000 barrels a day , well above the estimated upper limit of 60,000 barrels that has been spewing . `` Either we will be able to stop the flow , or to capture almost all the oil until the relief well is completed , '' he said . With that relief well now tantalisingly close to the bottom of the Macondo just five feet from the well , with another 30 feet to be drilled down to the final casing point all eyes will be on that last and potentially conclusive operation . Drilling has been suspended so as not to disturb work on the new containment cap , but is likely to resume in the next few days . The last procedure of pumping heavy mud and then concrete to plug the well could be weeks away . Around the Gulf , the reaction of some of the thousands of people hit by the catastrophe was a mixture of delight and scepticism . `` Five words I do n't want to hear : Houston we have a problem , '' said one commentator on the Alabama news site al.com . `` It 's freaking wonderful , '' a shrimper from Cut Off , Louisiana , told the Associated Press . But Stephon LaFrance , an oysterman who works in the marshes of southern Louisiana , insisted the news was a lie . `` I do n't believe they stopped that leak . BP 's trying to make itself look good . '' Amid the lighter mood , nobody was underestimating how much work still remains to be done . `` People down in the Gulf are still suffering as a result of this disaster , '' Obama said , repeating his now familiar mantra : `` BP is going to pay . '' Ken Feinberg , appointed by Obama to manage the $ 20bn -LRB- # 13bn -RRB- fund set up by BP to compensate individuals and businesses , said he would make the first payments in early August .

Photograph : Joe Raedle\\/Getty Images If you 've been reading Mother Jones lately , you 've heard about BP 's stranglehold on media access in the Gulf , which has included preventing reporters from visiting oil - soaked public beaches and barring its spill cleanup workers from talking to the press . Now , one of BP 's ex-media enforcers is speaking out . Former BP contractor Adam Dillon went public last Friday , telling a local news station in New Orleans that he was fed up with BP 's handling of the spill response , not least of all its information clampdown . In an interview with Mother Jones this week , Dillon , who claims he was fired for raising concerns about the cleanup with his bosses , elaborated on his experiences in the Gulf and vented his frustrations with BP . A retired Army special operations soldier who lives in Wilmington , N.C. -LRB- and is running for sheriff in his home county -RRB- , Dillon first worked management for BP on the beaches of Louisiana . In June , a camera crew caught him chasing reporters off a Grand Isle beach . Dillon was hired by O'Brian 's Response Management Group , which was in turn contracted by BP to hire an army of subcontractors to aid in various aspects of the the spill response , from cleanup workers to security guards to communications specialists . Based on his behind-the-scenes view of the spill response , he describes a cleanup effort in disarray , marred by unclear lines of authority and shoddy communications among the numerous players involved-from BP and its litany of contractors and subcontractors to the Coast Guard and local law enforcement agencies . `` There 's just so many moving parts and moving pieces , '' he says . `` The right hand is just not talking to the left . '' In BP 's attempts to control the flow of information , Dillon says , it has largely compounded these problems . '' The Climate DeskBut while Dillon says the company is bungling many aspects of the spill response , he notes that it has done a reasonably good job in one area : blocking the media from seeing the worst of the disaster in Grand Isle , a beach on a barrier island off Louisiana 's coast . `` There was all kinds of stuff they did n't want the media to see , '' he says , describing areas thick with oil that were off-limits to journalists . `` They kept it very strict what they wanted the media not to see , and what they wanted them to see . Where the media was actually given access to really was kind of mundane . '' While BP has insisted publicly that it has not prevented spill workers from talking to the press , Dillon says company officials made it perfectly clear to contractors that they would lose their jobs if they spoke to reporters . `` There are people down on that beach that are begging to talk to reporters , because they 're having pay issues , having problems , '' says Dillon of the workers in Grand Isle . `` Any of those laborers that are down there are being told behind closed doors that if they talk to the media , they 'll be fired . '' To enforce its media blockade , Dillon says , the company turned to its security force , largely made up of guys like him , ex-military and law enforcement personnel . `` They were given orders to herd the media away , '' he says , and they followed those instructions just like he did . `` They did n't know the reason behind it -- they were just told keep the media away from -LRB- the cleanup workers -RRB- . '' He adds , `` That 's a First Amendment violation ... You ca n't keep the media away . It 's a public beach . We were n't under Martial Law . '' After working on Grand Isle , Dillon was transferred to the Unified Command Center in Houma , La. , the hub of BP and federal response activities , to work on cleanup logistics . He claims he was fired last week `` because he was seen as a threat to superiors . '' -LRB- Stephanie Hebert , a spokeswoman at the Unified Command Center , confirms he was a contractor there but declined to comment on his dismissal . -RRB- Specifically , he says BP axed him after taking photos of what he described as `` equations on dispersants '' and calling these pictures to the attention of his bosses . He says he was `` confined and interrogated for almost an hour '' about what he saw , and within 12 hours was dismissed from the command center . Dillon declined to elaborate on the dispersant issue when we spoke , but pledged to avenge his termination by calling attention to BP 's mishandling of the response . `` They screwed up royally when they let me go , '' he says . `` I was down there to do the right thing , to clean up . They just do n't know who they 're messing with .

Photograph : Dave Martin When BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , said in May that the Gulf oil spill was a drop in the ocean '' tiny in relation to the total water volume '' , he was pilloried by Barack Obama and the US press , but he was technically correct . In the 85 days of the leak , the worst oil disaster in history , nearly 184m gallons of crude oil is estimated to have gushed into the Gulf of Mexico , the ninth largest body of water in the world . That is a lot , but no more than Americans burn every five hours and 10 minutes . Indeed , in the 24 hours since BP temporarily capped the Deepwater blowout , Americans have used over 840m gallons in their cars , planes , kitchens and factories which will have soiled the air , land and sea . The US can now look back on the Deepwater spill and count itself ecologically lucky , in many ways . It was not just a mile deep , allowing much of the oil to be diffused in the ocean , but it was 50 miles offshore in a warm sea . Many other oil spills have been far more injurious to wildlife and the marine and terrestrial environments , because oil breaks down much more slowly in cool seas . The 11m gallons spilt from the Exxon Valdez in the Alaskan waters in 1989 still threaten the whole ecosystem . That spill killed at least 36,000 sea birds . So far , Friends of the Earth US reported today , only 1,387 birds , 444 sea turtles , and 53 mammals have been found dead in the Gulf . Nonetheless , the damage yet to be revealed will be far worse than a few dead birds and tar balls along 500 miles of coast . Dolphins , whale sharks and sea turtles numbers will almost certainly have been hit hard , and some populations may not recover for years . Fish and shrimp-breeding habitats will have been hit . Deep coral reefs , which can take centuries to grow , may also have been affected . Furthermore , the ecological damage done in the last three months is made far more serious because it comes on top of years of man-made degradation of the Gulf environment . Many of the wetlands and estuaries that take the brunt of any oil spilt had already been seriously degraded by man 's interference with river flows . These could now disappear even faster if the oil has got into the roots of the grasses . The oil that gushed also added to natural oil and gas leaks into Gulf waters . These occur all the time from the sea bed , and the US Department of Energy estimates that there may be 5,000 active `` seeps '' in the northern Gulf alone . One researcher calculated in 2000 that 500,000 barrels of oil 84m gallons naturally gets into the Gulf each year , but is never cleaned up . The Gulf is also heavily polluted by nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilisers and livestock waste washed down the vast Mississippi river from farms and industry . Every year , a massive oxygen-starved region known as the `` dead zone '' develops off the coast of Louisiana in which nothing can live . Last month , the US government 's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- NOAA -RRB- said it expected this year 's `` zone '' to be between 6,500 and 7,800 square miles , the 10th largest ever . No one knows yet how the oil spill may affect it . Some marine scientists think the oil may make it larger , but others say it could help to limit its size a scenario that could , absurdly , see BP claiming to be clearing up pollution in the Gulf . Fish will have suffered , but paradoxically the US government 's decision to ban commercial fishing from 88,000 sq miles of the Gulf during the clean-up in order to safeguard human health could actually help regenerate depleted fish stocks . The Gulf is one of the most overfished seas in the world , with many species in serious decline and some fisheries near collapse . Closing off nearly a third of the waters is likely to have given many species a chance to increase numbers . The oil spill will have killed some fish , but vastly more are caught by industrial fishing operations every year . Stocks of fish such as red snapper and bluefin tuna , which spawn in the Gulf , could benefit greatly . One wild card yet to be played is a major hurricane tearing through the Gulf of Mexico , as is likely to happen before the end of the season in November . Rough seas will hamper efforts to finally seal the well and clean up the oil . The associated storm surges could also drive oil over barriers and further onto coastal land and into sensitive habitats . But the raging of a storm could also break up the oil slick , allowing the bacteria that break it down to act more rapidly .

That spill killed at least 36,000 sea birds . So far , Friends of the Earth US reports , only 1,387 birds , 444 sea turtles , and 53 mammals have been found dead in the Gulf . Nonetheless , the damage yet to be revealed will be far worse than a few dead birds and tar balls along 500 miles of coast . Dolphins , whale sharks and sea turtles will almost certainly have been devastated and some populations may not recover for years . Fish and shrimp breeding habitats will have been hit , as may deep coral reefs which can take centuries to grow . The ecological damage done in the last three months is made far more serious because it comes on top of years of man-made degradation . Many of the wetlands and estuaries which take the brunt of any oil spilt have already been seriously degraded by interference with river flows . These could disappear faster if the oil has got into the roots of the grasses . The oil that gushed from the Macondo well also added to natural leaks that occur all the time : the US department of energy estimates that there may be 5,000 active `` seeps '' in the northern Gulf alone . One researcher calculated in 2000 that 500,000 barrels of oil naturally get into the Gulf each year but are never cleaned up . The Gulf is also heavily polluted by nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilisers and livestock waste washed down the Mississippi . Every year an oxygen-starved region known as the `` dead zone '' develops off the coast of Louisiana . Last month , the US government 's national oceanic and atmospheric administration said it expected this year 's zone to be between 6,500 and 7,800 square miles , the 10th largest ever . No one knows yet how the oil spill may affect it . Some marine scientists think the oil may make it larger , but others say it could help to limit its size . Fish will have suffered but paradoxically the US government 's decision to ban commercial fishing from 88,000 sq miles of the Gulf nearly a third of the waters during the cleanup in order to safeguard human health could help regenerate depleted fish stocks . The Gulf is one of the most overfished seas in the world . The oil spill will have killed some fish , but vastly more are caught by industrial fishing every year . Stocks of fish like red snapper and bluefin tuna that spawn in the Gulf could benefit greatly . One wild card yet to be played is a hurricane tearing through the Gulf , as is all but certain to happen before the end of the season in November . Rough seas will hamper efforts to seal the well and clean up the oil . Storm surges could drive oil over barriers and further onto coastal land and sensitive habitats . But a storm could also break up the slick , allowing the bacteria that break it down to act more rapidly .

Photograph : Ann Heisenfelt\\/EPA BP ordered the owner of the Deepwater Horizon rig , whose explosion led to the worst environmental disaster in US history , to overhaul a crucial piece of the rig 's safety equipment in China , the Observer has learned . The blow-out preventer the last line of defense against an out-of-control well subsequently failed to activate and is at the center of investigations into what caused the disaster . Experts say that the practice of having such engineering work carried out in China , rather than the US , saves money and is common in the industry . This weekend BP remained cautiously optimistic that the cap placed on top of the Gulf of Mexico well on Thursday night would continue to hold back the torrent of oil . It is the first time the flow has been stopped since the accident happened almost three months ago . But BP said that the pressure readings from the Macondo well were not as high as it had hoped , which could indicate that it has ruptured and that oil could be leaking out somewhere else . There is no evidence that the significant modifications to the blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- , which were carried out in China in 2005 , caused the equipment to fail . But industry lawyers said BP could be made liable for any mistakes that a Chinese subcontractor made carrying out the work . It would be almost impossible to secure damages in China , where international law is barely recognized . It is understood that lawyers for Cameron International , the manufacturer of the BOP , will argue the device was so significantly modified in China that it no longer resembled the original component , and that Cameron should therefore not be held liable . Transocean , the owner of the Deepwater Horizon , which bought the BOP from Cameron , has already told congressional hearings into the disaster that the modifications were carried out at BP 's request and `` under its direction '' as the lessee of the rig . BP and Cameron declined to comment this weekend . Responding to the latest developments in the Gulf , President Obama said that it was too early to say if the well had been permanently fixed . `` We 're moving in that direction , but I do n't want us to get too far ahead of ourselves , '' he said . BP has been monitoring the pressure inside the well since Thursday . Thad Allen , the retired Coast Guard admiral overseeing the response effort , said that pressure of about 7,500 pounds per square inch would show the well was intact , while pressure that lingered below 6,000 psi would indicate it had been damaged and could be leaking . The pressure on Friday night remained at about 6,700 psi and was rising only fractionally . Allen has told BP to step up monitoring for any seabed breaches and gather additional seismological data to detect any pockets of oil in the layers of rock and sediment around the well . This week David Cameron will travel to the US to meet Obama and other politicians where he will stress the importance of BP to the UK economy . Business figures such as Lord Jones , the UK trade ambassador and former CBI boss , criticised Cameron for not being sufficiently supportive of the company last month after he said that he `` understood the US government 's frustrations '' over BP 's failed attempts to stop the leak . A government adviser said that Cameron and Obama shared common interests over the crisis , and that both wanted BP to survive the incident . BP accounts for over a tenth of all share dividends paid by UK companies , and pension funds rely on the income it generates . Politicians in the US want BP to make enough profits to pay potentially billions of dollars in compensation and damages arising from the spill .

Photograph : Dave Martin\\/AP When the history books come to be written about America 's worst environmental disaster , Sunday 18 July may be seen as the day the cry went up that the oil had permanently stopped spewing into the Gulf of Mexico . But things being the way they are , the announcement came in a cryptic statement from BP that was so shrouded in techno-garble and caveats that its huge significance was perilously close to being lost . `` Right now there is no target set to open the well back up to flow , '' said Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer , adding : `` We 're hopeful that if the encouraging signs continue that we 'll be able to continue the integrity test all the way to the point that we get the well killed . '' Given their importance , Suttles ' words deserve to be translated into English . Tests over the weekend on the new cap placed over the broken well suggested that it was working , there were no leaks , the flow had been stopped and wonder of wonders it might stay that way until the well is finally and conclusively plugged , probably next month . It is a sign of how cautious all concerned have become in the wake of numerous publicity gaffes that no one was prepared even to hint that the nightmare of oil billowing into the clean waters of the Gulf was over . `` We will take this day by day , '' Suttles said . As for the Obama administration , it said nothing at all . On Saturday its line , delivered through the government 's point man on the disaster , Admiral Thad Allen , had been that it was likely to order BP to open the new containment cap and begin pumping oil up to vessels on the surface as a way of reducing the risk of leakage from the well . But Allen was silent yesterday . And BP pointed out that reopening the cap would inevitably involve more oil spewing out . `` Clearly we do n't want to reanimate flow into the Gulf if we do n't have to , '' Suttles said . A federal official told the Associated Press there were concerns about a seepage and possible methane near the well , which could be signs that there are leaks . The official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , is familiar with the spill oversight but would not clarify what is seeping near the well . BP spokesman Mark Salt declined to comment on the allegation , but said : `` We continue to work very closely with all government scientists on this . '' There were no visible displays of elation in the most heavily affected coastline areas of Louisiana , but there was a new note of optimism . `` We see light at the end of the tunnel , '' said Billy Nungesser , who has been one of the most vocal leaders locally .

Photograph : Mario Tama\\/Getty Images The US government will allow BP to keep the cap on its damaged Gulf of Mexico well closed for another day , despite the detection of seepage and a possible methane gas leak in the seabed . The company promised to watch closely for signs of new leaks underground after a warning from Thad Allen , who is in charge of the US government 's response to the disaster . Allen said this morning BP had given government scientists the answers they needed about how it was monitoring the seabed around the mile-deep well , which has stopped gushing oil into the water since the experimental cap was closed on Thursday . US scientists grilled BP engineers last night after Allen wrote a letter to the BP managing director , Bob Dudley , asking for written details about how the valve would be opened if necessary . The letter said : `` When seeps are detected , you are directed to marshal resources , quickly investigate , and report findings to the government in no more than four hours . I direct you to provide me a written procedure for opening the choke valve as quickly as possible without damaging the well should hydrocarbon seepage near the well head be confirmed . '' The apparent setback caused shares in the oil company to fall more than 5 % , though by lunchtime losses had been pared to 2.5 % . The company has put the costs of dealing with the disaster at over $ 3.95 bn -LRB- # 2.6 bn -RRB- , and has already paid out $ 207m to 67,500 claimants who have lost money due to the spill . A BP spokesman said that if a seep is confirmed from the well , the cap will be lifted and oil flowed to the surface . In a characteristically technical statement it said : `` As directed by the National Incident Commander -LRB- Allen -RRB- , extensive monitoring activities are being carried out around the well site . Information gathered during the test is being reviewed with the government agencies to determine next steps . Depending upon the results of the test and monitoring activities , these steps may include extending the well integrity test or returning to containment options . '' Yesterday , officials said the cap was holding and continuing to prevent oil spewing into the gulf for the first time since the rig exploded in April , killing 11 workers . They expressed hope that it could stem the leak until relief wells were in place to permanently shut off the flow of oil but the discovery of seepage could mean there are still leaks in the damaged well . The plan had been for BP to pipe oil to the surface , which would ease pressure on the well but require up to three more days of oil spilling into the gulf . Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer , said yesterday : `` No one associated with this whole activity ... wants to see any more oil flow into the Gulf of Mexico . Right now we do n't have a target to return the well to flow . '' The new potential blow comes as David Cameron travels to Washington later today for his first full-length bilateral meeting with the US president , Barack Obama , at which they are expected to discuss the BP oil crisis . The spill is the worst in US history , causing economic and environmental disaster in five states along the Gulf coast and threatening to sour Anglo-American relations .

Photograph : Dave Martin\\/AP BP came under fresh attack last night amid accusations that it had ignored internal safety reports of a leak on the Deepwater Horizon rig and had not used industry best practice for avoiding oil spills . The news comes just as BP officials were hoping that their long nightmare was starting to be over as the new cap on the leaking oil well appeared to be holding firm and working well . There had been concerns that the cap might damage the stricken well and allow oil to burst out of the seabed . However , BP officials said there was no evidence of oil from the damaged well forcing its way through cracks in the seabed . `` We do not have any anomalies or evidence that we do not have integrity -LRB- of the well -RRB- , '' BP 's senior vice-president , Kent Wells , told reporters . But , while the capping of the well may be going well , developments onshore continued to prove what an enormous task BP faces in trying to repair its public image . In Louisiana an investigative hearing into the leak heard testimony from a BP official who said the firm had ignored warnings ahead of the disaster . Ronald Sepulvado , a BP well site leader , said he had reported a leak on a critical safety device at the rig to more senior company officials , but it seemed his warnings had not been passed on to the government regulating body , the Minerals Management Service . `` I assumed everything was OK , because I reported it to the team leader and he should have reported it to the MMS , '' he told the hearing . The leak was on a control pod connected to the blowout preventer on the rig , whose failure proved critical in causing the disaster . A congressional committee in Washington heard testimony from Gale Norton , interior secretary under former president George W Bush . Norton said BP had ignored rules put in place in 2003 . `` If regulations on the books and industry best practices had been followed properly , there might not have been a blowout , '' she said . `` It appears that BP violated all those regulations that were on the books . '' BP officials know that their best hopes lie in permanently sealing the well . A relief well being dug alongside is almost finished . `` The relief well is exactly where we want it , '' said Wells . The relief well is set to intercept the damaged well at the end of July . But before then BP will attempt to shoot drilling mud into the damaged blowout preventer , to seal the well from the top . A previous attempt using this method failed . Wells said that the company was seeking permission to make the effort , possibly this week . However , bad weather is building in the Caribbean and over the Atlantic , which could become a violent storm by the weekend , meteorologists said . A storm in the Gulf of Mexico could disrupt all efforts . `` We certainly are going to keep a very close eye on this system , '' said Dan Kottlowski , a hurricane expert at the website Accuweather . Finally plugging the well would go some way to ending the damage to BP 's reputation globally . But this respite is unlikely to come soon . Mother Jones , a leftwing magazine , reported an unlisted BP phone number for politicians in California to ring for tickets to sporting events and music concerts . The magazine said that BP had given away more than $ 300,000 -LRB- # 196,000 -RRB- worth of tickets in 10 years .

Photograph : Chip Somodevilla\\/Getty Images Concerns about oil and gas seepages around BP 's newly capped well in the Gulf of Mexico appear to have eased after the US government said they were not `` consequential '' . Thad Allen , the official appointed by Barack Obama to lead the government 's response to the disaster , said leaks detected over the weekend did not threaten the well . He said the seepage of gas from the seabed probably had nothing to do with the well . Oil and gas are known to ooze naturally from fissures in the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico . Speaking at a news conference last night , he said : `` The small seepages we 're seeing do not indicate at this point a threat to the well bore . '' Yesterday he gave BP another 24 hours to keep the containment cap on the ruptured well closed , during a terse exchange of words between the company and the government over the handling of the crisis . Today , Allen said BP could keep the cap closed for at least another 24 hours , provided the company remained on alert for leaks . Allen sent a stiff letter to BP on Sunday night ordering the oil giant to continue seismic and sonar monitoring around the well to try to get a better picture of what was happening now that the flow of oil had ostensibly stopped . He said the company had an obligation to inform him of any problems within four hours of any seepage being detected . `` I remain concerned that all potential options to eliminate the discharge of oil be pursued with utmost speed until I can be assured that no additional oil will spill from the Macondo well , '' he wrote . At the heart of the dispute is anxiety about what is happening under the seabed . The government fears oil may be leaking below the surface , and that if this process is left unchecked it could cause graver problems , including the collapse of the well . In a statement yesterday , Allen said he would ensure BP continued to assess whether keeping the cap closed could `` worsen the overall situation '' . BP , on the other hand , has pointed out forcefully that the antidote to seepage reopening the cap and allowing the oil to flow upwards again to specially designed oil-capture vessels would involve allowing oil to spew once more into the Gulf for at least another three days . That would undo the sense of progress achieved since last Thursday , when the cap was fully locked down and the oil flow stopped . The main way of tracking what is happening to the well its `` integrity '' , as it is known in the business is to gauge the pressure of the oil that is flowing up the pipe . BP said yesterday the level was about 6,800 lbs per square inch -LRB- psi -RRB- and increasing at around 2 psi per hour . The oil firm sees that as a positive figure , given that the quantity of oil in the reserve beneath the sea floor has already been depleted substantially , more than 4m barrels having spewed into the gulf . But the Obama administration thinks this is lower than it should be and would like to see the pressure rise to around 8,000 psi , which would show conclusively that there were no leaks . Until that figure is reached it will remain cautious , mindful of the political damage that has been caused to Obama 's presidency as a result of his early handling of the crisis , which was criticised for being soft on BP . Both sides agree that the disaster will not fully be over until the well has been permanently capped through the drilling of relief wells . BP said the first relief well had reached 5,450 metres , and the second 4,840 metres . The relief wells could join up with the original Macondo well as early as next week , at which point heavy mud and then concrete will be pumped down the original to block it forever . It also emerged today that Donald Vidrine , who was in charge of operations on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig at the time of its explosion , on 20 April , will not testify before a key hearing in the US . He cited health issues for his inability to attend a hearing in Louisiana held by the US department of the interior and the US coastguard , which began yesterday . It is the second time he has declined to give his account of events on the day of the disaster , after his failure to attend hearings in May .

BP successfully attaches a valve to the end of the broken drilling pipe at the Macondo well in a bid to end the flow of oil into the US Gulf . BP says one of the three leaks has been shut off by capping a valve , but that would not reduce the amount of oil gushing out . Officials conduct controlled burns to remove oil from the open water . BP confirms the arrival of three huge containment domes designed to collect much of the 5,000 bpd leaking into the US Gulf from the Macondo blowout . The department of justice asks Transocean to preserve evidence in connection with the explosion and sinking of the rig . Toxic pink oily seawater washes ashore on the Chandeleur Islands off the Louisiana coast , an important nesting and breeding area for many bird species . Hayward tells the BBC that the blowout preventer owned by Transocean was at fault for the leak . BP , he said , `` will be judged not on the basis of an accident that , you know , frankly was not our accident '' . Analysts put the cost of the spill for BP at # 15bn . BP engineers use undersea robots to move the containment chamber over the larger of the two remaining leaks on the seabed . This containment method has never before been attempted at such a depth . Efforts to close valves on a failed blowout preventer with underwater robots are abandoned . BP 's containment dome hits a snag when a buildup of crystallised gas forces engineers to postpone efforts to place the chamber over the oil leak and draw the oil to the surface . BP says it might try to plug the undersea leak by pumping materials such as shredded tyres and golf balls into the well at high pressure , a method called a `` junk shot '' . BP announces plans to place a small containment dome , known as a `` top hat '' , over the blown-out well to funnel oil to the surface , as Hayward holds a press conference . At a hearing before the Senate committee on energy and natural resources , representatives of the three oil companies involved in the Deepwater drilling blame each other for the accident . Halliburton , which cemented BP 's well , claims to have met BP 's stated requirements for the task and cites the failure of Transocean 's blowout preventer . Transocean 's CEO says the blowout preventer was successfully tested a week before the accident ; he also blames BP and Halliburton for the inadequate cementing believed to have led to the explosion . BP 's president says that Transocean , as owner\\/operator of the drilling rig , is responsible for safety . After the failure of the four-storey-high dome to draw oil from the major leak , BP lowers a five-foot-high dome to attempt to cover the smaller leak . The congressional hearing is told BP , Halliburton and Transocean ignored safety warnings in the hours before the Deepwater explosion . Steve Wereley , a researcher at Purdue University , tells the press he believes the well is leaking 70,000 bpd . BP releases underwater footage of the effort to stem the leak . BP plans to insert a 4in-tube into the ruptured 21in riser pipe that would take the oil to the surface . If that fails , they will use the small containment dome that has already been lowered . Both methods are intended to reduce , not to stop , the leak . The tube begins to draw oil to the surface . The volume of oil traveling through the tube is gradually increased to avoid the hydrate formation that doomed the large containment dome . Obama plans to establish an independent commission to investigate the oil leak , according to an anonymous administration official . As the spill continues to spread , the no fishing zone is doubled to 19 % of the Gulf waters . BP reports that the amount of oil drawn off by the tube has increased to 5,000 bpd . Given that BP had previously estimated the entire leak at 5,000 bpd and the tube only draws off a fraction of the spill , the leak must be much larger than previously estimated . Experts testifying at the congressional hearing put the figure at 20,000-100 ,000 barrels per day . The tube inserted into the leaking pipe captures much less oil than expected . BP pumps thousands of barrels of mud into the well in an attempt to plug the leak . The process , known as top kill , fails to overcome the flow of oil .

Photograph : Pete Souza\\/AP Attempts to permanently solve the problem of the Macondo oil well that has spewed more than 4m barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico have had to be pushed back as bad weather threatens to force the fleet of ships assembled around the stricken well to evacuate the area . A tropical depression that formed over the Bahamas was moving in the direction of the well located off Louisiana 's coast , with warnings that it could turn into a tropical storm along the west coast of Florida . The route followed by the depression is unpredictable , with weather forecasters citing a 50 % chance that it reaches the Macondo well within the next two days . The fleet of 65 ships involved in the disaster response were preparing to quit the area and head for port , though an evacuation had not yet been ordered . They include vessels being used in the monitoring of the well . But the threat of bad weather has already delayed efforts to plug the well at its source deep beneath the sea bed . Engineers were obliged to suspend work on the first of two relief wells that are being drilled down to the source , setting back the final procedure to plug it .

Photograph : Gerald Herbert\\/AP Vital warning systems on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig were switched off at the time of the explosion in order to spare workers being woken by false alarms , a federal investigation has heard . The revelation that alarm systems on the rig at the center of the disaster were disabled and that key safety mechanisms had also consciously been switched off came in testimony by a chief technician working for Transocean , the drilling company that owned the rig . Mike Williams , who was in charge of maintaining the rig 's electronic systems , was giving evidence to the federal panel in New Orleans that is investigating the cause of the disaster on 20 April , which killed 11 people . Williams told the hearing today that no alarms went off on the day of the explosion because they had been `` inhibited '' . Sensors monitoring conditions on the rig and in the Macondo oil well beneath it were still working , but the computer had been instructed not to trigger any alarms in case of adverse readings . Both visual and sound alarms should have gone off in the case of sensors detecting fire or dangerous levels of combustible or toxic gases . The evidence of deliberate dilution of the rig 's safety mechanisms is likely to have wide ramifications for BP and Transocean , the world 's largest offshore drilling company . It switches the spotlight of blame away from BP and towards the subcontractor which took the decisions . Of the 126 crew on board the rig on 20 April , seven worked for BP and 79 for Transocean . Williams said he discovered that the physical alarm system had been disabled a full year before the disaster . When he asked why , he said he was told that the view from even the most senior Transocean official on the rig had been that `` they did not want people woken up at three o'clock in the morning due to false alarms '' . Williams ' testimony will raise questions about whether lives could have been saved had the alarms been properly set and the disaster mitigated . He also revealed that a crucial safety device , designed to shut down the drill shack in the case of dangerous gas levels being detected , had been disabled , or bypassed as it is called . When he saw that the system had been bypassed , Williams protested to a Transocean supervisor , Mark Hay , who dismissed his concerns . Hay responded : `` Damn thing been in bypass for five years . Matter of fact , the entire -LRB- Transocean -RRB- fleet runs them in bypass . '' In a third significant disclosure , Williams also revealed that a computer system used to monitor the drill shack was constantly freezing up , and on one occasion even produced wrong information . The system failed to indicate that a vital valve inside the blowout preventer , the device designed to shut down the well in case of problems , had been damaged . Pressure is now likely to mount on Transocean to explain the discrepancies . The New York Times reported earlier this week that a survey of workers carried out by Transocean shortly before the blast suggested key safety practices had not been followed . Workers said that , while they were aware of unsafe practices on the rig , they were afraid to report mistakes for fear of reprisals . A BP spokesman said last night : `` The investigations continue to demonstrate that a range of things went wrong and that responsibility lies with a whole load of different companies .

The firm has been accused of muzzling the academics it is hiring Photograph : Alex Ogle\\/AFP\\/Getty Images BP has rejected accusations of muzzling the scientists and academics it has hired to help fight hundreds of lawsuits relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . The American Association of University Professors claims the oil giant is seeking to `` buy the silence '' of the scientific community in its fight against litigation . But BP says it is only protecting confidential information and is not trying to prevent the discussion of scientific data . A copy of the contract issued by BP to scientists , obtained by the BBC , says they can not publish the research they conduct for BP or speak about the data for at least three years , or until the government gives the final approval to the company 's restoration plan for the gulf . It also states that scientists may perform research for other agencies only so long as it does not conflict with the work they are doing for BP , and that they must take instructions from lawyers offering the contracts and other in-house counsel at the oil company . Cary Nelson , president of the American Association of University Professors , criticised the contract . He told the BBC : `` This is really one huge corporation trying to buy faculty silence in a comprehensive way . '' Bob Shipp , head of marine sciences at the University of South Alabama and one of the scientists approached by BP 's lawyers , said the company wanted to hire his whole department . `` They contacted me and said we would like to have your department interact to develop the best restoration plan possible after this oil spill , '' he said . `` We laid the ground rules that any research we did , we would have to take total control of the data , transparency and the freedom to make those data available to other scientists and subject to peer review . They left and we never heard back from them . '' BP said that it had hired a number of experts to help with the lawsuits , as well as a number of national and local scientists with expertise in the resources of the gulf of Mexico to help in restoration work . `` These scientists are helping us collect and understand data about the impacts of the oil spill on the natural resources and to plan for restoration of those resources , '' BP said . `` As is customary , we have asked these experts -LRB- more than a dozen -RRB- to treat information from BP counsel as confidential . However , BP does not take the position that environmental data are confidential . `` Moreover , BP does not place restrictions on academics speaking about scientific data . '' Seven federal judges next week will meet attorneys in Boise , Idaho , to try and decide whether or how to consolidate more than 200 federal civil lawsuits filed by a range of claimants , from fishermen to injured rig workers , oil-rig owner Transocean and other contractors tied to the spill . The judges will consider two key questions : where the cases will be heard and who will preside over them . The lawsuits range from civil racketeering and personal-injury suits to claims from out-of-work shrimpers and owners of now-vacant hotels on the gulf shore . The cost of the spill to BP has already exceeded $ 3.1 bn -LRB- # 2bn -RRB- , and the company has pledged some of its assets as security to the US government while it builds up a promised $ 20bn compensation fund . Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate the final bill for the disaster caused by the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig , which killed 11 workers , could run to $ 70bn .

Photograph : Gerald Herbert\\/AP The testimony of Michael Williams , an electronics technician , that emergency alarms on board the Deepwater Horizon were disabled weeks before it exploded , killing 11 workers and spewing more than 4m barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , is the most damning evidence yet of shoddy maintenance and compromised safety systems on board the oil rig . Hearings conducted by a federal panel of investigators from the US Coast Guard and the department of the interior have already uncovered several incidents of apparent safety irregularities that leave both BP , the oil giant that was working the Macondo well , and Transocean , the owner of the oil rig that was operating under contract to BP , with big questions to answer . Williams , a former Marine , managed to survive the explosion on 20 April by jumping from the burning rig . His evidence before the federal panel in Kenner , on the outskirts of New Orleans , suggested a litany of problems , from alarm systems that had been switched off to software that was so faulty the rig 's computer systems critical for the monitoring of key safety equipment regularly crashed . This week , the panel heard from Ronald Sepulvado , a BP manager who had been on board the rig until five days before the blast . He told investigators that three months before the disaster he had been warned by Halliburton , which was acting as a contractor on the well , that the rig 's blowout preventer could be faulty . Gas could be leaking out of the device , Halliburton reported , which would suggest that it was not fulfilling its role as the last line of defense against a possible blowout of oil or gas . Sepulvado said he informed his bosses at BP 's Houston headquarters , but they in turn appear not to have passed on the information , as they were obliged , to federal authorities . While BP is in the line of fire for failing to act on such apparently crucial warnings , Transocean , the Swiss-based company that owns a fleet of offshore oil rigs , also has to answer for serious anomalies . A report compiled at Transocean 's request by Lloyd 's Register Group shortly before the catastrophe found that crucial elements of the blowout preventer , including safety valves , had not been properly inspected for 10 years in violation of guidelines that the device is fully inspected every three to five years . The report , obtained by the New York Times , also listed 26 parts of the rig that were in `` bad '' or `` poor '' condition . Workers quoted in the Lloyd 's survey said that they were under the impression that Transocean considered keeping the drilling going a higher priority than maintaining the rig . So far in the three-month crisis , most attention has been placed on how BP has conducted itself before and after the explosion . Relatively little focus has been given to Transocean , which has been trying to limit its liabilities in the Gulf disaster by invoking an 1851 piece of legislation that sets a ceiling of $ 27m . On the other hand , the Obama administration has made clear that it is looking into the affairs of a number of companies , including BP and Transocean , as it considers whether to press criminal charges in the wake of the catastrophe , the worst environmental disaster in US history . In the long run , the federal authorities will have to consider whether a culture of compromised safety and corner cutting has spread across the business of offshore oil drilling . The Washington Post has scoured federal records and found that in numerous cases the operators of oil rigs have bypassed safety systems in order to press ahead with drilling . In similar terms , the energy and commerce committee of the US Congress has accused BP of scrimping on safety measures in order to meet tight drilling schedules . The committee 's chairman , Henry Waxman , said last month that `` time after time , it appears BP made decisions that increased the risk of a blowout to save the company time or expense '' .

The oil company that commissioned the fateful Macondo well , BP , has so far taken all the flak for the blowout which killed 11 men and triggered an environmental disaster . But that may be about to change . Transocean , which has had an easy ride so far , could find itself in the line of fire as a range of official investigations into what went wrong that fateful early morning of 20 April continue to unearth evidence of widespread mistakes and failures . The singling out of BP for criticism over the last eight weeks has led some to conclude this side of the ocean at least that the oil company was a convenient target . It was after all a foreign-controlled entity and had very deep pockets when it came to being asked to set aside $ 20bn -LRB- # 13bn -RRB- for potential claims before blame had even been formally apportioned . The fact remains that the American drilling company , Transocean , with its first quarter profits of $ 677m , is a relatively small target for any ambulance-chasing lawyers who know that BP made almost 10 times that amount . Tony Hayward , the chief executive of BP , did not help his own cause with a number of ill-judged remarks . Early on he appeared to clumsily lay the blame for the disaster entirely on Transocean : `` This was not our accident . This was not our drilling rig . This was not our equipment . It was not our people , our systems or our processes . This was Transocean 's rig . Their equipment , '' he said . The verbal hailstones that followed this attempt to pass the buck left BP reluctant to make any other effort to suggest others were to blame , although it did talk about a `` complex accident '' and `` multiples causes '' being at the heart of the accident . Last night BP said it had always believed that a lot of different things went wrong . BP might well have reminded everyone who their partners were on Macondo because the names of Mitsui of Japan and Anadarko Petroleum of America are little known in this unfortunate saga . Both made appearances in front of a Senate sub-committee earlier this week , where Anadarko executives seemed happy to keep all the blame on the main operator BP . But BP will start to fight its own corner more vocally next Tuesday when Hayward reveals first half financial results , talks about future corporate strategy and argues BP should not be the sole focus of blame .

If the company is found to have been grossly negligent , its insurance will be void . Photograph : Sean Gardner\\/Reuters BP will this week reveal that it has cleared itself of gross negligence after an internal inquiry into the causes of the Deepwater Horizon explosion . The company believes evidence will emerge of the role that other oil companies and contractors on the project had in causing the worst environmental disaster in US history . But this is unlikely to satisfy its critics . During congressional hearings in the US , politicians have laid the blame for the disaster squarely on BP , accusing it of ignoring standard oil industry safety practices to save money . Pressure is also mounting on the company to clarify the position of chief executive Tony Hayward at its half-year results meeting on Tuesday . There is growing speculation that , alongside the figures , BP could announce Hayward 's departure , although he could stay on until a relief well is in place in the gulf . A board meeting is scheduled for tomorrow , but a BP spokesman refused to comment on whether the succession issue was on the agenda or whether there would be an announcement about Hayward at Tuesday 's results . The company will publish the full findings of the inquiry into the causes of the gulf oil spill when it is completed next month . BP accepts that it will have to shoulder some blame for the accident . But it is understood that the company has found no evidence of gross negligence and does not expect any to come to light in the future . It will robustly defend itself against such claims . If investigators rule that BP is guilty of gross negligence , the firm would face a far heftier bill : under the US 's Clean Water Act , BP currently faces fines of $ 1,100 -LRB- # 715 -RRB- for each barrel of oil spilt , but a such a ruling could see the figure rise to $ 4,300 . If BP were the sole party to be found grossly negligent , it would also be liable for the entire clean-up and compensation bill . BP owns 65 % of the Macondo well on which the Deepwater Horizon was operating , with 25 % held by Texas-based Anadarko and the remainder by the Japanese company Mitsui . Anadarko has so far refused to pay any costs , while Mitsui has not made its position clear . BP will continue to pay for the clean-up which now totals $ 4bn and bill its partners for their share . A US oil lawyer said most indemnity agreements and insurance would protect BP against claims even it was found guilty of ordinary negligence , but would be void in a case of gross negligence . Such a finding would have `` far-reaching consequences '' for BP and its partners ' and contractors ' liabilities , he said . BP will also give the City guidance on the likely costs from the disaster this week . Analysts at Barclays Capital believe the provisions could exceed $ 25bn . Stripping out the costs relating to the disaster , BNP Paribas forecasts BP 's net income for the second quarter at just under $ 5bn , up by 68 % compared with the previous year the biggest rise of all its European oil industry peers . Hayward will also indicate which assets are core , and which peripheral , for the company in the future . BP is looking to sell more assets to shore up its balance sheet . It will continue to focus on its three core areas : deepwater oil and gas , `` unconventional gas '' -LRB- for example , from shale or coalbeds -RRB- and using new technologies to squeeze more oil and gas from major mature fields . Next month BP is expected to finish handing over responsibility for compensation claims to Kenneth Feinberg , who has been appointed by the White House to administer a $ 20bn fund paid for by the company . BP does not expect to have to pay out the full $ 20bn . Damages arising from other legal action , and from the completion of formal investigations into the accident , are likely to be more costly .

Photograph : Alex Ogle\\/AFP\\/Getty Images Ships were getting back in place today at the Gulf of Mexico site of BP 's leaky oil well as crews raced to resume work on plugging the gusher before another big storm stops work again . Now that tropical storm Bonnie has fizzled out on Louisiana 's coast , engineers are hoping clear weather lasts long enough for them to finish their work on relief wells . But as peak hurricane season approaches , the potential for another storm-related delay is high . `` We 're going to be playing a cat-and-mouse game for the remainder of the hurricane season , '' retired coast guard admiral Thad Allen , the federal government 's spill response chief , said as another disturbance already was brewing in the Caribbean , although forecasters said it was n't likely to strengthen into a tropical storm . Meanwhile , BP is planning to announce that its chief executive Tony Hayward is negotiating the terms of his departure ahead of the company 's half-year results announcement on Tuesday . A formal announcement is expected in the next 24 hours . Hayward , who angered Americans by minimizing the spill 's environmental impact and expressing his exasperation by saying `` I 'd like my life back , '' has been under heavy criticism over his gaffe-prone leadership during the spill . Back on the Gulf , a rig drilling the relief tunnel that will pump in mud and cement to seal the well returned to the spill site after evacuating the area . Crews corked the relief tunnel on Wednesday and the temporary halt pushed back efforts to solidly seal the well by at least a week , Allen said . Completion now looks possible by mid-August , but Allen said he would n't hesitate to order another evacuation based on forecasts similar to the ones for Bonnie . `` We have no choice but to start well ahead of time if we think the storm track is going to bring gale force winds , which are 39mph or above , anywhere close to well site , '' Allen said . In the past 10 years , an average of five named storms have hit the Gulf each hurricane season . This year , two have struck already Bonnie and Hurricane Alex at the end of June , which delayed cleanup of BP 's massive oil spill for a week even though it did n't get closer than 500 miles from the well . `` Usually you do n't see the first hurricane statistically until 10 August , '' said Dennis Feltgen , a spokesman for the National Hurricane Centre in Miami . `` The 2010 hurricane season is running just ahead of a typical pace . '' Hurricane season in the region ends on 30 November . Even though the evacuation turned out to be short-lived , it revealed one important fact : BP and the federal government are increasingly sure that the temporary plug that has mostly contained the oil for eight days will hold . They did n't loosen the cap even when they thought they 'd lose sight of it during the evacuation , although in the end , at least some of the real-time cameras trained on the ruptured well apparently kept rolling . Ironically , Bonnie may even have a positive effect . Churning waters could actually help dissipate oil in the water , spreading out the surface slick and breaking up tar balls , said Jane Lubchenco , leader of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . Beaches may look cleaner in some areas as the storm surge pulls oil away , though other areas could see more oil washed ashore . `` I think the bottom line is , it 's better than it might have been , '' Lubchenco said . At the site of the relief well , workers who spent Thursday and Friday pulling nearly a mile of segmented steel pipe out of the water and stacking the sections on deck will now have to reverse the process . It is not likely the BP will be able to resume drilling until tomorrow . By Wednesday , workers should finish installing steel casing to fortify the relief shaft , Allen said , and by Friday , crews plan to start blasting in heavy mud and cement through the mechanical cap , the first phase of a two-step process to seal the well for good . BP will then finish drilling the relief tunnel which could take up to a week to pump in more mud and cement from nearly two miles under the sea floor . Meanwhile , people in the oil-affected hamlet of Grand Isle , Louisiana , spent a gray Saturday at the beach , listening to music . The Island Aid concert , which included LeAnn Rimes and Three Dog Night , raised money for civic projects on the island . For the afternoon at least , things were almost back to normal . Young women in bathing suits rode around on golf carts while young men in pickup trucks tooted their horns and shouted . `` This is the way Grand Isle is supposed to be but has n't been this year , '' said Anne Leblanc of Metairie , Louisiana , who said her family has been visiting the island for years . `` This is the first we came this year . With the oil spill there has n't been a reason to come , no swimming , no fishing .

Taxpayers in the US and UK will now have to bear some of the clean-up costs from the spill Photograph : Reuters BP is poised for fresh controversy after it emerged today that the UK Treasury will lose hundreds of millions of pounds as a result of the oil clean-up in the Gulf of Mexico . The cost of the clean-up has pushed BP into the red , meaning the oil company will be able to book a near - $ 10bn -LRB- # 6.5 bn -RRB- tax credit , slashing its tax bill in the US and Britain . The loss comes on top of a plunge in tax revenues after BP halted its dividend payouts to shareholders . The news will dismay politicians in Westminster , since the coalition government needs all the tax revenues it can get as it introduces austerity measures to deal with the deficit . The majority of the tax credit is likely to relate to the US , but the exchequer is also likely to lose out badly . BP paid $ 8.4 bn of corporate taxes last year , with roughly # 930m going to the UK government . Tax experts reckon it paid a similar amount in US taxes . While the spill will reduce the level of BP 's corporate taxes , the news comes on top of the hundreds of millions lost to the exchequer in the form of lost dividend taxation . Under fierce political pressure from Washington , BP scrapped its lucrative payouts to shareholders this year and there is currently no plan to reinstate payments . BP announced today that it is making a $ 32.2 bn provision for the cost of the spill caused by the explosion and subsequent sinking of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in April . That pushed BP 's second-quarter results into a record loss of $ 17bn , compared with a profit last year of $ 3.1 bn . The company explained , however , that the net impact on BP 's bottom line will only be $ 22bn because the company will be able to record a $ 9.9 bn tax credit . BP 's UK tax bill will also be reduced , the firm added . Both the US and UK governments receive hundreds of millions of dollars from the company in tax payments each year . News that BP will be able to write off against tax the cost of plugging the well , cleaning up the spill and compensating the thousands of people who have been affected is likely to anger politicians of all political hues . Only the fines that might be imposed by the US authorities would definitely not be tax-deductible , according to tax experts . Three years ago , aircraft manufacturer Boeing flew into a storm of protest when it sought to write off against tax a $ 615m fine levied by the department of justice that settled an investigation into the improper hiring of a Pentagon official and the theft of data from Lockheed Martin Corporation . The fine was levied in order for Boeing to avoid criminal charges . Three Republican senators wrote to the US attorney general at the time to say that allowing Boeing to deduct payments to the government `` would be unacceptable '' .

We have now capped the oil flow and we are doing everything within our power to clean up the spill and to make restitution to everyone with legitimate claims . `` I would like to thank all of the BP people involved in the response and the many thousands of others along the Gulf Coast who have joined us in our efforts . `` I believe the decision I have reached with the board to step down is consistent with the responsibility BP has shown throughout these terrible events . BP will be a changed company as a result of Macondo and it is right that it should embark on its next phase under new leadership . `` I will be working closely with Bob Dudley over the coming months to ensure a smooth transition . It has been a privilege to serve BP for nearly 30 years and to lead it for the last three .

Their equipment , '' he said . On 25 May however , BP revealed details of its internal inquiry into the spill and admitted `` a number of companies are involved , including BP , and it is simply too early and not up to us to say who is at fault '' . Hayward makes his first , and probably most ill-judged considering subsequent events , gaffe when he tells the Guardian that `` the Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean . The amount of volume of oil and dispersant we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume '' . He goes on to admit that his job may be on the line . Asked if he felt his job was already under threat , he replied : `` I do n't at the moment . That of course may change . I will be judged by the nature of the response . '' In an interview with Sky News , Hayward says that the environmental impact of the spill will be `` very , very modest '' . `` It is impossible to say and we will mount , as part of the aftermath , a very detailed environmental assessment but everything we can see at the moment suggests that the overall environmental impact will be very , very modest . '' Probably Hayward 's biggest gaffe comes before a mass of reporters on the Louisiana shore when he says : `` The first thing to say is I 'm sorry . We 're sorry for the massive disruption it 's caused their lives . There 's no one who wants this over more than I do . I would like my life back . '' The families of the 11 people who died when the Deepwater Horizon exploded point out that they would like some lives back too . BP decides to go on the offensive and spends $ 50m -LRB- # 32m -RRB- on a national TV advertising campaign in which Hayward pledges : `` For those affected and your families , I 'm deeply sorry . We will make this right . '' At the same time the Financial Times publishes an interview with Hayward in which he admits BP was unprepared for an oil spill at such depths : `` We did not have the tools you would want in your toolkit . '' In an interview on US television Barack Obama says that if Tony Hayward had been working for him , the BP figurehead would have been relieved of his duties by now . The president says he is talking to a range of experts in an attempt to discover `` whose ass to kick '' . Svanberg , a native Swedish speaker who was formerly the head of the telecoms company Ericsson . `` I hear comments sometimes that large oil companies are greedy companies or do n't care but that 's not the case with BP . We care about the small people . '' Douglas Brinkley , a Gulf coast historian at Rice University , described it as another example of BP 's insensitivity : `` It 's snotty and deeply condescending and it shows the kind of corporate arrogance that BP has been exuding ever since the Deepwater Horizon accident . '' Hayward endures a seven-hour grilling by Congress but is attacked afterwards for his refusal to answer many of the questions levied by the House of Representatives ' energy and commerce committee . Hayward spends a relaxing Saturday on board his yacht `` Bob '' taking part in the JP Morgan Asset Management round the island race on the Isle of Wight . Pictures of the BP boss enjoying himself on the obviously oil-free waters of the Solent are described by White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel in an interview with ABC News as `` just been part of a long line of PR gaffes and mistakes '' . `` I think we can all conclude that Tony Hayward is not going to have a second career in PR consulting .

And things can only get worse ` The spill is slathering four states now . It could be blown over to Texas . It could show up in the marinas of Key West ... Law suits are spill ing out with no judicial blowout preventer to slow them down . ' Photograph : Stuart Franklin\\/Magnum Photos Those who live in Louisiana all their lives develop an understanding of disaster . We know a hurricane can turn over hundreds of offshore oil rigs in one pass and then come to land and do the same to our homes . Refineries explode , rigs blow up , pipelines burst , well pressures cause accidents that take fingers , feet , arms , legs and life itself . There 's hardly a family in the Gulf region that does not have a member involved in the oil industry . My father was a tugboat captain who handled barges of crude oil for the sprawling refineries , my brother sells oilfield equipment and technology , my nephew captains offshore supply vessels , my great-nephew operates a giant crane currently picking Katrina-smashed equipment from the Gulf floor . Cousins manage oil leases . So , even though I am not an oil worker , the industry is part of my environment , my history , and when I saw images of the April Deepwater Horizon explosion and fire , I thought at once , `` Wait a minute . That rig is state-of-the-art , the size of a small factory , loaded with technology that rivals the space program in complexity . Why is the fire so enormous ? '' And later , when the labyrinth of pipes and valves keeled over in a rumbling , hissing nimbus of flame , I was astounded , thinking , `` Why did n't the blowout preventer shut down the well ? '' And days later , when it was revealed that the device was not functioning , a dark spill began to spread in my soul , a burgeoning realisation that nothing could stop a runaway well 5,000 ft below the Gulf 's surface . A wide open fire hydrant blasting a plume of water out of a four-inch opening operates on a pressure of 50 pounds per square inch . The oil and gas venting from the rig 's seven-inch pipe is propelled by at least 3,000 psi . And if the pipe beneath the blowout preventer fails ? The reservoir pressures , I understand , are 11,000 psi . Unchecked , the subterranean caverns of oil would roar to the surface for years . BP has made a number of attempts to stop the fountain of oil and all have failed , except for the latest cap . But even this success poses many dangers , including a well rupture far below the ocean floor , initiated by the high pressure caused by the cap . No one knows what the result of such a failure would be , and this highlights the most frightening facet of the catastrophe : its unpredictability . The final solution is supposed to be the relief wells BP is drilling , and on the day I realized even these might not arrest the blowout , I decided to stop thinking about it all . I drove into my south-east Louisiana town of Hammond to get something good to eat . At a seafood cafe I ordered Oysters Scampi . The TV was on above the bar , showing miles-long strands of red oil streaming across the face of the Gulf . I thought of the men killed in the explosion , how they spent their lives trying to avoid something like this . My oysters were large and plump ; I ate the first fellow , then looked up at the oil . Locally , it 's well known that 60 % of the US 's oysters come from Louisiana 's coastal regions . The oyster beds would be killed by the oil and take years to regenerate . Longer , if the oil kept coming next year . The spill inside me widened as I realized that the shrimp fisheries would soon be closed , the commercial taking of red snapper , grouper and all their delectable cousins banned . I remembered that Louisiana supplies 73 % of the nation 's shrimp . My God , what about the charter boat industry and sport fishermen from Texas to Florida ? The nightly news told of oil coming ashore . Unlike its neighbor states , Louisiana has no shore , no sand beach except for a small spit called Grand Isle , no dunes , hills , cliffs . The entire Gulf border and its wide attendant marshes are exactly at sea level . The shore is mostly gritty mud held in place by tall , dense marsh grass . What is not water is grass , thousands of square miles of it . When the oil kills the grass , the shore will begin to melt away . This coastal marsh is home to millions of birds pelicans , terns , egrets , great herons and a rich variety of mammals and reptiles . It is threaded through by countless miles of narrow bayous , inlets and lagoons , all spawning areas for shrimp and succulent blue-claw crabs , nesting grounds for vast flocks of migratory geese and ducks a hot and humid greenhouse teeming with life . Louisiana is a relatively small state , but it contains 40-45 % of the nation 's coastal wetlands . The neighbor states of Texas , Alabama , Mississippi and Florida have similar fertile and productive marshes , though such areas are much smaller . The oil that began to show up , the so-called tar balls , were really reddish pancakes of axle grease ; they began to appear on Grand Isle , then east , on the Alabama beaches , followed by a nasty invasion of the lovely green water and white sand shores of Pensacola and Santa Rosa Island . Heavy dark oil began to pool against the Louisiana marshes , coating wildlife with a greasy , glue-like batter no one can ever know how many thousands of animals have died , how many carcasses are at the bottom of the quarter million square miles of the Gulf . Next , every fisherman 's greatest fear happened . The government had to close over 80,000 square miles of the Gulf to all fishing , and suddenly tens of thousands of fishermen were out of work , losing their identity and a way of life they and their ancestors have pursued for generations . The Cajuns have fished since they arrived in the 1700s ; the Vietnamese , Croatians , African Americans , Native Americans , Islenos and plain American country boys who trawl and fish and process are all on the bank watching their livelihoods drown in oil . Who will ever know ? As of now , a safe final estimate , if the cap holds and the relief wells work , is 200m gallons . The oil washing up in July might have leaked in April . Locals are losing sleep about how much oil is looming underwater to bedevil us next year or for 10 years . Calls to counselling and crisis lines are through the roof . Fourteen million people depend on fishing and oilfield work for a living in the Gulf region . The fishermen ca n't pay rents and mortgages , utility bills , insurance , buy fuel for their boats , save for any kind of future ; they stand in charity food lines on 100-degree days . The oilfield people are facing cutbacks because of the new ban on deepwater drilling ; this is affecting shipbuilding , crewboat , supply and helicopter fleets , machine shops , pipe yards , supply houses , foundries and a hundred other businesses . The fishermen are hurting acutely at the moment , but the oil workers are worried for their futures as well , as the industry is facing a wind-down that could last for years . The news keeps getting more uncertain and , yes , things can get worse because hurricane season is now upon us and no one knows what havoc a big storm in the Gulf could cause . It could do anything from pushing a bow wave of killing oil over the estuaries to painting New Orleans with black rain . I do n't think people living outside the region understand what is happening . One so-called environmentalist suggested Gulf fishermen and oil workers should just get educated in green technology and work in solar panel factories . What are they supposed to do for 20 years until the technology is perfected and the factories built ? Fishermen want to work as fishermen ; the Gulf is 1,000 miles wide and they are independent members of a huge culture , not employees . By the end of June I tried to limit my news intake . It was now clear the enormous Gulf tourism industry was on shaky ground because all the beaches from Panama City , Florida to Grand Isle , Louisiana were fouled or soon to be fouled , and the result was a freefall in hotel , condo and restaurant bookings , and trade in the thousands of gift shops , filling stations , convenience stores , bait-and-tackle shops Each type of business was firing workers , cutting orders , falling into debt . After a charter boat captain shot himself in the head , I turned off the television . But everywhere I went , neighbors , bank tellers , waitresses , university professors all fretted about the spill . Last year , one billion pounds of fish was harvested from the Gulf ; now only a tiny fraction of that is being caught in the small areas still open , and chances are even that clean catch will be distrusted by buyers outside the region . How many years will it take for Gulf seafood 's reputation for quality to return ? This disaster rides like a tumor on the back of the monster Katrina , a storm that in 2005 killed more than 1,800 people in the New Orleans area . Many residents of the region were finally getting their homes rebuilt , their boats and docks restored . It is true a few hundred men have been hired by BP at low wages to shovel muck off the shores . Several motels have been rented to house workers and BP has been leaking out cheques to fishing families and charter boat operators -LRB- though there are tales of cheques never arriving -RRB- . Hundreds of boats have been hired to go after the oil , but not a man in a thousand miles is glad about any of it . Everyone has a sense of why the accident happened . Weeks before the explosion , it seems BP knew the blowout preventer was leaking and missing a crucial seal . About 10 hours before 11 men were burned up , employees report an argument broke out between the rig 's BP manager , who wanted a speedy and cheap sealing of the well , and the driller and cementer , who demanded traditional , safe plugging methods . The company man overruled the experts . He wanted to save money , ignoring the first rule of industry economics : safety is never more expensive than an accident . The clean-up bill is complex and will extend for years . In Florida , workers clean a beach at dusk ; at sunrise it 's covered again . The spill is slathering four states now . It could be blown over to Texas . It could show up in the marinas of Key West , or even Wilmington , North Carolina on the Atlantic , wherever the Gulf Stream carries it . The coming expense is not to be imagined . Lawsuits are spilling out with no judicial blowout preventer to slow them down . Injury and loss of livelihood suits , suits from hotels for loss of bookings , suits from restaurants , bars , stores , suits for mental anguish , even claims from municipalities for loss of taxes . There is a large , years-old black spot in my driveway where my old Jeep once leaked a quart of transmission oil . It 's not fading away . The BP spill is likewise staining the coast 's soil , and sinking into the psychological fabric of the Gulf . Beneath the sorrow lies suspicion and anger based on the notion that if this spill had occurred near a place like Boston harbor where a lot of wealthy , well-connected people live , every oil-skimmer in the hemisphere would have been brought in and every offer of foreign help accepted immediately , instead of 71 days after the spill began . The locals have watched with disbelief some of BP 's lunatic and expensive clean-up methods , such as wiping down each blade of marsh grass with paper towels . They have watched their own , more effective , home-grown efforts ridiculed and crushed by irrelevant Coast Guard regulations and `` experts '' who have never seen Louisiana 's coast except perhaps through the windows of a plane . In three to 10 years , maybe the lawsuits will be settled , maybe the sea grasses will grow back to hold the marshlands together , maybe the fish now trying to breathe clouds of undersea oil will somehow propagate , maybe trust in the world 's best seafood will return . But a person 's life is composed of minutes and is most fulfilled by working and bringing one 's earnings to the family table . And who can give back even one ruined minute ?

Photograph : Patrick Semansky\\/AP BP will begin its legal offensive this month to cap its liabilities from the Gulf of Mexico disaster by offering those affected one-off compensation payouts in return for them waiving the right to sue . US lawyers say tens of thousands of affected people in the Gulf , particularly those in the fishing and tourism industries , are weeks away from bankruptcy . BP , which will try to permanently seal the Macondo well with a `` static kill '' operation on Tuesday , hopes that settling claims in this way will help it to begin to draw a line under the crisis and to quantify the costs . But lawyers say it is impossible to calculate future lost earnings . There is also no way for claimants to know whether they would receive more compensation if they decided to sue BP in the courts , which would take many months with no guarantee of success . Brent Coon , a Houston-based lawyer , said : `` These are mostly uneducated people . '' Applicants could rush to apply for a one-off , lump sum payout if they believe that BP will run out of money or will put its US business into bankruptcy . Ken Feinberg , who was appointed by the White House in June to administer the claims process on behalf of BP , will take charge within the next three weeks . BP has committed to pay $ 20bn into the fund in a series of instalments over the next three and a half years . The fund does not cap BP 's liabilities at $ 20bn . But privately the company believes that it will not have to pay out anywhere near this sum . BP has hired a battery of lawyers to protect itself , and so far it has paid out $ 261m in claims . When Feineberg takes over this month , for the first time claimants will be offered a one-off sum based on their future lost earnings , provided they agree not to sue BP . `` The fund will offer lump sum payments in return for an agreement not to pursue claims in court , '' a spokeswoman said . Claimants will also be able to receive an emergency payout to cover their lost income for up to six months without waiving their right to sue BP . BP had been making monthly payouts . A spokeswoman for Feinberg did not answer emailed questions from the Guardian about how a one-off payment would be calculated . Claims from those directly affected by the spill , such as fishermen , will qualify but uncertainty surrounds those more indirectly affected . For example , many owners of beach apartments in Florida even where no oil hit the shore face bankruptcy because holidaymakers stayed away . `` BP could argue that it could not foresee that people would react this way , '' said Coon . `` At some point the chain of foreseeability becomes so remote that as a matter of law there is a capping of liability . '' Feinberg has said such indirect claims may be determined by state tort law . It is likely to be many months , and probably years , before BP knows the cost of legal action by other companies involved and any fines payable . Today , it emerged that the US Coast Guard routinely approved BP 's requests to override a federal directive to ban the use of toxic dispersant to break up the spill except on rare occasions . The coastguard granted 74 exemptions over 48 days , according to documents obtained by Ed Markey , chairman of the House energy and environment subcommittee . According to BP , 1.8 m gallons of dispersant have been pumped into the Gulf . Scientists say that the resulting high toxicity levels could harm marine life for years to come . On Friday night , the House of Representatives passed legislation that would block BP from winning future drilling permits in the US because of its safety record .

Photograph : Charlie Riedel\\/AP BP was poised to begin the final preparations for permanently plugging its leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico yesterday , 105 days after the gusher put the future of one of the world 's biggest oil companies and an entire region in jeopardy . A last-minute hitch a small leak of hydraulic fluid in a control panel delayed the start of a set of tests designed to gauge the condition of the well . Scott Dean , a BP spokesman , said the test would now get under way after repairs to the control panel on the capping stack on top of the well . It is hoped this will happen this morning . But even with an end to the crisis in sight , there were signs of a split between BP and the Obama administration last night about how and when the well will eventually be put to death . Kent Wells , BP 's senior vice-president , suggested the so-called static kill during which heavy mud will be slowly pumped into the top of the well could permanently plug the gusher . That runs counter to the conventional wisdom of the last three months that a relief well still weeks from completion was the only total solution . `` We want to end up with cement in the bottom of the hole , '' he said . `` Whether that comes from the top or whether it comes from the relief well , those will be decisions made along the way . '' He said a relief well might be used merely as `` confirmation '' that the well was dead . Thad Allen , the Coast Guard admiral in charge of the administration 's response , disagreed . `` I do n't think we can see this as the end-all and be-all until we get the relief wells done , '' he said . Allen was more guarded about the prospects for static kill , saying it could take up to 60 hours to complete the procedure . Engineers hope to begin pumping heavy drilling mud into the well after running a series of pressure tests . No new oil has entered the Gulf since 15 July , when BP put in a temporary cap . But despite the prospect of a permanent solution , there were fears that BP and the Obama administration were moving too quickly to declare the crisis over . `` We are terrified that there is going to be this ` mission accomplished ' moment , '' said Aaron Viles , campaign director of the Gulf Restoration Network , in a reference to George Bush 's notorious declaration of victory in Iraq in May 2003 . `` There is a tremendous pressure to move on here , on all these under-resourced federal agencies and BP clearly also has an incentive . '' Recent reports have suggested the environmental damage done by the 5m barrels of oil that entered the Gulf has been exaggerated , or that the ocean surface was now free of oil . Government scientists last night put out their highest estimate to date of the spill , saying the well had been gushing at a rate of 62,000 barrels per day at its peak . The figure exceeds BP 's early worst case scenario , of 60,000 barrels a day . Viles said : `` There are no magic elves . The oil is still there in large volumes . It is just dispersing and working its way through the ecosystem , and at each step of the process it is having an impact . '' He said he flew over the spill at the weekend . `` We saw significant amounts of oil , but there was no fleet mobilised to tackle that oil , '' he said . If tests go to plan , BP will begin pumping heavy drilling mud into the well from a nearby ship loaded with 8,000 barrels of the substance . Wells said the aim was to slowly force the oil back down into the reservoir by steadily pumping in the heavier mud . `` We 'll be carefully monitoring the pressures and the volumes . The team will be looking and making sure we do everything to get this well killed , if at all possible , '' he said . The success of this week 's operation will also be critical to Obama and his fellow Democrats , who are facing big losses in congressional elections in November . Since the explosion which killed 11 workers , the Obama administration has faced continued challenges to its claims to competence . BP is set to begin plugging its runaway well in the Gulf of Mexico after a last set of pressure tests . An experimental cap has stopped the flow of any fresh oil into the Gulf since 15 July , but engineers want to monitor the pressure and volume of oil in the well as they begin a procedure BP is calling a `` static kill '' . Once engineers give the go-ahead , crews will begin slowly pumping heavy drilling mud into the top of the well from a nearby ship , the Blue Dolphin , through a line connected to the well 's original blow-out preventer just below the cap . The mud would be pumped at low pressure and speed , as engineers hope to force the oil back down the well . If all goes well , engineers would then begin pumping in cement down the same line through the top of the well to seal it off . BP will decide whether to continue work on a relief well that had been designed to pump mud and cement into the Macondo from the bottom .

Nearly 5m barrels of oil have gushed into the ocean since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank in April , according to federal scientists . That makes the spill larger than the 3.3 m barrels released into Mexico 's Bay of Campeche when the Ixtoc I oil rig suffered a catastrophic blowout in 1979 . At its peak , the BP well was spewing 62,000 barrels a day , according to the federal team , which is higher than the original worst-case scenario of 60,000 . But by the time that BP was able to cap the well last month that figure had dropped to 53,000 a day . The new estimate of the size of the spill of a total of 4.9 m barrels means the potential penalty that BP faces under US law has ballooned . Under the Clean Water Act , BP faces a fine of $ 1,100 -LRB- # 691 -RRB- a barrel , or $ 4,300 a barrel if it is found that the spill was the result of gross negligence . As a result , BP could be fined either $ 5.4 bn or $ 21bn . The federal team reckon BP 's own containment efforts saved about 800,000 barrels which could be taken into account as a mitigating factor , reducing the fine to either $ 4.5 bn or $ 17.6 bn . The largest oil spill in history came at the end of the first Gulf war in 1991 when retreating Iraqi forces destroyed countless Kuwaiti wells , which resulted in an estimated 1.4 m to 1.5 m tonnes of oil being released into the Persian Gulf . That spill is not , of course , counted as accidental . In an attempt to finally close the Macondo well , BP engineers will today carry out a pressure test to see whether they can begin the so-called ` static kill ' procedure , which involves pumping heavy drilling mud into the well . If tests go to plan , BP will begin pumping mud into the well from a nearby ship loaded with 8,000 barrels of it . The plan is to slowly force the oil back down into the reservoir by steadily pumping in the heavier mud . If successful , BP will be able to either cement the well from the top , or wait until the relief wells which are due to be completed later this month have reached the correct depth and cement the well from the bottom . Preparations for the `` injectivity '' test which was delayed on Monday because of a small leak of hydraulic fluid in a control panel come as it emerged BP has sent a bill for $ 480m to one of its partners in the well . Japan 's Mitsui , which has a 10 % stake in the well through its unit Mitsui Oil Exploration , said overnight that it has received a bill for $ 480m from BP which it will `` carefully '' study but has yet to decide if it will pay any clean-up costs . Anadarko has flatly refused to accept any blame for the disaster . In June its chairman and chief executive , Jim Hackett , said BP 's actions probably amounted to `` gross negligence or wilful misconduct '' .

Static kill is similar to the top kill method that BP attempted to use back in May . The procedure works by essentially pumping heavy mud and cement through the blow-out preventer and into the well . The idea being that the mud is so dense that it will suffocate the flow of oil , forcing it back down the well into the reservoir . -LRB- See graphic -RRB- . In a recent technical update , Kent Wells , BP senior vice-president , said the key difference between top kill and static kill is that during the top kill the well was flowing . `` We had to pump at tremendous rates and pressures to overcome that , '' he said . `` Today we have the well shut in , we do n't have that flow we have to overcome , so we can go at very slow rates , very little additional pressure above what the well shut-in pressure already is . `` It 's a much more controlled fashion . '' The heavy drilling mud , which weighs about 13lb per gallon , will be pumped to the seabed from a ship , and through a manifold a device that controls the mud flow before being forced down into the well through the blow-out preventer . If the mud successfully smothers the oil , BP could then pump concrete down into the well in a bid to seal it . The company will conduct an `` injectivity test '' this morning , and if successful could attempt the static kill this afternoon . Although , a spokesman warned that the procedure could take a few hours but might take `` much longer '' . Finally , sealing the well would represent an enormous relief for beleaguered BP executives . The flow of oil was first stemmed on 15 July , when the company fitted a cap to the blow-out preventer . The cap prevented leaking oil for the first time since 20 April , ending three months of attempted shut-off procedures . BP 's initial efforts to contain the spill focused on trapping and burning the oil on the water surface , while repairing the blow-out preventer , so it could shut off the flow . When this failed in late April , the company began to drill two relief wells , but warned they would take two to three months to become operational . While beginning this drilling , the company successfully stemmed one of the three leaks by attaching a valve to the end of the crippled drilling pipe , and after constructing three huge cofferdams or containment domes tried to lower one over the main source of the leak . In early May , the cofferdam failed due to a build up of crystallised gas , and as the oil began to wash ashore , BP focused instead on trying to capture some of the leaking oil , rather than stopping the flow all at once . At the end of May , the terms `` top kill '' and `` junk shot '' entered the worldwide vernacular , as BP tried to force heavy mud , and later golf balls and bits of tyre through the blow-out preventer . It did n't work , and in early June , BP turned to capping the well , with some success , before replacing the original cap with a tighter fitting one , sealing the well , in July .

The BP oil spill is the biggest in history , figures show . Photograph : Charlie Riedel\\/AP We thought it was big , but now we know it is huge the greatest accidental marine oil spill in all history . The latest calculations of the vast quantity of oil polluting the Gulf of Mexico after the blowout of BP 's Macondo well conclude that 4.9 m barrels poured into the ocean . The scientists making the estimate believe it is accurate to within 10 % , so even the smallest leak would be a third bigger than the 3.3 m barrels released into Mexico 's Bay of Campeche when the Ixtoc I oil rig blew out in 1979 . The largest ever was the 11m barrels deliberately spilled by retreating Iraqi troops in 1991 . At its peak , the Macondo well was spewing out 62,000 barrels a day and declined a little to 53,000 by the end , as the reservoir became exhausted by 87 days of venting . The figures make a mockery of the initial estimates 1,000 barrels a day rising to 5,000 , then 12,000-19 ,000 and beyond . But we can finally have some confidence in the numbers : the well is capped and the pressure readings now possible give a strong steer on the previous flow rates . So the oil has stopped the final sealing is expected for the well this week and we know the scale of the disaster . But where does that leave us and our relationship with oil ? For the families of the 11 men who died on the Deepwater rig nothing has changed . For BP , it can start to make some calculations of the fines it may face : $ 5bn , or over $ 20bn if it is found to have been grossly negligent . Harder to estimate is the compensation the company will have to pay to those who lost their livelihoods because of the spill , from fishermen to strippers . BP 's efforts to cap their payments by offering one-off deals in return for signing away the right to sue seems in bad taste , but the hard-up may be tempted and in any case the relationship between the residents of the Gulf states and big oil is complex . Many have lived well off the industry and when a federal ban on some drilling was imposed the court case to overturn it had a good deal of popular support . But the biggest unknown is what will happen to the Gulf itself and the coastal wetlands that fringe it and that is because BP buried much of the oil below the surface . By injecting at least 1.8 m gallons of dispersant chemicals into the plumes of oil , BP kept the oil out of sight and may have prevented some oiling of the shores . But the consequences for the food chain in the gulf are completely unknown , and the dispersant is just as toxic as the oil . Also unknown is how the oil will interact with the huge '' dead zones '' that afflict the gulf . These result from the wasted farm fertiliser washed down the Mississippi and other rivers into the gulf , where it spawns algal blooms which consume all the oxygen in the water . This year 's dead zone is likely to be the biggest ever , greater than the state of Massachussetts , and early research shows the oil will make it worse . More difficult to call is the consequence of a hurricane ripping through the gulf , as is likely before the end of the season in November . Such a storm could drive oil on to land , causing further damage , but it could also break up and disperse the oil , speeding its decomposition . Another positive factor is the gulf 's latitude : the warm ocean there speeds the evaporation and digestion of the oil by bacteria . Some have wondered if coverage of the environmental impact of the spill has been overdone , particularly given reports from other oil spills suggesting that intial fears were confounded by nature 's ability to heal . The clear answer here is we do n't know . There has never been a spill like this and the impacts depends on the interplay between the oil , ocean currents , storms , the dead zones , breeding seasons and more . But the biggest question raised by the declaration of this disaster as the worst accidental marine oil spill ever is a simple one . Faced by this human , economic and ecological catastrophe , can the US and the world start to wean itself off oil ? Or will its thirst drive it into ever deeper water , from Brazil to Shetland ? The US has called its relationship to oilan '' addiction '' and has said the benefits of changing its energy mix are security , jobs , less global warming . But the Senate 's inability to accept anything other than a very limited energy bill suggests that any positive outcomes of this serious crisis may well go to waste . cents This article was amended on 4 August 2010 .

Photograph : Reuters The Obama administration is facing internal dissent from its scientists for approving the use of huge quantities of chemical dispersants to tackle the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , the Guardian has learned . The US Environmental Protection Agency has come under attack in Congress and from independent scientists for allowing BP to spray almost 2m gallons of the dispersant Corexit on to the slick and , even more controversially , into the leak site 5,000 ft below the sea . Now it emerges that EPA 's own experts have been raising similar concerns within the agency . Jeff Ruch , the exective director of the whistleblower support group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility , said he had heard from five scientists and two other officials who had expressed concerns to their superiors about the use of dispersants . `` There was one toxicologist who was very concerned about the underwater application particularly , '' he said . `` The concern was the agency appeared to be flying blind and not consulting its own specialists and even the literature that was available . '' Veterans of the Exxon Valdez spill questioned the wisdom of trying to break up the oil in the deep water at the same time as trying to skim it on the surface . Other EPA experts raised alarm about the effect of dispersants on seafood . Ruch said EPA experts were being excluded from decision-making on the spill . `` Other than a few people in the united command , there is no involvement from the rest of the agency , '' he said . EPA scientists would not go public for fear of retaliation , he added . Jerrold Nadler , a New York Democrat who introduced a ban on dispersants pending further testing in an oil spill bill passed by the House of Representatives last week , said the EPA had failed in its duty to protect the environment . `` We are undertaking a huge uncontrolled experiment with the entire Gulf , '' he said . `` They have fallen down on the job very substantially because they allowed BP to use dispersants . Even when they told BP not to use dispersants they allowed BP to ignore their advice . '' Independent scientists also criticised the EPA for claiming that the combination of oil and dispersants posed no greater danger to marine life on its own . On Wednesday , a toxicologist from Texas Tech University is scheduled to tell a Senate hearing that the unprecedented use of dispersants `` created an eco-toxicological experiment '' . `` The bottom line is that a lot of oil is still at sea dispersed in the water column , '' said Ron Kendall . `` It 's a big ecological question as to how this will ultimately unfold . '' Previous studies , including a 400-page study by the National Academy of Sciences , have warned that the combination of oil and dispersants is more toxic than oil on its own , because the chemicals break down cell walls , making organisms more susceptible to oil . The EPA issued a report on Monday , based on a study of how much of the mixture was needed to kill a species of shrimp and small fish , just two of the 15,000 types of marine life in the Gulf . The EPA test did not address medium - or long-term effects , or reports last week that dispersants were discovered in the larvae of blue crab , entering the food chain . `` It was only one test and it was very crude . We knew going into this and the EPA knew that this mixture is highly toxic to many , many species . There is a whole weight of literature , '' said Susan Shaw , the director of the Marine Environmental Research Institute , who has been organising on the issue . `` It is not the whole science . It 's the convenient science . '' Hugh Kaufman , a senior EPA policy analyst , dismissed the tests as little more than a PR stunt . `` They are trying to spin this limited piece of information to make it look like dispersants are safe and that the Corexit dispersant is safe . '' EPA did not immediately respond to requests for comment . It is under fire from Congress for allowing BP and the coast guard to ignore its order last May to cut the use of dispersants by 75 % . Documents released by the Massachusetts Democrat Ed Markey this week show the EPA allowed spraying of dispersants 74 times over a period of 48 days . At times , the EPA gave advance approval for the use of dispersants for up to a week . The documents also showed the EPA allowed BP to spray 36,000 gallons of Corexit in a single day . The controversy surrounding EPA 's role in the oil spill marks a turning point for the Obama administration , which came to power vowing to repair the frayed relationship between scientists and government under George Bush and promising a new era of transparency . Nine leading scientists have written a public letter calling on BP and the Obama administration to release all scientific data related to the spill , including wildlife death . `` Just as the unprecedented use of dispersants has served to sweep millions of gallons of oil under the rug , we 're concerned the public may not get to see critical scientific data until BP has long since declared its responsibility over , '' said Bruce Stein of the National Wildlife Federation .

Photograph : Patrick Semansky\\/AP Barack Obama today declared the US 's largest and most politically embarrassing oil spill near an end as BP said it had reached a `` significant milestone '' in its efforts to permanently seal the Deepwater Horizon well . `` The long battle is finally close to coming to an end , and we are very pleased with that , '' said the president , who was strongly criticised for what was initially seen as a slow and weak response as millions of barrels of oil poured into the Gulf of Mexico . BP said it had completed a process known as static kill , in which heavy mud was pumped in to plug the stricken well , producing a `` textbook '' result . The head of the government 's response team , retired coastguard admiral Thad Allen , said the process had almost certainly ensured there would be no further leaks while the drilling of a relief shaft is completed in the next fortnight and the main well finally capped . `` We 've pretty much made this well not a threat , '' he said . Obama described the static kill operation , and a report by government scientists that about 75 % of the nearly 5m barrels of spilled oil has been dealt with by the clean-up effort or nature , as `` very welcome news '' . The White House tried to ensure the administration would gain credit for leading what it called a `` robust '' response to the disaster by saying that the clean-up would not have been as successful if it had not pushed BP `` every step of the way '' . The administration 's spokesman , Robert Gibbs , said : `` It is sort of the beginning of the end of the sealing and containment phase of this operation . '' He added that no one owed an apology to the outgoing BP chief executive , Tony Hayward , who angered many Americans with what were seen as insensitive comments . The White House energy adviser , Carol Browner , today said a report by the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration suggested there was no major additional environment threat . `` The vast majority of the oil has now been contained , it 's been skimmed , Mother Nature has done its part , it 's evaporated , '' she said . BP still faces an as yet undetermined number of compensation claims , which Browner said the government was determined to see it meet . `` We are going to continue to ensure that BP is held accountable for the damage that they did , for the economic losses and ultimately for the natural resource damages and all of the restoration that will take place in the Gulf communities and in the Gulf at large .

BP said it had reached a significant milestone overnight when mud forced down the Gulf of Mexico well the static kill operation held back the flow of crude . Workers stopped pumping mud into the well after about eight hours and were monitoring it to ensure it remained stable , BP said . `` It 's a milestone , '' said a spokeswoman , Sheila Williams said . `` It 's a step towards the killing of the well . '' Site leader Bobby Bolton said the pressure in the well dropped quickly in the first 90 minutes of the procedure , indicating that everything was going to plan . Crews must now decide when to use cement as a final cap . Federal officials will not declare victory until a successful `` bottom kill '' when mud is pumped into the well bottom two to three miles below the sea floor and then cemented is completed .

Photograph : Ho\\/REUTERS The White House was accused today of spinning a government scientific report into the amount of oil left in the Gulf of Mexico from the BP spill which had officials declaring that the vast majority of the oil had been removed . As BP workers finished pouring cement into the well as a first step to permanently sealing it today , environmental groups and scientists including those working with government agencies to calculate the scale and effects of the spill said White House officials had painted far too optimistic a picture of a report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency -LRB- Noaa -RRB- into the fate of the oil . `` Recent reports seem to say that about 75 % of the oil is taken care of and that is just not true , '' said John Kessler , of Texas A&M University , who led a National Science Foundation on-site study of the spill . `` The fact is that 50 % to 75 % of the material that came out of the well is still in the water . It 's just in a dissolved or dispersed form . '' With work progressing on the final phase of the `` static kill '' sealing of the well , Thad Allen , the Obama administration 's top official on the spill , told reporters there would be no new oil in the Gulf . But those assurances failed to satisfy scientists and environmental groups , who disputed the claim by Carol Browner , the White House energy and climate adviser , that `` the vast majority of oil is gone '' . In Louisiana , state wildlife officials told CNN that tar balls and patches of oil were still washing up in the marshes and coastal areas of St Bernard , Plaquemines and Jefferson parishes . Susan Shaw , a marine toxicologist and director of the Marine Environmental Research Institute , said the White House had been too quick to declare the oil was gone . `` The blanket statement that the public understood is that most of the oil has disappeared . That is not true . About 50 % of it is still in the water , '' she said . Like other scientists , she said the report failed to explain how it reached its estimates on the amount of oil that was biodegraded naturally , or dispersed with chemicals . `` There are a lot of unanswered questions . '' Even the White House 's own estimates still left a spill five times the size of that from the Exxon Valdez , she said , with long-term consequences that would be unknown for years to come . Terry Hazen , the head of ecology at the Lawrence Berkeley national laboratory , who studied the spill for Noaa , said his teams could find no trace of oil on the surface or in the deep between 2km and 100km from the well site last week . `` Whatever was put into the environment , it is undetectable in the water column and the surface of water , '' he said . But he added : `` That is not true though in the marshes or on some of the shorelines . We do know there is still oil out there . '' He also said there were potential weaknesses in the analysis because of Noaa 's assumptions about the size of the spill . `` When they do all of the inventories trying to estimate all of the oil and where it went there is pretty wide margins of estimates of how much was actually coming out of the well head , '' he said . `` That complicates everything . '' However , such nuances were overshadowed by the White House , which staged a high-profile event on Wednesday to announce that the well had stopped flowing , and that the consequences of the spill were not as catastrophic as once feared . Francesca Griffo , senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists , said the White House had stepped on more nuanced statements from Noaa scientists . `` When these reports go through the spin machine they get distorted , '' she said . `` If you look closely at this report , it makes it very clear that this is not over . '' Rick Steiner , a former University of Alaska marine biologist , suggested that the White House had been too eager to try to put the oil spill behind it , with Democrats in Congress facing tough election fights in November . `` It seems that there was a rush to declare this done , and there were obvious political objectives there , '' he said . `` Even if there is not a drop of oil out there , and it had truly magically vanished , it would still be an environmental disaster caused by the toxic shock of the release of 5m barrels of oil .

Photograph : Bevil Knapp\\/EPA US officials recorded a big jump in the numbers of dolphins and endangered brown pelican and sea turtle injured or killed by the BP spill over the past week , even as officials were proclaiming that the oil was rapidly disappearing from the Gulf . Some 1,020 sea turtles were caught up in the spill , according to figures -LRB- pdf -RRB- today an ominous number for an endangered species . Wildlife officials collected 177 sea turtles last week more than in the first two months of the spill and a sizeable share of the 1,020 captured since the spill began more than three months ago . Some 517 of that total number were dead and 440 were covered in oil , according to figures maintained the Deepwater Horizon response team . `` It is a high number for any endangered species , '' said Elizabeth Wilson , a scientist for the Oceana conservation group . The number of dolphins , whales and other marine mammals captured or found dead also rose last week , from 69 to 76 . An analysis by the National Wildlife Federation said the numbers of oiled birds collected had nearly doubled since the well was capped , from 37 to 71 a day . It was not immediately clear why the numbers of injured and dead wildlife have jumped . Kevin Godsea , a fish and wildlife official overseeing the rescue of threatened brown pelican , said many of the more recent victims were hatchlings who took their first flights right into the oil . `` We had a lot of young birds hanging right around the boomed areas of rookeries , and lot of those young birds are testing out their wings and they are getting right into the oil , '' he said . Older pelicans exposed to oil are also able to survive much longer because of relatively warm temperatures in the Gulf , and are only succumbing now , he said . In addition , he said officials had purposely stayed away from island bird sanctuaries to avoid exposing hatchlings to disease . But that concern to avoid disturbing habitat may have put pelican eggs and hatchlings at greater risk once able-bodied pelican fled the oil . `` There has been a lot of criticism of fish and wildlife for the fact that they never actually went on the islands , and because they did not , abandoned nests were left so that any chicks that were already hatched died , and any eggs that were left were also left to die , '' said Cynthia Sarthou executive director of the Gulf Restoration Network .

Photograph : Pete Souza\\/Reuters Barack Obama plunged up to his neck into the debate about the safety of Gulf waters after the BP oil spill yesterday when the White House released a photo of the president taking a dip at a Florida resort town . The White House had cast the trip to Panama City by the president , Michelle Obama and daughter Sasha as a solidarity mission that would help restore public confidence in the resort towns , which have suffered heavy cancellations during the peak school holiday season . Obama has faced a growing chorus of criticism for not heeding his own advice that Americans vacation in the Gulf . The president and his family were pictured playing mini golf and taking a boat trip around St Andrews Bay looking for dolphins . The White House also released a single image of Obama swimming with his daughter by the official photographer Pete Souza . Other photographers were kept away from the beach . The resort towns of the Florida panhandle are on the eastern edge of the oil spill but the beaches were still hit by tar balls and an oily sheen . A study by Oxford Economics for the US Travel Association estimated the spill could cost coastal towns in the four Gulf states nearly $ 23 billion dollars in lost tourism arrivals over the next three years . On Friday , Alabama became the first state to sue BP for damage from the oil spill . Louisiana sustained the most damage to its coastline following the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig three months ago . The state 's attorney general said it was suing BP , Transocean and Halliburton for `` catastrophic harm '' caused by the spill . On Saturday , Obama sought to shore up businesses along the entire Gulf coast . `` As a result of the clean-up effort beaches all along the Gulf Coast are clean , they are safe and they are open for business , '' Obama told reporters . `` That 's one of the reasons Michelle , Sasha and I are here . '' He promised that his administration would continue to monitor the oil as it hit the shore and to make sure the clean up was completed . But the first family 's own holiday in the Gulf was over within just 27 hours with the Obamas returning to Washington by lunchtime today . They leave on their real holiday a 10-day stay in Martha 's Vineyard midweek . No new oil has entered the Gulf since July 15 when a BP crew fitted a new cap over the well . The administration 's lead official on the crisis , Coast Guard commander Thad Allen , on Saturday directed BP to conduct a new set of pressure tests on the well before launching the operation to kill it for good with a relief well . It could be later tomorrow or early on Tuesday before officials know the results of those tests .

Photograph : AFP\\/Getty BP has failed to update its oil spill emergency plan in the Gulf of Mexico more than three months after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in apparent violation of federal regulations , the Observer has learned . The company was lambasted by US politicians for having a response plan which , even before the explosion , appeared to have serious flaws . Errors included a proposal highlighting the need to protect sea walruses , even though none exist in the Gulf , and listing one wildlife expert who died four years before the plan was approved . BP has admitted it has still not revised the plan . Yet according to the federal agency responsible for offshore drilling , the Minerals Management Service -LRB- MMS , now renamed BOEM -RRB- , operators must submit a revised plan within 15 days if `` a change occurs which significantly reduces your response capabilities '' and if `` a significant change occurs in the worst case discharge scenario '' . Both these conditions apply to BP , according to one Texas law firm . Mikal Watts of Watts Guerra Craft said : `` After a catastrophe like Deepwater Horizon , MMS regulations require that BP submit a revised oil response plan . BP has n't , and the Gulf of Mexico continues to be at risk because of BP 's failure to follow the law . '' Politicians also said that the disaster had exposed the plan 's worst-case discharge scenario as inaccurate . Under BP 's plan , the worst case envisaged was a spill of 250,000 barrels a day 30 miles off the shore of Louisiana . Even though the size of the Deepwater Horizon spill was much smaller , BP was still unable to prevent the oil from hitting the coast . A BP spokesman denied the company needed to file a revised plan , saying : `` An incident does not trigger automatic re-submittal of an oil spill response plan Once we have gathered the learnings from the Deepwater Horizon incident , we will update our plan and submit it . '' Asked about the BOEM regulation to revise the plan within 15 days in changed circumstances , the spokesman said , `` we believe we are in compliance with the regulation '' . BOEM said it was still reviewing BP 's original plan , and that the company had not submitted a revised version . Congressional hearings into the oil disaster have heard that MMS routinely failed to enforce its own laws in the Gulf . President Obama has promised to tighten up the regime .

Photograph : Jae C. Hong\\/AP The Obama administration is calling for environmental reviews for all new deepwater oil drilling , spelling an end , for the time being at least , to the kind of exemptions that allowed BP to drill its blown-out well in the Gulf of Mexico with little scrutiny . The announcement came after a report by the White House Council on Environmental Quality that found BP received environmental exemptions based on decades-old data for its well that exploded in April , killing 11 workers and triggering the US 's worst-ever oil spill . Shallow-water drilling also will be subject to stricter scrutiny . The report sheds new light on the granting of those categorical exclusions , saying the exclusions BP operated under were written in 1981 and 1986 , long before the boom in deepwater drilling propelled by dramatic new technologies for reaching far into the sea floor . The report also finds other problems with how the Minerals Management Service applied environmental laws in reviewing the BP project . It notes , for example , that in assessing the likelihood of a major spill , MMS did not consider the example of the disastrous 1979 Ixtoc spill in the Gulf , simply because the spill was not in US waters .

Photograph : Pete Souza\\/Reuters The saddest sight this week has been of America 's first family taking a quick one-day holiday in Florida . Crashing visitor numbers and plummeting fish sales have devastated the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill . There is talk of an 80 % drop in revenues in some resorts . Yet figures show just 16 of the state 's 180 holiday beaches are at all polluted , while the bulk of the spill appears to have dispersed , or be dispersing out at sea . Having hyped the disaster for political purposes , the president is now frantically trying to play it down . The spill has been another classic of state terror in which incident and response are wholly out of proportion to one another . As the oil leak began back in April , Obama declared a disaster , banned fishing in 37 % of the Gulf and ordered a halt to underwater oil exploration , putting some 27,000 jobs at risk . Columnists screamed it was `` Obama 's 9\\/11 '' and demanded he `` harness the nation 's outrage '' . He was attacked for playing golf within 58 days of the disaster . With dial-a-quote scientists howling blue murder , any who might have looked at previous spills and thought it might not be so bad would have been unpatriotic disaster-deniers . Hardly a day passed without the president castigating BP , the hated `` British Petroleum '' never its American site operators , Transocean and Halliburton , or his own regulators . It was a field day for xenophobes . The president used the sort of language normally visited on global terrorists . He was going to `` get BP '' and make them `` pay for this '' . It was another Hurricane Katrina , but one that could thankfully be blamed on foreigners . A Louisiana seafood supplier declared : `` If I had a bomb , I would put it on London '' which would have him in Guant namo Bay if he were Muslim and speaking of New York . Foreigners had raped America . It was they , they , they Now , mysteriously , Obama speaks of we , we , we who `` have this thing under control '' . His environment adviser , Carol Browner , says `` the vast majority of the oil appears to have gone '' . Less than 10 % of coastline saw any oil at all . There have been no sightings of dead fish floating in the sea and most fishing will soon be `` back to normal '' . The Gulf is apparently `` clean , safe and open for business '' , and a lovely place to take the kids . It is OK , everyone . Disaster has turned to triumph , so let us all think about the midterm elections . So whose fault really was the collapse in the local economy ? It began with a failed oil well , responsibility resting with BP , but blame still not apportioned . Yet as every terrorist knows , it is not the bomb that does the real damage , it is the publicity multiplier given it by the media and politics . The bomb causes the bang ; the target is then relied on to supply the megaphone . So it has proved in the Gulf . Competing scientists have had a field day . While some kept up the hysteria this week with such declarations as `` We do n't know the long term yet '' , those with links to the administration or fishing for BP 's $ 500m offered to Gulf environmental research are suddenly optimists . Most of the oil has mysteriously evaporated , like that from the biggest similar disaster , the dumping of oil into the Persian Gulf in 1991 by Iraqi forces . America did not turn a hair , any more than it did about the Union Carbide explosion that killed 15,000 Indians in Bhopal in 1984 , with only trivial compensation paid . The issue is apparently no longer the number of `` barrels '' spilled but the sort of oil , the location of the spill and the temperature of the ambient water and air . Contamination of most wildlife appears to have been minimal . Even crustaceans recover fast , while the ban on fishing has boosted fish stocks . What we have here is yet another fiasco in the public management of disaster , which is becoming a global pandemic all of its own . From oil spills to Icelandic ash clouds , from flu viruses to `` Frankenstein cows '' , from Afghanistan 's `` terror threat to our streets '' , which has already killed more than 300 British servicemen , to the supposed menace of Iran 's nuclear bomb , politics has rejected its most precious obligation , to set the world 's dangers in context and react proportionately . The imperative to exploit public fear is as old as power itself , but modern media give it a new menace . It enables leaders to suppress the dictates of reason and , however briefly , mesmerise the public into obedience . In 2003 Tony Blair decided to show off by sending 400 Household Cavalry in tanks to Heathrow `` to counter terrorism '' , as a preliminary to a blitz of legislation curbing civil liberty . The image of a city under siege wiped millions off Britain 's tourism account , but Blair got his legislation . The continued efforts of the big defense lobby to persuade the British people that they still live under the threat of a nuclear winter has become little more than high-class job protection and profit maintenance . Yet it is bought hook , line and sinker by most politicians and commentators . George Osborne has at least boldly told the defense chiefs that , if the nuclear threat to Britain is so grave , that is precisely what the existing defense budget is for . There was no threat to Britons , or the world , proportionate with the response to last spring 's ash cloud , swine flu , Osama bin Laden or , for that matter , to liquids in carry-on flight bags . Europe 's airport giants are even now wrestling with the question of whether a camembert is a `` liquid '' . The great conflation of fear often egged on by `` the science '' is the result of government gladly allowing itself to go mad for a day , to raise a fear , glean a headline or win a budget rise . Obama grotesquely exaggerated the oil threat to advance his personal and party cause . He is now struggling to downplay it . The US Travel Association is suing BP for $ 500m in promotional compensation . Why not sue the president ? It was he who led the charge in disaster rhetoric , with a daily stream of negative publicity for the Gulf of Mexico , before trying , somewhat pathetically , to make up for it .

Photograph : Win Mcnamee\\/Getty Images The White House is facing a growing challenge to its claim that most of the oil from the Deepwater disaster has disappeared from the Gulf of Mexico , as at least two independent teams of scientists reported new evidence of oil persisting deep under the surface of the sea . Earlier this month , government scientists reported that about 75 % of the oil had been captured , burned off , evaporated or broken down in the Gulf . But University of South Florida scientists , returning from a 10-day research voyage , said they found oil on the ocean floor in the DeSoto canyon , a prime spawning ground for fish far to the east of BP 's rogue oil well . Preliminary results suggested that oil was getting into the phytoplankton , the microscopic plants at the bottom of the Gulf food chain . `` The idea that this could have an impact on the food web and on the biological system is certainly a reality , '' David Hollander , a marine geochemist , told the University of South Florida radio station . Smaller organisms would be likely to be affected the most , he added . `` Fish eggs if they 're in that environment they may not be consuming it , but it 's like paint in the air . You breathe it at low concentrations for a long enough time , you 're still going to have that response . '' Scientists from the University of Georgia also disputed the White House claim , releasing their own analysis suggesting 70 % to 79 % of the oil in the Gulf of Mexico remained in the water . `` The idea that 75 % of the oil is gone and of no concern for the environment is just absolutely incorrect , '' said Charles Hopkinson , a marine science professor at the university . And the Gulf Coast Fund , a citizens ' group , maintains that oil is still washing ashore in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and the Florida panhandle . `` Just because the oil is no longer on the surface , it does not indicate the area is healthy , '' said Wilma Subra , a chemist advising the group . `` We 've received reports from residents all along the coast who continue to see oil on and off shore , as well as reports of hundreds of dead fish , crabs , birds , dolphins , and other sea life . '' Congress is due to examine the White House claims at a hearing tomorrow on the fate of the 5m barrels of oil that leaked into the Gulf from BP 's well . The energy and commerce committee will also look at official claims that Gulf seafood is safe to eat . BP might not be able to execute the final kill of its well until September , said Thad Allen , the US Coast Guard 's former commander , recently retired . Allen said that BP and government officials had yet to agree on a way to pump cement into the bottom of the well without putting too much pressure on a cement seal at the top . Engineers are assessing whether to install a new blow-out preventer or a new system for relieving pressure on the cap at the top of the well . The debate about the fate of the oil is a product of the strategic decision taken by the BP and the Obama administration to tackle the oil offshore and prevent the waste penetrating Louisiana 's ecologically fragile wetland ; the move involved spraying nearly 2m gallons of chemical dispersants on the oil , some of it at depths of 1,524 metres -LRB- 5,000 ft -RRB- . The approach means that scientists are now operating in uncharted waters . BP 's well caused the biggest offshore oil spill but never before had response teams used such quantities of dispersants and at such depths . The efforts to end the problem also led to fears that the chosen cure , in this case the chemical dispersant Corexit , was more dangerous than the ailment . Research had suggested that Corexit made organisms more vulnerable to the toxic components in the oil . The uncertainties about the long-term consequences of the oil spill have complicated efforts by BP and the Obama administration to move to a long-term response plan . The administration is demanding new pressure tests before it gives the go-ahead for the completion of a relief well . BP said it was winding down its claims operation , and that today would be the last day it would consider claims from anyone suffering economic losses through the spill . All new claims would be overseen by Ken Feinberg , an independent administrator appointed to oversee the $ 20bn BP escrow account . BP said its team had so far paid out $ 368m to claimants .

Photograph : Chip Somodevilla\\/Getty Images White House claims that the worst of the BP oil spill was over were undermined yesterday when a senior government scientist said three-quarters of the oil was still in the Gulf environment and a research study detected a 22-mile plume of oil in the ocean depths . Bill Lehr , a senior scientist at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- NOAA -RRB- departed from an official report from two weeks ago which suggested the majority of the oil had been captured or broken down . `` I would say most of that is still in the environment , '' Lehr , the lead author of the report , told the house energy and commerce committee . The growing evidence that the White House painted an overly optimistic picture when officials claimed two weeks ago the remaining oil in the Gulf was rapidly breaking down fuelled a sense of outrage in the scientific community that government agencies are hiding data and spinning the science of the oil spill . No new oil has entered the Gulf since 15 July , but officials said yesterday the well is unlikely to be sealed for good until mid-September . Under questioning from the committee chair , Ed Markey , Lehr revised down the amount of oil that went into the Gulf to 4.1 m barrels , from an earlier estimate of 4.9 m , noting that 800,000 barrels were siphoned off directly from the well . By some estimates , as much as 90 % of the oil was unaccounted for . Lehr said 6 % was burned and 4 % was skimmed but he could not be confident of numbers for the amount collected from beaches . The NOAA has been under fire from independent scientists and Congress for its conclusions and for failing to explain how it arrived at its calculations . The agency has failed to respond to repeated requests from Congress to reveal its raw data and methodology . Markey told Lehr the agency report had given the public a false sense of confidence . `` You should n't have released it until you knew it was right , '' he said . `` People want to believe that everything is OK and I think this report and the way it is being discussed is giving many people a false sense of confidence regarding the state of the Gulf , '' Markey said . Lehr said the agency would release all supporting data in two months . But the impression of stonewalling has damaged the credibility of the Obama administration in the scientific community . `` That report was not science , '' said Ian MacDonald , an ocean scientist at Florida State University who has studied the Gulf for 30 years . He accused the White House of making `` sweeping and largely unsupported '' claims that three-quarters of the oil in the Gulf was gone . `` I believe this report is misleading , '' he said . `` The imprint will be there in the Gulf of Mexico for the rest of my life . It is not gone and it will not go away quickly . '' MacDonald went on to warn of a tipping point from which the wildlife and ecosystem in the Gulf could not recover . Meanwhile , in the Science article , experts from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute mapped a 22-mile plume of oil droplets from BP 's well , providing the strongest evidence so far over the fate of the crude . `` These results indicate that efforts to book-keep where the oil went must now include this plume , '' said Christopher Reddy , one of the Woods Hole team . The report also said the plume was very slow to break down by natural forces . `` Many people speculated that subsurface oil droplets were being easily degraded , '' said Richard Camilli , the lead author of the paper . `` Well , we did n't find that . We found it was still there . '' The scientists zig-zagged for hundreds of miles across the ocean to track the plume , taking 57,000 readings of its chemical signature during a 10-day research voyage at the end of June . The Woods Hole effort reinforces earlier reports from research voyages by scientists from the University of Georgia and Texas A&M University who detected the presence of deepwater plumes of oil . This week , University of South Florida scientists reported oil in amounts that were toxic to critical plankton on the ocean floor far east of the spill . Those findings have not been reviewed by other scientists . According to the Woods Hole findings , the deepwater plume is 22 miles long or about the length of Manhattan 1.2 miles wide and 650ft high . It noted that the plume was not made up of pure oil but included toxic oil compounds including benzene and xylene . Yesterday 's testimony and the Science article put the White House and government scientific agencies increasingly out of step with independent scientists . It also raises new questions about the administration 's decision to use nearly 2m gallons of a chemical dispersant Corexit to break up the oil . The NOAA chief Jane Lubchenco , herself an ocean scientist , had played down the first reports of oil in the ocean depths . MacDonald and other scientists have accused NOAA of discouraging them from making public their findings about lingering oil in the deepwater . A NOAA spokeswoman said last night that the Woods Hole voyage was in late June , while the broken BP well was still spewing oil . `` It 's not necessarily an indication of where we are today '' she said . A NOAA team reported two weeks ago that just over a quarter of oil remained in the Gulf as a light sheen on the surface or degraded tar balls washing ashore .

The oil spill reversed the fall in energy insurance rates lifting them by up to 20 % , in recognition of the increased risks . The worst spill in American history has affected insurance rates for deepwater drilling around the world and has also had a knock-on effect on marine liability rates because of potential pollution , said Amlin 's chief executive Charles Philipps . The disaster has also fuelled demand for insurance . `` A lot more people want to buy . Regulators are demanding that if companies are drilling in the Gulf they get X amount of insurance , '' said Hiscox . He was confident about the future , even though experts are expecting a worse-than-usual hurricane season this year . Unlike banks faced with black holes in their finances , insurers tend to bounce back quickly after a big disaster because they can bump up their prices . `` If it 's really big and hairy , a feast follows the famine , '' he said . He noted that the worst year for the insurance industry , 2005 , when four hurricanes hit America , was followed by several years of staggering profits . Amlin cheered investors by raising its interim dividend by 10.8 % to 7.2 p a share while Hiscox increased its dividend by 11 % to 5p .

Photograph : John McConnico\\/AP BP has been forced to abandon hopes of drilling in the Arctic , currently the center of a new oil rush , owing to its tarnished reputation after the Gulf of Mexico spill . The company confirmed tonight that it was no longer trying to win an exploration licence in Greenland , despite earlier reports of its interest . `` We are not participating in the bid round , '' said a spokesman at BP 's London headquarters , who declined to discuss its reasons for the reverse . The setback , which follows the announcement this week of a major find in the region by British rival Cairn Energy , is the first sign that the Gulf of Mexico disaster may have permanently damaged BP 's ability to operate not just in US waters , but in other environmentally sensitive parts of the world . Today the bureau of minerals and petroleum in Nuuk , the capital of Greenland , confirmed that the names of successful bidders for future exploration licences would be announced in the next couple of weeks . The bureau refused to comment on widespread rumors that it had specifically decided not to consider BP as a result of the recent Macondo well disaster in the US . However , senior sources confirmed to the Guardian that both the Greenland government and BP had agreed it would be inappropriate for the company to be involved . `` With the Greenpeace ship already harassing Cairn off Greenland a company which has an exemplary safety record everyone realized it would be political madness to give the green light to BP , '' one source said . BP has traditionally been at the forefront of breaking into new frontiers such as Russia and Angola , as well as drilling the deepest wells in the Gulf of Mexico , but the blowout and enormous environmental damage in the southern states has completely changed its external image and its own ambitions . There has been speculation since the Deepwater Horizon accident in April that BP could find itself persona non grata , particularly in sensitive environmental regions such as the Arctic . BP 's current interests around the Arctic region are centred on Alaska , but there has been extensive speculation that the company is in talks with rivals such as Apache to sell these off in a desperate attempt to raise cash to pay for expected oil-spill liabilities of more than $ 30bn . Cairn 's announcement that it had struck gas this week reinforced the views of the US Geological Survey which said last year that it believed there could be 90bn barrels of oil and 50tn cubic metres of gas in the wider Arctic region . There will be another round of bidding for drilling off Greenland next year and the year after , but BP 's reverse this week shows that it will be difficult for the firm to secure future exploration licences in the area . Environmentalists are particularly nervous about plans to open up Arctic seas for exploration because the cold conditions would make a spill far more damaging . Last month a report by US government scientists concluded that a quarter of the 4.9 m barrels of oil estimated to have been spilled in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico had evaporated or dissolved . Oil spilled in the Arctic would be far harder to disperse and break down . Despite the Deepwater Horizon disaster , major oil companies BP included still hope to begin drilling in the Arctic off the coast of North America soon . Barack Obama opened up US waters there to exploration shortly before the Deepwater Horizon explosion , but suspended the plans while investigations into the disaster took place .

Photograph : Reuters BP is still standing , but the Gulf of Mexico oil spill has changed the company forever . It could have been far worse . In June , some City analysts doubted whether BP could survive the crisis . Shares had plunged by more than half . Within the space of a few weeks , the official estimate of the amount of oil flowing into the Gulf had increased from 5,000 barrels to anywhere between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels per day . The company 's repeated attempts to stop the flow had failed and August the earliest the first relief well could be drilled seemed a lifetime away . The chief executive , Tony Hayward who has since resigned and BP 's chairman were summoned to meet Barack Obama at the White House . They were forced to scrap plans to pay shareholders a dividend and instead to set aside $ 20bn to pay damages to those affected . While the battle to stop the leak is over , the legal battle is only just beginning . BP will fight tooth and nail against accusations that it was grossly negligent . If the charge stands , it faces fines of up to $ 21bn . BP would n't be able to pass off other costs , such as the clean-up and damages , to its partners . With investigations by the Department of Justice , among others , only just beginning , US lawyers say it will take years to decide who was to blame for the accident and the full level of BP 's liabilities . The company is already selling $ 30bn worth of assets to meet its costs from the spill so far . What executives are labeling `` Future BP '' will be a much smaller company shorn of much of its presence around the world . If investigations decide it has been grossly negligent , many more asset sales will be necessary . BP argues that whatever happens , it is in the US 's interests that it survives so it can meet all its liabilities . But it may be some time before it can afford to resume paying bumper dividends , which normally make up more than one-tenth of all payouts by UK companies .

Fishermen fear that the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico will cause longterm harm to their industry . Photograph : Patrick Semansky\\/AP High tide , and the remains of a late summer storm , and it is hard to tell on this strip of land between the Mississippi and the marsh where land ends and water begins . It was here in the most southerly reaches of Louisiana on terrain that is slowly sliding into the sea that oil from BP 's Macondo well first started coming ashore , about a week after the 20 April explosion on the Deepwater Horizon . Eleven men were killed when the drilling platform blew up . And it is here where local people will take the most convincing that the worst of the oil spill is behind them and that recovery is under way . Barack Obama 's point man on the spill , the US Coast Guard 's former commander , Thad Allen , said at the weekend that the well no longer posed any threat to the Gulf . Crews will begin the last few remaining operations needed to abandon the well this week . People here live and die by the water . On a fine day the docks in Venice empty out , with seaworthy boats and able-bodied crew off to look for oil contamination , at sea and in the marsh grass . No one , it seems , believes the assurances from the White House or government scientists that the oil is largely gone . And no one really believes BP when oil company executives say they will stay in Louisiana for the long haul . They have seen one exodus already , just before Tropical Storm Bonnie blew through , about a week after the well was capped in mid-July . BP evacuated work crews and boats ; many have not returned . `` Oh , the oil 's out there , '' said a captain of one of the air boats chewing through the marsh . When the water is clear the oil pops out like a giant black teardrop . He said the air boats were carrying away up to 3,000 white plastic trash bags of oiled sand from a nearby section of marsh each day . `` We 'll be here for at least a year if they still want us , that is . '' The autumn shrimping season opened on schedule on 16 August and the authorities have steadily been opening up more of the Gulf for fishing . About 83 % of US waters in the Gulf are now open for fishing . The first tests on shrimp , swordfish and tuna hauled out of the Gulf showed no traces of oil . But Acy Cooper , who wears a shrimpers ' white rubber boots even on days when he is not fishing , is possessed by a powerful sense of dread . How can we know for sure that the shrimp is safe from crude or its toxic components ? He has seen oil in certain shrimping areas . `` We are only going to get one shot at this . If we do n't do it right , we are going to be in big trouble if any tainted shrimp gets on the market , '' he said . `` We do n't want to get anything on the market that is going to kill us in the long run . '' Not even the most stringent testing can ensure that fishermen stay out of oiled waters not when some fishermen have been out of work since late April . `` Some people are so hungry they are going to do what they can to survive , '' Cooper said . Already the local economy is being transformed . On noticeboards , cards for mental health services and lawyers offering to sue BP are tacked on top of advertisements for fishing guides . It is getting harder to find a market for fish . The other day George Barisich , the head of the United Commercial Fishermen 's Alliance , had to drive all the way into Mississippi before he could find a processor who wanted his shrimp . He said he was reduced to selling for just $ 1.40 -LRB- 90p -RRB- per pound . Officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency have been on local radio shows , such as Talk of the Bayou , trying to persuade fishermen like Cooper they have nothing to fear . `` So far we have n't seen a bit of evidence the oil is getting real deep in the marsh , '' said Jacqueline Michel , a NOAA biochemist . Only 22 of the 2,000 water samples taken from the Gulf contained traces of oil , and none has permeated deep into the wetlands , which are breeding grounds for shrimp . The callers were not buying it , and neither was Cooper . He worries that the last few months may have ruined the fisherman 's life for some . Although local people complain that BP gave too many jobs to outsiders rather than locals for cleanup work , some taken on have become used to earning good money even when they were waiting around at the marina on the oil company 's `` vessels of opportunity '' program for the cleanup . Cooper is worried they may give up on shrimping , now that it 's such an uncertain occupation . `` We are on the verge of losing this industry , '' he said . `` The chain is broken with the vessels of opportunity . '' For Al Sunseri that chain stretches back to 1876 when his family set up the P&J Oyster Company on the edges of New Orleans ' French quarter . He still turns up for work at 4.30 am , but there are no workers shucking oysters on the loading dock . Eleven people have been let go . Premium oysters are a vanishing commodity . Those oysters not killed by the oil were finished off by the Louisiana government 's decision to flood the Gulf with fresh water to try to keep the oil offshore . Sunseri now occupies his time taking orders on a clipboard , trying to mollify the desperate chefs who are his main customer base . He is running dangerously low on shucked oysters . He asks callers if they could get by with a smaller order . `` I am just going to have to tell people I do n't have them and that is not something that I am used to doing , '' he said . The shortage has pushed the price of oysters in the shell up 40 % since the spill . That is too rich in the depths of a recession even for a luxury product . Sunseri also worries that what oysters he can find are of variable quality . `` I know they say about 40 % of the oyster growing area is open but as far as productive areas , it is maybe about 15 % , '' he said . `` We do n't have babies , and we do n't have the market-sized ones . '' He moves over to a tabletop display of oyster shells . Those that are being harvested are about half normal size . `` These would ordinarily not be harvested for another year , '' he said . `` They really should be in there developing . The few little oysters that I am selling right now are really inferior . '' Even industry cheerleader Mike Voisin , who chairs the Louisiana Oyster Task Force , admits it will be three years before the oyster beds resettle . Until then , he says , the harvest will probably fall to half of the usual 113,000 tonne annual take . The timespan is depressing for Sunseri . He said he is telling his children : `` Your daddy does not care if this business fizzles away . Do n't feel the burden of carrying this on . '' For Ryan Lambert , who once counted himself the biggest fishing charter operator around Venice , such acceptance is unthinkable . He is much too angry to be resigned . The spill left him with a calendar showing week after week of canceled bookings , gutting a business that once brought in $ 1.3 m a year . By BP 's reckoning though , his losses were just $ 66,000 . He said he has paid his accountant hundreds of dollars to meet BP 's demands for documentation . `` I should n't have to fight for the money that is owed me , '' he said . `` I am not the bad guy here . They are the ones who ruined it for me , not vice versa . For me to have to fight for them to pay me for what they did makes me sick . '' He is also worried sick that the fish will start disappearing , as they did in the years after the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska , and that his business will be dealt a slow , painful death . He built his company from scratch , starting from his love of bass fishing ; now his clients troop into his fishing lodge from all across the country . He rebuilt once before , after Hurricane Katrina . He is not sure he can do it again , or wait for the Gulf to make a full recovery . `` I am 52 years old . I ca n't wait 20 years for them to clean things up . '' He feels certain BP will pull out much sooner . `` The well will be stopped , and then they will hang around until the oil stops coming up on the beaches , and then they will be gone , '' he said . `` Anything they do n't clean will be left to me and the microbes and Mother Nature until all of a sudden we wo n't be America 's best fishery any more . `` This will be history some day , and I will still have that problem . '' ` On television they are saying all the time that there is no oil . What BP did is that they succeeded in buying off the White House and Congress and most of the senators , and now they are buying off the networks ' ` The oil is still very in the coastal areas , it 's still coming up along the beaches , and it 's in the bottom offshore as well as in the bays and estuaries .

The species is at risk because of habitat loss , say conservationists . Photograph : Robert F. Sisson\\/NG\\/Getty Images One of the world 's smallest seahorses faces extinction because of the BP oil spill , conservationists have warned . The minute creatures , barely 2cm tall , were elusive even before the spill , found only among the seagrass in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico . Now conservationists from the Zoological Society of London 's Project Seahorse team are warning populations could fall precipitously because so much of their habitat could have been lost to the spill . `` We have very high levels of concern for this particular species because they have a narrower range , '' said Heather Masonjones , a seahorse biologist at the University of Tampa . Although most seahorses are believed to live in shallow water , some also cling to the seagrass mats that float in the open water . During the three months that oil was gushing from BP 's well , these mats become collection points for crude . Some of these were set alight in burn fields as BP tried to stop the oil washing on shore . Furthermore , thick clouds of oil in water typically starve seagrass of the light they need to survive , while toxic components of the oil as well as the millions of gallons of chemical dispersants used to break down the spill could also be shrinking suitable habitat for seahorses . The dwarf seahorses , or Hippocampus zosterae , are particularly ill-suited to escape . They are poor swimmers , making the species extremely vulnerable to a sudden environmental impact such as the BP spill , said Heather Koldewey , the associate director of Project Seahorse . They also mate for life , and produce relatively few offspring , making it more difficult for them to recover from a cataclysmic event . Masonjones said the experience of earlier oil spills suggested it could take five years for seagrass to make a complete recovery , which represents about three generations of seahorses . It is also unclear how dispersants , which can be hormone disrupters , will affect reproduction cycles , especially on seahorses where males carry the eggs . Koldewey said it was crucial that BP take steps to help protect the seagrass in the oil spill clean-up in the months ahead to avoid further damage to seahorse populations : `` We are urging BP to continue to use booms in the clean-up to isolate the oil slicks . These can be skimmed , left to evaporate , or treated with biological agents like fertilisers , which promote the growth of micro-organisms that biodegrade oil .

BP 's report today attempts to spread the blame for the disaster . Photograph : Lee Celano\\/Reuters `` The well is blowing out ... -LRB- one of the technicians -RRB- is shutting it in now . '' That call was made aboard the Deepwater oil rig at 21.45 on 20 April , but was fatally optimistic . Within four minutes , two giant explosions had set the rig ablaze , killing 11 people and injuring 17 more . The `` nightmare well '' , as it had been dubbed by some workers , had become a real world horror . The minute-by-minute timeline in the report released by BP today , along with the astonishing catalogue of errors and failures the report details , paints a vivid picture of both the terror of that night on the rig and the extraordinary lapses in safety . The catastrophe , which led to the spilling of five million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , began some time before 19.55 local time , deep below the sea . Oil and gas started forcing its way into the well bore , breaching a cement barrier . Without naming the cement contractor , Halliburton , the BP investigators made their opinion clear : `` There were weaknesses in cement design and testing , quality assurance and risk assessment . '' Two further barriers , in the so-called `` shoe track '' at the base of the well , then failed as the intense pressure of the hydrocarbons came to bear on them . Next came perhaps the most crucial mistake . Pressure readings were taken on the well to determine whether it was under control , but despite `` anomalies '' the test was considered `` good '' . BP 's report accepts some of the responsibility but also blames the Transocean rig crew for reaching the `` incorrect view that the test was successful '' . That was at 19.55 , and all must have seemed well on the rig , but below their feet the storm was gathering . The report estimates that at 21.38 , hydrocarbons burst through the well and into the riser , the pipe leading up to the rig . Within three minutes , mud had shot up through the derrick on the rig , the first warning blast , and from here events unfolded at breakneck speed . As the mud spurted , a valve was closed diverting the flow to a device that separated mud from gas - another crucial mistake . This brought the full force of the blown well directly onto the rig , rather than venting it overboard . At 21.45 , as mud was `` raining down on the deck '' and the well pressure was trebling , the call was made to shut the well . In the following minutes , high pressure gas was discharging towards the deck , vibrating the huge rig . The sirens of one gas alarm after another went off , and the drill pipe pressure rose another fivefold . By 21.49 , just four minutes after the call to shut the well was made , the rig was plunged into darkness as all power was lost . The darkness of the Gulf night lasted just five seconds . A huge explosion hit the rig followed by another one 10 seconds later . The fate of Deepwater , and the biggest offshore oil spill in history , was set . Those four minutes contained another series of terrible failures . The bursting of gas and oil into the wellbore pushed up pressure readings 40 minutes earlier , but it was 40 minutes before any action was taken . Once again , the BP report blames the rig crew - Transocean . Next was the decision to route the flow of the hydrocarbons onto the rig , to the mud gas separator . Without that decision , `` there may have been more time to respond , and the consequences of the accident may have been reduced '' says the BP report . The onslaught of hydrocarbons overwhelmed the separator and allowed them to burst into parts of the rig that were not designed to suppress electrical sparks , via the heating , ventilation and air-conditioning systems , with explosive consequences . At 21.52 , the Mayday call went out , as the rig crew tried to ensure the blowout preventer - the 450-tonne set of valves on the sea floor and the ultimate failsafe - was in operation . As they did , 115 people began to leave the rig by a nearby ship . The coastguard were at the rig by 23.22 . Eleven hours later the rig sank and oil began to pour into the gulf . The failure of the blowout preventer was the final , catastrophic lapse . BP 's report found that the explosions and fire on the rig very likely disabled the `` emergency disconnect sequence '' , the primary emergency response that was supposed the seal the well . An automatic system , meant to kick in if power from the rig was lost , also failed , for the prosaic and appalling reason that the batteries in one control pod were flat and a crucial valve in the other was faulty . Two days later , the Macondo well delivered the final insult . Robot submarines had made it to the seabed and operated the shear valve that was meant to seal the well . Transocean 's response to BP 's report has been scathing : `` This is a self-serving report that attempts to conceal the critical factor that set the stage for the Macondo incident : BP 's fatally flawed well design . In both its design and construction , BP made a series of cost-saving decisions that increased risk in some cases , severely . '' Stephen Davis was on board Deepwater and told the Guardian in May about his memory of that night of chaos : the sensation of being flung five metres into a wall by a powerful explosion , the desperate , muddy scramble on a deck lit only by the reflections from a huge pillar of flame ; the look in men 's eyes before they jumped 18 metres -LRB- 60ft -RRB- into the water . `` You could taste the fumes , that godawful taste in your mouth . It was hard to breathe . The oxygen was being sucked out of the living quarters . Then all of a sudden just boom . It was the biggest explosion I ever heard in my life . '' `` The whole rig was vibrating and shaking , '' he said . `` It 's like we walked straight into hell .

The company is expected to admit it is partly to blame for the disaster , but will also claim that other companies must accept some responsibility . The explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon rig on 20 April killed 11 workers and began a devastating spill which leaked over 4 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico the largest spill in American history . The leak took three months , and a huge variety of different attempts -LRB- see interactive -RRB- , to seal before BP finally closed it off on 15 July . The ruptured oil well is still not permanently sealed , with the company announcing last week it will be two weeks before the leak is closed off for good . The leak was only allowed to occur when the blow-out preventer the last line of defense against an out of control well failed to activate after the explosion above the surface . Today 's report will examine why it failed , following an internal investigation into the events leading up to the explosion nearly five months ago . In July it was revealed that the blow-out preventer was modified in China in 2005 . Our team of experts will be poring over the BP report as soon as it is released , with key sections being reported and analyzed here . We 'll also have the latest reaction from the global markets and from other companies potentially implicated in the spill . Follow the latest here and offer us your response below . My colleague Graeme Wearden writes this morning that shares in BP rose by around 1 % this morning to 412p ahead of the report 's publication . City analysts Evolution Securities said the investigation could shift culpability towards Transocean which operated the Deepwater Horizon rig on BP 's behalf and `` in particular the integrity of the blowout preventer which should have acted as the ultimate fail safe '' , Graeme reports . BP also received good news from Fitch this morning , which raised its credit rating on BP to A , from BBB , with a stable outlook . Fitch said that it was now more confident that the well was capped permanently . `` The `` A '' rating also reflects both the improved visibility of potential liability scenarios the company could still face and substantial payments that BP has made to date in building up liquidity to address potential financial payments , '' Fitch added . `` The investigation found that no single factor caused the Macondo well tragedy , '' is BP 's findings in short . `` Rather , a sequence of failures involving a number of different parties led to the explosion and fire which killed 11 people and caused widespread pollution in the Gulf of Mexico earlier this year . '' Some links on how to find information on the report : cents Or download the report in full : -LRB- pdf , opens -RRB- Terry Macalister , our energy editor , says a first glance at the BP report confirms expectations that the company would argue that `` multiple failures '' by a number of different parties were to blame for the fatal blowout . The report points the finger at Transocean -LRB- the rig operator -RRB- and Halliburton -LRB- the well contractor -RRB- as being as much to blame for the disaster as BP . The oil company always claimed to have been unfairly singled out by US politicians and now claims to have the proof that others should be held to account also . Damian Carrington , the Guardian 's head of environment , writes : As well as very clearly seeking to spread the blame , the end of BP 's press release notes that its report is based on `` information available to the investigating team '' . Once again , it turns the focus on its contractors : `` Additional relevant information may be forthcoming , for example , when Halliburton 's samples of the cement used in the well are released for testing and when the rig 's blow-out preventer -LRB- owned and operated by Transocean -RRB- is fully examined now that it has been recovered from the sea-bed . '' The Guardian 's Nick Fletcher is following the reaction in the financial world to the report . Shares in BP , which rose this morning , have risen again , he writes . The stock market seems to like BP 's plan to share out the blame for the Gulf spillage , judging by the initial reaction . The company 's shares - already up 6.75 p at 413.55 p immediately ahead of the report 's release - have made further gains now the findings are out . They currently stand at 414.95 p , up 8.15 p or 2 % . But the market is in a jittery mood and there is no guarantee that things will stay the same once investors have had time to digest the full report . And it is worth bearing in mind BP 's shares were at 650p ahead of the disaster on April 20 . Below the line , bombed writes : `` I 'm curious , who hired these other companies to work with BP ? Was it BP themselves or some authority overseeing the whole endeavor ? '' RealPol has the answer : `` BP , through the tender process usually . '' More from Terry Macalister on BP 's efforts to share the blame : Tony Hayward , the BP chief executive , puts part of the blame directly on to US contractor Halliburton -LRB- whose former chief executive was previous US vice president , Dick Cheney -RRB- which did the `` cementing '' of the Macondo well . `` To put it simply , there was a bad cement job , '' said Hayward in a statement which conflicts with a previously published email from a Halliburton employee on the rig to a colleague saying the job `` went well . '' BP also takes blame away from itself over the `` design '' of the well . `` It would appear unlikely that the well design contributed to the incident , '' argues Hayward .

You can either comment below the line or get in touch on Twitter : @adamgabbatt BP 's executive summary -LRB- pdf , opens -RRB- lists eight main issues that led to the Deepwater disaster , killing 11 people and injuring 17 . Damian Carrington has been reading the findings . `` It is , frankly speaking , quite terrifying a catalogue of appalling shoddiness , '' he writes . Damian has simplified BP 's eight findings below : 1 - The cement that was supposed to stop the oil and gas shooting up the well pipe did n't work - the report blames the type of cement used 2 - Futher barriers at the bottom of the drill pipe failed to stop the hydrocarbons bursting into the well pipe 3 - Amazingly , a pressure test performed to see if the well was under control was accepted despite the readings showing the well was not under control 4 - With oil and gas now pouring up the well , it took 40 minutes to realize this 5 - Once it was realized , the hydrocarbons were not diverted `` overboard '' but brought onto the rig 6 - This meant the hydrocarbons `` vented directly onto the rig '' - a frightening image 7 - The fire prevention system on the rig failed . `` The heating , ventilation and air conditioning system probably transferred a gas-rich mixture into the engine rooms '' . That 's where it probably caught fire and destroyed the rig 8 - Key point - the blowout preventer , the ultimate failsafe failed . The fire on the rig stopped the BOP being operated , while an automated system failed in part because the BOP had flat batteries in one control pod and a faulty solenoid valve in another BP is likely to have had its legal liability for the Deepwater disaster uppermost in its mind and the executive summary bears that out : of the four and half pages of text , the first page is entirely disclaimers of one sort or another . If BP was shown to have been `` grossly negligent '' then the financial penalties ramp up vastly . Terry Macalister wonders what the report suggests re safety practices across the rest of the oil industry : What is really shocking about this report is the catalogue of errors - both human and mechanical . They demolish once and for all the oil industry 's much quoted mantra that `` safety always comes first . '' It may come first in the board room but it does not down at the wellhead where the real dangers are faced . It is worth remembering that BP , its rig operator Transocean and the main well contractor Halliburton are the blue chip companies in the wider oil and gas sector . If the shoddy work practices highlighted here are what the best-in-class do , then what is happening in the lower reaches of this industry ? More financial reaction from Nick Fletcher : The US market is not open yet for reaction , but Transocean 's Swiss quoted shares are down nearly 1.5 % following the release of the BP report suggesting the drilling contractor missed danger signs on the Deepwater Horizon rig . Meanwhile BP itself has slipped from its best levels but is still up 1.7 % at 413.7 p. Damian Carrington emails : `` Reaction to the BP report is starting to flow , and it 's not going to be pretty . '' This is from Jim Footner , head of Greenpeace 's energy campaign . `` This report is a sorry catalogue of the gaffes and failures behind the Deepwater Horizon disaster . And it 's highly likely that a truly independent report would be even more damning for BP . `` Worryingly , they 're just weeks away from drilling at similar depths in UK waters . The Government must step in right now and stop this by introducing a moratorium on deep water drilling . `` But the real problem is our addiction to oil , which is pushing companies like BP to put lives and the environment at risk . The age of oil is coming to an end and companies like BP will be left behind unless they begin to adapt now . The time has come to move beyond oil and invest in clean energy . '' Our US environment correspondent , Suzanne Goldenberg , has been speaking to Alfred R Sunsen owner of New Orleans oyster company P&J , which is now facing ruin after 134 years in business . Sunsen said he believes the report was `` pretty thorough '' , although points out that BP said it carried out the report with limited access to physical evidence . The oyster business owner writes : The report does not address the people , businesses , animals , or natural resources that have been impacted by the disaster and will be dealing with the consequences of their inadequate and slow response to the disaster . Me as well as my friends in the oyster business in Louisiana are in big trouble and will be for some time to come Talk is cheap . When BP shows me a report of how exactly they will deal with those people most impacted by this tragedy , i.e. those in the fisheries related businesses , I 'll believe they are not just using their talents in public relations to dispel their liability , but have a plan to help us salvage our businesses and retain our livelihoods and heritage , by paying our bills until we are `` made whole '' as Mr Hayward and Mr Obama said months ago . Suzanne has just arrived at the Washington DC hotel where Mark Bly BP 's head of safety and operations is giving a briefing . You can follow her tweets from the meeting @suzyji cents BP has released the findings of its investigation into the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . The company has listed eight different issues which let to the Deepwater disaster , including that a test performed to see if the well was under control was accepted despite the readings showing the well was not under control . cents The company has , as expected , sought to share the blame for the explosion and spill . In a press release accompanying the report Tony Hayward , BP 's outgoing chief executive , said : `` To put it simply , there was a bad cement job . '' It was US contractor Halliburton which cemented of the Macondo well . cents The report also points the finger at Transocean , which operated the Deepwater Horizon oil rig . `` The negative pressure test was accepted when it should not have been -LRB- see top bullet-point -RRB- , there were failures in well control procedures and in the blow-out preventer ; and the rig 's fire and gas system did not prevent ignition , '' Hayward said . cents Greenpeace has criticised BP , describing the report as a `` sorry catalogue of gaffes and failures '' . Jim Footner , head of the charity 's energy campaign , said : `` It 's highly likely that a truly independent report would be even more damning for BP . '' He added that the company are `` weeks away '' from drilling at similar depths in UK waters . cents BP 's share price rose after the report was published , with shares up by 2 % half an hour after publication . Later this afternoon the share price had fallen slightly but was still up 1.7 % , at 413.7 p. However this is a long way from the 650p BP 's shares were trading at before the disaster on 20 April . No response from the White House yet to the report , although President Obama 's press secretary Robert Gibbs was asked about it in yesterday 's press briefing . Gibbs appears to say that the US government had not seen a copy of the report , which seems strange . Here 's the exchange : Q : BP is going to release its report tomorrow into the causes of the oil spill . Has the White House had an advance look at this ? And secondly , given the past relationship between the administration and the company , what level of confidence do you have that this is going to produce a genuine finding into what caused the accident ? Gibbs : Well , look , I 'll say this . I know of no one that has seen it here . I 've certainly seen emails alluding to the notion that -- and clips alluding to the notion that this is -- this will be released . Obviously I think we 'd want a chance to look at the report . I think an important partner of that investigation , Stephen , ultimately is going to get -- is going to be a look at the blowout preventer itself , which only recently , in the last few days , has been brought to the surface , and will give us a chance to see whether was this a design flaw , was this something that was just a problem that this blowout preventer had to deal with , and a whole host of things . So we 'll certainly look through the report . Obviously -- look through the report and may have some comment about it . But I do not know of anybody who has seen an advance copy . Damian Carrington on BP 's report into the Deepwater Horizon explosion `` It 's a pretty terrifying picture for a drilling operation that was supposed to be failsafe , '' Damian says . Terry Macalister has sent me what he says could be the key section in BP 's report . The final sentence reiterates BP 's main argument `` multiple companies '' were involved in the failure . `` The team -LRB- investigating the explosion -RRB- did not identify any single action or inaction that caused this accident . Rather , a complex and interlinked series of mechanical failures , human judgments , engineering design , operational implementation and team interfaces came together to allow the initiation and escalation of the accident . Multiple companies , work teams and circumstances were involved over time . '' Transocean has accused BP of attempting to `` conceal '' its own failings in today 's report , and says the company `` made a series of cost-saving decisions that increased risk '' during the drilling . Transocean owned and operated the Deepwater Horizon rig , and is one of the two companies which BP 's report says are also responsible for the explosion . However the company says it was BP 's `` fatally flawed well design '' which set the stage for the incident . It says cost-cutting by BP contributed to the increasing of risk in the design and construction of the Macondo well . Transocean also appears to hint that BP is holding up its own report into the Deepwater disaster by failing to release evidence . Here 's the statement in full , courtesy of my colleague Graeme Wearden . `` This is a self-serving report that attempts to conceal the critical factor that set the stage for the Macondo incident : BP 's fatally flawed well design . In both its design and construction , BP made a series of cost-saving decisions that increased risk in some cases , severely . Those decisions , made exclusively by BP , included : cents Using a long production string rather than a casing tie back , decreasing the number of barriers to gas flow . cents Neglecting to run a cement bond log -LRB- CBL -RRB- to test the integrity of the cement . cents Installing fewer than one third of the recommended number of centralizers , dramatically increasing the risk of cement channelling and gas flow . cents Failing to conduct a complete `` bottoms up '' circulation of the well to insure the quality of the cement seal . cents Not running a lockdown sleeve to secure the production string to the well head , eliminating yet another barrier to a blowout . Transocean 's investigation is ongoing , and will be concluded when all of the evidence is in , including the critical information the company has requested of BP but has yet to receive . '' Graeme adds that Wall Street is now open , and says Transocean 's shares are actually up in early trading , so far gaining 1.5 % in New York . `` Cameron International , which made the blowout preventer that failed to stop the leak , are also up nearly 1.7 % . Halliburton has taken a hit , though , down around 0.3 % , '' Graeme said . `` BP 's own shares are currently up around 1.5 % in London . So traders are taking this report in their stride , so far ... '' The publication of BP 's report is headline news on many US news websites . Because of its authorship , the report is unlikely to carry much weight in influencing the Department of Justice , which is considering criminal and civil charges related to the spill . The report is , however , as much a public relations exercise as a preview of BP 's probable legal strategy as it prepares to defend itself against possible federal charges , penalties and hundreds of pending lawsuits . WWL-TV , a news channel based in Louisiana , one of the states affected by the spill , said BP had `` spread the blame around '' , but pointed out that `` in public hearings , it had already tried to shift some of the blame to rig owner Transocean Ltd. and cement contractor Halliburton '' . BP 's report is far from the final word on possible causes of the explosion , as several divisions of the U.S. government , including the Justice Department , Coast Guard and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement , are also investigating . Suzanne Goldenberg has spoken with Wayne Pennington , head of the geological engineering department at Michigan Technical University . Pennington notes that BP 's finger pointing at Halliburton and Transocean still leaves important questions unanswered about the safety decisions it took itself : While blame for some errors can perhaps be assigned to the contractors working for BP , the blowout and subsequent explosion and spillage appear to the result of an overall attitude that encouraged unwarranted optimism in the quality of each component of the job , allowing the omission of standard testing procedures , and the misinterpretation of other tests in the most-favorable light . Instead , skepticism should reign on any drilling job , and testing and evaluation at each stage of the drilling and completion would then be routine ; instead of questioning the need for such things as the cement bond log , the companies involved should insist on checking and double-checking quality at each step of the process . This was clearly not done , repeatedly , in the case of the Macondo well , and disaster resulted . Damian Carrington emails regarding Transocean 's response -LRB- see 3.28 pm -RRB- to BP 's findings : OK bear with me on this one it 's a key bit of finger-pointing between Transocean and BP . Transocean , the rig operators , say the decision was made `` exclusively by BP '' to install `` fewer than one third of the recommended number of centralizers , dramatically increasing the risk of cement channeling and gas flow '' . To translate , centralisers keep the bore hole in shape while the cement is poured in , allowing it to form a better seal . Transocean accuse BP of cost-cutting . BP says in its report that modelling showed that using 21 centralizers could reduce the chances of a leak . The equipment they were using had only six centralizers , so they got another 15 sent to the rig . But `` the BP Macondo well team erroneously believed that they had received the wrong centralizers . They decided not to use the 15 centralizers due to a concern that these ... could fail . '' So on this key point , BP appears to accept that its team made the mistake . A 5pm -LRB- or thereabouts -RRB- summary : cents BP 's report into the Deepwater Horizon explosion lists eight separate findings which contributed to the blast . The company admits some culpability ; that some of its staff misinterpreted readings regarding the pressure in the well , and that BP workers only used six centralisers which keep the well bore hole in shape and reduce the chances of a leak when BP had intended them to use 21 . cents Although it admitted some responsibility , the company has sought to share the blame , mentioning Transocean and Halliburton as also at fault . BP listed a number of failures committed onboard the rig , which was operated by Transocean . Outgoing BP chief exec Tony Hayward also said today : `` To put it simply , there was a bad cement job . '' It was the contractor Halliburton which cemented of the Macondo well . cents Transocean has struck back this afternoon however , accusing BP of trying to conceal its own failings in the report . It says the company `` made a series of cost-saving decisions that increased risk '' during the design and construction of the well . Transocean also appears to hint that BP is holding up its own report into the Deepwater disaster by failing to release evidence . cents The financial world has so far reacted positively to the report , with BP shares in London up 1.3 % at closing . Share price closed at 412.15 p , up 5.35 p on the day . In the US Cameron International and Transocean are currently around 2 % higher than opening while even Halliburton down initially has recovered to show a 1.5 % increase . That 's all from me in London , but stay tuned , my colleague Richard Adams will shortly be taking over to cover the rest of the day 's developments from the US . 5.30 pm : Good afternoon , this is Richard Adams in the Guardian 's Washington DC bureau , taking over from Adam 's excellent work . The US media is still getting its collective head around the BP report but reaction is starting to trickle out , although so far it 's mainly just straight news coverage of the report . If nothing else this will be more grist for the Onion , along the lines of : `` BP report clears BP of BP oil rig disaster '' . Except that would n't be satire . The Onion 's previous effort `` Massive flow of bullshit continues to gush from BP headquarters '' has been so popular that the satirical website is selling a framed print of that week 's front page . Yours for just $ 44 . 5.37 pm : One US outlet that is taking the BP report very seriously indeed is , as you might expect , is the New Orleans Times-Picayune . And its verdict is savage . The Times-Picayune has top reporter David Hammer on the case , writing : In the 193-page report ... the British oil giant sought to spread some of the blame to its contractors , rig owner Transocean and cementing firm Halliburton . Throughout the Gulf oil spill , BP 's high-ranking officials have touted what they call the firm 's culture of safety and responsibility . But that self-proclaimed culture of safety is not what 's reflected in the shortcuts BP engineers took on the Deepwater Horizon rig , ignoring warnings and leading to the death of 11 workers and the worst oil spill in the nation 's history . 5.50 pm : My hard-working colleague Damian Carrington is polishing off a blockbuster analysis of where BP is putting the blame , which will appear on the Guardian 's site soon I 'll link to the article as soon as it 's up . But in the meantime , here 's a sneak preview from Damian : The eight big things that went wrong are , engineers tell me , a logical and plausible explanation . But who 's fault were they , according to BP ? My explanations are below , but to cut to the chase , the BP report appears to pin 4.5 of the 8 problems on Transocean , 1 on Halliburton and 1.5 on BP , with one undecided . More to come on this . 6.10 pm : Of course , some people cynics mainly , hippies and so on are n't convinced by BP 's own report -LRB- although if you ca n't believe a giant , profit-seeking multinational corporation , who can you believe ? -RRB- . Those sort of people would probably prefer to get their information from an independent source . In that case you really should read this sterling and lengthy analysis published in the Times-Picayune : BP 's Gulf drilling manager , David Sims , acknowledged in testimony that `` every conversation , every decision has a cost factor . '' E-mail messages and reports by BP engineers in the weeks before the accident make reference to money or time savings as they debated methods for closing the well . In each case , they went the cheaper way . 6.39 pm : Insightful commentary from Geoffrey Maitland , professor of energy engineering at Imperial College in London and an expert in the field . He says the report gave an analysis of the disaster that would not surprise anyone in the oil industry but `` it tries to put the best light on it for BP , as you 'd expect for an internal report which will play a part in legal actions in the future . '' `` What is not there is interesting . BP says the well design was not a factor . Transocean say it is and I think Halliburton think the same . '' Prof Maitland notes that a preliminary report by the US Congress back in June raised six points about well design but that very few of those are addressed in BP 's report : `` The BP report gives lots of detail but it does not give the detail needed on how the decisions were taken in the critical areas and how the decision making was shared . '' `` You will get the lawyers playing some very clever games about which path to take through the maze of cause and effect , depending on who their client is . '' 7pm : Halliburton has finally put out an official response to BP 's report and the signs are that it is going to come out swinging . This is from Cathy Mann , director of corporate affairs at Halliburton : As we continue to review BP 's internal report published earlier today , we have noticed a number of substantial omissions and inaccuracies in the document . Halliburton remains confident that all the work it performed with respect to the Macondo well was completed in accordance with BP 's specifications for its well construction plan and instructions , and that it is fully indemnified under its contract for any of the allegations contained in the report . Deepwater operations are inherently complex and a number of contractors are involved which routinely make recommendations to a single point of contact , the well owner . The well owner is responsible for designing the well program and any testing related to the well . Contractors do not specify well design or make decisions regarding testing procedures as that responsibility lies with the well owner . I 'll stick my neck out here and say that sounds like a longer version of `` We 'll see you in court '' . The report says : `` The BOP maintenance records were not accurately reported in the maintenance management system . The condition of critical components in the yellow and blue -LRB- control -RRB- pods and the use of a non - -LRB- original -RRB- part , which were discovered after the pods were recovered , suggest the lack of a robust Transocean maintenance management system . '' BP 's verdict : Transocean to blame Strangely enough , Transocean are to blame for five of the eight big problem areas , according to BP . But of course , it was BP that hired Transocean ... 8pm : The FT 's Lex columnists think the report was a generally good thing for BP to have done , on the grounds that : `` At least BP has spoken first . It can now get ahead of its peers in improving rig safety . '' That would be BP 's peers who have n't had a giant oil spill disaster . The FT has been reliably pro-BP throughout the entire Gulf spill , and that has n't changed based on today 's Lex note -LRB- which may be behind a paywall -RRB- : BP has never sought to dodge its responsibilities ; hence the prompt decision to write an unlimited clean-up cheque $ 8bn so far . Still , the company would like to avoid falling into the expensive legal hell that would come with the finding of `` gross negilgence '' . The report , in essence , is a defense against that charge . It presents a credible narrative that suggests an unfortunate concatenation of errors , each more serious than the last , from many actors , rather than one single big mistake . The narrative may be credible , but is the source ? 8.27 pm : The industry reaction in the US appears to pick out BP 's focus on the cement used in the well as a significant cause of the blow-out . FuelFix , the energy blog at the Houston Chronicle formerly known as NewsWatch Energy , has a sharp take : The BP investigators stressed eight problems and failures that may have culminated with the April 20 rig explosion that left 11 workers dead and triggered the nation 's worst offshore oil spill . But they repeatedly honed in on the failure of the cement job at the site , a focus that shifts attention to the work done by the cement contractor Halliburton . So , it was the cement wot done it ? Not quite : `` Ultimately , though , the team said that a bad cement job , in and of itself , should n't have caused the lethal escape of natural gas from the well . '' 8.52 pm : One of BP 's most vocal and influential critics , Congressman Ed Markey , who chairs the House of Representatives 's energy and environment subcommittee , is also not impressed by BP 's effort : `` This report is not BP 's mea culpa . Of their own eight key findings , they only explicitly take responsibility for half of one . BP is happy to slice up blame , as long as they get the smallest piece . '' Markey says he 's still waiting to hear `` the real story of this disaster '' from the various independent inquiries taking place . 9.18 pm : There has been a reaction from the White House , although a rather low-key one . The White House press secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters that the administration was reviewing BP 's report but would continue with its own investigations : `` Our job is to find out what went wrong and hold those responsible ... for the damage that 's been done , and that 's what the administration will do . '' 9.45 pm : The aftershocks of the BP spill continue to be felt in Washington , especially at the government agency formerly known as the Minerals Management Service , which has suffered from staffing shortages and a cozy relationship with the oil industry . This afternoon the Obama administration announced it will spend $ 29m on training offshore drilling inspectors and upgrading enforcement this year , and another $ 100m next year . The agency hopes to hire hundreds of new inspectors to supplement the 60 responsible for overseeing 3,500 rigs and platforms in the Gulf of Mexico . 10pm : One question is , what other inquiries are there into the Gulf oil spill and Deepwater Horizon disaster ? There are about 11 others , believe it or not , but there are three that really count . Here 's a rundown of the big three : cents The Department of Justice and Environmental Protection Agency 's criminal investigation . This is the most important and the one that is most likely to lead to prosecutions and steep fines , assuming it 's not settled beforehand . cents The joint US Coast Guard-Bureau of Ocean Energy Management investigation . This is the federal investigation that has made the most progress and will be most influential within the government . cents The Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board . BP has ` previous ' in front of the CSB , which extensively investigated BP 's 2005 Texas City refinery explosion . High on credibility but low on its ability to punish the wrongdoers here , and could take two years to complete . 10.16 pm : The Houston Chronicle probably has stronger coverage of the US oil industry than any other US media outlet , because of the high concentration of the industry in the city . But it does n't pull any punches . Here 's business columnist Loren Steffy on the BP report . He says it 's deja vu all over again : Today 's Bly report follows a template established by the Mogford Report , issued a few months after the March 2005 explosion at BP 's Texas City refinery that killed 15 people . That report , too , placed blame far down the management chain , laying it at the feet of contract workers and mid-level managers . The article is tastefully illustrated with Britney Spears ' Oops ! ... I Did It Again artwork . 10.44 pm : The Christian Science Monitor has an interesting take on the report from an unnamed official : One observer familiar with the BP report , who asked not to be named because he is a member of a federal investigative commission , faulted it for not responding to key questions : `` Who was in charge at each step which employer and position , not which individual was involved in and responsible for making decisions about what specific equipment , materials , and especially procedures ? '' the observer said in an e-mail . `` What information would be provided to help or be a reference for the rig site personnel in implementing those decisions ? '' 10.57 pm : The New York Times weighs in with a detailed news piece : Among the report 's most significant conclusions , investigators say that the blowout came up the center of the pipe and not up the outside of the well casing , the area known as the annulus . If true , the finding is significant because it plays down the importance of certain BP decisions that have been criticized as negligent . One such decision was BP 's choice of a type of well casing that internal documents indicated the company knew was cheaper but riskier . Another such decision was BP 's use of fewer-than-advised centralizers , devices that are meant to keep the casing properly positioned . The report offers scant insight into why certain decisions were made and by whom questions that are likely to become important in coming legal battles . For example , the report does not say why the crew failed to notice that the well was flowing until it was too late . It does not clearly explain why the blowout preventer shear rams failed to seal the well when they were eventually closed after the explosion . 11.39 pm : Time to wrap things up for the night , since the latest commentary is either reheating the same points the report is all about BP 's looming legal defense or starting to get so wonky that you need a PhD in engineering to understand the discussion about flapper valves , annuluses -LRB- annuli ? -RRB- , shear rams and float collars . -LRB- Come to think of it , that sounds more like a nasty Craigslist personals ad . -RRB- Within BP the report might even be counted as a qualified success : some not-bad PR , some legal cover and , as AP reports , even a bump up in its share price : Energy stocks rose after Fitch Ratings raised its credit rating of BP . BP also released an internal report that largely spread blame from the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico to rig owner Transocean and contractor Halliburton as well as itself . Anyway , let 's leave the last word to the Guardian 's leader writers tonight : The curious effect of all this blame-shifting is that it provides the reader with a rare peek into the workings of the offshore-drilling industry and a very ugly sight it is too ... BP and the companies working for it are among the best in the business : just imagine how the cowboy outfits behave .

Photograph : Greenpeace\\/Reuters '' It 's not our accident , '' Tony Hayward said soon after the disastrous explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig . It was almost the most foolish thing BP 's chief executive said in the wake of the tragedy , since few hard facts were available at the time . The line was quickly dropped . Today , almost five months later , the company has given its considered opinion over 192 pages containing much dense technical detail : it was a shared accident . The report detailed eight causes , including `` a bad cement job '' , as Hayward put it . Halliburton mixed and installed the cement , so there is one partner to share the blame . Transocean 's crew on the rig failed to act quickly enough , according to the report , so there 's another . And BP put up its own hand on various scores . Those contractors have their own versions of the story to present and will inevitably dispute large chunks of these findings . The biggest area of contention is the design of the well . Transocean says that it was `` fatally flawed '' . BP says that it was n't . In the end , though , the only report that matters is the one produced by the official inquiry . But even if BP 's finding of `` multiple causes '' is accepted , that does not tell us whether the company will be found grossly negligent or merely negligent . Should BP have taken greater care in supervising the work of the contractors it appointed ? That is a critical question . Halliburton and Transocean are massive corporations , with years of experience in deepwater oil production , but neither held the licence to the Macondo well . Anyone who disagrees , and thinks today 's report provides greater clues to the negligence\\/gross negligence question , is free to speculate . The difference in cost to BP could be $ 30bn , a figure big enough to move the share price substantially . It 's hard to know what outcome is currently priced in , of course , but the shares themselves barely budged today they rose 1 % . The market 's snap reaction was clear enough : the report is welcome , fascinating and necessary , but does not provide all the answers .

Photograph : Toby Melville\\/REUTERS A war of words broke out today between BP and Transocean after a long-awaited report by the oil company into the worst crude spill in US history placed much of the blame on the US rig operator . The investigation team working for BP avoided making many references by name to Transocean in its summary but claimed that `` multiple companies '' and mistakes were at the heart of the Deepwater Horizon blowout . It went on to list eight key findings related to the causes of the accident and at least five of them appeared to come under the area of responsibility that could be attributed to Transocean rather than BP . The British oil company has taken the bulk of public and political criticism since the Macondo well blowout on 20 April and has dismissed chief executive Tony Hayward in an attempt to recover ground . It has always believed that the accident was the responsibility of a wider group of companies and the investigators have backed up its claims , concluding that there was no single action or inaction that caused the accident . Instead they claim in the report that `` a complex and interlinked series of mechanical failures , human judgments , engineering design , operational implementation and team interfaces came together to allow the initiation and escalation of the accident . Multiple companies , work teams and circumstances were involved over time . '' Transocean was immediately on the attack , issuing a statement that accused BP of producing a `` self-serving report that attempts to conceal the critical factor that set the stage for the Macondo incident : BP 's fatally flawed well design . In both its design and construction , BP made a series of cost-saving decisions that increased risk in some cases , severely . '' The BP report also points the finger of blame at Halliburton , the huge contracting firm that used to be led by former US vice-president Dick Cheney , and Cameron , an American firm that provided a `` blowout preventer '' meant to stop the well exploding . Hayward made clear that he felt the report partly exonerated his own company . `` The investigation report provides critical new information on the causes of this terrible accident . It is evident that a series of complex events , rather than a single mistake or failure , led to the tragedy . Multiple parties , including BP , Halliburton and Transocean , were involved , '' he said .

This is a sector that is used to secrecy , and one before which many governments , never mind members of the public , are forced to bend the knee . Big Oil is used to waving away questions about the way it operates with the assuring mantra that `` safety always comes first '' , but the blowout on board the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig last April blew away some of the mystique . The report by BP 's investigation team published today takes this demolition job a stage further by itemising a host of human and mechanical failures that it believes were responsible for the accident . Critics of BP and that now includes its rig operator Transocean see this as an attempt to spread the blame among its partners , but whoever is responsible for each mistake , no one is questioning the basic narrative : a catalogue of chaos . What is doubly disturbing about the problems , be they `` human judgments , engineering design , operational implementation '' as the investigating team points out , is that they were produced by the industry 's finest . BP is the largest operator in the US Gulf ; Transocean is the biggest rig operator in the world ; and Halliburton , targeted by the report for its `` cement '' work on the stricken well , used to be led by former US vice president Dick Cheney . They are the industry aristocracy . One shudders to imagine what might be happening at less financially secure and worse-managed companies . Neil Atkinson , energy industry research director at Datamonitor , said all the companies involved were `` world class '' but in this case `` slipshod '' . The most common private reaction of the oil industry to the Gulf spill was `` there but for the Grace of God go I , '' said Atkinson , who believed it showed an accident like this could happen any day , any place . The BP investigation team makes 25 recommendations covering everything from blowout preventers , well control , emergency systems , cement testing , rig audit and personnel testing . The company said it expected its finding `` to be considered relevant to the oil industry more generally and for some of the recommendations to be widely adopted . '' This will add to growing concerns among environmentalists , trade unions and the wider public that the oil industry desperately needs reining in . They will give muscle to senior political figures such as G nther Oettinger , the European energy commissioner , who has already prosed a ban on some offshore drilling until all the lessons are learned from the Gulf blowout . It also comes at a time when the oil industry is trying to move into more and more environmentally sensitive areas : Greenland and the Arctic region for example as easily accessible reserves run out . For Britain the report arrives just as the Health and Safety Executive has reported an alarming escalation in the number of offshore accidents . The Guardian reported earlier this week that Transocean had come under scrutiny from the HSE after the safety regulator reported allegations of bullying and intimidation on some of its North Sea rigs . The BP report is far from the final word on the Deepwater Horizon with further reports due from more obviously independent bodies such as the US coast guard and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management . There will also be concerns that at a time when the industry should be working closely together to improve safety measures , there are signs of dispute and non-cooperation between the parties . Transocean immediately rejected the BP report as `` self-serving '' , while the oil company complained that its investigation team could not complete all of its work because of the `` unavailability of Halliburton cement additives and products '' . BP goes on to say that that the team was also `` unable to obtain access for testing of a representative Cameron blow out preventer '' as well as the same safety device off the damaged Deepwater Horizon rig . This is an industry at war with itself . That 's not such a bad thing if it produces higher safety standards , more transparency and a bit more humility .

The blast killed 11 people and created the biggest oil spil in US history . Photograph : AP BP admitted today its managers on the Deepwater Horizon missed key warning signs in the hours before the explosion aboard the oil rig , but an internal investigation put much of the blame on other companies involved in the well . A 234-page report described eight main causes for the blast , which killed 11 men and created an environmental disaster . But BP was accused of attempting to pass on the blame for its conclusion that Transocean , the rig owner , and Halliburton , which carried out cement work , shared much of the responsibility . Mark Bly , the oil company 's head of safety and the leader of the investigation , admitted that BP onsite managers could have prevented the catastrophe had they picked up warning signs of a breach of the cement seal at the bottom of the well , as well as unusual pressure test readings , only moments before the explosion . He told reporters in Washington : `` Given everything that came before , there probably should have been more risk assessment . They probably should have been more careful . '' The report was widely seen as a possible preview of BP 's legal strategy . The oil company was accused of trying to reduce the chances of being charged with gross negligence , which would expose it to possible criminal proceedings and billions of dollars in damage . Within hours of its release , Transocean and Halliburton accused BP of attempting to shift attention from its own mistakes of bad well design and disregard of safety procedures . Members of Congress and environmentalists also dismissed it . Transocean said : `` This is a self-serving report that attempts to conceal the critical factor that set the stage for the Macondo incident : BP 's fatally flawed well design . '' Ed Markey , the Massachusetts Democrat who has been investigating the spill in Congress , said the report was more about protecting BP 's interests than getting to the cause of the disaster . `` BP is happy to slice up blame , as long as they get the smallest piece , '' he said . Environmental organizations were more scathing . `` BPs investigation does n't pass the smell test , '' said Kieran Suckling , the director of the Centre for Biological Diversity . `` This report is more concerned with calming BP shareholders than taking responsibility for its actions . '' There were similar sentiments in the Gulf . Alfred Sunseri , whose family-owned oyster company faces ruin after the spill , said : `` When BP shows me a report of how exactly they will deal with those people most impacted by this tragedy ie those in the fisheries-related businesses I 'll believe they are not just using their talents in public relations to dispel their liability . '' Bly acknowledged the report fails to address the key charges raised in Congress and elsewhere against the oil company : that it allowed a culture of recklessness to flourish , and that it was so anxious to finish work on a project that was 43 days over time and $ 20m -LRB- # 13m -RRB- over budget that it omitted standard industry safeguards . The report does recognize there were gaping lapses in oversight on the Deepwater Horizon , going on to make 25 recommendations for tighter scrutiny by well owners such as BP of rig operations . But Bly rejected the idea that cost-cutting had dictated BP 's decisions on the rig , saying : `` What we see instead is , where there were errors made they were based on poor decision-making process or using wrong information . '' Oil companies could be facing tougher regulation anyway : the White House said it was asking for more funds from Congress to step up oil rig inspections . The report is narrowly focused on the final days before the explosion rather than on earlier decisions about well design and safety procedures . It is also closely focused on the rig itself . No BP officials have been sacked for their role in the explosion , and Bly said there was no indication of any blame beyond the well-site managers . The investigation identifies eight main causes of the explosion , putting particular blame on well integrity . It says Halliburton 's choice of foam cement for the area around the well casing failed to produce a strong enough seal . Tony Hayward , who was BP 's chief executive at the time of the explosion , said in a statement : `` To put it simply , there was a bad cement job . '' Halliburton said it had carried out its work to BP specifications . The report also said the blowout preventer , the last line of defense once there is a breach , had failed . There , BP pointed at Transocean noting that the battery pack on the blowout preventer had been allowed to run low . But Bly said the disaster may have been prevented had work crews BP 's as well as Transocean 's spotted the crucial warning signs in a series of anomalous pressure test readings in the run-up to the explosion . `` A fundamental to well control is early detection , '' he said . The pressure test readings should have alerted crews to the escape of oil and gas from the well reservoir , he said . The report is far from the final word on the explosion and the subsequent oil spill , with Transocean , Congress and the federal government carrying out investigations . But Robert Gordon , a lawyer for businesses affected by the spill , said it was unlikely to carry much weight in the months ahead . `` BP blaming others for the Gulf oil disaster is like Bernie Madoff blaming his accountant , '' he said .

Photograph : Carolyn Cole Here 's my take on the blame game : who the BP report on the Deepwater oil spill points the finger at for the astonishing catalogue of errors and failures that caused the Deepwater disaster . BP owned the well lease . Transocean were contracted by BP and operated the rig and blow out preventer - they have already condemned the BP report as `` self-serving '' . Halliburton did the cementing , but has not yet responded in detail to BP 's report . The eight big things that went wrong are , engineers tell me , a logical and plausible explanation . But who 's fault were they , according to BP ? My explanations are below , but to cut to the chase , the BP report appears to pin 4.5 of the eight problems on Transocean , one on Halliburton and 1.5 on BP , with one undecided . The cement that was supposed to stop the oil and gas shooting up the well pipe did n't work The report says : `` Improved engineering rigor , cement testing and communication of risk by Halliburton could have identified the low probability of the cement to achieve zonal isolation . Improved technical assurance , risk management and management of change by the BP Macondo well team could have raised awareness of the challenges of achieving zonal isolation and led to additional mitigation steps . '' BP 's verdict : Halliburton and BP to blame 2 . Further barriers at the bottom of the drill pipe failed to stop the hydrocarbons bursting into the well pipe The report says : `` The `` shoe track '' cement and the float collar must have failed to prevent this '' influx of oil and gas . BP 's verdict : As with 1 , Halliburton and BP to blame 3 . A key pressure test performed to see if the well was under control was accepted despite the readings showing it was not The report says the well site leaders - that 's BP - and the rig crew - that 's Transocean - formed and maintained this incorrect view despite the contradictory information . BP 's verdict : Transocean and BP to blame 4 . It took 40 minutes to realize gas and oil was shooting up the well The report says : `` Analysis indicates that the first indications of flow from the well could be seen in the real-time data after 20:58 hours . The rig crew and mudloggers either did not observe or did not recognize indications of flow until after hydrocarbons entered the riser at approximately 21:38 hours . The Transocean Well Control Handbook stated that the well was to be monitored at all times . '' BP 's verdict : Transocean to blame 5 . The surging hydrocarbons were not diverted `` overboard '' but brought onto the rig The report says : Transocean 's shut-in protocols did not fully address how to respond in high flow emergency situations after well control has been lost . Well control actions taken prior to the explosion suggest the rig crew was not sufficiently prepared to manage an escalating well control situation . '' BP 's verdict : Transocean to blame 6 . Diversion of the oil and gas was `` vented directly onto the rig '' The report says : `` The investigation team concludes that ... the rig crew diverted the flow of hydrocarbons ... -LRB- to -RRB- a low-pressure system , and its design limits would have been exceeded . '' BP 's verdict : Transocean to blame 7 . The fire and gas system did not prevent the explosions The report says : `` Because of the low probability of hydrocarbons being present before a well produces , only a small area of Deepwater Horizon was electrically classified -LRB- against sparking -RRB- . '' The blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- , the ultimate failsafe , failed The report says : `` The BOP maintenance records were not accurately reported in the maintenance management system . The condition of critical components in the yellow and blue -LRB- control -RRB- pods and the use of a non - -LRB- original -RRB- part , which were discovered after the pods were recovered , suggest the lack of a robust Transocean maintenance management system .

Photograph : Ann Heisenfelt\\/EPA BP is to be thrown out of the main ethical investment index , FTSE4Good , and has been forced to delay publication of its third quarter financial results because of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . The global index provider said its policy committee , which is used by many ethical fund managers to provide yardsticks to the industry , had decided to exclude BP from the end of next week . The Guardian has also learned that BP faces a second legal challenge over its safety record in the gulf . Campaign group Food & Water Watch was set to file a lawsuit in Houston tonight against the company , alleging that it began production on its giant Atlantis platform there without having and keeping safety documents required by law . BP denies the allegations . The move to eject BP from the FTSE4Good , which could further hit the company 's already battered share price as investors withdraw , underlines the damage to its reputation wreaked by America 's worst offshore oil pollution incident . `` The committee 's decision to remove BP followed consideration of the company 's response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , the environmental and social impact and its history of similar incidents , '' FTSE4Good said in a statement . Greenpeace and others had launched a major campaign to have the British oil group removed while earlier this year BP was evicted from the Dow Jones Sustainability Index . Ethical investors account for an increasing portion of share buyers and the decisions could hit future demand for BP shares , which closed down nearly 1 % on the day . BP said earlier it would delay the release of its latest quarterly results by a week because of added accounting complexities related to the Deepwater Horizon accident . The company said its quarterly figures , normally reported on the last Tuesday of the month after the end of a calendar quarter , would now be released on 2 November . A spokesman said the decision came after it proved challenging to complete its previous quarterly numbers within the normal timeline and denied it was related to the discovery of any new liabilities . BP last week produced an internal investigation into the explosion which killed 11 rig workers and spread millions of gallons of oil onto the shores of the southern states of the US . The spokesman said the team compiling the report , which laid most of the blame on Transocean and other companies BP hired to drill the well , had been supported by internal and external lawyers . However , he said the lawyers had been `` ring-fenced '' from the rest of BP and denied their role was to present the report so as to help BP fend off lawsuits . `` Their role was to make sure everything in the report was legally watertight , '' said the spokesman amid mounting criticism by the contractors and American politicians .

The oil firm said today that the results would be released on Tuesday 2 November , a week later than previously indicated . A spokesman said the company wanted more time to prepare the figures , saying because of the `` complex accounting issues associated with the Gulf of Mexico spill it 's prudent to allow a bit more time '' . He also noted that BP used to publish its third-quarter results in November but had brought them forward in recent years . In June , chief executive Tony Hayward who has since resigned was forced by the White House to suspend dividend payments to shareholders for the rest of this year and to set aside $ 20bn instead to pay compensation to those affected by the disaster . BP admitted this week that its managers on the Deepwater Horizon missed key warning signs in the hours before the 20 April explosion aboard the oil rig , but an internal investigation shifted much of the blame towards other companies involved in the well . Analysts at Evolution Securities noted that the eight key events that led to the disaster are interwoven between BP , Halliburton and Transocean , according to BP , and appear not to single out any one company or action as solely responsible for the accident . `` We suspect this makes a gross negligence case more difficult to prove and so subsequent litigation claims against BP will take longer and ultimately be spread between BP , its licence partners , Transocean and Halliburton . '' BP 's market value has plunged by $ 72bn since the accident to $ 120bn , while its rivals have only fallen an average of 9 % . `` It appears that BP 's shares are still assuming a cost for the accident of $ 55bn .

Photograph : Nasa BP 's incoming chief executive , Bob Dudley , has reassured the City that the company will probably end up paying out less than the committed $ 20bn in compensation for those affected by the Gulf oil spill . The White House ordered the company to pay $ 20bn into a compensation fund over three and a half years , making it clear that further payments may be required . Although BP still does not know how much it will have to contribute , Dudley 's comments that the $ 20bn already pledged should cover these claims reflect BP 's growing confidence that it can emerge from April 's Deepwater Horizon disaster in a relatively strong position . It is understood the company also informed City analysts at a meeting in London on Friday that a facility allowing any unpaid amounts from the fund to be paid back to BP has now been set up . Analysts even believe BP will soon be able to resume paying dividends , with Citigroup predicting it could do so as early as February , when it reports its full-year results . Dudley , who formally takes over from Tony Hayward on 1 October , stressed that the decision to suspend the dividend in June was for liquidity reasons , to conserve cash to pay for the spill costs . Since then , BP has raised about $ 10bn from asset sales and its costs from the clean-up operation are tailing off because oil has stopped flowing from the stricken well . Because the size of the spill has stopped growing and has been measured , the extent of BP 's potential liabilities have also become clearer . Dudley also told analysts the estimate BP made in July of $ 32.2 bn for its total liabilities from the spill officially the biggest in US history remained reasonable . This assumes BP is not found to have been grossly negligent , in which case its liabilities would soar . BP has privately been confident for some time that the compensation fund now being run by White House appointee Ken Feinberg would not pay out anywhere near $ 20bn . About $ 500m in claims have been paid out in just under five months and the claims process will remain open for three years . It is thought Dudley has been in regular contact with Feinberg . But Dudley did acknowledge the ongoing risks in the aftermath of the disaster when he said one of BP 's priorities was to retain its licence to operate in the US . BP makes more than a third of its total revenue from producing oil and gas from its operations in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore in the US , and some politicians have called for the company to be banned from operating there . One analyst at the meeting told the Guardian : `` He was upbeat . I would n't say he was optimistic but he was definitely confident about BP 's position and seemed more comfortable . '' This week retired coastguard Admiral Thad Allen , who is handling the BP oil spill crisis on behalf of the US government , is expected to explain in more detail how the level of pollution in the Gulf will be measured , which will go a long way to determining the amount of reparations BP must pay . BP has hired scientists as subcontractors to work alongside federal agencies and universities to take samples , which has led some to question whether the company could seek to influence the results . A spokesman said there was nothing untoward about assisting the effort . Jackie Savitz , a marine biologist from campaign group Oceana , said some scientists were concerned about BP being able to influence the process , although no evidence has emerged that this has taken place . `` There is no question that BP would be less committed than the government to showing the full impact and degradation caused to the environment since the company will be on the hook for the damages . The question is whether the government will allow BP to influence its analysis . `` The scientists I have spoken to are aware of the possibility that BP could try to influence the process , and that there can be other pitfalls from the company participating . For example , with BP constantly looking over their shoulders when they collect data , they have to do it 100 % right otherwise BP could challenge it in court later .

Photograph : Keystone\\/Rex Features The final solution to BP 's oil well spill could be in place by Sunday , five months after the deadly explosion spewed 5m barrels of crude into the Gulf of Mexico , the Obama administration said today . But officials conceded the effects of the spill , which turned the Gulf of Mexico into an environmental and economic disaster zone and brought one of the world 's biggest oil companies to the brink of ruin , would be felt for months , if not years . Barack Obama 's point man on the oil spill , coastguard commander Thad Allen , told reporters in a conference call today that drill crews were hours away from intercepting the Macondo well and installing a permanent plug . `` We started this morning the final drilling process to close in on the bottom of the Macondo well , '' he said . `` Four days from now it could all be done . This is the window we are looking at right now . '' Allen said the administration had already begun to move out equipment from the well site , in anticipation of the placement of a permanent mud and cement seal . He said the central pipe of the well is already under a cement seal , after oil was injected into the top of the well in July . But he said it is unclear whether oil is still flowing in the area between that pipe and the rock formation . But even with the end only hours away , Jane Lubchenco , who heads the National Oceanic and Atmospheric -LRB- NOAA -RRB- adminstration , said there was still significant oil in the Gulf , especially at depths . The admission marks a reversal for the rosy assertions by the administration last month that nearly 75 % of the oil had been broken down or cleaned up . `` There continues to be some oil in the subsurface especially in this layer between 3,000 to 4,300 ft , '' she said . `` There is oil being observed in the sediment on the sea floor surface . '' Much of that oil is in tiny droplets the width of a human hair but Lubchenco said that did not diminish its potential impacts . Scientists on a University of Georgia research voyage reported this week that they had found a two-inch-thick layer of oil on the ocean floor , challenging the NOAA 's earlier assertions that the oil was rapidly being broken down . Lubchenco promised the administration would continue to track the oil over the long term to ensure the health of the marine environment and protect the seafood industry in the Gulf . Parish officials in Louisiana have reported a number of fish kills in areas affected by the spill and Plaquemines parish reported this week that large numbers of fish had died around Bayou Chaland on the west side of the Mississippi river . The officials said it was unclear whether the fish were killed by contact with oil or because of a drop in oxygen levels caused by high activity among microbes eating up the oil .

Photograph : AP The disastrous financial , political and PR fallout from the Deepwater Horizon spill has stripped billions of dollars from the value of the BP brand , according to a leading marketing consultancy , which has dumped the oil giant from its index of the world 's best brands for the first time in 11 years . Interbrand concluded that the `` majority of the company 's brand value has been destroyed '' by the Gulf of Mexico disaster , as it published its annual survey of the top 100 brands . The blow comes a day after outgoing BP chief executive Tony Hayward was grilled by MPs about the company 's operational record and handling of the worst oil spill in US history . Since 1999 Interbrand has produced an annual report giving a dollar value to the world 's 100 most valuable brands , based on three factors financial performance , role of the brand in purchase decisions , and its strength in securing earnings for the company . Interbrand stripped billions from BP 's brand value , which last year was calculated at $ 3.7 bn , ranking the company 83rd , and instead promoted rival oil company Shell to 81st place , at $ 4bn . Because BP did not make the top 100 , Interbrand did not reveal its estimate of the company 's remaining brand value . However , Julian Dailly , director of valuation at Interbrand London , said : `` BP failed to execute on the level of standards they talked so proudly about in the press and the majority of the company 's brand value has been destroyed as a result . The overall impact can last a long time with the company finding it harder to enter new markets and bid for new contracts . The incident may not change the behavior of people turning left and right at the petrol pump but it will have a huge impact on the company 's bottom line and for a mineral giant that is critical . '' The report also saw the value of the Apple brand jump by 37 % to more than $ 21bn -LRB- # 13.5 bn -RRB- as embarrassing technical issues with the iPhone 4 were more than offset by the successful launch of the iPad . Apple showed the biggest increase year on year among Interbrand 's top 100 brands for 2010 , jumping three places to 17th . Interbrand attributed Apple 's resilience , in the face of a major flaw with the eagerly anticipated iPhone 4 , to factors including the `` guru-like '' following of the brand and the company 's chief executive , Steve Jobs . `` The antenna flaw may have grabbed headlines from more legitimate news headlines but sales were certainly not affected , '' said Interbrand . `` And let 's not forget how quickly the negative buzz over the iPad name was replaced with long lines of eager buyers waiting to make their purchase .

Google moved from seventh to fourth , just one place behind Microsoft , which managed a 7 % increase in value to $ 60.8 bn .

The Obama administration has been accused of helping BP hide the oil . Photograph : Lee Celano\\/Reuters The Obama administration is facing two new charges of suppressing information about the BP oil spill . Independent scientists , environmental organizations and local groups in the Gulf have repeatedly accused government agencies of helping BP to under-estimate the amount of oil that spewed out of its well and play down its effects on marine life . The emergency phase of the spill may now be all but over : administration officials say the well could be permanently sealed by Sunday . But the Obama administration still faces a big trust gap over its handling of the spill , with environmentalists and scientists growing more vocal about their suspicions that the US public is being spun . Now here are two more challenges : from the National Wildlife Federation , which suggests the US Fish and Wildlife Service is playing fast and loose with figures in its estimates of sea birds killed by the spill and from the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility , which says the government is deliberately withholding information about the spill . The NWF did succeed in prising numbers for birds killed or injured in the spill from the US Fish and Wildlife under a freedom of information request . Conservation groups had been pushing officials to provide a breakdown of the types of birds caught up in the spill : brown pelicans , laughing gulls , northern gannets . But the numbers which FWS handed over on Wednesday , 10 days after an original deadline had passed , turned out to be 40 % lower than the rolling tally posted each day on the Deepwater Horizon Response website . The FWS report listed only 4,676 affected birds up to 14 September , while the latest FWS figures on the Deepwater Horizon response site on the same date listed 7,996 birds . On further scrutiny , it turns out the FWS tally was not up to date . But the low number left an impression that the FWS was trying to play down the effects of the spill on wildlife . `` I do n't have a problem with releasing partial data , '' said Doug Inkley , a senior scientist for the NWF . `` What concerns me is that they represented it as complete . '' He went on : `` I think both BP and the federal government have had a very strong resistance to giving out information . We saw that at the beginning when the government continued to release the information that the flow rate was only 5,000 barrels per day and everyone in the world knew it was much more than that . '' It 's become a familiar charge over the past five months , and it extends across several government agencies . In early August , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency -LRB- NOAA -RRB- released a report suggesting that about 75 % of the oil was gone from the Gulf . A closer look revealed that even by NOAA 's own accounting half of the oil was still in the environment though diluted and dispersed . NOAA later backed away from the report . On Thursday , Peer accused the US Geological Survey of hiding hundreds of pages of reports and internal memos related to the work of a group of technical experts who were charged with producing an authoritative estimate of the flow rate from BP 's ruptured well . Peer 's director , Jeff Ruch , said in a statement : `` Our concern is that the administration took , and is still taking , steps to falsely minimize public perception about the extent and severity of the BP spill . '' It 's widely accepted that it will take months if not years before scientists and environmental organizations are able to produce a true picture of the effects of the BP spill . But as new evidence continues to come in , independent scientists seem to be saying that it 's getting harder and harder to trust the government to come up with the facts . As Inkley put it : `` Whenever we see reports , if there is a bias one direction or another there is always an under-representation of the damages or potential damages .

Photograph : Win Mcnamee\\/Getty Images With a final shot of cement , BP permanently `` killed '' its well in the Gulf of Mexico that ruptured in April and unleashed the worst oil spill in American history , US officials confirmed today . `` We can finally announce that the Macondo 252 well is effectively dead , '' retired coast guard admiral Thad Allen , who oversees the US government response to the disaster , said in a statement . `` After months of extensive operations , planning and execution under the direction and authority of the US government science and engineering teams , BP has successfully completed the relief well by intersecting and cementing the well nearly 18,000 ft -LRB- 3.4 miles -RRB- below the surface , '' Allen added . President Barack Obama , whose approval ratings were hurt by public discontent over the government 's initial response to the spill , welcomed an `` important milestone '' . Obama said his administration was now focused on making sure the Gulf coast `` recovers fully from this disaster '' . `` This road will not be easy , but we will continue to work closely with the people of the Gulf to rebuild their livelihoods and restore the environment that supports them , '' the president said . On Thursday , a relief well bored into the bottom of the Macondo well to pump in cement and seal the reservoir for good . BP pumped cement for seven hours on Friday , and finished a pressure test early today that showed the well was dead , Allen said . The well ruptured on 20 April , causing an explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that killed 11 workers . The spill polluted the coasts of four Gulf states , prompted a ban on new deepwater drilling and left BP 's image in tatters in the United States , home to 40 % of its business . Oil has not leaked into the sea from the well since BP engineers sealed it on 15 July with a cap . The well had gushed more than 16 times as much as the 257,000 barrels of oil spilled by the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska in 1989 .

The beleaguered oil company revealed that its total cost of the spill had climbed to $ 9.5 bn . BP also said payouts to people affected by the spill such as fishermen , hoteliers and retailers had dramatically increased since it handed over authority for dispensing funds to a White House appointee . BP has set up a $ 20bn compensation fund , which has so far paid out 19,000 claims totalling more than $ 240m . The fund is run by lawyer Kenneth Feinberg , the Obama administration 's former executive pay tsar . The oil company previously paid out about $ 3.5 m a day in compensation , but this has risen to $ 12.5 m a day since Feinberg took over . However , BP 's incoming chief executive , Bob Dudley , who formally takes over from Tony Hayward on 1 October , told the City a week ago that the company expects to pay out less than the committed $ 20bn .

Five months after the explosion that killed 11 workers on the Deepwater Horizon rig and let loose millions of barrels of crude oil , the well passed a pressure test yesterday that confirmed it was sealed about 5,000 metres below the sea bed . `` We can finally announce that the Macondo 252 well is effectively dead , '' said Thad Allen , the former coast guard admiral heading the government response to the spill . Allen declared that the well `` poses no continuing threat to the Gulf of Mexico '' . The spill was brought to a halt in July with a temporary cap while a relief well was completed .

Barack Obama hailed the news as an `` important milestone '' and praised those who `` worked around the clock to respond to this crisis and ultimately complete this challenging but critical step to ensure that the well has stopped leaking for ever '' . Obama said the government remained committed to helping communities along hundreds of miles of Gulf coast recover from the disaster . BP is still counting the cost of the disaster . It was forced by the US government to establish a $ 20bn compensation fund . Nearly 70,000 people or businesses have lodged claims mostly for loss of earnings or profits . So far about one in four have been paid although some of the recipients say with cheques far lower than their claims . The majority come from Florida and Louisiana . BP last week refused to process a claim by the state government of Alabama for $ 148m in lost income tax revenues because workers have lost their jobs or have diminished earnings as a result of the spill . The company is also facing about 400 lawsuits and many more are likely to be filed . BP is estimated to have paid $ 8bn so far in clean-up costs . It has launched a national advertising campaign that promises to make right the damage caused by the spill . The environmental toll is still being assessed but thousands of dead birds , turtles and other wildlife have been found even if the impact is not as great as initially feared . The debate over where the spilled oil has gone continues . Last month the government said that nearly three-quarters of it had evaporated , been devoured by living organisms or scooped up . But some scientists claim that a massive plume of oil remain in the Gulf of Mexico with some of it having settled on the sea bed . Earlier this month , BP published its own findings into the causes of the disaster . It accepted a partial share of the blame for the blowout but also accused a contractor , Halliburton , of sub-standard work at the well head which led to the disaster and the owner of the rig , Transocean , for the failures of the blowout preventer on the ocean floor . The blowout preventer , a series of valves designed to stop a surge of oil and gas , is being held at a Nasa facility in New Orleans to await examination next month . BP 's position is widely viewed as establishing its legal strategy as it faces fines and possible prosecution over the disaster .

In spite of the long road ahead of civil , regulatory and possible criminal action , BP 's outlook has begun to brighten . More optimistic analysts are predicting legal claims arising from the Deepwater Horizon disaster could be significantly below the $ 20bn -LRB- # 13bn -RRB- set aside by BP and a leading US campaign group , Public Citizen , has ended its call for a boycott of the oil company . BP 's shares climbed 8p to 411p following confirmation on Sunday that the company had permanently sealed the Macondo field , some 50 miles off the coast of Louisiana , by pumping cement into the undersea reserve of oil and by intercepting its leaking well with a relief well . BP said the disaster , which involved a spill of 4.9 m barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , had so far cost the company $ 9.5 bn . The ultimate cost of the damage wreaked by the disaster remains uncertain but some believe market estimates have been too high . Jason Kenney , an oil analyst at ING Barings , said BP 's sale of non-core assets to pay for the disaster could , ironically , benefit the company . `` They 're still investible ; they 're still credible ; they 're very much alive and they could come out of this reinvigorated , '' said Kenney , who believes BP is unlikely to face criminal charges for the explosion on its Deepwater Horizon rig , which triggered the disaster . `` I think , in time , we 'll look back at this and the US will be quite happy with a record financial penalty and not necessarily look at charging BP on a criminal basis . '' A presidential commission investigating the disaster is due to deliver its findings in January and , at about the same time , a US coastguard panel will present its conclusions on the causes of the Deepwater explosion . The outcome of these two investigations is likely to determine whether BP is judged grossly negligent a crucial decision as it will help determine the scale of environmental fines and the degree to which BP can offset costs to its minority co-owners in the Deepwater venture , Anadarko Petroleum and Mitsui . Pavel Molchanov , a Texas-based analyst at the investment firm Raymond James , said he believed the overall cost could reach $ 48bn , including fines of as much as $ 18bn if BP is found grossly at fault , although fears over the future of BP have dissipated . `` The bankruptcy fears have really gone away since July , when the oil stopped flowing into the Gulf . But at this point , the stock will probably remain under a cloud because liabilities are very uncertain , '' he said . In the coastal region where businesses have been hit by the spill , locals remain concerned by the disaster 's economic impact . Dean Blanchard , a Louisiana seafood wholesaler hit by fishing bans in the Gulf , told the Houston Chronicle that he could only cautiously welcome the well 's closure : `` It 's good news in one way , but it 's surely not solving our problems . '' However , BP could at least see some relief on petrol forecourts . The biggest advocate of a US-wide boycott of BP 's petrol stations , Public Citizen , is no longer urging motorists to shun the green sunflower logo . The energy campaigner Tyson Slocum said : `` You should give your business to whatever vendor you agree with . We are no longer organising a formal boycott of BP . '' BP 's latest update on the cost of its response efforts cover the expenses involved in the well 's kill operation , as well as compensation for those who have been affected and the clean-up measures , which have involved about 25,200 people , dozens of aircraft and more than 2,600 ships and boats .

Photograph : Ann Heisenfelt\\/EPA The starting up of the hype machine for Donald Rumsfeld 's upcoming memoir has got me thinking about his famous line before the US invasion of Iraq . There are known knowns . These are things we know that we know . There are known unknowns . That is to say , there are things that we know we do n't know . But there are also unknown unknowns . There are things we do n't know we do n't know . In Rumsfeld 's case , the former Pentagon chief was basically admitting , albeit in an extremely convoluted way , that there was no evidence linking Saddam Hussein to terrorists and that he really had no idea why he was taking the country to war . In the case of the BP oil disaster though , when the true environmental and economic toll could take months or even years to become evident , the idea of `` known unknowns '' and `` unknown unknowns '' does not seem that ridiculous . Among the biggest `` known unknowns '' is the long-term effects on the marine environment of a spill of this magnitude . There are questions too about what additional damage , if any , rendered by the government 's decision to use such huge quantities of chemical dispersants to prevent the oil from coming ashore . And then there is the uncertainty , fuelled by a lack of transparency by BP and the Obama Administration , even about the `` known knowns '' . Independent scientists and environmental organizations have grown suspicious of official reports on the oil spill . Do we really know what we think we know ? Now a team led by Timothy Crone , a marine geophysicist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University , has tackled another of the great `` known unknowns '' : how much oil entered the Gulf of Mexico in the nearly three months it took for BP to gain control over its Macondo well ? The team , which published their research in the journal Science , claim to have produced the first estimate of the flow rate from the well that is independent , transparent in its methodology , and reviewed by other scientists . The team arrived at its estimate by analyzing video of the gushing well shot from the ocean floor . And it turns out , their numbers are very close to the final figure produced by a special team of experts assembled by the Obama administration . That 's a bit of a break for government agencies who have been routinely accused by scientists and environmentalists of spinning the spill . Crone 's team concluded that some 56,000 to 68,000 barrels a day gushed out of the well , releasing some 4.4 m barrels into the ocean before it was capped on July 15 . The study found that the oil gushed with greatest force in the first six weeks after the explosion , when there was a jagged break in the pipe leading up from the reservoir . The estimate is very close to the official tally arrived at by the Obama Administration 's scientific team . Their estimate was 4.9 m barrels , of which 800,000 were siphoned off by BP directly to a waiting tanker ship , leaving 4.1 m barrels in the water . But the team did not make their methodology available to other scientists for review . But while that agreement might lead some to immediately dismiss the study as pro-government spin , it 's worth remembering that Crone was among the first scientists to take on BP 's claim that it was impossible to estimate the flow from the well . Crone 's efforts , supported by Congressman Ed Markey , forced BP to release video from its undersea cameras , which showed giant clouds of oil billowing out of the broken well . And as weeks turned into months , government officials kept raising their estimates of the flow rate from 1,000 barrels a day to 19,000 by late May , and then 69,000 . When the Deepwater Horizon went down , Crone was one of a small group of people who had experience measuring oil and gas on the ocean floor . He spent four years developing a technique for measuring natural releases of oil from the ocean floor , using high resolution video from underwater cameras . The seemingly endless video from BP 's webcam had very low resolution and could not be analyzed . Back in May , when BP released its first brief clips from the ocean floor , Crone immediately asked the oil company to share more higher resolution images , to no avail it seems . The researchers had access only to a few brief high resolution clips released to Congress . `` We clearly acknowledge the limits of our technique ; we 're unlikely to ever know the exact figure , '' he said in a statement . But it is an important start . As time goes on , I hope to keep track of the work of government and independent scientists , environmental organizations , and local groups on the ground to fill in the blanks around the `` known unknowns '' . I am looking forward to getting a first hand look at some of those efforts today aboard the Greenpeace ship , the Arctic Sunrise . A team of scientists is lowering monitoring equipment and gathering samples from depths of 1,000 m to gauge the effects of the remaining oil and gas in the Gulf . Here is their early account : The first piece of science work started on Monday morning and continued until first thing Tuesday dropping a half-tonne apparatus that includes a ` CTD ' , or `` conductivity , temperature and depth '' device , along with an array of water sampling containers and various other water monitoring instruments , down 1000m or so below the ocean 's surface . They will be sharing these samples with other scientists to help build a broad , and importantly , a more independent picture of just what is going on beneath the waves of the Gulf .

Photograph : Mannie Garcia\\/Greenpeace The twin drilling platforms rising from the waters above BP 's blown well look like the brooding guard towers of a lost ruin , which in a sense they are : the relics of a disaster zone now turned into an open-air science quest to claim a slice of $ 500m -LRB- # 316.5 m -RRB- in research funds . Ten days after BP 's well was plugged with cement , teams of scientists are scrambling to set sail in the Gulf to collect baseline data on the oil before it biodegrades and changes , as well as get noticed by the distributors of the fund pledged by BP for research into the ecological consequences of the spill . Below deck on the Arctic Sunrise , five miles off the BP well , Rainer Amon , an ocean scientist at Texas A&M University at Galveston is looking over data on hydrocarbon and oxygen levels generated by sensors lowered to depths of about 1,000 metres . It 's his second trip to the waters around the well since the BP spill . In June , Amon was part of a Texas A&M team that made a crescent-shaped tour around the well , finding high concentrations of methane gas as well as oil . Instead of today 's deserted seas , his photos from June show dozens of oil response boats , and thick clouds of black smoke billowing from the surface of the water . On his return voyage he is encountering a void . `` If that oil and gas had been consumed by bacteria you would expect to see more oxygen depletion than what we have seen , '' he said . `` Was it just a fluke that we found it , or is there an oil carpet on the ground ? '' So where is the oil ? It 's been two months since any new crude from BP 's well entered the Gulf . Independent estimates suggest 4.4 m barrels of oil spewed out into the Gulf of Mexico , but there is no scientific agreement on its fate . `` You could say it 's a mystery , '' said Amon . Did the oil sink to the bottom ? A University of Georgia research expedition earlier this month discovered a thick coating of oil on the sea floor , 16 nautical miles from the BP well-head . Is it floating in the depths ? One team of researchers reported finding a deep sea plume of oil and natural gas the size of Manhattan , that was slow to degrade . A second study of the plume found the oil and gas were quickly being gobbled up by microbes . Federal government agencies , meanwhile , have been seen to play down the long-term effects of the oil . `` We still have not got to the bottom of where the majority of the oil went , '' said Adam Walters , a Greenpeace scientist . `` The work is sound but the conclusions are really clutching at straws . '' The uncertainty about the fate of the oil has deepened the sense of urgency among scientists to gather evidence from the deep water and the ocean floor , and to begin weighing the effects of the spill on marine life . That in turn has scientists clamouring for the release of the BP research funds , the bulk of which have yet to be awarded . Amon , who faced a long wait for grant money to come through , got out to sea again by jumping on board a Greenpeace ship . The campaign group has been offering the Arctic Sunrise to research scientists . That was a definite attraction for Amon , who was otherwise facing a seven-month wait for a research grant by which time the processes governing the oil that entered the Gulf would be well advanced . Another A&M researcher on board , Cliff Nunnally , is hoping to gather samples from the sea floor . In addition to the headstart on research , there is a cost incentive . Research vessels , depending on their equipment , can cost upwards of $ 30,000 a day , the biggest single expense on a scientific mission . Then again , as Amon notes , on a fully staffed research voyage , he would not be personally overseeing the winch lowering his massive steel-framed device into the depths . Other traditions are being challenged in these early days of the quest for oil , fuelling suspicions among some scientists that the White House and BP are trying to dictate the agenda for the next generation of Gulf research . At first , BP intended to follow standard academic protocols and hand control of the fund , which will be awarded over 10 years , to a consortium of independent scientists to review research proposals . But the White House later instructed BP to involve Gulf governors , who have been pushing to direct money towards in-state researchers over the more prominent and widely recognized ocean science institutions . There are also concerns that politicians , rather than scientists and other technical experts , could define the parameters of further study . But even with those reservations , there is a sense in the scientific community that the catastrophe of the BP oil spill is opening up an entirely new frontier for research in one of the most highly industrialised , yet biologically rich , marine environments on the planet . A decade ago , Nunnally , then working on his master 's degree , was part of an ambitious product to conduct a census of marine life , on the ocean floor and in the depths , from Texas to the Florida coast . The project was commissioned by the Minerals Management Service , which was the government agency overseeing offshore oil drilling until it was reorganised following the Deepwater Horizon disaster . The project took four years , but in all that time Nunnally said it never occurred to the scientists they would soon be out there again . `` For all the ship time and all the conversations that we had with our colleagues that is the one conversation we did not have : what will we do in 10 years ' time if there is an oil spill and we have to come out and do it all over again ?

A report commissioned by Barack Obama has revealed that the White House office of management and budget blocked scientists seeking permission to show worst case scenario models two weeks after the explosion . Photograph : Gerald Herbert\\/AP The White House blocked government scientists from warning the American public of the potential environmental disaster caused by BP 's broken well in the Gulf of Mexico , a report released by the national commission investigating the oil spill said yesterday . The report , produced by a panel appointed by Barack Obama to investigate the spill , said that about two weeks after the BP rig exploded scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- NOAA -RRB- asked the White House for permission to release their models showing their worst case scenarios for the spill . The White House office of management and budget , which is a traditional clearing house for decisions , turned down the request , the report said , quoting interviews with administration officials . The report , one of four released today by the commission , provides the most compelling evidence to date of direct attempts by the White House to spin the BP oil spill disaster . The White House disputed the commission 's findings . `` Senior government officials were clear with the public what the worst-case flow rate could be , '' the acting director of the OMB , Jeffrey Zients and the NOAA adminstrator , Jane Lubchenco , said in a statement . The commission report does not explore why the White House sought to block the worst-case scenarios for the spill . The report amplifies scathing criticism last week by the commission 's co-chairs , Bob Graham and William Reilly , of the Obama administration 's handling of the disaster . It goes on to catalogue other lapses by the administration , including repeated underestimates of the size of the spill , and downplaying the environmental damage after the BP well was capped . The report found particular fault with the White House energy adviser , Carol Browner , who appeared on television on 4 August and said : `` The vast majority of oil was gone . '' It said Browner was overstating the findings of a NOAA analysis of the fate of the oil . `` By initially underestimating the amount of oil flow and then , at the end of the summer , appearing to underestimate the amount of oil remaining in the Gulf , the federal government created the impression that it was either not fully competent to handle the spill or not fully candid with the American people about the scope of the problem , '' the report said . The documents for the first time put the White House at the center of the long running dispute between the administration and independent scientists about how much oil was discharged into the Gulf , and how much remains in the water . At first , BP claimed the well was leaking 1,000 barrels a day . By early May , the administration had revised its estimate upwards to 5,000 barrels a day , but based its assessment on the work of a single NOAA scientist using `` overly casual '' analysis of satellite images of oil on the surface of the ocean . The administration clung to that estimate which turned out to be 12 times lower than the actual spill size despite known inaccuracies in the scientists ' work , the report said . It went on : `` Loss of the public trust during a disaster is not an incidental public relations problem .

Photograph : Dan Kitwood\\/Getty Images Bob Dudley , chief executive of BP , said emphatically today that the oil firm `` will not be quitting America '' in the wake of the devastating explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig that caused an environmental crisis in the Gulf of Mexico and left 11 workers dead . Addressing an audience of business leaders at the CBI , Dudley said there was `` too much at stake '' for BP to walk away from the United States and that the company had begun the task of rebuilding trust among federal and state government . He also underlined BP 's determination to continue `` finding and producing oil and gas in the deep waters of the world 's oceans '' , despite the safety concerns over deepwater drilling following the Gulf spill . He also thanked the British government for its support `` during what has been a very difficult time '' and said David Cameron 's visit to Washington at a time when anti-British sentiment directed toward BP was at its most hysterical had `` real impact '' in calming the situation . Dudley reiterated that BP is `` deeply sorry for what has happened '' . In a speech pitched at the task of beginning to rebuild BP 's shattered reputation , Dudley also cast a critical eye on the media for its saturation coverage of the event , saying the `` demand for information and instant conclusions is insatiable '' . He told the audience : `` We live in an atmosphere where many things are often exaggerated , opinion can quickly become polarised and it is tempting to react to events in extreme ways . '' He added : `` Over 87 days as the oil kept flowing into the ocean , it frequently felt as if we were the only story on the news , 24\\/7 . I have seen figures that in some months fully 30 % of the 24-hour news coverage was devoted to the incident . '' There was , he added , `` a great rush to judgment by a fair number of observers before the full facts could possibly be known , even from some in our industry . `` I watched graphic projections of oil swirling around the gulf , around Florida , across and around Bermuda to England these appeared authoritative and inevitable . The public fear was everywhere . '' He hoped that over the coming months and years a more `` balanced and informed judgement about what happened '' would emerge . Dudley , who assumed the chief executive role at the beginning of this month , admitted that `` the very existence '' of BP had been threatened as a terrible accident grew into a corporate crisis and described the circumstances in which he stepped into the top job as `` humbling '' . He has already made a series of changes aimed at restoring BP 's tarnished reputation . On his arrival he ousted the troubled oil firm 's head of exploration and production and announced a series of measures , including the setting up of a separate safety division , which BP claims will have greater powers to intervene in operations . The company has also carved up the exploration and production division into three units , each with its own boss , to prevent it acting as a semi-autonomous unit within BP . Last week , Dudley also said the company would link staff bonuses to better safety standards . He denied that BP would turn its back on the US . `` Contrary to what is sometimes said , BP is not widely seen over there as ` British Petroleum ' ; we 're part of the American community . '' He said relationships with federal and state government departments and agencies `` have survived and are beginning to recover '' in large part because of the scale of BP 's response . `` They have not completely lost faith in BP , '' he said . `` And for our part , I can promise you that I did not become chief executive of BP in order to walk away from the US . BP will not be quitting America . There is too much at stake , both for BP and the US . The US has major energy needs . BP is the largest producer of oil and gas in the country and a vital contributor to fulfilling them . '' On deepwater drilling , he said : `` The deep waters are becoming an increasingly important source of energy to fuel the global economy . They account for around 7 % of total oil supplies now , growing to a projected 9 % in 2020 . And we are one of only a handful of companies with the financial and technological strengths to undertake development projects in these difficult geographies . And it can be done safely . '' Dudley said BP had made `` huge progress in cleaning up the spill '' , mobilising a fleet of vessels larger than at the Normandy landings and said the `` silver lining '' was that the industry was now better prepared to prevent this kind of accident in the future . He said he had in recent weeks spent time with experts in other hazardous industries including the nuclear and chemicals industries and noted there was much that could be learned . `` There are lessons for us relating to the way we operate , the way we organise our company and the way we manage risk , '' he added . He also insisted that BP remained `` financially healthy '' and that the firm 's `` underlying operational and financial performance is sound '' . Dudley refused to criticise his predecessor , Tony Hayward , who had been widely attacked for a series of gaffes during the crisis . He said Hayward had `` defined our aims with great clarity . We would do the right thing and stay the course . '' The leaking well was capped in mid-July , stopping the flow of oil into the Gulf and it was officially declared sealed by US government officials on 19 September .

Investigators say cement used on the well did not meet industry standards . Photograph : US coastguard\\/EPA BP and Halliburton were aware of flaws in the cement used to seal the doomed well in the Gulf of Mexico , according to the lead investigator for the presidential commission on the oil spill . In a letter to the commission , the investigator , Fred Bartlit , said the cement mixture used on the well did not meet industry standards , and failed three out of four laboratory tests before the Deepwater Horizon explosion on 20 April . Halliburton , which was hired by BP to cement the well , learned of those failures in February , and informed BP on 8 March . But both firms chose to go ahead with the nitrogen foam cement mixture , which was supposed to secure the bottom of the well . `` Halliburton -LRB- and perhaps BP -RRB- should have considered redesigning the foam slurry , '' the letter said . However , Halliburton said it did not believe that the foam cement design used on the well caused the incident . `` Halliburton believes that significant differences between its internal cement tests and the commission 's test results may be due to differences in the cement materials tested , '' the company said in a statement issued in response to the letter . `` The commission tested off-the-shelf cement and additives , whereas Halliburton tested the unique blend of cement and additives that existed on the rig at the time Halliburton 's tests were conducted . '' The company added : `` Halliburton believes that had BP conducted a cement bond log test , or had BP and others properly interpreted a negative pressure test , these tests would have revealed any problems with Halliburton 's cement . '' A fourth test , performed in April , did indicate the cement would hold . But Bartlit said BP did not have the results of that test before 19 April , when it ordered work crews to begin pumping cement into the well . The finding offers some good news for BP , whose own investigative report on the spill last month zeroed in on problems in the cement seal performed by Halliburton . Like BP 's investigators , the commission conducted its own tests on the cement design used by Halliburton although they had an exact recipe . The mixture failed all nine stability tests . The companies involved in the catastrophic spill BP , Transocean , which owned the rig , Halliburton , and others are engaged in a high stakes fight to shift blame , and millions of dollars in liability , for the explosion and spill . Bartlit cautioned that the failure of the cement seal alone was not the sole cause for the oil disaster . `` The story of the blowout does not turn solely on the quality of the Macondo cement job . Cementing wells is a complex endeavor and industry figures inform us that cementing failures are not uncommon in the best of circumstances , '' he wrote . The oil industry had developed other common tests to ensure against cement failures , he said . `` BP and\\/or Transocean personnel misinterpreted or chose not to conduct such tests at the Macondo well .

The oil giant announced the new charge to cover the cost of the Gulf of Mexico spill alongside its financial results for the third quarter of the year . It blamed the delays that dogged its attempts to seal the leak , along with higher clean-up costs and legal fees . The new charge knocked BP 's pre-tax profits for the third quarter of 2010 down to $ 1.8 bn , compared with $ 4.98 bn a year ago . In late July BP set aside $ 32.2 bn to cover the cost of the clean-up , more than the City had expected , a move which pushed the company into a record loss of $ 17bn for the second quarter of 2010 . At that time , though , the Macondo well was still leaking oil into the ocean , and was only finally shut off in mid-September . Richard Hunter , head of UK equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers , said the additional $ 7.7 bn provision was `` a stark reminder that the fallout from the spill will follow BP for some considerable time to come '' . The final cost of one of the worst environmental disasters ever could climb further . BP said that the total charge of $ 39.9 bn was its `` current best estimate of those costs that can be reliably measured at this time '' . So far , BP has actually paid $ 11.6 bn in total costs since the incident , but still faces ongoing clean-up charges , compensation claims , and probably a multi-billion dollar fine from the US government . BP owned 65 % of the Macondo well with two partners owning the remainder Anadarko Petroleum with 25 % , and Mitsui with 10 % . BP has billed Anadarko and Mitsui a total of $ 4.29 bn , but admitted that both companies are `` withholding payment in light of the investigations surrounding the incident '' . Separately , Mitsui revealed today it had received a $ 1.9 bn bill from BP to cover some of the clean-up costs of the spill . When the costs of the oil spill were excluded , BP 's operating profits for the quarter were 18 % higher than a year ago at $ 5.5 bn . Chief executive Bob Dudley , in his first results announcement since taking over from Tony Hayward , said they showed BP was `` on track '' to recover from the disaster . `` This strong operating performance shows the determination of everyone at BP to move the company forward and rebuild confidence after the terrible events of the past six months , '' Dudley said . BP also said that it would reconsider its current dividend freeze in February 2011 . Richard Griffith , analyst at Evolution Securities , said BP 's underlying performance was better than expected . Shares in BP rose by 1.5 % this morning to 430p , around a third lower than their value before the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in April .

Photograph : Gerald Herbert\\/AP The presidential commission investigating the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster ran into controversy today by saying it had found no evidence that BP and other oil companies put profits ahead of safety on the Deepwater Horizon rig . In a preliminary finding by what is the first independent panel , the commission 's chief investigator found a series of missed warning signs before the April 20 explosion on the rig . Fred Bartlit said repeatedly that he had found no evidence to justify claims that BP and others on the Deepwater Horizon took shortcuts on safety to save money : `` To date , we have not found a single instance where human beings made a conscious decision to favor dollars over safety . '' Bartlit , appointed by Barak Obama , had led the investigation into the 1988 Piper Alpha disaster in the North Sea , when 167 workers died . He was immediately accused by lawyers for Deepwater Horizon victims , environmentalists and Democrats in Congress of letting the oil company off the hook . But in an angry session with reporters he insisted he was not clearing BP , Transocean and Halliburton of responsibility for the disaster . `` Any time you are talking about $ 1.5 m a day , money enters into it . All I am saying is that human beings did not sit there and sell human safety down the river for dollars that night , '' he said . Bartlit complained repeatedly during his presentation that he did not have subpoena powers and had to rely on the goodwill of oil firm . `` I wish I had that power because I think it 's damned important but that 's the way it goes , '' he said . The Senate refused to grant such powers . The commission 's version of events , which agreed 90 % with the conclusions of BP 's internal investigations , runs counter to the narrative developed in congressional investigations that the firm regularly took safety short cuts to save money . `` When the culture of a company favors risk-taking and cutting corners above other concerns , systemic failures like this oil spill disaster result without direct decisions being made or trade-offs being considered , '' Ed Markey , a Democratic congressman who led investigations into the spill , said in a statement . In a long and detailed re-enactment of events leading up to the explosion , Bartlit and his team outlined a clear trail where disaster could have been averted . The team also questioned executives from BP , Transocean and Halliburton . The investigation produced 13 findings on the path to the disaster . Eleven men died when the rig exploded , releasing nearly 5m barrels of oil and gas into the Gulf of Mexico . The Macondo well was from the start a challenging one . BP had intended to drill even deeper but stopped at 18,360 ft because of the difficulties of preventing oil seeping into the surrounding rock . But despite those early difficulties BP , Transocean , and Halliburton overlooked warning signs several times during drilling . The investigation singled out the crew 's decision to overlook the results of a negative pressure test on the well , hours before the 20 April explosion , which showed a faulty cement seal . `` The well was flowing . Hydrocarbons were leaking , but for whatever reason the crew after three hours that night decided it was a good negative pressure test , '' said Sean Grimsley , Bartlit 's associate . `` The question is , why these experienced men out on that rig talked themselves into believing that was a good test which established well integrity . '' The failure is even more striking given BP and Halliburton knew by 20 April that the cement seal on the well was defective . `` People knew there was one barrier . The well was under-balanced and that called for heightened high vigilance , '' Grimsley said . `` People knew you had to be really careful . '' cents The cement seal at the bottom of the well failed to hold back oil and gas in the reservoir , and should have been redesigned . cents BP and Transocean interpreted the failed negative pressure test as a success . cents BP introduced additional safety risks in its plan to shut down the drilling rig . cents Crews on the rig and in offshore offices should have picked up warnings on monitors that gas was rising from the well . cents Rapid response at that time could have prevented a blowout . Many conclusions mirror those of BP 's internal investigation , and Bartlit said he agreed with 90 % of it . The most significant conclusions for BP could be the finding that the leak rose through the drill pipe rather than the space between the casing and the rock formation . That supports BP 's contention that its well design was not a contributing factor in the explosion . Some analysts have said BP 's choice of a `` long string '' well design which was cheaper increased the risk of oil and gas escaping the pipe . But Bartlit said he was inclined to agree with BP . Yesterday 's session was the most dramatic of the five public hearings , as Bartlit strode across the floor , holding up pieces of drilling equipment . The commission is to produce its final report on 11 January . By its own admission , the commission 's investigations are not exhaustive . He admitted at times he was unable to come to a conclusion when faced with different versions of events from BP , Transocean , Halliburton and the other oil companies involved .

Photograph : Gerald Herbert\\/AP BP and the other companies involved in the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster were operating under a `` culture of complacency '' and need top-to-bottom reform , the head of the presidential investigation into the oil spill said today . A day after releasing preliminary findings on the causes of the fatal explosion on the Deepwater Horizon the first of multiple inquiries William Reilly , co-chair of the commission , was scathing about the safety regime on board the Deepwater Horizon . Reilly said there was `` emphatically not a culture of safety on that rig '' . He added : `` I referred to a culture of complacency and speaking for myself , all these companies we heard from displayed it . '' Bob Graham , the commission 's other co-chair and a former senator , said : `` There were a series of almost incredible failures in the days and hours leading up to the disaster . '' On Monday , the commission 's chief investigator , Fred Bartlit , uncovered a string of bad judgments by all three companies , BP , Transocean and Halliburton , during the last days of the rig . Eleven men were killed in the 20 April explosion , which sent nearly 5m barrels of oil spewing into the Gulf . The bad calls on the rig included : going ahead despite a faulty cement seal at the bottom of the well ; overlooking a failed pressure test ; replacing heavy drilling mud -LRB- compounds used to lubricate and cool wells during drilling -RRB- with seawater ; and failing to notice monitors , on board and onshore , showing a strong kick of gas . These were warning signs that the well was about to blow . Much of the scrutiny focused on the company 's plan to temporarily plug the well , which investigators with the presidential commission say added to the risk of a blowout . Plugging the well is a procedure used to seal it off until the company comes back to produce oil and gas . Experts questioned BP 's use of a single plug in the process . Charlie Williams , a chief scientist with Shell Energy Resources , said his company used a minimum of three plugs in its deepwater wells . Reilly described the narrative , developed by Bartlit in a courtroom style that drew on sophisticated graphics and questioning of executives from the three companies , as `` ghastly '' . Bartlit said he found no concrete evidence that any of those mistakes were motivated by cost a conclusion that drew angry criticism from Democrats in Congress . But he also noted that time and money were always factors because of the huge costs associated with offshore drilling . `` Any time you are talking about $ 1.5 m -LRB- # 935,000 -RRB- a day , money enters into it . '' Panel members also said that BP was hurried and made confusing , last-minute changes to plans that were unusual in the complex environment of deep-water drilling . They said BP could have operated more safely if it had taken the time to get the necessary equipment and materials . `` We are aware of what appeared to be a rush to completion , '' Reilly said . What is unclear , he added , was what drove people to determine that they could not wait for equipment and materials to perform operations more safely . Today 's proceedings are devoted to developing a safety culture of offshore drilling , with two other oil companies , Exxon and Shell , talking about their safety protocols . But Reilly put BP in a category of its own . `` BP has been notoriously challenged on matters of process safety , '' Reilly said . `` Other companies may not be so challenged . '' The panel is due to release its final report on 11 January , but it has been pressing hard for the Senate to grant Bartlit powers to issue subpoenas for more rigorous questioning of the oil companies . A number of those who were on the rig have refused to talk to the investigators .

Photograph : Toby Melville\\/Reuters Tony Hayward , the former chief executive of BP , has said that if he had a degree in acting from `` Rada rather than a degree in geology I may have done better '' in handling the fallout from the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster . Giving his first in-depth interview about his handling of the crisis , he also told the BBC , in a documentary to be broadcast tonight : `` You know it 's very difficult to hate a company , it 's much easier to hate an individual . '' Hayward was vilified particularly in the US after he made a series of public relations gaffes . During one tour of the stricken Gulf , he famously said : `` I want my life back . '' He also told the Guardian , in comments which were reported around the world , that the amount of oil which had leaked into the Gulf was `` relatively tiny '' compared with the `` very big ocean '' . The disaster , which killed 11 workers , resulted in the world 's biggest accidental marine oil spill . Hayward expressed his anger at the hostility of some of the media coverage , such as when he was seen on a yacht at Cowes in July during a rare trip home . `` I have to confess , at the time I was pretty angry actually . I had n't seen my son for three months . I was on the boat for six hours , between the hours of midnight and six o'clock in the morning US time and I 'm not certain I 'd do anything different . I wanted to see my son . The only way I could see my son was to be with him on a boat race he was on .

'' The hour-long BBC2 documentary at 9pm tonight called `` BP : the $ 30bn Blow-Out '' also delves into the history of BP , which last year produced more oil than any other non-state controlled company . Hayward also becomes the first senior company figure to publicly acknowledge the severity of the financial crisis faced by BP in June , when the size of the spill had increased by 10 times in the space of a few weeks and BP was under pressure from the White House to suspend dividend payments . `` Prior to the meeting with the White House the capital markets were effectively closed to BP , we were not able to borrow in the capital markets , either short or medium term debt at all , '' he said . '' It was a classic financial crisis issue . It was n't about the cash flow of the company it was about the liquidity . '' Bob Dudley , who took over from Hayward as chief executive on 1 October , also agreed to be interviewed for the program . It is understood that Lord Browne , who preceded Hayward , declined a request by the program makers to be interviewed . Browne 's reputation was tarnished by a string of accidents in the US which hastened his retirement .

Photograph : Christopher Berkey\\/EPA The White House rewrote a department of the interior report to suggest wrongly that independent experts had endorsed a six-month ban on deepwater drilling after the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster , an official report has said . The report , from the department 's inspector general , is bound to further inflame Republicans in Congress who have said the ban was politically motivated , and who are demanding an investigation into the White House energy and climate adviser , Carol Browner . Between 2am and 3am on 27 May , aides to Browner produced two different edits of the executive summary to a report on recommendations for drilling safety . Both versions altered the text significantly to make it appear as if a seven-member panel of scientists and engineers supported the drilling ban . The inspector general 's report said : `` The White House edit of the original DoI draft executive summary led to the implication that the moratorium recommendation had been peer-reviewed by the experts . '' But the experts had not been consulted on the wisdom of a drilling ban , and were instead asked for technical advice on a separate list of safety recommendations . The report makes no judgment on why the White House would have made changes that significantly altered the meaning of the executive summary . After complaints from the experts and pressure from Republicans , the interior secretary , Ken Salazar , issued three separate apologies to the experts in a letter , a conference call and a face-to-face meeting last June . `` There was no intent to mislead the public . The decision to impose a temporary moratorium on deepwater drilling was made by the secretary following consultation with colleagues including the White House , '' Kendra Barkoff , an interior department spokeswoman , said in a statement . A White House official said three of the experts accepted that the editing changes were a misunderstanding . However , the inspector general 's report challenges a core principle of the Obama administration , to be guided by the science and to operate transparently , as a corrective to the allegations of politicisation of environmental policy under George W Bush . Browner has been accused by the presidential investigation into the BP oil spill and others of misrepresenting official reports related to the disaster . Last August on TV , Browner introduced a report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency , claiming that threequarters of the leaked crude oil in the Gulf had been cleaned up . But the report itself did not make that claim , conceding that half the oil was still in the Gulf . The administration 's ban , which affected 33 wells , produced a huge controversy , with Louisiana complaining it was putting hundreds of local jobs at risk . Republicans said the ban was politically motivated , and have said they will investigate the decision-making behind the moratorium when they take control of the House of Representatives in January . Fred Upton , a Michigan Republican likely to take over the energy and commerce committee , has been pushing for some time to bring Browner up before Congress . The original wording of the executive summary , sent to the White House for review late on the night of May 26 , mentioned the drilling ban ordered by the interior secretary , Ken Salazar , on the first page . The reference to 22 safety recommendations , approved by the expert team , was on the second page . Browner 's staff made significant changes to the draft executive summary on the night of 26 May . But in both versions staff moved up the paragraph discussing the technical experts support for new safety recommendations so it appeared directly underneath the drilling ban . `` Both versions , however , revised and re-ordered the executive summary , placing the peer review language immediately following the moratorium recommendation causing the distinction between the secretary 's moratorium recommendation which had not been peer-reviewed and the recommendations contained in the 30-Day Report which had been peer-reviewed to become effectively lost , '' the report said . The interior department approved the White House changes . But on 3 June , the interior department deputy secretary David Hayes wrote to the experts to apologise . `` We did not mean to imply that you also agreed with the decision to impose a moratorium on all new deepwater drilling , '' the letter said . The investigation was ordered after the experts complained that their views had been misrepresented , and that they had never been asked to weigh in on the drilling ban . Elizabeth Birnbaum , who then headed the offshore drilling regulatory agency , was also not directly consulted about a deepwater ban , the report said .

Photograph : Toby Melville\\/Reuters The former boss of BP admitted last night that the oil giant had been completely unprepared for the Gulf of Mexico accident that nearly sank it financially . When the crisis hit , BP was forced to make up its oil spill disaster response as it went along , something that made it look `` fumbling '' and `` incompetent '' in the eyes of the public , said Tony Hayward . `` Embarrassingly we found ourselves having to improvise on prime-time TV and slap bang in the middle of the glare of the global media . `` Our efforts involved amazing feats of engineering tasks completed in days that would normally take months , numerous major innovations with lasting benefits . `` But because every move was scrutinised around the world , what the public thought they saw was fumbling and incompetence . '' The admissions came in a speech to students at the Cambridge Union in which Hayward went on to claim corporate complacency spreads across an industry that has repeatedly denied these allegations when made by environmental critics . `` For me perhaps the most shattering reflection was just how much havoc can be wreaked by a single accident in one small part of a giant company 's operations an accident moreover that all our corporate deliberations had told us simply could not happen , '' he said . `` For BP this was the ultimate low-probability , high-impact event a black swan to borrow a term used in the financial crisis . '' But BP was not the only company at risk from such an event , he added . `` The whole industry had been lulled into a sense of false security after 20 years of drilling in deep water without a serious accident , till now , '' said Hayward , in criticism which will be challenged by oil rivals who have tried to distance themselves from the behavior of the British oil group . Hayward admitted the contingency plans drawn up by the company were completely inadequate . `` While we were able to mount a massive response to contain and disperse the oil on the surface we did not have the equipment to contain and disperse on the seabed . In fact the equipment had never been designed or built . It simply did not exist , '' he said . Hayward 's comments will ignite debate in environmental and political circles about the oil industry 's fitness to operate , especially in pristine environments such as the Arctic . The oil industry has always argued that safety come firsts but Hayward 's comments seriously undermine this claim . Environmentalists have long challenged the responsible nature of big oil and politicians too have expressed concern since the April 20 accident involving the Deepwater Horizon rig which had a massive blow out killing 11 workers and causing the worst environmental accident in US history . Barack Obama banned deep water drilling in the gulf for a period but has just given the industry permission to restart . In Europe a debate still rages inside the Europe Union about whether there should be tougher controls on oil companies drilling wells in areas such as West of Shetlands . The European Energy Commissioner proposed tougher measures but the moves were headed off by a UK government that insists its own safety regulations are among the toughest in the world . Hayward was removed from his post as BP chief executive on 1 October . He is now a non-executive director of TNK-BP , the UK\\/Russian joint venture while his place has been taken at the BP group by a first American to take the post : Bob Dudley . Hayward , vilified in the US media over the spill , has been on a PR offensive to try and salvage some of his reputation . He told the BBC in a documentary screened on Tuesday night that he would have needed to study drama at RADA rather than geology at Edinburgh University if he had wanted to perform better in front of a hostile US public . He has repeatedly been accused by critics of making insensitive or unfortunate comments but told the BBC that he sincerely believed that nothing he said would have changed the outcome for BP . cents This article was amended on 11 November 2010 .

The oil giant was fined and put on probation over a spill from corroded pipes in 2006 . Photograph : Al Grillo\\/AP BP is facing new fines in connection with its criminal conviction for a huge oil spill on Alaska 's North Slope in 2006 . Federal probation officer Mary Frances Barnes argued in an Anchorage federal court yesterday that a second spill in Alaska in November last year constituted a violation of its probation . In 2006 , a corroded pipeline leaked 200,000 gallons of oil on to the tundra in the worst leak in the history of the North Slope . The company was sentenced to three years ' probation and ordered to pay $ 20m -LRB- # 12.5 m -RRB- in criminal penalties and restitution . The leak in 2009 occurred when a pipeline at the BP-operated Lisburne oil field burst , leaking nearly 46,000 gallons of crude and oily water near Prudhoe Bay , Alaska . After roughly 165 days of low-temperature warnings , BP found ice in the pipe . Fifteen days later , operators discovered the rupture . Investigators said BP operators had `` failed to respond to the alarms and failed to investigate or troubleshoot the cause of the alarms '' and argued that BP should have known better , as it had suffered a similar ruptures in other frozen pipelines as far back as 2001 . The troubled oil giant disputes the characterisation of its operations . `` We 've made measurable improvements in safety and reliability , '' BP spokesman Steve Rinehart told the Anchorage Daily News . Among other things , the company argued , it had replaced corroded transit pipelines with new lines at a cost of $ 500m . Still , the ruling will only increase scrutiny of the British firm , which recently estimated that the more recent Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico this summer would end up costing it $ 40bn . Earlier this month , the investigative journal ProPublica revealed that BP 's own internal maintenance reports had documented that at least 148 its pipelines on the North Slope received an `` F-rank '' because of corrosion . According to one welder , some of BP 's pipes `` have hundreds of patches on them . '' After that report was published , a BP spokesman explained that an `` F '' ranking does not imply that an accident is imminent . `` It does prompt a higher priority repair plan depending on technical details and engineering review , '' Rinehart said . The latest report will add to pressure on the company : in addition to costs relating the Gulf of Mexico spill , it was fined $ 50m in August over a 2005 refinery explosion in Texas City that killed 15 people and injured 170 . But the latest ruling is unlikely to affect the firm 's Alaskan operations , which the company plans to sell as part of a $ 30bn program to raise money to meet costs relating to Deepwater Horizon spill . BP said it will respond to the government 's legal filings at a hearing on December 20 .

Photograph : Jim Young\\/Reuters BP 's damages bill for the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster could be much smaller than expected after it was revealed that half the claims made so far to the $ 20bn -LRB- # 12.7 bn -RRB- compensation fund either have no supporting documents or `` woefully inadequate '' ones . Ken Feinberg , appointed by the White House to run the claims process , announced the figures today , adding that BP would be able to automatically challenge any individual claim of more than $ 500,000 . Although BP has set aside $ 20bn to pay all `` legitimate claims '' from the biggest accidental offshore oil spill , privately it thinks that its final compensation bill will be significantly lower . Tuesday was the deadline for emergency claims covering the last six months . The fund will now start accepting final lump-sum claims , which require recipients to waive the right to sue BP . Feinberg said he would end up making $ 2.3 bn of emergency payments to 175,000 claimants . Before he took over the process from BP in late August , the company had paid out less than $ 400m in four months . The fund has received 450,000 claims in the last three months . Many of these are from fishermen or others involved in the fishing industry , which was banned from operating in large parts of the gulf before the leaking well was capped . Feinberg said that of these claims , 125,000 were submitted with no accompanying documents , such as tax receipts to show proof of typical earnings . A further 100,000 were submitted with `` woefully inadequate '' documents , while a further 1,000 suspected fraudulent claims have been referred to the Department of Justice . Many fishermen and oyster catchers in the gulf are from the largely unassimilated and poor Vietnamese community which has settled in Louisiana . Many do not speak English and do not keep records of income or pay tax , typically selling their catch for cash . They are unlikely to receive any damages , Feinberg has indicated , even if their claims are legitimate . Most fishing restrictions in the gulf have been lifted , with only about 1,000 square miles nearest to the damaged well remaining closed . Oyster beds have been severely damaged and it may take at least three years before the crop returns to pre-spill levels . Those involved in the tourism industry such as owners of beach homes have also filed claims . Beaches in the gulf are now clean but some resort owners still expect takings to be down by as much as half next summer . Daniel Becnel , from New Orleans based Becnel Law Firm , said : `` Feinberg wants to give the money away . That is what it 's there for . Most people are going to stick with Feinberg . He is being fair . But fishermen , oystermen and other people in the food industry are screwed because most operate on a cash basis and do n't keep sales or tax receipts . '' Becnel added that he expected most claimants to apply for final lump sums based on estimated future damages or lost earnings related to the spill over the next three years . Claimants can also opt to receive quarterly cheques over the next three years instead , until the fund is wound up , leaving them free to sue BP for extra damages . Feinberg said that BP had not yet exercised its right to appeal against any claims made over $ 500,000 . He added that it was possible that BP could recover all payouts from other companies if they are found to be responsible for the spill .

BP 's safety lapses have been labeled ` chronic ' . Photograph : Sipa Press\\/Rex Features Bad management and a communications breakdown by BP and its Macondo well partners caused the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico , the White House oil spill commission said today . A report to the commission said safety lapses were `` chronic '' at the company and improvements to its systems still needed to be made . In its final public deliberations before delivering its findings to Barack Obama next month , the commission said the fatal blowout on BP 's well could have been avoided . `` The series of decisions that doomed Macondo evidenced a failure of management , and good management could have avoided a catastrophe , '' William Reilly , the co-chair of the investigation , said . A report by expert staff said all three companies BP , Halliburton , and Transocean were guilty of bad management . `` Most of the mistakes and oversights that led to the blowout were the result of management failures by BP , Halliburton Co , and Transocean Ltd , '' the staff concluded . However , the commission singled out BP for failing to ensure its cost-cutting measures did not further increase risks in an already dangerous environment . Further unchecked cost-cutting would mean `` financial pressures will likely bias decisions in favor of time and cost savings '' , technical staff said . The report , which reviewed seven accidents in the US and UK over the past decade , said : `` BP safety lapses appear to be chronic ; its systems safety engineering and safety culture still need improvement . '' The commission is holding its last public hearings today and tomorrow before delivering the official report on the blowout and clean-up effort to Obama in January . The commission went on to fault the three companies for poor communications . It said they failed to share important information which meant they did not fully appreciate the risks they were taking in the final days of the Deepwater Horizon . But the blame did not stop with the oil industry . The commission said there were huge gaps in monitoring offshore drilling . Oil companies are not even required to report accidents unless they are on the scale of the blowout out at BP 's Macondo well . `` Macondo was n't the black swan .

The prospect of BP facing even greater costs over the worst offshore oil spill in American history knocked 15p off its share price , which dropped to 461.1 p. This wiped around # 2.8 bn off BP 's market capitalization . The suit is seeking fines and penalties under the Clean Water Act to cover the damage caused by the oil spill . That could potentially lead to a fines of up to $ 4,300 for each barrel of oil released into the Gulf if the courts find the company grossly negligent . The US estimates that nearly 5 million barrels of oil spewed into the ocean - suggesting a potential fine of $ 20bn -LRB- # 12.8 bn -RRB- . BP has warned last month the disaster could cost it $ 40bn in clean-up costs , compensation and a likely fine . But the ongoing uncertainty over the spill appears to have unsettled the market David Buik , City commentator at BGC Partners warned that the lawsuit could `` run for a decade '' , unless BP can agree a deal with the Department of Justice . There would of course be a price that BP might be prepared to agree to allow everyone to get on with their lives . We will all wait with bated breath . Last night BP 's shares initially fell 2.6 % in New York , but closed only 1.3 % down at the close . This lawsuit is surely in the price ? It may be the 2nd half of 2011 before the DOJ tells us the cost of the gross negligence . BP 's shares were worth 650p before the Deepwater Horizon rig caught fire and sank , and hit a low of 298p before the leak was finally capped . The lawsuit claims that BP , and the other companies involved with the well , had violated safety regulations prior to the blast in which 11 men died , and failed to monitor conditions during the drill .

Attorney General Eric Holder announced on Wednesday that the US government is suing several companies involved for damages . Photograph : Ann Heisenfelt\\/EPA A disaster as large as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico can not be remediated through the courts but we can still sue the bastards . This is America , after all . The US department of justice has filed a civil lawsuit against BP and associated companies like Anadarko and Transocean for damages resulting from the Deepwater Horizon explosion that erupted on 20 April , and spewed nearly 5m barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico before it was capped on 15 July . The suit cites damage to the Gulf 's natural resources , wildlife and their associated human activities . These natural resources do n't just have aesthetic value for a few bird watchers ; they have economic value , too . As much as we like to think of ourselves as insulated from nature , we still depend on the complex marine ecosystem for our sustenance , all the way down to the plankton at the bottom of the food chain . The oil executives may tell us we need to be pragmatic in considering the economic effects of environmental controls , but the disaster has already had a pretty big practical effect on the shrimpers , who had 4,200 square miles of Gulf waters closed to their boats last month after tar balls were found in their nets . The lawsuit , announced by Attorney General Eric Holder , did not specify damages sought , noting ominously -LRB- pdf -RRB- : `` The full extent of potential injuries , destruction , loss and loss of services is not yet fully known and may not be fully known for many years . '' In other words , this could take a while . But if the suit takes five or ten years to wind its way through the courts , is it worth it ? According to the old saying , justice delayed is justice denied . But the suit does n't have to be resolved quickly for it to affect corporate behavior . BP has already set up a $ 20bn compensation fund for those affected by the mess . The justice department lawsuit is n't intended to compensate victims , but to give pause to those managers who are too willing to cut corners on safety . And in the meanwhile , the companies will have to set aside enormous reserves against legal losses , and carry the reserves on their books until all claims are settled . BP 's shares fell 3 % on the news of the lawsuit . With luck , the oil and gas companies ' risk managers will look at the numbers and tell the engineers to tighten up on their safety procedures . Even if the lawyers are successful in suing the perpetrators of this spill , though , we still have larger problems with the energy industry . Maybe the lawyers can help prevent future explosions like the one on the Deepwater Horizon , but the planet is still on a slow boil from the burning of fossil fuels .

Photograph : AFP\\/Getty Images Striking resemblances between BP 's Gulf of Mexico disaster and a little-reported giant gas leak in Azerbaijan experienced by the UK firm 18 months beforehand have emerged from leaked US embassy cables . The cables reveal that some of BP 's partners in the gas field were upset that the company was so secretive about the incident that it even allegedly withheld information from them . They also say that BP was lucky that it was able to evacuate its 212 workers safely after the incident , which resulted in two fields being shut and output being cut by at least 500,000 barrels a day with production disrupted for months . Other cables leaked tonight claim that the president of Azerbaijan accused BP of stealing $ 10bn of oil from his country and using `` mild blackmail '' to secure the rights to develop vast gas reserves in the Caspian Sea region . WikiLeaks also released cables claiming that : cents Senior figures in Thailand are concerned about the suitability of the crown prince to become king , citing rumors that he has lovers in several European capitals in addition to his wife and son in Thailand . cents American energy firm Chevron was in discussions with Tehran about developing an Iraq-Iran cross-border oilfield , despite US sanctions against Iran . The leaks came as the whistleblower site 's founder Julian Assange prepared for another night in jail ahead of tomorrow 's high court challenge to the decision to grant him # 200,000 bail . Swedish authorities , who want to question Assange on allegations of sexual assault , believe he should remain in custody as he is a flight risk . On the Azerbaijan gas leak , acable reports for the first time that BP suffered a blowout in September 2008 , as it did in the Gulf with devastating consequences in April , as well as the gas leak that the firm acknowledged at the time . Written a few weeks after the incident , the cable said Bill Schrader , BP 's then head of Azerbaijan , admitted it was possible the company `` would never know '' the cause although it `` is continuing to methodically investigate possible theories '' . According to another cable , in January 2009 BP thought that a `` bad cement job '' was to blame for the gas leak in Azerbaijan . More recently , BP 's former chief executive Tony Hayward also partly blamed a `` bad cement job '' by contractor Halliburton for the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico . The blowout in the Gulf led to the deaths of 11 workers and the biggest accidental offshore oil spill in history . BP was also criticised for not initially sharing all its information with the US authorities about the scale of the Gulf spill . The gas field in the Caspian Sea was in production when the leak and blow out occured , unlike the well in the Gulf which was being drilled to explore for oil . BP declined to answer questions put by the Guardian about the cause of the Azerbaijan gas leak and who carried out the cement job , pointing to a general statement it had made about the cables . The cable reveals that the company had a narrow escape . `` Given the explosive potential , BP was quite fortunate to have been able to evacuate everyone safely and to prevent any gas ignition . Schrader said although the story had n't caught the press 's attention , it had the full focus of the -LRB- government of Azerbaijan -RRB- , which was losing ' $ 40-50m each day ' . '' The leak happened at the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshi -LRB- ACG -RRB- field , Azerbaijan 's largest producing oil field in the Caspian where vast undeveloped gas reserves also lie . BP is the operator and largest shareholder in the consortium , which includes US companies Chevron , ExxonMobil and Hess -LRB- formerly Amerada Hess -RRB- , as well as Norwegian firm Statoil and Azerbaijani state owned oil company Socar . BP comes in for criticism for allegedly limiting the information it made available about the incident . Another cable records shortly after the incident : `` ACG operator BP has been exceptionally circumspect in disseminating information about the ACG gas leak , both to the public and to its ACG partners . However , after talking with BP and other sources , the embassy has pieced together the following picture . '' It goes on to say the incident took place when bubbles appeared in the waters around the Central Azeri platform , signalling a nearby gas leak . `` Shortly thereafter , a related gas-reinjection well for Central Azeri had a blowout , expelling water , mud and gas . '' BP 's annual report last year referred to a `` comprehensive review of the subsurface gas release '' having taken place and remedial work being carried out . The cable continues : `` At least some of BP 's ACG partners are similarly upset with BP 's performance in this episode , as they claim BP has sought to limit information flow about this event even to its ACG partners . Although it is too early to ascertain the cause , if in fact this production shutdown was due to BP technical error , and if it continues for months -LRB- as seems possible -RRB- , BP 's reputation in Azerbaijan will take a serious hit . '' BP is in charge of Azerbaijan 's key energy projects , and has a significant influence across the region . In late 2006 discussions were taking place about when Turkey would be able to link up its own network to a new pipeline operated by BP transporting gas across the Caucasus from BP 's giant new Shah Deniz field in Azerbaijan . The new pipeline was seen as crucial as reducing the region 's dependence on unreliable gas supplies from Russia , particularly amidst rising gas prices . According to one cable , BP 's outgoing Azerbaijan president , David Woodward , said in November 2006 that BP thought it unlikely that Turkey would be able to complete its work before spring 2007 . `` However , he added that ` it was not inconceivable ' that Botas -LRB- Turkey 's state pipeline company -RRB- could ` rush finish ' the job so that it would be ready to receive gas shortly , although the pipeline would not meet international standards , '' the cable said . In the end , BP said Turkey began receiving gas from Shah Deniz in July 2007 . BP officials also complained about a shortage of Navy and Coast Guard boats mostly Soviet era and built in the 1960s and 1970s to patrol the waters around the platforms . It was also not clear which government agency or branch of the military was in charge , meaning a `` response to a crisis offshore could be problematic '' , one cable in August 2008 recorded . The oil firm said BP `` enjoys the continued support and goodwill of the government and the people of Azerbaijan '' . The oil firm said in a statement that : `` BP continues to have a successful and mutually beneficial partnership with the government of Azerbaijan . This cooperation has produced and contunues to produce benefits to all parties involved and most importantly to the nation of Azerbaijan . The Government of Azerbaijan has entrusted us with the development of its major oil and gas development projects on the basis of Production Sharing Agreements -LRB- PSAs -RRB- that are enacted as laws in Azerbaijan . The operatorship of PSAs of this scale and size require cooperation and alignment between contractors and the Government . BP in Azerbaijan enjoys the continued support and goodwill of the Government and the people of Azerbaijan to meet its obligations .

Photograph : Gerald Herbert\\/AP BP is more likely to escape the potentially ruinous charge of gross negligence , according to City analysts , after a powerful US commission blamed `` systemic '' causes for the Gulf of Mexico disaster . Barack Obama 's national commission released part of its final report into the disaster last night on Wednesday night . The report , to be published next week , could influence several other parallel investigations into the spill that are yet to finish . The commission was scathing in its criticism of BP , as well as its contractors Halliburton and Transocean , which it blamed for a collective `` failure of management '' . But it added that it had found no evidence that the blowout which led to last April 's disaster was the result of `` aberrational decisions made by rogue industry or government officials '' . Commission co-chair William K Reilly said : `` So a key question posed from the outset by this tragedy is , do we have a single company , BP , that blundered with fatal consequences , or a more pervasive problem of a complacent industry ? Given the documented failings of both Transocean and Halliburton , both of which serve the offshore industry in virtually every ocean , I reluctantly conclude we have a system-wide problem . '' Analysts said that blaming the oil industry , and not singling out BP , would help the company in its fight against being found guilty of gross negligence . But industry and legal sources told the Guardian that BP would still have to strike a deal out of court to settle myriad lawsuits . Separately , the US justice department has launched a civil action against BP and is investigating potential criminal violations . BP shares rose by more than 2 % during morning trading in London but finished the day slightly down . Analysts expect BP to resume paying dividends which were suspended last summer under intense White House pressure when it reports full-year results on 1 February , as the company tries to move on from the disaster . Before the spill the company paid out $ 10bn -LRB- # 6.5 bn -RRB- annually to shareholders but it is likely to resume dividends at only half that level . Investors could receive dividends for the last quarter of 2010 as soon as March . Analyst Peter Hitchens , of stockbroker Panmure Gordon , said : `` The national commission 's report is another chink of light for BP . BP was named and held responsible in the report but it also said ` we ca n't solely blame BP ' . `` It 's hinting that there wo n't be a finding of gross negligence . What seems to be coming through is there was an unfortunate string of accidents which led to the disaster . BP had a near-death experience . But time is a great healer for BP , it seems . '' The national commission report was also highly critical of the now-disbanded offshore regulator , the Minerals Management Service -LRB- MMS -RRB- , which it previously accused of giving a higher priority to increasing production in the gulf than to safety . The full report , to be released on Tuesday , is likely to recommend a radical overhaul of the regulatory regime to improve offshore drilling . Charlie Kronick , a spokesman for Greenpeace , said : `` The report sets up a big flag that the regulatory regime is going to be much tighter . The new regulator has already indicated that it wo n't be a permit-fest once new guidelines for offshore drilling are drawn up . '' But he said that pointing the finger at BP 's contractors should not exonerate the company from blame . `` Halliburton and Transocean were operating on BP 's behalf . It 's hard to see how that lets BP off the hook . '' If BP avoids a charge of gross negligence it will be able to charge its junior partners in the fateful Macondo well Anadarko and Mitsui for a third of the costs . US federal fines would triple under a gross negligence finding , with JP Morgan estimating that the total bill for BP under this scenario could be as high as $ 69bn . BP has made good progress in its program of selling assets worth $ 25-30bn , having netted about $ 20bn so far .

Photograph : Gerald Herbert\\/AP The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico was an avoidable disaster caused in part by a series of cost-cutting decisions made by BP and its partners , the White House oil commission has concluded . In a preview of its final report , due next week , the national oil spill commission said systemic management failure at BP , Transocean , and Halliburton caused the blow-out in the Gulf of Mexico , and warned that such a disaster would likely recur because of industry complacency . Many of the poor decisions taken on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig before the fatal blow-out on 20 April were taken to save time and money . `` Whether purposeful or not , many of the decisions that BP , Halliburton , and Transocean made that increased the risk of the Macondo blowout clearly saved those companies significant time -LRB- and money -RRB- , '' the report said . In a separate chart , it identified nine decisions that increased risk ; seven of these saved the companies time . BP was involved in all nine decisions . BP , which owned the well , did not enforce the proper controls to manage those increased risks , the report said . `` BP did not have adequate controls in place to ensure that key decisions in the months leading up to the blow-out were safe or sound from an engineering perspective . '' It continued on the same theme , concluding : `` Most of the mistakes and oversights at Macondo can be traced back to a single overarching failure a failure of management . '' In earlier pronouncements , the commission 's chairmen have suggested a culture of complacency ruled on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig and in the oil industry . `` This disaster likely would not have happened had the companies involved been guided by an unrelenting commitment to safety first , '' commission co-chairman Bob Graham , said in a statement . `` And it likely would not have happened if the responsible governmental regulators had the capacity and will to demand world-class safety standards . '' On 11 January , the seven-member commission will publish its full report into the causes of the blow-out , which killed 11 men and spewed 4.9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf . Its findings could prove critical to the civil lawsuit filed last month by the US Justice Department against BP , Transocean and other companies involved in the spill for damages to the environment , as well as the hundreds of lawsuits filed by Gulf residents who have lost their livelihoods because of the spill . The report warned that BP and the other companies could be liable for billions more in compensation to people who have lost money because of the oil spill , and for damage to natural resources . The explosion was caused by a sudden kick of gas through the 5,000 ft riser pipe connecting the well to the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that another investigation found went undetected for several crucial moments . The report identified a series of mistakes that , it said , eventually made the blow-out `` inevitable . '' It paid particular attention to the faulty cementing job , performed by Halliburton , at the bottom of the well . But it blamed BP for failing to exercise proper oversight over the cementing job , and for misreading a pressure test that indicated the well had not been properly sealed . `` Based on evidence currently available , there is nothing to suggest that BP 's engineering team conducted a formal , disciplined analysis of the combined impact of these risk factors on the prospects for a successful cement job , '' the report said . It also criticised BP 's choice of a long string well design . BP crew were also wrong to replace heavy drilling mud in the riser pipe with lighter seawater before the well was properly sealed , the report said . Transocean also came in for criticism for failing to communicate to its crew the risks of deepwater drilling even after a near-miss only months earlier . BP said in a statement that it was working with government regulators to ensure that the experience in the Gulf led to improved practices . Transocean tried to shift the blame to BP and government . `` The procedures being conducted in the final hours were crafted and directed by BP engineers and approved in advance by federal regulators , '' a company statement said . Halliburton , which has previously criticised commission lab tests finding a faulty cement seal , said the commission had made use of selective information .

Photograph : Gerald Herbert\\/AP The huge quantities of methane gas that bubbled out of BP 's broken well in the Gulf of Mexico were eaten up almost entirely by undersea microbes by the end of August , a new study reports today . Other scientists cautioned that much oil remained on the ocean floor , where it has penetrated deep into the sediment , as well as in fragile marshlands . Oil is still turning up in tar balls on beaches and in fishermen 's nets . But the latest study , published in Science , offers an important new piece of information to help resolve the question of what happened to the underwater plume of oil and gas that stretched for miles from BP 's broken well . Yesterday , the White House oil commission , which was set up in June to look into the causes of the disaster , produced a preview of its report to be released next week . It said the spill was avoidable and caused in part by a series of cost-cutting decision made by BP and its partners . Methane is thought to account for 30 % by weight of the output from BP 's blown-out well , and was a major component of a vast plume of oil and gas that formed about 1,000 metres deep . However , contrary to the expectations of the lead researcher in the new study , John Kessler , an oceanographer at Texas A&M University , that the methane would linger for years , nearly all of the gas was consumed by microbes within 120 days of the blow-out . By the time Kessler and his team returned for the second of their three research missions to the Gulf on 18 August , the methane had been scrubbed . `` All of that evidence had pointed to a much longer lifetime of methane in deepwater plumes with a lifespan possibly as long as years , '' he said . `` It was quite surprising . '' Readings on methane and oxygen levels at 207 stations indicated a massive `` bloom '' of methane-eating underwater bacteria sometime between the end of June and the beginning of August . `` It likely occurred after affected waters had flowed away from the wellhead , '' the study said . Kessler said the data suggested that the process of degrading the oil only stopped because the microbes had eaten their way through the methane . `` It appeared that nothing stopped it except for the availability of methane . '' He said the findings also offered good news on the broader concern of climate change . Methane release from the oceans is seen as potential driver of climate change . But the study say any large-scale release would likely trigger the same response from bacteria . The blow-out on the Deepwater Horizon rig last April was caused by a huge bubble of methane gas shooting up the riser pipe from the well on the ocean floor . A government study concluded that BP 's blown-out well spewed 4.9 m barrels of oil into the Gulf -LRB- plus or minus about 10 % -RRB- : the equivalent of twice the crude spilled in the Exxon Valdez accident . BP eventually rigged up a system to siphon oil directly from the broken well to a tanker ship , capturing 820,000 barrels . But even with those efforts , as well as burning and skimming and natural processes such as evaporation , more than 2m barrels of oil remained in the Gulf , according to a study by the Congressional Research Service . The study said the fate of the oil may never be known . The Science paper could help resolve one question , however : what happens when the Gulf 's well-studied community of oil-eating bacteria meets 4.9 m barrels of crude ? `` Apparently there are a number of bacteria in this particular ecosystem which are ready and waiting to take advantage of any hydrocarbon source that may be there , '' said Steve Murawski , who was until this month the chief scientist for NOAA , and had not seen the study . `` It looks like the water column effects are going to be ephemeral . '' Other scientists who had seen the paper ahead of release , however , expressed skepticism of the idea of a sudden spurt in the population of methane-eating microbes three months after the blow-out . The study should also not be construed as an all-clear for the Gulf , scientists warned . A study due later this month from Samantha Joye , a University of Georgia oceanographer , provides evidence that much of the oil not recovered from the Gulf sank to the ocean floor . Joye 's team found heavy deposits of oil in the sediment in a 2,600 sq mile area from the well , including remnants of oil that had been burned on the surface . Under a UV camera , which shows oil as a bright lime green , `` it looks like someone has come with a paintgun and just splotched all over the bottom , '' she said . `` You can visibly see : it lights up like a Christmas tree . '' She also said she had seen dead corals and heavily oiled crabs on the ocean floor . It is also unclear what effect the oil and gas had on marine life such as fish eggs in the deep water before it was consumed by the microbes . `` The book is only partially written here in terms of the impact , '' Murawski said . `` The real question is going to be : did it leave any lasting effects in the ecological population the invertebrates , turtles , whales , fisheries ? '' Several scientists have tried to flesh out the role played by the microbes in scrubbing the Gulf of the oil that never made it to the surface or the shore . A team from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute published a paper in Science last August documenting a 22-mile underwater plume of tiny oil droplets . The team said the oil was very slow to degrade . One week later , Science published a paper from another team , from Lawrence Berkeley labs , saying the plume had been eaten by undersea microbes . By mid-September , the picture shifted once more . A new paper , also involving Kessler and his team , suggested that while ethane and propane were being quickly consumed by bacteria , methane was being consumed at a far slower rate . `` It really is a scientific puzzle , '' said Kessler . `` We are just now beginning to get to a stage to see all the data that has been collected to date , to start to tell a comprehensive story .

Photograph : Ho\\/AFP\\/Getty Images British taxpayers could end up footing the clean-up bill from any major oil spill in UK waters because current rules allow companies to dodge their environmental responsibilities , according to MPs investigating BP 's Gulf of Mexico disaster . And the government ought to require companies to prove that they can pay out billions of pounds in clean-up costs before they are granted exploration and production licences , recommends the committee 's final report , which is published today . It also points to `` serious doubts '' over whether companies ' plans to respond to spills by capping leaking wells and skimming oil from the sea surface would work in the rough Atlantic waters off the west coast of Shetland . The report points to the `` limitations '' of the computer modelling used by oil companies to predict the long-term effects of spills at sea . The Guardian has obtained documents relating to the oil spill response plan of US company Chevron which , in October , was given consent to drill off Shetland . It showed that its modelling software could not simulate spills lasting more than 14 days without crashing . The Gulf of Mexico spill lasted almost three months . The energy and climate change committee held several hearings last year , with witnesses from the oil industry including BP 's former chief executive Tony Hayward environmentalists and politicians all giving evidence . Its report -LRB- UK Deepwater Drilling : Implications of the Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill -RRB- into what lessons could be learned from the BP disaster largely exonerates the UK 's industry and regulatory regime , which it said was much tougher than the one that oversaw the Gulf of Mexico . But it attacks the voluntary oil spill clean-up fund set up by the industry , which can pay out a maximum of $ 250m -LRB- # 161m -RRB- per year , as `` insufficient '' . It only covers `` direct damage '' the definition of which the report says is not clear . `` While membership of the Offshore Pollution Liability Association -LRB- Opol -RRB- remains voluntary ... -LRB- that -RRB- voluntary nature weakens its legality and the control and deployment of its funds . We believe this lack of legal control will allow polluters to claim that damages to biodiversity and ecosystems are indirect , and therefore do not qualify for compensation . '' The report adds : `` We conclude there needs to be clarity on the identity and hierarchy of liable parties to ensure that the government , and hence the taxpayer , do not have to pay for the consequences of offshore incidents . '' The report also says that EU legislation obliging companies to meet their responsibilities over a spill is vague and inconsistent and `` unlikely to bring to account those responsible for environmental damage caused by an offshore incident such as happened in the Gulf of Mexico '' . It adds that the government should work with the EU to draw up new legislation based on the `` polluter pays '' principle . It says that a moratorium on drilling in the UK , as some environmentalists have recommended , would be bad for the British economy . In December Barack Obama , the US president , angered the oil industry when he banned new drilling off the east coast and the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico . However , the committee , which is chaired by Tim Yeo , the Conservative MP and former environment minister , said that the British regulator should consider requiring all blow-out preventers to have a double , rather than a single , set of blind shear rams , which are supposed to cut through the drill pipe to close off the well in the event of a blow-out . BP 's Deepwater Horizon only had one set of blind shear rams , which failed to activate , rendering the blow-out preventer the last line of defense against a major spill useless . Charles Hendry , the energy minister , said that the government would carry out another review of the British offshore safety regime once US investigations had been concluded . Trade body Oil and Gas UK said it was against a requirement for double shear rams and disagreed on the report 's claims on industry clean up funding . The report also urges the government and oil companies to stop the intimidation of rig workers into not reporting safety concerns . The Health and Safety Executive -LRB- HSE -RRB- accused Transocean , the American rig owner at the center of BP 's Gulf of Mexico oil spill , of compromising safety in the North Sea by `` bullying , harassment and intimidation '' of its staff .

Photograph : Facundo Arrizabalaga\\/EPA The report , to be released in full on Tuesday , is utterly damning . The safety failures of BP and its contractors Haliburton and Transocean were `` systemic '' , due to a `` failure of management '' and , without reform , a repeat accident `` may well occur '' . Worse , these are the best operators in the global industry and BP was led by Tony Hayward who , on his appointment as CEO in 2007 , said : `` I promise to focus like a laser on safe and reliable operations . '' That followed another fatal accident at a BP refinery in Texas City in 2005 , as well as a hushed-up blowout in Azerbaijan in 2008 . So the best operators , focusing laser-like on safety , caused the worst offshore oil spill in US history . You can see the problem . But how did we get here ? The world runs on oil , a point made most succinctly by George W Bush of all people , when he described the US 's '' addiction to oil . '' That addiction takes us to the ends of the Earth and the bottom of the ocean in search of the next fix . Drilling in deep oceans for oil and gas is one symptom , from Brazil 's massive pre-salt reserves to the west of Shetland . The filthy squeezing of the black gold from the tar sands of Canada is another , as is the global surge is fracking of oil shales , another dirty business . Surely the higher risks and impacts involved in strangling the dregs of oil and gas out of the Earth would make other , renewable , options preferable ? No , because the costs of the euphemistically dubbed `` unconventional '' sources of fossil fuel are not borne by those who produce or consume them . The only long-term answer is to wean ourselves off oil before the post-peak trouble really starts . It is not easy . It 's amazing stuff : energy-dense and easily transported . But alternatives exist , from electric vehicles to biofuels to fuels generated from sunlight . These need investment , but would we really rather spend billions on clean-up operations and lawyers ?

It was one of the worst spills in history , combining natural destruction , economic damage and even diplomatic tension between London and Washington , as they rowed about BP 's punishment . And , according to the National Oil Spill Commission set up by Barack Obama , it was entirely `` avoidable '' . After reviewing thousands of pages of documents from government and industry -LRB- including company internal documents -RRB- , and interviewing hundreds of officials , oil-industry employees and other witnesses , the commission has found that `` most of the mistakes and oversights at Macondo -LRB- BP 's well -RRB- can be traced back to a single overarching failure a failure of management . Better management by BP , -LRB- and its key contractors -RRB- Halliburton and Transocean would almost certainly have prevented the blowout . '' There will be much argument in coming months and years over what that phrase means , and whether it is true . But the clearest implication is this : the lethal Deepwater blast need never have happened if only BP and its key contractors , three of the biggest and richest firms in the industry , had done their jobs better . That is from a chapter released this week ahead of the full report 's publication next Tuesday but on their own these 48 pages , which convey much technical analysis and argument in clear , cool prose , make for a devastating charge sheet . Seasoned BP-watchers mainly agreed yesterday that the extract was not as bad for the oil giant as it looked , largely because it spared then chief executive Tony Hayward and his staff from accusations of gross negligence . But that is to miss the point . The oil spill commission was never meant to argue any particular case , but to investigate the blowout , its causes and immediate aftermath : not the prosecution so much as the investigating detective . Yet if the rest of the report matches up to this chapter then it will be exhibit A for the US government in its civil lawsuit against BP . What the oil-spill commission makes clear is that drilling the Macondo well was a meticulously planned and well-designed operation which in execution was sometimes rushed to the point of thoughtlessness . Substandard equipment turned up and , rather than wait , the drillers pressed on , with a BP engineer talking about `` the risk\\/reward equation '' and claiming that all would `` probably be fine '' . Behind this under-considered haste lay an overwhelming desire to cut costs . As the report remarks : `` Whether purposeful or not , many of the decisions that BP , Halliburton , and Transocean made that increased the risk of the Macondo blowout clearly saved those companies significant time -LRB- and money -RRB- '' . The commission lists nine key decisions that may have contributed to the disaster : seven of them saved the drillers time , and only two were not made by BP . There is nothing necessarily wrong with companies seeking to do business more efficiently ; but there is everything wrong in cutting corners when the risks are so huge and widespread . That must be unarguable after last April 's disaster . Two more sobering points to consider : first , the three companies named and shamed in the commission report are three of the biggest in the world , and they were operating off the US coastline . Imagine what smaller firms may be up to in less regulated territories . Second , American regulators clearly do not have enough oversight of deep-water drilling . Officials must be called in not just to judge plans for wells , but to closely supervise how those plans are implemented . Otherwise they are regulators of theory rather than practice . There is a lot more in the Deepwater Horizon saga still to run ; on the initial evidence , however , it is not just BP that needs to improve its act , but an entire industry and area of government .

The Trans - Alaska pipeline system , which transports oil from the Prudhoe Bay field , was closed on Saturday following the discovery of a leak . The incident is expected to drive up oil prices , and could mean motorists face even higher costs at the pumps . Prudhoe Bay is America 's largest oil reserve . BP is the largest shareholder in the company which runs the Trans-Alaska pipeline , called Alyeska Pipeline Service . The leak occurred at a pumping station at Alaska 's North Slope , and forced 95 % of oil production at the site to be cut off . A BP spokesman based in America described the leak as `` a significant event '' and it is not clear how long it will take to restart production . Prudhoe Bay will typically produce 630,000 barrels of oil each day equivalent to around 40 % of the UK 's daily consumption . The price of a barrel of US crude oil rose by almost 1 % to $ 89.92 this morning , as traders reacted to the unexpected drop in supplies . BP was the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 when trading began , with shares dropping as much as 12p to 480.7 p. This eroded some of the recovery since the Deepwater Horizon disaster last April , which sent BP 's shares tumbling from 650p to 296p . The cost of insuring BP 's debt against default also rose by over 10 % , according to Gavan Nolan at Markit . Prudhoe Bay is a major resource for BP , with the company planning to build a new pipeline to tap Alaska 's gas reserves . BP Pipelines owns nearly 47 % of Alyeska , with ConocoPhillips Transportation owning 28 % , ExxonMobil Pipeline owning 20 % , and smaller shareholders controlling the remainder . There have not been any reports of environmental damage because of the leak . Alyeska said yesterday that around 10 barrels of oil had been recovered from the basement of a booster pump room , and that around one barrel of oil remained . However , the incident is likely to put the oil industry 's safety record under renewed scrutiny , just nine months after the Gulf of Mexico disaster . Bob Dudley , who replaced Tony Hayward as chief executive , announced the creation of a new safety unit last September with the powers to audit the company 's operations around the globe . A BP spokesman declined to comment on the leak this morning , referring inquiries to Alyeska . Its president Tom Barrett said : `` Our goal is to engineer and implement a solution so that we can safely return the pipeline to service as quickly as possible . '' Last summer , Alyeska was accused of putting safety at risk by cutting maintainance and safety budgets . Kevin Hostler , the company 's chief executive who had previously worked for BP for 27 years , was criticised by congressman Bart Stupak , a member of the US House Energy and Commerce Committee which investigated the allegations . Hostler subsequently retired from Alyeska . The Trans-Alaska system was completed in 1977 . The 48-inch diameter steel pipeline runs for 800 miles , carrying `` hot oil '' from northern Alaska to the port of Valdez . The pipeline is either buried underground or lifted above the surface to prevent the permafrost melting . Oil experts have warned that temporarily closing the pipeline is a tricky procedure , as BP must ensure that the lines do not freeze once the flow of oil stops .

Photograph : Jeremy Horner\\/Corbis BP failed to observe proper environmental safety procedures during construction of an oil pipeline in Colombia , according to allegations in a case lodged by a group of farmers at the high court in London . A scientific investigation has been commissioned by lawyers acting for 73 Colombian farmers , who are suing BP in the high court in London for allegedly causing serious damage to their land , crops and animals . In the first case of its kind the farmers claim that BP acted negligently and breached a duty of care towards them . They say that BP Exploration Company -LRB- Colombia -RRB- Ltd worked with Colombia 's national oil company and four foreign multi-national corporations , to construct the 450-mile -LRB- 720 km -RRB- Ocensa pipeline . They allege that this caused extensive erosion and damage to soil and groundwater , causing crops to fail , livestock to perish , contaminating water supplies and making fish ponds unsustainable . According to documents lodged in the high court last month , the scientific investigation has alleged that BP failed to take proper measures to control soil erosion on the farmers ' land , failed to properly preserve the topsoil when earth was moved during the construction process and failed to prepare the soil properly for construction . The farmers say that BP engaged in `` risky or dangerous activity '' and add that an environmental impact study submitted by BP to the Colombian Ministry of the Environment in 1994 was `` inadequate and defective '' . The solicitor acting for the farmers , Paul Dowling of Leigh Day & Co , said : `` The emerging evidence in this case has brought to light BP 's central role in the construction of the Ocensa pipeline , and its failure to adequately appreciate risk and implement basic measures to protect the local environment and the livelihoods of impoverished local communities . '' `` Rather than accepting responsibility for its actions , BP has , in the same way as it has done in the Deepwater Horizon spill , sought to distance itself as far as possible from the environmental destruction that has taken place . '' The farmers are claiming damages against BP for breach of contract and negligence . If the court accepts the evidence of environmental damage caused by the project it could open the way for similar claims by other communities in developing countries who say they have been adversely affected by oil pipelines . The area where the pipeline was laid from Cusiana-Cupiagua oilfields in the region of Casanare to the port of Covenas has been plagued by paramilitary activity . Farmers say they have experienced harassment and intimidation from Colombian paramilitaries employed by the government to guard the pipeline . Marta Hinestroza one of the farmers ' lawyers , fled Colombia for Britain when she discovered that her name was on a paramilitary hit list and was granted asylum here in 2002 . BP announced its plans to sell its 24.8 % shareholding in Ocensa last August along with BP Exploration Company -LRB- Colombia -RRB- Ltd but the sell offs have not yet been completed . Funds raised by these sales will be used to help pay the bill for the Deepwater Horizon spill . In its response to the original claims lodged on behalf of the farmers in the high court BP denies that it acted negligently and that construction of the pipeline has caused long-term damage to the farmers ' property . It argues that the main cause of soil erosion and sedimentation is the removal of forests by farmers for cattle grazing . The farmers dispute this . BP has not yet lodged a response to the new evidence . When contacted by the Guardian a BP spokesman declined to comment on the latest findings .

Photograph Reuters The White House commission investigating the BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico began lobbying Congress today to set aside anti-government sentiment and commit more funds to overseeing the offshore oil industry . In presenting the commission 's final report on the BP disaster , commission co-chair William Reilly said he was launching an all-out campaign to get Congress , the Obama administration and the oil industry to impose tougher safety and environmental regulations . `` We are going to make a lot of noise , '' he said . The commission , issuing 15 main recommendations , wants Congress to approve funds to create a separate safety agency for the offshore oil industry , whose chief would be shielded from political interference by being appointed for a fixed term . The commission 's co-chair acknowledged turning the recommendations into reality would be a challenge given the prevailing mood in Washington . Republicans took over the house of representatives last week vowing to roll back government regulations and environmental safeguards . Meanwhile , the powerful Chamber of Commerce business lobby today said overturning the Obama administration 's `` tsunami '' of environmental regulations would be a top priority for 2011 . However , Bob Graham , the commission 's other co-chair , argued that even conservative Republicans would make an exception because of the economic and environmental consequences of the BP blow-out . `` It will override an ideological preference for less government intrusion , less government cost , '' Graham said . `` Members of Congress understand that this is not just a typical example of government regulating a private enterprise . This is government regulating land that the people of the United States own , '' he added . Reilly said the commission 's early conversations with oil executives about industry funding of a safety institute had been positive . However , the American Petroleum Institute lobby group complained that companies had already made safety improvements since last April 's blow-out . `` This does a great disservice to the thousands of men and women who work in the industry and have the highest personal and professional commitment to safety , '' Erik Milito of API said in a statement . Among other top recommendations , the commission said it wants : cents Congress to raise the liability cap on offshore oil spills , now set at $ 75m -LRB- # 48m -RRB- , and to allocate 80 % of the funds from BP fines under the Clean Water act to Gulf restoration . cents America to bring its safety regulations for deepwater drilling in line with tougher standards in Norway and Britain , which require companies to demonstrate they can deal with especially risky wells . cents Oil companies to pay for an industry-wide safety institute , as part of their fees for drilling licences . cents Congress to give more time , up to 60 days , to government regulators to approve oil drilling licences an idea resisted by senators from oil states such as Louisiana and Alaska . Commission members were due to brief congressional staffers later today , and will testify before Congress this month to press their case . The 380-page report on the causes of the disaster described a systematic breakdown of safety and environmental safeguards in offshore drilling , involving industry as well as government . Democrats in Congress said the commission 's report showed the need to move ahead on legislation . `` Because systemic safety and oversight issues regarding the offshore oil industry persist , if we do not enact reforms there will likely be repeats of this disaster , '' said Ed Markey , who headed the house global warming committee now disbanded by the Republican majority . In London , BP shares closed up 2.8 % . Peter Hitchens , from stockbroker Panmure Gordon , said investors were reassured that the full report contained `` no more nasties '' after the release of part of the report last week . It also followed a sell-off on Monday after BP admitted it had to shut down 95 % of its Alaskan oil production because of a pipeline leak . However , despite that sweeping indictment , the commission said the Obama administration had been `` excessive '' in ordering a six-month halt to offshore exploration . The commission 's refusal to call for a halt to offshore drilling among its 15 main recommendations was criticised by environmental organizations today . `` The commission 's full findings reveal that offshore drilling simply can not be done safely , '' the Oceana conservation organization . `` To suggest that the oil industry is ready to make the complete transformation called for in this report is not credible . '' Greenpeace , in its response , said the commission was misguided to put its faith in a UK-style regulatory system . `` Only last week a committee of MPs raised the alarm over oil companies ' preparedness to deal with a major spill , '' the organization said .

Photograph : Doug Wilson\\/Corbis The final report from the presidential commission investigating the causes of BP 's Gulf of Mexico disaster is expected to recommend today that the US oil industry adopt the North Sea approach to safety . The US government is expected to radically overhaul its discredited regulatory regime covering offshore operations , which had merely required companies to fill out uniform box-ticking safety audits . It is also expected that the commission will recommend the setting up of an independent safety institute responsible for auditing companies ' plans . It comes as engineers battled extreme cold to fix a leak in the 800-mile Trans - Alaska oil pipeline part-owned by BP and restore supply lines from America 's largest oil reserve . The pipeline carries about 12 % of America 's domestic production , and the shutdown for a third straight day yesterday has raised concern about oil prices after companies cut production by 95 % . `` I remain concerned about the potential impact both on oil prices and Alaska 's economy of even a short-term shutdown of the pipeline , '' said Lisa Murkowski , the senior Republican on the Senate energy committee . BP is the largest shareholder in Alyeska , the company which runs the pipeline carrying oil from the BP-operated Prudhoe Bay field to the port of Valdez . BP owns about 47 % of Alyeska , ConocoPhillips 28 % , ExxonMobil 20 % and smaller shareholders control the remainder . BP is referring all questions about the shutdown to Alyeska . Only an estimated 10 barrels leaked onto the basement of a booster pump room , and none seaped onto the tundra with no reports of any environmental damage being done . But the news could not have been more badly timed , coming on the eve of the commission 's report into the Gulf of Mexico disaster and putting BP 's safety record under the spotlight once again . The commission is expected to recommend the setting up of an independent safety institute responsible for auditing companies ' plans , analysts said . Under the UK 's ` safety case ' model which the commission has endorsed in previous hearings , companies are required to separately assess the risk for each operation and show how they would mitigate this . Experts believe this system , which is audited by independent consultants , results in fewer accidents because companies have to proactively demonstrate safe operations in each instance . The analysts also doubt that production in the Gulf of Mexico will ever recover to pre-spill levels . Tighter drilling regulations will mean that `` permitting will forever be more deliberate and constrained '' they said . In 2006 , BP was responsible for the largest ever oil spill on Alaska 's North Slope when a pipeline at its Prudhoe Bay field leaked an estimated 5,000 barrels . BP 's Alaska operations have also been the subject of numerous ` whistleblowing ' safety concerns being raised by the ombudsman the company set up in 2006 . Of the 252 known concerns received since 2006 , 148 relate to BP 's Alaska operations , including 50 specific safety-related concerns at the North Slope operations . Alaska remains a key region for BP in the US , and contributes about 200,000 barrels of oil per day in production , 5 % of the company 's total . Gas reserves found there are also one of the largest undeveloped resources for BP globally . In a venture with ConocoPhillips , it is competing against a rival consortium to build a $ 35bn pipeline to transport the gas southwards . Safety concerns raised by incidents such as the Trans-Alaska shut-in will not help its bid . BP shares , down by almost 2.5 % in morning trading in London yesterday , closed down 1.25 % . News of the Trans-Alaska closure sent the price of oil quoted in New York up by 1 % to just under $ 90 a barrel .

Photograph Kirsty Wigglesworth\\/AP Bob Dudley , BP 's chief executive , will scrap the company 's production targets when he lays out his vision this week for a smaller , more exploration-focused company after last April 's Gulf of Mexico disaster . Analysts expect that BP will pump about 3.6 m barrels of oil and gas a day this year , a tenth less than in 2009 , when it overtook US group Exxon Mobil to produce more than any other non-state-controlled company . Sources close to the Environmental Protection Agency -LRB- EPA -RRB- also told the Observer that the US government is likely to agree to reduce its estimate of the size of the gulf spill , which would cut BP fines . Water samples from the gulf by US government scientists investigating the environmental damage caused by the spill are also understood to be showing a stronger than expected recovery in fish stocks , further limiting the damages payable by BP . Shell fish stocks remain severely affected however . In the last year , BP sold assets worth $ 20bn -LRB- # 17bn -RRB- , many of them mature oil and gas fields , partly to raise cash to pay for spill-related costs . The company had also banked on new fields in the gulf to help it achieve its target , set out weeks before the spill , of increasing production by 1 % 2 % from 4 million barrels per day until 2015 . But new regulations will increase the cost and time to develop them . Analysts at Liberum Capital expect limited production growth after 2012 , but more in the longer term as BP focuses on big new finds and unconventional gas . Peter Hitchens , an analyst from stockbroker Panmure Gordon , said that Dudley could outline plans to eventually increase production by 3 % each year , but starting from a lower base . Dudley is also expected to reassure investors that the $ 39bn provision it has made for spill-related costs will be more than enough . They are forecasting that BP will report a $ 5bn profit in the final quarter of last year when it unveils annual results on Tuesday , with analysts expecting a similar figure from Shell , which also reports this week . BP 's profits , and the progress in selling assets , should allow Dudley to restart dividend payments to shareholders but the predicted payout of 7 cents a share would be roughly half the pre-disaster level . Last month BP formally challenged the official estimate of the size of the spill , made by US government scientists , of 4.9 m barrels , making it the world 's largest offshore accident . BP argues that scientists have miscalculated the flow rate from the Macondo well , and that the actual spill size could be half the official estimate . It will also point to the number of different estimates of the flow rate made by the US government as evidence of their fallibility , and the EPA is understood to accept that no estimate can be 100 % accurate . BP is thought to be preparing to enter negotiations with the EPA on the issue , although it will be some months before a final estimate is agreed . "}]
