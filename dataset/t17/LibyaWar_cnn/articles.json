About 200 protesters came out to show support for human rights activist and lawyer Fathi Terbil , who had been detained earlier , the source said . Several people were arrested after police confronted the protesters , the source added . But Libya -- ruled by Moammar Gadhafi since 1969 -- is not Egypt , said a highly placed Libyan source close to the government who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to talk to the media . `` There is nothing serious here , '' he said . `` These are just young people fighting each other . '' Driven by discontent and fueled by social media , protests in the region spread this week not just to Libya but to Iran and Bahrain . Anti-government sentiment has also manifested itself on the streets of Algeria , Jordan , Syria and Yemen . In Yemen , Sanaa University students protested Wednesday , calling for an improved curriculum , but the demonstration rapidly morphed into an anti-government stand . Participants said government supporters outside the university gates hurled rocks , but the situation stayed under control . It was at least the sixth day that scuffles had broken out between the government 's supporters and foes . Activist Abdul Rahman Barman said three anti-government protesters were injured when government supporters attacked them after the demonstration . One had to be hospitalized for head injuries , he said . Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has been in power for 32 years but has pledged not to run for re-election when his current term ends in 2013 . In nearby Bahrain , thousands of people marched in a peaceful funeral procession for Ali Abdulhadi Mushaima , who was killed when clashes erupted during the funeral for another protester . They camped out at the Pearl Roundabout , a landmark in the capital , Manama , that has been adopted by protesters as their Tahrir Square , the epicenter of Egypt 's revolution . A massive pearl sits at the apex of a circle of inward-sweeping arches , and Wednesday , Bahrainis camped out at its base and painted anti-government slogans . Later in the day , flag-waving pro-government demonstrators were out in Manama and the second largest city of Muharraq . New York Times journalist Nicholas Kristof said security forces have backed off after `` a concerted deliberate effort to use a truly stunning amount of force . '' `` Now that the regime has backed off , it 's a little hard to say where things will go , '' Kristof told CNN . `` It is possible that ... there will be some kind of truce and agreement to have more democracy , some more concessions . '' Large crowds showed up for a funeral as well in the Iranian capital , where 26-year-old Saneh Jaleh was laid to rest . Iranian authorities said Jaleh belonged to the pro-government Basij militia and was shot to death by the outlawed People 's Mujahedeen of Iran . But some of Jaleh 's acquaintances disputed that account , and Jaleh 's funeral strangely drew both supporters and foes of the Islamic regime , which has cracked down on dissent even though it publicly praised Egyptians for toppling President Hosni Mubarak . International journalists are barred from covering Iran 's unrest , but a protester told CNN that police fired tear gas and beat people with batons . Sara , whose full name has been withheld for security reasons , said she was risking her safety to march on the streets because Jaleh was part of Iran 's reformist Green Movement . `` We are not allowing his blood to go to waste , '' she said . `` I am doing this for him . '' In the place that gave rise to the spirit of the region 's freedom movement , changes were still slowly unfolding . Tunisia lifted its midnight-until-4 a.m. curfew , though a state of emergency remains intact , the state-run Tunis Afrique Presse said . Weeks of demonstrations forced the ouster of longtime President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January . `` Tunisia now after the revolution of its population is now searching for its independence , '' said Lazhar Samali , an engineer who protested against the government . `` It 's a sovereign state , and Tunisia has in its own hands its destiny . '' The end of Ben Ali 's 23-year rule inspired Egyptians , and then others , to rise up for their rights . Last Friday , after 18 days of mass demonstrations in Egypt , Mubarak stepped down , leaving the nation in the hands of its powerful military .

The casualties occurred as thousands of Libyans took to the streets to voice their discontent over leader Moammar Gadhafi , witnesses said . Friday 's killings brought to 50 the number of people killed since Tuesday , when the protests began , the medical source said . Amnesty International said security forces had killed at least 46 during the past three days , with sources at al-Jala Hospital in Benghazi saying that the most common injuries were bullet wounds to the head , chest and neck . Protester : Thousands in Libya 's streets Protests , arrests continue in Libya Libya 's turn to topple a dictator ? Did WikiLeaks help spawn Libyan unrest ? CNN was unable to independently verify the information . In front of the main courthouse in a square in Benghazi , thousands of demonstrators filled the streets demanding a change of government , a protester said . He said people were chanting for Gadhafi and his children to get out of Libya . He called Gadhafi 's authoritarian rule `` the biggest dictatorship in history . '' Late Friday , a witness said more people were still streaming into the already crowded plaza , with some erecting tents , apparently planning to spend the night . There was no sign in the square of police or military forces except for the presence of three tanks , which were not moving , he said . Another source said that he saw three Libyan army tanks in the square and that young demonstrators were engaging the tank crews in conversation . He said government forces were not visible in or around Benghazi . He added that he visited Al-Jala hospital and that it was `` full of dead and wounded . '' Electricity was lost in parts of the city but had been restored by late Friday , when the city was quiet , he said . Farther east , in al-Baida , thousands of people showed up to bury 13 protesters killed in clashes in recent days , said Mohamed Abdallah of the opposition National Front for the Salvation of Libya , who has been receiving information about Libya from sources there . Plainclothes members of the Revolutionary Committee had reportedly fired at the protesters , Abdallah said . Demonstrations unfolded Friday in other cities as well , he said . CNN has not been permitted to report from Libya and can not confirm information about the demonstrations . The government maintains tight control of the news media and telephone services , and many people expressed fear of talking openly amid what they described as a climate of fear . CNN has been relying on information from protesters , human rights groups and foreign-based Libyan organizations assessing the situation through their sources on the ground . Libyan state-run television was airing taped images of Gadhafi surrounded by adoring crowds . The demonstrations erupted Tuesday after the detention of a human rights lawyer and spread across the country . U.S. President Barack Obama condemned the government crackdowns in Libya , Bahrain and Yemen , which are all embroiled in unrest . `` Wherever they are , people have certain universal rights , including the right to peaceful assembly , '' Obama said . `` The United States urges the governments of Bahrain , Libya and Yemen to show restraint in responding to peaceful protests , and to respect the rights of their people . '' `` The security forces ' vicious attacks on peaceful demonstrators lay bare the reality of Moammar Gadhafi 's brutal rule when faced with any internal dissent , '' said Sarah Leah Whitson , Middle East and North Africa director for Human Rights Watch . Navi Pillay , the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights , also condemned the crackdown in Libya and other countries `` as illegal and excessively heavy-handed . '' Abdallah , the spokesman for the National Front for the Salvation of Libya , reported that protesters in Benghazi had freed people who had been detained during the first two days of the unrest . He said protesters also set afire a police station and the Revolutionary Committee headquarters in Benghazi , al-Baida and Darna . Gadhafi 's regime , however , has sought to portray a different picture of events and sent out tacit warnings via mobile phone texts to Libyans planning to make their voices known . `` The inappropriate use of telecommunications services contradicts our religion ... our customs ... and our traditions , '' said a text from the General Communications Body . Another said : `` We commend the conscious youth who have realized that sedition destroys his family , his city , his country . And we commend our cities who have realized that touching national unity destroys the prospects of future generations . Together for the sake of the Libya of Tomorrow . '' A screen grab of the messages was sent to CNN by Abdulla Darrat , spokesman of Enough Gadhafi , a U.S.-based organization that has been in close touch with people on the streets of Libya . State-run television countered the anti-government protests with coverage of pro-Gadhafi demonstrations . It showed men chanting pro-Gadhafi slogans , waving flags and singing around the Libyan leader 's limousine as it crept through Tripoli . Scores of supportive demonstrators packed the roadway and held up pictures of their leader as fireworks burst into the night sky . The images followed reports from protesters , witnesses and human rights activists who described brutality by internal security forces , sometimes dressed in plain clothes . One of the protesters likened the situation in Libya to that which occurred early this month in Egypt , telling Human Rights Watch that `` they are sending baltaqiyyas -LRB- thugs -RRB- to beat us . '' Libya , like many of its Arab neighbors , is suffering from economic hardship and a lack of political reform . Youth unemployment is high . Gadhafi is acutely aware of popular grievances and has spoken with groups of students , lawyers and journalists in the past few weeks , a source told CNN this week .

An Iranian opposition member warns that street protests could lead to civil war `` Nastaran '' warns that protests are strengthening Iran 's Revolutionary Guard and pro-government militia `` Nastaran '' says many Iranians will not accept a religious figure as the new leader of Iran -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An Iranian supporter of the country 's opposition movement has warned that continued anti-government street protests could lead to civil war . The woman , a 34-year-old jewelry designer who lives in Tehran , issued the warning in a series of emailed answers to questions put to her by CNN . The woman does n't want her real name revealed due to fear of retribution so has asked that we call her Nastaran . Does Iran 's opposition movement want regime change or just more freedom from this regime ? -LRB- The -RRB- separation of religion from politics . As long as religious leaders do n't interfere with politics , I do n't see a regime change as necessary . However , I doubt that the religious leaders would be willing to accept this . What kind of real change does the opposition movement hope to accomplish with street protests ? Nastaran : I completely disagree with the continuation of street protests . We are walking towards a civil war by asking people to pour into the streets and fight with empty hands . The regime will not step back and will kill as many people as it deems necessary to stay in power . Fight over Iran protest deaths Civil war is not the way . We need a change in strategy . I think by not changing the strategy and constantly asking people to get into the streets -LRB- especially in the same location -RRB- we are empowering Sepah -LRB- Iran 's Revolutionary Guard -RRB- and the Basij -LRB- Pro-government militia -RRB- . It is evident when you go on the streets during the protests that they have learned how to organize and mobilize better . Further , we are helping them to expand their army . How afraid are you of Iran 's security forces and their threats ? Nastaran : Extremely scared !! They are merciless and will do anything in the name of religion . The legal framework of Iran is also being ignored so they can accuse you of anything and perhaps kill you . Are Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi the leaders of Iran 's opposition movement ? Nastaran : To me they are not . To me they became leaders through people 's anger and dissatisfaction with the regime . However , I believe that every movement and uprising requires a leader and at this point in time there is no one better than them . The regime will not step back and will kill as many people as it deems necessary to stay in power . I do not accept them as leaders because I generally disagree with their ideologies . Further , I think they are not the right leaders for a large portion of our population . Many Iranians will always believe that these guys are part of the system and will refuse to support them . Many Iranians will not accept a religious figure , some one with a turban on their head as a leader , given their experience in the past 30 years . What does Iran 's opposition movement want from America right now ? What do you want President Obama to do ? Nastaran : Direct interference -LRB- from -RRB- America is not helpful . Iranians are prone to conspiracy theories and history has proven that American interference is not to our benefit . 28 Mordad is a prime example -LRB- the 1953 U.S.-backed coup that overthrew Iran 's democratically elected government -RRB- . As a result , the masses tend to not want to follow any movement that is initiated or assisted by Americans . Their help should be indirect , but their help can be valuable . An example would be creating infrastructure for Iranians to more freely communicate , have access to information and spread the information . Additionally , appropriate sanctions can be useful also . However , they should be the type of sanctions that the regime would n't be able to blame for the people 's unhappiness and poverty . I think -LRB- that -RRB- until people really feel hungry and see that different economic and foreign policies will mean more comfortable lives , they wo n't join any kind of a movement . Intelligent sanctions can result in the latter .

Benghazi , the North African nation 's second-largest city and hub of its eastern province , was home to some of the bloodiest clashes Saturday . Still , an anti-government demonstrator there said that despite having been barraged for days by tear gas and bullets , many of his colleagues slept overnight outside the city 's courthouse and planned another rally at 1 p.m. Sunday . `` There are a lot of people getting killed for their freedom , '' the man , who was not identified for safety reasons , told CNN early Sunday . `` Our goal is simple : We want Gadhafi to leave . ... We want democracy . '' The man , a technology expert who has set up cameras airing live online video streams around Benghazi , estimated that the numbers of anti-government demonstrators in the city has grown 20 % since the protests began Tuesday . Another protester in Misratah , a city about 250 km -LRB- 155 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , said that roughly 1,300 remained on the streets there through the night and into the morning Sunday , burning pictures of Gadhafi and calling for an end to his rule . Libya 's turn to topple a dictator ? Understanding Mideast and African unrest CNN could not independently confirm information on the escalating unrest in Libya , the most isolated nation in the region , though it has interviewed numerous witnesses by phone . The government has not responded to repeated requests from CNN for access to the country and maintains tight control over communications . Instead , a report from Libya 's state-run JANA news agency blames `` acts of sabotage and burning '' on outsiders aiming to undermine the nation 's stability , security and unity . The report claims that the unrest has been fomented in Libya as well as Tunisia , Morocco , Sudan , Egypt , Lebanon and Iran by an Israeli-led network of covert operatives . Since Wednesday , authorities have arrested `` dozens of foreign members of this network who were trained on starting clashes , '' the JANA story said , adding that the outsiders were of Tunisian , Egyptian , Sudanese , Turkish , Palestinian and Syrian descent . Meanwhile , the toll from the unrest continued to mount Saturday . While Human Rights Watch , citing interviews with hospital staff and witnesses , reported 84 deaths since Tuesday , the total number is unknown and could n't be independently confirmed by CNN . Medical sources at Misratah Medical Complex said that at least three died and 70 were wounded in clashes Saturday between security forces and anti-government protesters . Three of those injured are in critical condition , the sources said . A doctor treating the injured in Benghazi 's Al Jala hospital said that at least 30 people died Saturday , most from gunshot wounds to the head . Hovering helicopters fired into the crowds and the hospital was receiving a steady stream of injured people , said the doctor , who CNN is also not identifying for security reasons . His count did not include casualties from a clash between the protesters on the funeral march and soldiers at a military camp . Soldiers there fired tear gas and guns ; the protesters hurled rocks and at least two hand grenades , witnesses said . `` The situation is critical right now , '' said the doctor . `` The city is effectively under siege . '' Lt. Col. Mohammed al-Majbari , who helped lead Libyan military forces in Benghazi before deciding early this week to join the opposition , claimed that government forces , aided by mercenaries from other African countries , `` caused a massacre . '' `` It is time for freedom , '' al-Majbari said . '' -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- is not a human being . A Libyan would never do this to his people . He is a dictator . '' The United States urges the governments of Bahrain , Libya and Yemen to show restraint in responding to peaceful protests Several eyewitnesses told CNN that cars of riflemen drove past protesters , indiscriminately firing at them . A Libyan woman supportive of the protesters , who was not identified to protect her safety , told CNN that army soldiers on Saturday initially claimed solidarity with the demonstrators , only to reverse their tack and open fire on the crowd . `` The soldiers ... said , ` We are with you . ' We believed them , '' she said . `` After that , they started shooting the people . Why did they lie ? '' Other eyewitnesses told CNN that anti-government demonstrators used a bulldozer Saturday to tear down part of a wall at Alfadeel Abu-Omar military camp , and were fired upon as they retreated . Many were hit by mortar and automatic weapon fire , the witnesses said . `` We are peaceful people , '' the technology expert said early Sunday from Benghazi . `` They are killing unarmed civilians . '' Others in Libya reported similar protests in the cities of al-Baida , Ajdabiya and significantly in Misratah -- an indication that the demonstrations centered in the east were spreading west . Anti-government protesters leaving noon prayers Saturday at Misratah 's Al-Sheikh mosque were confronted by pro-Gadhafi demonstrators , two witnesses told CNN . Security forces stepped in , firing tear gas to disperse the crowds . After the anti-government group moved to another square , security forces fired into the crowd , one protester said . A protester , identified only as Moftah , told CNN that Libyans , inspired by the toppling of dictators in neighboring Egypt and Tunisia , had simply had enough of Gadhafi . `` He will tell you that his secret police are everywhere , '' Moftah said . `` It 's time to break this fear barrier . We reach a point that we do n't care anymore . '' A Libyan source in exile , who has knowledge of events inside the country , said Saturday that the government was bringing in special military units . He said anti-Gadhafi factions now `` control '' increasing parts of eastern Libya , aided by `` police and security forces there -LRB- who -RRB- also belong to tribes . '' To counter that , the government is using `` military squads of African origin , '' the source said , voicing the same claim made by Majbari . `` They are not restricted or bound by tribal ties , '' and can therefore be better counted on to suppress the opposition . `` Violence in the east will escalate because of the tribal mentality of revenge , '' the source said , claiming reports of violence there had already fueled sporadic demonstrations in western Libya . Gadhafi 's regime , however , has sought to portray a different picture of events . Having previously aired extensive footage of pro-Gadhafi rallies in Tripoli , a Libyan state television program on Saturday described the anti-government protests as acts of sabotage . The report claimed that hospitals , banks , courthouses , prisons , security centers and military police headquarters had been burned , showing videos of buildings on fire and the aftermath of destroyed and scorched locales . The anchor said that security forces had managed to arrest dozens of people , claiming they were part of a foreign network of agitators trained to spark clashes and create chaos . The official Jamahiriya News Agency also reported that Gadhafi had spoken in recent days with fellow leaders from Guinea , Liberia and Yemen . The government also sent out , via text , a tacit warning against `` the inappropriate use of telecommunications services -LRB- that -RRB- contradict our religion ... our customs ... and our traditions . '' Internet service in Libya shut down Friday evening , though it was more available by Sunday . The government 's firm grip on power heightened the concerns of a woman from Benghazi , who urged U.S. President Barack Obama and other world leaders to help the Libyan people in the face of the government crackdown . `` We have no freedom here , '' she said . `` I speak to all the world , to America , to Mr. Obama : Please help us . We -LRB- did -RRB- nothing . We want to live a good life .

Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's government responded with a $ 24 billion fund for housing and development . More demonstrations were sparked when police detained relatives of those killed in an alleged 1996 massacre at the Abu Salim prison , according to Human Rights Watch . High unemployment has also fueled the protests , as have anti-Gadhafi groups . Here 's a timeline of events : Three days after the fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , calls go out on Facebook for peaceful demonstrations in Libya against leader Moammar Gadhafi . Roughly 200 protesters take to the streets in the coastal city of Benghazi to show support for lawyer and human rights activist Fathi Terbil , according to witnesses . Several are arrested amid confrontations with police . A highly placed source close to the Libyan government tells CNN , `` there is nothing serious here . These are just young people fighting each other . '' State-run media reports that the government has released 110 political prisoners and that a committee would be convened to consider major changes to the government .

Seven people are killed in clashes between security forces and anti-government protesters , according to medical sources . Raucous pro-government demonstrators take to the streets in the nation 's capital in support of Gadhafi , witnesses say .

The organization bases that estimate on telephone calls made to medical providers across the country . Violence surges in Benghazi where eyewitness say protesters have taken control of the city and much of Tripoli .

Moammar Gadhafi led a military coup in 1969 that began in Benghazi He now faces his first real popular unrest in 42 years centered in Benghazi Gadhafi has been controversial internationally and has become more a statesman lately His government has restricted communication and freedom , experts and critics say -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Moammar Gadhafi 's first grab at power occurred 42 years ago in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi , when he led a crew of fellow military officers in taking over key government institutions on his way to usurping the nation 's monarchy . Ever since , he 's referred to himself as the Leader of the Revolution -- though politically , at least , Libya has appeared to be largely stable , with few threats to Gadhafi 's power . But that all changed this past week , with reports that tens of thousands took to the streets calling for an end to Gadhafi 's rule . And , once again , that change began in Benghazi . CNN has been unable to independently confirm information on the escalating unrest in Libya , the most isolated nation in the region . The government has not responded to repeated requests from CNN for access to the country and maintains tight control over communications . Still , phone interviews with witnesses and others on the ground suggest that some of Gadhafi 's strongest opposition has been in Benghazi , where protests began and have escalated . Since then , there have been indications that the opposition movement has spread westward toward the capital Tripoli . Why Gadhafi suddenly came under fire after decades of a strong-handed , seemingly stable rule remains a question . Protester : ` We want our basic rights ' One obvious factor is that Libya borders Tunisia , where popular unrest last month helped unseat authoritarian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali after more than two decades in power . Weeks later , a similar movement contributed to the end of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's 30-year rule . Gadhafi is far from alone now . Anti-government protests have popped up all around the Arab world , with pressure growing on powerful leaders in places like Bahrain , Yemen and Algeria . But what makes Libya unique , in large part , is its colorful , controversial and powerful leader . Gadhafi was a captain in Libya 's army when , on September 1 , 1969 -- which is referred to as Revolution Day in Libya -- he and others launched the coup by assuming control of key institutions in Benghazi . The overthrow was completed in two hours , according to GlobalSecurity.org , an independent provider of security information . At the time , the United States had military aircraft at Wheelus Air Base in Libya . And Washington did not initially oppose the coup , a 2008 Congressional Research Service report noted . Gadhafi soon established himself as one of America 's most vocal , and flamboyant , enemies . By 1972 , Gadhafi urged Muslims to fight the United States and Great Britain and vowed support for black revolutionaries in America . The next year , he launched a program `` to destroy imported ideologies , whether they are Eastern or Western , '' a U.S. State Department timeline noted . In 1979 , the U.S. designated Libya as a state sponsor of terrorism . The relationship only worsened in the 1980s , when U.S. military aircraft shot down two Libyan fighter jets . Libya 's alleged attacks in Sudan , support for Nicaragua 's Sandanista government and role in the bombing of a West Berlin nightclub only further stoked the ire of the administration of U.S. President Ronald Reagan , who called Gadhafi a `` mad dog . '' Libya 's standing took a turn with the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland , killing 270 people . World pressure intensified on Tripoli after Libyan intelligence agents were implicated . By 1993 , Gadhafi told the International Herald Tribune that he was taking a more conciliatory approach to world affairs . He called U.S. President Bill Clinton `` the savior of the new world , '' and decried Islamic militants as `` mad dogs '' and `` terrorists . '' Clinton continued to keep pressure on Libya , signing a law imposing sanctions on companies that invested more than $ 40 million in that nation 's petroleum industry . By 1999 , Libya finally agreed to transfer the Pan Am 103 suspects for a trial in the Netherlands , leading to their conviction two years later . While still known for sometimes unconventional comments , Gadhafi appeared to evolve into more of a statesman -- at least internationally . In 2009 , he was elected by member states as head of the African Union . That year , he also addressed the United Nations ' General Assembly for the first time . Still , he proved to be more a firebrand than an even-keeled diplomat , delivering a blistering , wide-ranging 96-minute rant . His topics ranged from the U.N. Security Council to the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy to a one-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians : Isratine . Gadhafi blamed the U.N. for failing to prevent 65 wars since its founding in 1945 . But he also had kind words for U.S. President Barack Obama : `` We are content and happy if Obama can stay forever as the president of America , '' Gadhafi said . While Gadhafi seemed to take on a new role internationally , the world had few insights into what was happening inside Libya itself . Even as the U.N. , the United States and other nations gradually began to soften their stance on Libya , reports suggested that freedom and basic rights remained widely restricted under Gadhafi . `` He has n't changed , '' said Fouad Ajami , a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies . `` This is a monster . And the Libyan people are suffering from this . '' The government maintained a tight control over its communications , clamping down on news accounts critical of Gadhafi and his colleagues . It also restricted outside media access , including denying repeated requests from CNN to enter the country this month . On Friday night , Libyan authorities shut down the nation 's access to the internet , the U.S.-based tech firm Arbor Networks reported . While there have been indications of spotty Web coverage since , Libya sent out a text message warning about the `` inappropriate use of telecommunications services . '' Internal political dissent was largely and often violently squashed . Moftah , an anti-government protester who did not give his full name for security reasons , said Gadhafi `` always plays on fear '' -- relying on a broad network of intelligence agents , secret police and others . `` He makes you afraid of your family , of your friends , '' Moftah told CNN . `` He will tell you that his secret police are everywhere . '' And yet , despite the odds , people have still risen up this month against Gadhafi . For years , Libya profited greatly from its vast oil reserves . One of Gadhafi 's first orders of business after taking over was to assume control of properties and other interests of international petroleum companies . Still , even the great wealth of oil could n't change the fact that Libya has suffered in the recent global economic downturn . As in much of the Arab world , youth unemployment is high in Libya -- and most of the population has never known a leader other than Gadhafi . And the fact it began in Benghazi , despite the Libyan leader 's early history , is not a surprise , said Dirk Vandewalle , an associate professor at Dartmouth and author of `` A History of Modern Libya . '' He noted that the coastal city has traditionally been seen as somewhat disloyal to Gadhafi 's regime . Whether the Libyan demonstrators can follow the leads of their Arab colleagues in Tunisia and Egypt remains to be seen . If they do , they will have to overcome a cult of personality -- much like prevailed in those countries -- without having any fallback as far as political institutions or legislation to build off should they succeed . Unlike Egypt , Libya has no constitution , established institutions or any kind of mechanisms in place to support a new nation . The nation and its leader are one . `` In Libya , '' Vandewalle said , `` there is nothing beyond Gadhafi and his close circle .

U.S. authorities were keeping a close watch on Libya 's rapidly unfolding political crisis Monday , in part to see what possibilities might exist for meaningful reform , a senior Obama administration official said . Among other things , Washington was taking a close look at a speech delivered Sunday by Saif al-Islam Gadhafi -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's son -- which included warnings of a civil war if demonstrations in the North African country do n't stop . In the same speech , Saif Gadhafi also acknowledged changing times regionally and proposed `` radical '' reforms -- like bolstering local governments , relaxing restrictive laws , raising salaries , extending loans , and drafting a constitution , which does n't now exist . Obama officials continued to discuss with their Libyan counterparts the need to avoid violence against peaceful protesters , the official added . President Barack Obama was briefed on the situation in Libya by his national security adviser , Tom Donilon , on Sunday night , the official also said . Despite the warning from Gadhafi 's son , Libya 's protesters are showing no sign of an intention to back down . After Gadhafi 's government apparently lost control of the city of Benghazi , some angry protesters in Tripoli said they hoped for a similar turn of events in the nation 's capital .

Please send your crew to cover our Cameroon Demonstrations in Washington DC on March 3rd at the Capitol at 3pm and March 4th at the Caemroon embassy same time PLease help us make things known to the world REv Muma Unfortunately I am a human being of facts and the fact is we are all about oil . The everyday person in America is about oil whether they know it or not . We have to get to work , class , store , and most importantly the gas station . Otherwise the others do n't exist . This does n't mean that we should let khadafi or ghaddafy or ghadaffy or whatever his name is get away with what he 's doing . The people there know better than i think any of us know ; especially our president . I heard tonight that our options are wide open except that we do n't know what option to utilize right now . Bhedalzi and Tripoli are at a stalemate just as the world and Lybia are at a stalemete . Citizens in tripoli have stated that it seems that khadafi may be winning right now but thats because bhedalzi and tripoli are like california and utah except to us its like california and new york . They are so far away that the mileage between them do n't matter . Let 's sit back and wait to be called on for once . I do think when countries call for democracy they think of AMERICA . Call me foolish but we are still the land of dreams and the place people think of abroad . Our problem is we do n't know how good we got it because everything has become so damn relative . One day I hope we all get our own wake up call and see how beautiful this place really is behind a different perspective . Americans should stop their influence on innocent people i pray Qaddafi does n't strike if he does America is going to be like Haiti . Qaddafi is not leaving today or tomorrow this is Africa because they only need a head for war but he need a head for everything . Qaddafi is the best man for Libya . America should sacrifice our guys because we need oil more than the rest . We have an addiction at resources all over the world . We are no stupid . We know why we fighting and if we make lies about Gaddafi , we have good reason . Thanks to george orwell 1984 . We as Citizens of the United States and those who are elected by the people to lead it , should look at OUR OWN HISTORY and start by asking our selfs . Could we have become the Nation we are today , the Democracy , the Symbol of Freedom known throught the World as a LEADER without help ? The Answer to that question I will leave up to you . But without the FRENCH , I strongly agree America would be alot less independent . The United States of America is letting down every Democratic Libyan by not being the ones on the phone every day convincing the UN councle to establish the NO FLY ZONE . Because when the Libyan Rebelian falls to Gadafi it will be the United States of America folks who will be the Bad GUY . Not Standing up for a Democratic Ally is the same as watching some one you know get the crap beat out of them and just watching it happen making you guilty by association . I just hope we have only missed the first play and not the Game by waiting this long . america should explore and drill their own oil . they should not buy oil from middleeast countries . nor invade or engage in war because of oil . -LRB- required , but will not be displayed -RRB- CNN welcomes a lively and courteous discussion as long as you follow the Rules of Conduct set forth in our Terms of Service .

Continue they did , as the central government lost control of the coastal city of Banghazi , and protests continued in Tripoli . Though CNN has not yet been granted access to report on the ground , there were several reports of violence Monday . Protesters set a government building in Tripoli ablaze the day after ransacking the state TV headquarters , according to media accounts . In the capital , hundreds of pro-government protesters gathered to listen to a speaker in Green Square , an eyewitness said . Another group of protesters who tried to make their way to the square dispersed when confronted by security forces with tear gas . Crowds topped 50,000 people this weekend as demonstrators continue to express their frustration with the state 's budget bill . Gov. Scott Walker , however , is not retreating . The bill is vital and complaints that it is union-busting are a `` red herring , '' he said . Tom Morello , formerly Rage Against the Machine 's guitarist , has called Walker `` the Mubarak of the Midwest , '' likening the governor to the recently toppled Egyptian leader . Morello will perform solo for protesters Monday . The budget repair bill was proposed by Walker to address a $ 137 million shortfall through June 30 . It increases state workers ' contributions to their pensions and health insurance benefits , requires collective bargaining units to conduct annual votes to maintain certification and eliminates the right of unions to have dues deducted from worker paychecks . Fourteen Democratic state senators essentially boycotted the Legislature and went to Illinois to prevent a quorum from passing the bill . Walker has said powerful public employee unions are behind the blocking of the bill . It was one of the bloodiest 72 hours in recent memory , authorities said after 53 people , including four policeman , were killed in Ciudad Juarez , Mexico . It began Thursday when 14 people were killed . Twenty more were killed Friday - a state police investigator en route home , among them . Saturday brought 19 killings , including a patrolman killed by a driver whom he 'd just given a citation . He was shot 10 times in broad daylight . The violence was not exclusive to Ciudad Juarez , either . Mexico 's Public Security Secretariat reported that 13 taxi drivers were killed in Acapulco in a rash of violence that began Friday . Suspected drug traffickers are believed to be behind the violence in addition to setting cars ablaze and destroying street lights and security cameras . Among the casualties , a human head was discovered on a street and another body was found near a charred vehicle . i CA N'T BELEIVE THAT KADAFI KILLING HIS PEOPLE WITH AIR STRIKES HOW CAN UNITED NATION SEE THIS ? THE POEPLE NEED HELP ASAP There is no justification for Wisconsin taxpayers paying $ 57 for every $ 1 school teachers pay into their retirement account . That is absurd and the behavior of crazy people . To allow it to continue is insane . Retirement funds are subject to inflation , just like anyother fund . The concept of people living 30 to 40 years and paying into retirement is what Social Security Administration was founded on . Might as well stop paying interest on bank accounts and other investments .

The first was n't displayed yet so I re-posted . @Jim Briesle hi jim ! i dont think the money is at issue . i believe thier problem is having no other say in any benefits which would eliminate unions from getting dues just saying Only 53 dead in Juarez ? Spring break is coming up and the extreme tourist season is upon us . Maybe a little Matamoros stew for the revelers ? I had too many lazy teachers in my school years to think any significant change has come forth . They are the most spoiled profession with the exception of 10-20 % .

Whether Moammar Gadhafi stays or goes , the turmoil-wracked country is likely to be in for more of a rough time , two Libya experts told CNN Monday . `` Whichever way this goes , I think there 's going to be a good amount of chaos , '' said Diederik Vandewalle , associate professor of government at Dartmouth College . During his 42 years in power , Gadhafi has limited the formation of political and other institutions , Vandewalle said . `` All civil society organizations have been eviscerated by the regime , '' he said . In a telephone interview Monday night , he predicted more bloodshed if Gadhafi steps aside . `` We could see some tribal uprisings '' as competing groups seek a share of Libya 's oil wealth , he said , describing the likely scenario as `` not very pretty . '' But , he added , oil exports will likely continue after `` some '' interruption . `` It would be in the interest of all parties that oil keep flowing , '' he said , dismissing as unlikely any apocalyptic scenario in which Libya would descend into civil war . The current uncertainty will likely be decided in the next few days , he predicted . `` It seems to me that we 're in an endgame here , '' he said . `` The big question is how much bloodshed we 're going to see . '' He called the violence against unarmed civilians `` extraordinary , but not surprising from a regime that 's truly entrenched . '' There are few candidates in the wings to replace Gadhafi -- `` no younger leadership able to assume that mantle of leadership , '' he said . But Gadhafi 's imminent departure is not a foregone conclusion , he added , putting the odds at `` 80 % go , 20 % stay . '' Ronald Bruce St John , who has written seven books on Libya , said Gadhafi 's reign appears to be drawing quickly to a close . `` He 's losing support by the hour from critical people in his regime , '' he said . But St John said it was unlikely that the next leader would emerge from the military , since Gadhafi has long sought to keep the institution at arm 's length . `` Though he was an army officer when he came to power and was supported by the military and all the original members of the Revolutionary Command Council were from the military , he has , from the beginning , evidenced a great distrust for the military , '' St John said . `` He recognized it as the most likely power to overthrow him . '' As a result , Gadhafi has routinely rotated commanders `` so no one established a base of support .

Piers Morgan talks to several people who can shed some light on who Moammer Gadhafi really is . Prince Sayyid al-Senussi and Jamie Smith gave their take on `` Piers Morgan Tonight '' Monday night . this guy is the biggest joke cnn has evey had all your good anchors and journlish were fired like stouffer this is why fox is eating cnn 's lunch and this goon to replace king i 'll admit king should 've been gone long ago but to get this morgan goon iwhat nut got him should go . Sayyid Idris is well positioned to play an important role in the formation of a new Libya that is based on democracy with the rich heritage of Al Senussi Family . Libyan state doesn ' t exist at the moment and the royal family could achieve a good job there . Piers , as a nice Brit , clearly believes that by inviting failing kings and queens -LRB- see previously Queen Noor -RRB- , he offers serious analysis on the Middle East current political events . He should certainly overcome his British style and try to be more open minded , constructive and democratic . This was a ridiculous show yesterday ! A forgotten monarch -LRB- Prince of Libya ? -RRB- commented on a crazy dictator ... Why have n't you told the truth about the land and property robbery of 1973 that you and your associates are guilty of `` receiving stolen goods '' Piers Morgan ? Erik J C Young UK Please , refresh my history memory ?! No , Seriously ; Please , I suffered severe brain trauma and have to learn everything all over again Somethings you say in your comment seem familiar , OK ? Your friends Michael Napier QC of Irwin Mitchell Solicitors , Simon Cowell , Sharon Osbourne all from the Woking area like you are ? All involved in a series of very serious crimes you thought would be erased by time never mind two children were murdered . . You do know what I am talking about . . `` nobody knows where the owner has gone '' is n't that the story put out when I was right on your doorstep . . but you and your associates thought outnumbering me and killing two of my children would frighten me away . . and where is my wife and daughter Netnapa and Mercedes ??? you marauding friends came to Bangkok and interfered with serving a pack of very evil lies to ruin my life My wife was very similar to the girl in the film `` The Bodyguard '' -LRB- do you suppose the film was about my wife and I ? -RRB- until your marauding friends the Sylvester-Shinawatra family totally corrupted her beliefs in me . . Piers Morgan are you also from a former WW2 gestapo family ? let 's find out where you really come from You kjnow your group of friends had me severely tortured in Bangkok , many of my friends killed , I had to watch seven of them die in front of my eyes all under 35 years old . . all so your group could keep property that is n't yours to keep . I had to do my best to protect her from these very bad people lurking around trying to get her into very very bad things people who think it is ok to steal other peoples property . . did you know I was shot at -LRB- with real guns -RRB- over 60 bullets . . The last gun fire was a hired hit man using a high velocity rifle similar to that used to kill my UnclePresident John F Kennedy . . did you know your friends did that to me Piers Morgan . . a truck driver accelerated to stop the bullet killing me . . Do you think the USA people think our family Young-Henry-Kennedy-Johnson are liars NO we are not liars Piers Morgan . . do you think the Kennedy family do n't know my cousin Leonard Frederick Johnson ? Of course they know us So you and your group hired someopne to assassinate me the same way as my Uncle John F Kennedy was killed in Dallas Texas but on Rama 3 Bangkok Thailand . That cement-mixer truck driver risked his life to save mine . . he saw the gun man aiming at me . Do you think it is a game to steal someone 's children and have people assassinated so your group can get very rich ? What do you think CNN readers and viewers think ? . . you knew who was terrorising me and planning to kill me and did nothing to stop them Do you know who the other grad father of my daughter is Piers ? He is The Sultan of Brunei ... what did you people tell Sir Cliff Richards Managing Director Malcom Smith about me . . He was a personal friend of mine Then there is the horrifc attack upon Rihanna . . did you know that happened after your group and their mafia found out I was very fond of Rihanna ? Just like it has happened to other girls they found out I cared about they got beaten up for liking me . . I 've cried for her many times . . Do you know what malcom Smith thinks of Simon Cowell ? He thinks he has been wrecking the music industry . . he is correct I heard that your group of peoplke decided I would not be allowed to see my wife or daughter for nine years . . who the hell do you think you are ??? your game of being the humiliating judges . . what an evil thing to do to a family Americans should remember there are people in this World selling Heroin who go to massive lengths to poison the names of those that oppose their trade . . what was President J F Kennedy doing about the Heroin trade when he was assasinated Colonel Gadhafi had his family wrecked he 's had children killed etc. . but he 's the man that led a bloodless coup . . Gadhafi the last frican leader to join the syndicate to lock Heroin out of Africa . . do you suppose the Heroin trade has had a hate campaign against Gadhafi since before Lockerbie Pam-Am flight 103 ? I DO In 1969 Gadhafi took control of Libya without loss of life ... perhaps the recent killings are his military killing the runners\\/trouble makers who are satanists of the Heroin trade ? of course that is how the Heroin trade want it to look like it is too crazy suggesting it is them behind the problems . . The real concern is OBAMAGATE look into the origins of President Obama ... his ancestors may have been gestapo families that stole land and property ijn Indonesia then moved to Hawaii and did the same there . . maybe that is why Gadhafi does n't trust the USA yet again ? OBAMAGATE Gestapo families have a 3500 year history of inflicting suffering particularly upon the poor who will not join their mafia . . they then target the rich with poisonous stories . . why is President Obama not helping Libya remove the real problem and why is he removing more financial support of the poorest Americans . . he 's from a gestapo family that is why President Obama 's family made their wealth from killing and defrauding other people in Asia , he may even be related to the killing fields of Cambodia executioners -LRB- who were not the Khmer people -RRB- they were Id thieves , historically marauding catalonians . . `` Erik the Germans soldiers were very nice to us in Norway in WW2 but the Gestapo they were n't Germans they were monsters '' the words of Fredrikke Louisa Young a cousin by marriage of President J F Kennedy A cat has 9 lives . . is a catalonian has 9 IDs in their lifetime ... a cat burglar . . is the catalonians robbing houses ...

I think this may be true I refer to Marauding catalonians as Dubouys -LRB- sounds like jewboy -RRB- Durian is a Thai fruit in English it means Satan 's Fruit that is why I call them Dubuoys ... but do n't prejudice every Catalonian some have become good people it is their Heroin-gangster-ID thief element that are the major problem for the world behind 80 % of the world 's terrorism using other people 's IDs Do you know where I come from ? The family of the best friend of Jesus Christ . . my ancestor was a man called Luke ... I do n't like satanism or corruption I can swing a chandalier around clockwise or anti-clockwise with my eyes . . but I can prove it . . I have commanded a lightening strike -LRB- hundreds of times in a night one time -RRB- and have many witnesses to these supernatural powers . . which is the power of Almighty God not Satan ... sounds crazy does n't it but it is true . . hundreds of people in Thailand have witnessed me doing these things in the past ... Indonesia was where a relative by marriage of his daughter to a cousin of President J F Kennedy had serious problems concerning his business and assets being sabotaged and stolen by ID thieves . Mr V A Fog who owned The Summatra Planation Compagne in Indonesia was having his bank accounts and valuables robbed as well as his land interests ... I believe the family of Fog and Henry suffered similar problems in Siam -LRB- today Thailand -RRB- and possibly Hawaii ... as well . . This part of the Kennedy relatives , the Fog family are of Danish descent . . The Kennedy-Henry family are relatives of King Henri of France circa 1003a . d. ... for years we have been persecuted by satanists . . hiding behind the IDs of other people How the gestapo mafia heroin network killed some people I knew in Thailand then later claimed it was all made up and not real . . it was real 150 young men killed in one day , all innocent ... This all connects into the Morgan-Cowell-Shinawatra-Napier-Winn-Osbourne land and property fraud by what started as a group called the Okcult in the 1970s 1000s have died due to their theft and greed . . including the killing of children ... this is why I despair to know where my wife and daughter have gone are they still alive ?? I do not know The UN Security Council can say what they want , but Muammar Gaddafi is not listening . If someone does not step in , he will wipe out the entire population . He said these mercenaries will go house to house to kill the protestors . He also said he is fighting for liberty . I see no liberty in his actions , only a murderous mind wishing to kill his citizens . Someone needs to remove him from power now and have him sent to the Hague . However , I doubt he will survive this as most of the country is against him . If Gadhafi was inclined kill his people he would have been doing this for years and he has n't been killing his people ithe past . However there are some very bad people in Libya who are not peaceful and these people are his targets due to the fact they have caused chaos and violence . They had the same situ \\ tion for a while in Egypt and they killed the people who caused the problems this resulted in peaceful protesting and a conclusion free of total chaos I had an Aunt from Philadelphia called Helene , perhaps you are a relative Woking Police in the UK mentioned something they called The Pyrford Place Scam back in the 1980s . . I think Michael Napier QC sold Pyrford Place to Geri Halliwell who bought in good faith . However it was not his property to sell and he already knew it formed part of my inheritance but never contacted me about it nor did I received any of the proceeds It is not a civil matter it is a series of crimes that has now implicated Geri Halliwell and others so she needs to be questioned by the police along with Michael Napier QC , Piers Morgan , Simon Cowell , John Berisford aka Ken Winn-Pope , and Sharon Osbourne all orginating from the Woking area Piers Morgans may have lived in Gloucester Rd Old Woking in the past when he had a different name As a result of this massive land property robbery and fraud , that may even be effecting Libya , Egypt and Tunisia is two of my children have been murdered , and my wiufe , Netnapa -LRB- her alias -RRB- disappeared over five years ago with my daughter , I do not know if they are still alive . . this is all connected to the OKcult group of Piers Morgan , Simon Cowell Michael Napier Sharon Osbourne and John Berisford -LRB- who keeps changing his ID -RRB- and Mr Sylvester aka Thaksin Shinawatra who has been dealing heroin for many many years . So will people please understand Gadhafi is not the bad man he does n't like Heroin dealers So they 've told 1000s of lies about me . . `` nobody knows where the owner of these properties is '' is one of their lies . . they knew it was my inheritance they are all liars . . they may have sold property to Sir Richard Branson which formed part of my inheritance So would the USA government please place extreme pressure on these people and their friend PM David Cameron and find out where my wife and daughter are being kept and explain to her I want to see them , I have never been convicted lawfully of any serious crime in my life . . they 've been telling her loads of lies ... which is why when all this trouble started in Thailand and she 'd been told a pack of lies she said on the phone in Thai about me `` not to kill him yet '' talking about me Irwin Mitchell Solicitors in London give me so little money out of my asset wealth I am only able to buy the basics to stay alive , can not fuel a car , can not go out for the evening , can not go and meet anyone I am trapped in a condition simiar to house arrest and I am not mad nor a criminal Thank you CNN for stopping others from blocking my right to publish the truth . . they have been stopping me publishing information on sites like your news site for years claiming I am mentally ill when I am not ill , they 've obstructed my right to have a Court of Protection Order removed which was a temporary arrngement for my divorce from my former second wife over five years ago . . but still they do not return my money they have been defrauding me an English firm of Solicitors called Irwin Mitchell Solicitors in London , they need to be arrested and my money returned I live in a very small house in Byfleet Surrey UK , most of my possessions at my previous home in Shamley Green stolen , but nothing belonging to my ex-wife was stolen only my possessions including a silver and gold beaker used at The Last Supper of Jesus Christ handed down through the family , it was a christening present to me from my scandinavian relatives My phone calls and emails have been blocked and interfered with , semi colons and brackets appear around phone numbers when I try to send text messages but other do not have these on their phones only me , my accounti is with vodaphone Now I remember where I have met Piers Morgan before he wasa friend of a man called Mark , a nephew of Mrs Irene Evans of Weybridge Surrey now deceased , who ended up in prison for fraud . Mark 's father Desmond was a con-man all his life ... I 'll remember Mraks family name in due course In their quest to destroy my name and my family and deprive me of love in my life , they had me physically tortured in Thailand as well as mentally tortured , they used 10,000 people there to claim I was so evil I was like Satan . . there were multiple attempts to kill me , meanwhile their solicitor friends in the UK Irwin Mitchell that includes Julia Lomas formerly Julian Sylvester told everyone I was a convicted pedophile , an outrageous lie totally untrue , they lied to my insurance company , my banks , the credit card companies , the Bently dealership so I got a US$ 10,000 for a first service on a Bentley Continental , they did the same with my Ferrari a huge service bill the car had only done 5000 miles . . everywhere I went they had people claiming I was a convicted pedophle total lies 1000s of lies trying to get me killed . . friends of Piers Morgan doing this Through their OKcult mafia they 've killed over 60 of my family 's friends and thousands of other people I knew elksewhere in the World , the young men in Tak Naratiwat Province had known me because they lived in the Naratiwat Rd area of Bangkok and went South and waited for me thinking I was going there to help sort out the problems . . before I had a chance to leave Bangkok and go South they were ALL dead ...

Amongst other problems I have The Abraham Cowley Secure Mental Unit constantly on my back in spite of a Court Order in June 2007 banning them from making any further contact with me . In addition a Social Services person named Elaine constantly harrassed me , she was at Woking Social Services , I complained to the Government and she was moved to Guildford , however someone using her name has been calling this Abraham Cowley Unit alleging to be my sister , who denies calling them .

We are working urgently with friends and partners around the world to convey this message to the Libyan government . '' It was the highest-level statement so far by the U.S. government on the accelerating strife in Libya , where reports Monday indicated a deteriorating situation with some military forces and pro-government allies attacking anti-government demonstrators . Two Republican senators called Monday for President Barack Obama to publicly denounce what they called `` egregious violations of human rights '' by Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi . `` We urge the president to speak out clearly in support of the Libyan people , '' said a statement by Sen. Jon Kyl , R-Arizona , and Mark Kirk , R-Illinois . U.S. authorities were keeping a close watch on Libya 's rapidly unfolding political crisis , in part to see what possibilities might exist for meaningful reform , a senior Obama administration official said . Among other things , Washington was taking a close look at a speech early Monday by Saif al-Islam Gadhafi -- the Libyan leader 's son -- which included warnings of a civil war if demonstrations in the North African country do n't stop . 2010 : Connecting with Saif Gadhafi Obama officials continued to discuss with their Libyan counterparts the need to avoid violence against peaceful protesters , the Obama administration official added . The State Department , meanwhile , ordered all U.S. Embassy family members and non-emergency personnel to depart Libya . U.S. citizens were urged to defer all travel to the country . Despite the warning from Gadhafi 's son , Libya 's protesters showed no sign of backing down . After Gadhafi 's government apparently lost control of the city of Benghazi , angry protesters said they hoped for a similar turn of events in the capital , Tripoli . Tripoli residents said state-run al-Shababiya TV was attacked Sunday evening by anti-government protesters . CNN , however , could not immediately confirm reports . The Libyan government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated requests from CNN for access to the country . CNN has interviewed witnesses by phone . The unrest , spurred largely by high unemployment and demands for freedom , has left at least 233 people dead in Libya , according to Human Rights Watch , citing hospital sources . The growing U.S. pressure on Gadhafi -- a famously mercurial leader -- is only the latest in a series of twists and turns in the relationship between Washington and Tripoli over his 42 years of rule . In 1986 , Libya was implicated in the fatal bombing at a West Berlin nightclub that resulted in the death an American service member . President Ronald Reagan ordered the bombing targets in Libya in response and imposed economic sanctions . Reagan dubbed Gadhafi the `` mad dog of the Middle East . '' Two years later , Libya was implicated in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 , which exploded over Lockerbie , Scotland . In 1999 , Gadhafi tried to thaw his icy relationship with the West , agreeing to demands to turn over suspects in the Lockerbie bombing . In 2003 , he agreed to eliminate his pursuit and stockpile of weapons of mass destruction . The moves helped Libya regain diplomatic relations with the United States in 2006 . In 2008 , however , Swiss officials jailed one of Gadhafi 's sons , prompting the furious leader to cut off the country 's oil supplies , withdraw Libyan money from Swiss banks and threaten to sever diplomatic ties . Two years ago , Gadhafi returned to the international spotlight yet again when Scotland agreed to release convicted Lockerbie bomber Abdel Basset al-Megrahi , who received a hero 's welcome in Libya . Scottish authorities said al-Megrahi was terminally ill with cancer and , as a result , was released on compassionate grounds . Skeptics , including several U.S. senators , contend that al-Megrahi was released as part of a deal fueled by British business interests in Libya , including oil giant BP . Libya is one of Europe 's key oil suppliers . CNN 's Alan Silverleib , Jill Dougherty and Mike Pearson contributed to this report .

But if the unrest continues , `` forget about democracy , forget about reform ... It will be a fierce civil war . '' While criticizing international media for overstating its extent , the younger Gadhafi acknowledged the violence in Libya as well as `` mistakes '' by police and military in addressing unrest . Still , he principally blamed drunks , criminals and foreigners for fanning dissent and instigating attacks that threatened to tear apart Libya . Witness : It can only be called genocide Obtaining independent confirmation on events in Libya is very difficult . The Libyan government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated requests from CNN for access to the country . CNN has interviewed , however , numerous witnesses by phone . Saif Gadhafi , appointed in 2009 as Libya 's general coordinator , insisted his father , Moammar , was not like recently deposed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali . He also said Libya was unlike those two countries , predicting that its civil war would be `` 1,000 times worse '' and its economic hardship even more severe should the current government fall . He conceded these are `` difficult times '' and that `` there are people inside Libya who are opposing us . '' Even while he cast blame , the leader 's son also acknowledged changing times regionally and proposed `` radical '' reforms -- like bolstering local governments , relaxing restrictive laws , raising salaries , extending loans and drafting a constitution , which does n't now exist . Michele Dunne , an expert at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace , noted that the Western-educated Saif Gadhafi has pushed such reforms previously , but they have not gotten much traction . Meanwhile , eyewitnesses -- who are not being identified , for security reasons -- told CNN about significant movement and growing violence on Sunday , the sixth consecutive day of unrest in the isolated and reclusive North African nation . Medical sources and others on the ground have said that at least 219 had died nationwide in the violence . Saif Gadhafi , though , claimed in his speech that international media had overstated the death toll . He also claimed foreign nations and `` illegal immigrants '' had stirred the uprising , with some dissenters attacking government installations as well as stealing caches of weapons . The central government lost control of Benghazi , with multiple witnesses reporting that protesters took over Libya 's second-largest city with support from some military who dropped their allegiance to Moammar Gadhafi . Protester : ` We want our basic rights ' However , his son continued to insist the military remained loyal to the ruling government and would be taking an increasingly active role in suppressing unrest in the coming days . The reported power shift followed fresh clashes that left 25 dead earlier in the day , a doctor at Benghazi 's Al Jalla Hospital said . A source at Benghazi Medical Center , the city 's other major hospital , said there were 10 people dead there Sunday . One man told CNN that uniformed troops opened fire on thousands of mourners as they passed through the streets during a funeral procession honoring those killed the previous day . Protesters later Sunday packed at least one car with explosives and sent it crashing into a compound wall at a military camp in the eastern city , eyewitnesses said . Security forces then fired on the protesters as they attempted to breach the camp . On the camp 's southern side , meanwhile , protesters drove a tank from a nearby army base in another attempt to break in , witnesses said . They have also obtained other weapons , the protester said . Libyan state television reported the camp has been defended , and that protesters were being warned on loudspeakers not to attack the compound . The network called it an act of sabotage . The protester said that the military camp is significant because it houses Gadhafi 's eastern palace . `` It 's a symbol of his dominance here , '' he said . `` And it 's the last symbol , basically . '' A protester said some fellow anti-government demonstrators had other weapons . Saif Gadhafi alluded to this claim in his speech early Monday , claiming criminal elements had stolen weaponry and even fired them in an attempt to cast blame on military and security forces . People said there was a food shortage in parts of Benghazi . The internet remained down in the city and electricity was cut off for the second night in the row , but was back in the morning . One man , a technology expert who has set up cameras airing live online video streams around Benghazi , estimated that the numbers of anti-government demonstrators in the city has grown by 20 % since the protests began Tuesday . `` There are a lot of people getting killed for their freedom , '' he said Sunday . `` Our goal is simple : We want Gadhafi to leave . ... We want democracy . '' Others in Libya reported similar protests in the cities of al-Baida , Ajdabiya and significantly in Misratah -- an indication that the demonstrations centered in the east may be spreading west . Meanwhile , the most significant unrest to date hit Moammar Gadhafi 's doorstep of Tripoli on Sunday . Clashes broke out between a large crowd of demonstrators and people who appeared to be African mercenaries in the center of the city , according to an activist . Elsewhere , hundreds of protesters were demonstrating in front of the courthouse , the activist said . Both groups were calling for the downfall of the regime . A woman said she saw demonstrators running down a Tripoli street outside her window , chased by apparent mercenaries in pickup trucks . The Africans were firing at the demonstrators and throwing tear gas at them , according to the witness . Many families have closed their windows and turned off their lights out of fear , she said . Another witness said that crowds of anti-government demonstrators hit the streets and set cars on fire . Masked , armed men in SUVs drove through the streets blasting pro-government music , said the witness , claiming that the same people had been firing at protesters and passerby . Gunfire also rang out near Green Square and the presidential palace , according to multiple witnesses . Another man said that men were walking around Libya 's streets with automatic rifles early Monday , firing seemingly indiscriminately . The crackdown , as well as the government 's role and reaction to it , stoked the ire of many opposed to Moammar Gadhafi as well as governments outside Libya . Libya 's ambassador to the Arab League said Sunday he resigned his position on Saturday over `` the killing of innocent people . '' Abdel Elhuni said the protesters are asking for `` normal things '' and that Gadhafi is `` over , finished . '' He speculated that the Libyan leader has only a day or two left in power because `` he lost the people . '' British Foreign Secretary William Hague spoke on Sunday with Saif Gadhafi and `` made clear the U.K. 's grave concern at the escalation of violence , '' the Foreign Office said in a statement . `` He expressed alarm at reports of large numbers of people being killed or attacked by Libyan security forces . The Foreign Secretary told Mr. Gadhafi that the Libyan government 's actions were unacceptable and would result in worldwide condemnation . '' The United States also said it was `` gravely concerned with disturbing reports and images coming out of Libya . `` We are working to ascertain the facts , but we have received multiple credible reports that hundreds of people have been killed and injured in several days of unrest -- and the full extent of the death toll is unknown due to the lack of access of international media and human rights organizations , '' State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said in a statement . U.S. officials have communicated to Libyan officials including Libyan Foreign Minister Musa Kusa `` our strong objections to the use of lethal force against peaceful demonstrators , '' Crowley said . `` Libyan officials have stated their commitment to protecting and safeguarding the right of peaceful protest . We call upon the Libyan government to uphold that commitment and hold accountable any security officer who does not act in accordance with that commitment . '' One man in Tripoli said was particularly angry at state-run TV for `` pretending that nothing is happening . '' A medical staff member at Benghazi Medical Center was among those sharply critical of Saif Gadhafi 's speech , calling him a liar and saying -- disputing his assertion that Libya could split into several parts if not united under his father 's rule -- the nation was one . `` There are no divisions among Libyans , '' the staff member said . `` We want to be united with our brothers and sisters ... All Libyans think this way , it is the regime that lacks knowledge about the people .

'' He added that both are showing incredible arrogance and disrespect for voters when suggesting that they would discuss between the two of them who should run for president in 2012 . Gorbachev has been ever more outspoken in recent weeks in criticizing Russian leaders , saying he sees the country becoming increasingly entrenched in a dangerous , authoritarian system . In an interview with a Russian newspaper he co-owns , Gorbachev said he was trying to start a new political party but has been blocked by the Kremlin . He claims Kremlin bosses refuse to officially register and recognize his new social democratic party . Gorbachev says Russia is in need of a democratic revival . Many Russians are ambivalent toward Gorbachev and his legacy . While many concede he brought real change to their lives with greater freedoms under Perestroika and with the dissolution of the Soviet Union , many also blame him for hardships that came afterward .

But now after the speech some pro-government crowds gathered in the downtown area . '' Human Rights Watch researcher Fred Abrahams said that he did n't believe the speech would placate crowds of people who are looking for change . `` There 's been so much resentment built up over four decades of rule , '' he said . `` Serious violations , disappearances , political killings , total restrictions on freedom of assembly , no free media , and corruption ... And those resentments bubble up from Libyans .

Sutter , CNN Protestors in Egypt show their support for an ongoing anti-government demonstrations in neighboring Libya . CNN reporter says internet access has been cut Traffic monitors say access has been sporadic , cut most often at night The massive Saharan country , long controlled by the dictator Moammar Gadhafi , has suffered `` rolling blackouts '' of its internet connections during the regime 's ongoing violent crackdown on protestors , according to the internet traffic monitor Renesys . The cause of these internet service cuts , however , remains uncertain . Possibilities include a government crackdown , an internet traffic overload or simple power outages , said Jim Cowie , Renesys ' co-founder . `` If this had happened in any other country I might have said , ` Oh , that 's just a provider . Maybe they had a power outage in their data center and their servers would n't start up , '' he said . CNN 's Ben Wedeman , one of the few independent journalists on the ground in eastern Libya , wrote that `` the electricity was working . The cell phone system is still functioning , though you ca n't call abroad . The internet , however , has been down for days . '' Google 's online `` Transparency Report '' shows internet searches from Libya , which is controlled by anti-government demonstrators , have been happening at below-average levels in recent days . And Arbor Networks , a network security company , issued similar findings . International internet traffic to and from Libya was shut down on Saturday morning from about 1 to 8 a.m. and again on Sunday during the same timeframe , according to Renesys ' analysis , which was posted on the company 's blog and is based on traffic data the company collects from internet service providers around the world . It 's almost as if the country had instituted a `` overnight internet curfew , '' Cowie said , adding it 's possible that Gadhafi 's government wanted to crack down on cyber dissidents who are known to organize online while other people sleep . Reports of wider-spread internet outages could be an indication that Libya is using more sophisticated methods to control the internet , some of which would n't be visible to international traffic monitors like Renesys . Iran , for example , is known for shutting down internet traffic at the neighborhood level , or removing capacity from the local internet to the point that local and international Web traffic simply overload the system , Cowie said . `` You remove capacity until everybody is squeezing through a small soda straw , '' he said . Libya 's internet blackouts are somewhat similar to those instituted by neighboring Egypt 's government during protests in that country . Egypt , however , completely shut down internet access for five days during protests against the regime of Hosni Mubarak , who was forced to resign after 30 years . That move appeared to be an attempt by the government to shut down access to blogs , e-mail , Facebook and Twitter , which were used heavily by some of the people who helped organize the anti-Mubarak protests which toppled his government after 18 days on the streets . Wael Ghonim , a prominent Egyptian protestor , issued a warning to other dictators in the Middle East and North Africa , saying , `` If you want to liberate a society , just give them the internet . '' It 's unclear how much of a role the internet and social media sites have played in organizing the protests in Libya . The news network Al-Jazeera reports Facebook was used to help coordinate the start of the protests in Libya , which went into full swing on February 17 . `` In a country where public dissent is rare , plans for Thursday 's protests were being circulated by anonymous activists on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter , '' the news organization writes . `` One Facebook group urging a ` Day of Anger ' in Libya , which had 4,400 members on Monday , saw that number more than double to 9,600 by Wednesday . '' Some authoritarian regimes restrict internet access , as was the case in Egypt , as a way to try to stay in power . Others , like Syria , China and Russia , filter some websites and use the internet as a way to monitor their citizens and steer public discourse . The internet infrastructure in Egypt and Libya is quite different , Cowie said . `` The key thing to remember is the massive difference in scale between the two countries . Egypt 's internet was thousands of prefixes . Libya 's internet is about a dozen prefixes , '' he said . An internet prefix is like an online ZIP code . It 's a number used to group devices that access the internet . Libya has 13 of these online zip codes out of the 400,000 internet prefixes that make up the entire internet , Cowie said . That makes the country a `` very small corner of a very big universe . '' Also of note : Only about 6 % of Libyans are on the internet , compared to nearly a quarter of people in Egypt , according to the ITU , an agency of the United Nations that focuses on the internet and communications . Libya 's access to the international internet is controlled by a single company , which is run by the state , Cowie said . That would make it easier , in theory , for the country to shut down internet connections than it was in Egypt , where the government had to call several internet service providers and order them to cut service as part of emergency law . Meanwhile , as Wired.com reports , a Twitter activist called Arasmus has created a map of the few unconfirmed internet reports that are coming out of Libya .

'' Ex-Interior Minister Abdul Fattah Younis al Abidi told CNN that he resigned Monday after hearing that some 300 unarmed civilians had been killed in Benghazi during the prior two to three days . He accused Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi of planning to attack civilians on a wide scale . `` Gadhafi told me he was planning on using airplanes against the people in Benghazi , and I told him that he will have thousands of people killed if he does that , '' Abidi said in an Arabic-language telephone interview conducted Wednesday . Abidi said he now supports the people and the revolution . He called Gadhafi `` a stubborn man '' who will not give up . `` He will either commit suicide or he will get killed , '' said Abidi , who said he has known him since 1964 . Abidi predicted the revolution will succeed `` in a matter of days or hours , '' and he called on Libyan security forces `` to join the people in the intifada . '' Already , he said , `` many members '' of the security forces had defected , including those in the capital , Tripoli . He said the entire eastern part of the country is no longer under Gadhafi 's control and that security forces there have orders to never open fire on the people unless forced to do so in self-defense . Two people to watch Zakaria : ' I thought he was on drugs ' UN wants end to Libyan violence Gadhafi told me he was planning on using airplanes against the people in Benghazi -- Abdul Fattah Younis al Abidi , now ex-interior minister The Libyan ambassador to the United States , Ali Aujali , also called for Gadhafi to resign , joining a chorus of Libyan officials , including the deputy ambassador to the United Nations , who say they now work for the Libyan people , not for Gadhafi . Among them was the Libyan ambassador to Bangladesh , A.H. Elimam , who resigned to side with pro-democracy protesters , said BSS , the official news agency of Bangladesh , citing a Foreign Ministry official Tuesday . Their announcements came eight days into protests that have cost Gadhafi control of eastern Libya and the support of other prominent Libyan officials worldwide and hours after Gadhafi delivered a defiant , rambling speech Tuesday , refusing calls to step down . `` This is my country , the country of my grandfathers , '' Gadhafi said in remarks carried live on Libyan state television . He vowed to die `` a martyr '' in his country . Blaming the unrest on `` rats '' who are `` agents '' of foreign intelligence services , Gadhafi said people found to be cooperating with outside forces fomenting discord and those who carry weapons against the country will be executed . The 68-year-old leader , who has been in power for nearly 42 years , spoke from a compound that U.S. warplanes bombed in 1986 , the Jamahiriya News Agency of Libya reported . The United States attacked the compound after implicating Libya in a discotheque bombing in West Berlin that resulted in the deaths of two U.S. service members . Libyan state TV described the crowds on the streets who were watching Gadhafi 's speech as his supporters ; an opposition leader said they had been dragged onto the streets . Some students at Tripoli 's Academy of Graduate Studies were offered free master 's degrees if they joined Gadhafi supporters in Green Square , a source said . Some people in Tripoli were offered money to put pictures of Gadhafi on their cars and go to Green Square , the source said . Moammar Gadhafi : An iron grip on Libya Will the military continue to comply ? A government spokesman , speaking on television , said Libyans were returning to their usual routine . `` A sense of normalcy is returning , '' he said . `` Some provisions are becoming shorter , but things will return to normalcy within a short period -- maybe a few days . '' He said Libyan authorities have asked those tribe members who have attacked barracks and police stations to return the weapons they had taken `` because security and safety will return to normal . '' Referring to reports that the military had attacked civilians , he said , `` We have reports and evidence they are not using arms unless against those who attacked the barracks . '' The spokesman said U.S. and Israeli intelligence operatives were behind the unrest . `` We will get rid of them , in collaboration with our people in the eastern province , '' he said . Despite such claims and even as he called on Libyans who `` love and support him '' to take to the streets and demonstrate for him , Gadhafi 's grip on power appeared to be weakening . In eastern Libya , groups of armed people wearing civilian clothing were guarding the streets as opposition leaders seemed to be in firm control , CNN 's Ben Wedeman reported . Wedeman was the first Western television correspondent to enter and report from Libya during the crisis . As Wedeman and his crew were entering the country , a young man at the border in civilian clothing and toting an AK-47 asked them for their passports . `` For what ? '' responded Wedeman 's driver . `` There is no government . What is the point ? '' They then drove in . On the Libyan side , there were `` no officials , no passport control , no customs , '' Wedeman reported . After meeting Tuesday in an emergency summit , the Arab League issued a statement suspending Libya 's participation in the body 's meetings and all the group 's agencies . The statement called for the immediate cessation of violence and condemned what it called crimes against protesters and peaceful strikers in Libya . It also asked Libyan authorities to lift the ban imposed on the media , to open communications and telephone networks and to ensure the delivery of emergency medical aid to the wounded . The U.N. Security Council met Tuesday in private -- the group 's first meeting since the wave of protests began rippling through Arab countries several weeks ago -- and then issued a statement condemning the violence in Libya . It called on authorities `` to act with restraint , to respect human rights and international humanitarian law and to allow immediate access to international human rights monitors and humanitarian agencies . '' Ibrahim Dabbashi , Libya 's deputy ambassador to the United Nations , said the statement `` was not strong enough , but I think it is a good message to the regime in Libya about stopping the bloodshed . '' Dabbashi said Monday that the death toll could be as high as 800 . Human Rights Watch said Monday that at least 233 people have been killed during the unrest . CNN has been in contact with medics and witnesses in Libya , whose accounts appear to corroborate the Human Rights Watch report . The rights group said Tuesday that witnesses in Tripoli `` have described Libyan forces firing ` randomly ' at protesters '' this week and that sources from two hospitals in Tripoli reported at least 62 bodies being taken to their morgues since February 20 . Witnesses have told CNN that helicopter gunships fired into crowds of protesters . Libya 's government denied it was turning its air force against civilians . Gadhafi 's second-oldest son , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , told the state news agency Jamahiriya the warplanes were targeting weapons depots in remote areas . But one witness , who agreed to be identified only as Adam , said helicopters landed troops `` armed to the teeth '' in Tripoli 's Green Square on Monday . `` They have been using aerial tactics , along with men on the ground , to disperse and shoot indiscriminately into crowds , '' he said . The force included both government troops and mercenaries working for Gadhafi , he said . Residents responded by barricading themselves in their homes and setting up makeshift checkpoints to keep cars full of gunmen out of their neighborhoods . On Tuesday evening , some anti-government protesters began trying to gather in Tripoli and were fired on by people on foot wearing plainclothes , a witness said . The sounds of `` nonstop bullets '' could be heard throughout the capital , which the source described as `` electronic firing . '' At least some of the firing seemed to be coming from Green Square , the source said . Red cars drove through the streets of Tripoli and fired indiscriminately at people , a source in the capital said . Residents of Tripoli reported Tuesday a food shortage , gunfire and intimidation by security forces . Security forces cordoned off the Fashloom suburb of the capital and were shooting people on the streets , including those who were trying to retrieve bodies , said Mohamed Abdallah , spokesman for the National Front for the Salvation of Libya opposition group . Abdallah attributed the information to four witnesses on the ground . An opposition figure said some people were told the bodies of their loved ones would not be released unless they signed a form saying the person had died in surgery . CNN could not immediately confirm reports for most areas . The Libyan government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated requests for access to the country . But CNN has interviewed numerous witnesses by phone . In eastern Libya , where Wedeman was reporting , residents said hundreds of mercenaries from sub-Saharan Africa had been killed or captured while fighting for Gadhafi , but much of the army appeared to have switched over to anti-government forces . In Tobruk , demonstrators chanted the same slogans that were heard in recent days in Tunis , Tunisia , and Cairo , Egypt : `` The people want to topple the regime ! '' Here , the old Libyan flag now flies over the main square . The police station , a hated symbol of Gadhafi 's rule , has been ransacked . Other buildings were sacked , but banks and some other installations appeared untouched . People in Tobruk were threatening to cut off the export of oil from eastern Libya `` unless this massacre is stopped immediately , '' local leader Abdallah Sharif told CNN . But a U.S official with access to U.S. intelligence told CNN `` little to no disruption of Libyan oil production '' has been seen as a result of the unrest . And Deputy Energy Secretary Daniel Poneman , who was attending the International Energy Forum in Saudi Arabia , said U.S. officials had seen no evidence of an oil shortage . `` We believe there is a lot of product in the market , '' he said . Still , the senior source close to the Libyan government said ammunition depots had been attacked and ammunition and guns were `` everywhere . '' The source said the country was fighting `` Islamic extremists . '' The unrest in Libya has been fueled by protesters demanding freedom and decrying high unemployment . Even as Gadhafi tried to hold on to power , he attracted the ire of increasing numbers of Libyans worldwide . About 250 protesters stormed into the Libyan Embassy in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia , on Tuesday , chanting and calling for Gadhafi to step down , a counselor at the embassy said . Osama Ahmed said most of the protesters were Libyan students studying in Malaysia . The protests were peaceful , he said . A top Libyan diplomat stationed in China said Tuesday he had resigned in protest of his government 's crackdown on protesters and called on Gadhafi to step down and leave the country . Hussein Sadiq al Musrati , who was the second secretary in the Libyan mission to Beijing before stepping down four days ago , joined about 20 students and protesters in front of the Libyan Embassy in Beijing on Tuesday . Demonstrators held signs that read , `` The game is over . Get out ... you 're finished . '' Adm. Mike Mullen , U.S. chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said the Libyan `` military firing on its own people , killing its own people is absolutely unacceptable . '' The situation `` needs to be resolved peacefully , '' he said .

Wedeman is the first Western television correspondent to enter and report from Libya during the crisis . Meanwhile , Gadhafi 's regime faced defections from prominent officials who declared their solidarity with the Libyan people . Justice Minister Mustafa Abdul Jalil resigned , saying he was protesting the `` bloody situation '' and `` use of excessive force '' against unarmed protesters , according to the Libyan newspaper Quryna . And Libya 's deputy ambassador to the United Nations called the crackdown `` genocide , '' adding , `` The mass killing has reached a stage where no one can stay silent about it .

But Gadhafi `` can not survive '' this uprising , Dabbashi said . `` The Libyan people are determined to get rid of him . It 's a matter of time . I do n't know how long it will last , but it will be soon , '' he said . The U.N.

The Libyan government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated requests for access to the country , though CNN has interviewed numerous witnesses by phone . Libyan state television reported that government security forces were demanding citizens ' cooperation . It showed a crowd in Green Square chanting pro-government slogans and holding a sign supporting the regime . But a woman in Tripoli reported that warplanes and helicopters were attacking parts of the capital , and armed men in cars were firing at anyone on the streets . The leader of an opposition movement told CNN that helicopter gunships were firing into crowds , and two Libyan pilots defected to Malta after being asked to bomb Libyan citizens , a Maltese government source said . The defecting pilots ' French-built Mirage F1 jets were armed with rockets and loaded machine guns when they landed in Malta , the Maltese source said . Video posted on YouTube showed what CNN was told were the charred remains of six Libyan troops in open body bags . Opposition sources in Libya say the dead were soldiers who refused to shoot at anti-government demonstrators . The minute-long video was captured on a mobile phone camera and posted on Monday , but it was not clear when it was taken . It depicts a crowd gathered around the bodies , which were burned beyond recognition , and the opposition sources said many more bodies were found in an adjacent military barracks . Citing hospital sources , Human Rights Watch said Monday that at least 233 people had been killed in the past week of upheaval . CNN has been in communication with medics and witnesses in Libya , whose accounts appear to corroborate the Human Rights Watch report , but Dabbashi said the toll could be as high as 800 . Libya is the latest Arab nation to fall into turmoil since January 's ouster of Tunisian strongman Zine El Abidine Ben Ali . Similar protests toppled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on February 12 and have spread across the region from Morocco to Bahrain . Gadhafi has ruled Libya since a 1969 coup d'etat , but questions about his whereabouts swirled Monday after his son delivered a televised address on the crisis . In that speech , the younger Gadhafi acknowledged that protesters had seized heavy weapons from government troops in Benghazi and that the country faced a civil war that could smash it to pieces and release `` rivers of blood . '' `` We have a very dangerous decision to make , '' said Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , the country 's `` general coordinator '' and one of his father 's top lieutenants . `` We are all the same , we all have weapons , we are all Libyans , and this is our country , our homeland . '' U.N. General-Secretary Ban Ki-moon `` had an extensive discussion '' with the Libyan leader Monday , the United Nations said . Ban `` expressed deep concern at the escalating scale of violence and emphasized that it must stop immediately , '' a U.N. spokesman said . `` He reiterated his call for respect for basic freedoms and human rights , including peaceful assembly and information , '' the spokesman said , and Ban `` underlined the need to ensure the protection of the civilian population under any circumstances . '' Quryna , a traditionally pro-government organ that did not mention the protests when they began last week , reported that African mercenaries had opened fire on unarmed civilians in Tajouraa , about 40 kilometers -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli . A Quryna reporter also said snipers had shot an unarmed woman in the same area . In Tripoli , a woman who asked not to be identified reported seeing violence in the streets . `` I 've seen myself red Hyundai cars with tinted windows that had armed people inside it shooting random people , '' she told CNN in a telephone interview . `` Three victims have fallen in the street where I live . '' During a meeting with EU ambassadors in Tripoli , Prime Minister Baghdadi Mahmudi blamed the upheaval on `` terrorists and destructive plans '' and stressed that Libya has the right to `` take any measures '' to protect its unity , stability , people and resources , Libyan state television reported . The Arab League will hold an urgent summit Tuesday to discuss Libya , Egypt 's official news agency MENA reported Monday , and Arab League Secretary-General Amre Moussa called for an end to the violence . He criticized the younger Gadhafi 's assertion during a speech early Monday that Tunisians and Egyptians were to blame for Libya 's revolt , saying demands for reform , development and change were the `` legitimate rights '' of the Arab people . In Washington , the United States condemned the violence and called for a halt to the `` unacceptable bloodshed '' in response to civil unrest , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement . `` The government of Libya has a responsibility to respect the universal rights of the people , including the right to free expression and assembly , '' Clinton 's statement said .

When I asked him about Libyan democracy he threatened to sue . `` If you or someone else says that Libya is not a democracy then it would be considered an insult , '' he said . `` We could go to court to redeem honor from that insult . '' The conversation was back in 2005 at his tent in Tripoli , a single-room structure made of colorful textiles in the middle of a heavily guarded compound . We sat on plastic garden furniture that had been carefully hand-cleaned by a man in an orderly 's uniform , while a small goat picked at patchy grass outside . Gadhafi is famous for his odd behavior , female bodyguards and bizarre ideas such as his plan to abolish Switzerland . We only saw very conventional male bodyguards . But even with their protection , Gadhafi 's manner made it hard to understand how he managed to stay in power for more than four decades . He did n't seem up to it . He appeared lethargic and his eyes , even behind sunglasses , seemed unfocused . 2005 : Gadhafi on ending nuclear program His answers , through a translator , seemed rambling . Author Kenneth Timmerman , who has also met him , says Gadhafi has kept power through cunning . `` He 's a very , very skilled player , '' Timmerman said . `` He divides the country . He conquers the small groups . He 's kept the tribes squabbling amongst themselves , and up until relatively recently he has distributed some of the oil wealth to the people . '' Human rights groups also say that Gadhafi 's regime has killed , jailed and tortured its opponents . Libya today is in turmoil . Back then , it was in transition , a rogue state trying to redeem itself . Pressed by international sanctions , it had abandoned support for terrorist organizations , surrendered its weapons of mass destruction to the West and was trying to open-up its economy . Gadhafi told me he was angry that Libya never got the payoff it expected : U.S. esteem and investment . In part it was because Washington 's attention had turned to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . But it was also , no doubt , because no American president or politician would be eager to embrace the man Ronald Reagan once called a `` mad dog . '' In any country or company 's plans for Libya , Moammar Gadhafi was the wildcard , the unpredictable element .

Share your photos and videos with CNN iReport . Benghazi , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Even as Moammar Gadhafi called on the military to crack down on anti-government protesters , reports emerged Wednesday that the Libyan leader was facing growing international and domestic opposition , including from his own military . An opposition figure told CNN that a pilot who had been ordered to bomb oil fields southwest of Benghazi refused to do so and instead ejected from the plane . Citing military sources , the Libyan newspaper Quryna reported that the two people aboard -- the pilot and co-pilot -- parachuted out and that the plane then crashed into an uninhabited area west of Ajdabiya , 160 kilometers -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- southwest of Benghazi . Quryna itself is a sign of the changes sweeping through Libya . When protests began last week , it carried regime propaganda . But it later reported on the protests and casualty figures . CNN could not confirm reports for many areas in Libya . The Libyan government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated requests from CNN for access to the country . CNN has interviewed numerous witnesses by phone . A Libyan Arab Airlines plane was denied permission to land in Malta on Wednesday , Maltese government sources said . Permission was denied for `` clearance reasons , '' because officials did not know who was on board , the sources said . Gadhafi vows to stay as regime crumbles Eastern Libya slips from Gadhafi 's grip Eastern Libyan : I 'm a free man Libya Interior Minister joins revolution Meanwhile , Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini characterized the situation as a civil war , `` with the authorities of the capital ordering attacks against the same Libyan people -- bombings and acts of unprecedented violence . '' In a speech to the Italian Senate , Frattini said , `` Unconfirmed reports spoke of 1,000 deaths ; other sources have given even higher figures . '' He said the claim from official sources that put the total number of deaths nationwide at 200 to 300 deaths `` frankly lacks credibility . '' The head of the largest trauma hospital in Benghazi told CNN on Wednesday that 202 people have been confirmed dead in the city since protests began last week . The opposition now controls Benghazi and much of the rest of eastern Libya . On Wednesday , the ninth day of protests , Gadhafi faced more defections from within his regime and new international pressure to halt military actions against demonstrators . Uncertainty surrounded the whereabouts of one prominent defector . Abdul Fattah Younis al Abidi , the country 's interior minister , told CNN Wednesday in a telephone interview that he had resigned Monday and was supporting the opposition after hearing that 300 unarmed civilians had been killed in Benghazi . `` Gadhafi told me he was planning on using airplanes against the people in Benghazi and I told him that he will have thousands of people killed if he does that , '' al Abidi said . He accused Gadhafi of planning to attack civilians on a wide scale but predicted that protesters would emerge victorious in `` days or hours . '' But hours after that interview , the Libyan government announced Wednesday that the former interior minister had been kidnapped . State media reported that `` gangs '' had abducted him in Benghazi . But Benghazi , now solidly in the camp of the protesters , was peaceful Wednesday . The only shooting that could be heard was celebratory gunfire . Crowds cheered as international journalists drove through the city , thanked them for arriving and threw them candy . Absent Gadhafi 's influence , residents formed ad hoc committees to take over the business of running the city , ensuring that hospitals were adequately staffed and supplied , banks were protected , electricity was flowing and garbage was picked up . They also formed a security force to defend the city in the event that forces loyal to Gadhafi were to attack . Gadhafi : Profile of a dictator Can Gadhafi survive ? Two people to watch Gadhafi : ' I will be a martyr ' Libyan protests threaten oil prices One member of the ad hoc government said forces here have been in telephone contact with tribes in the west of the country , many of whom remained loyal to Gadhafi , and have tried to persuade them to reject him . In New York , U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon left no doubt about where the world body stands on Libya . `` The reported nature and scale of the attacks on civilians are egregious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law , '' he told reporters . `` I condemn them loudly and without qualification . Those responsible must be held accountable in courts of law . '' He noted that the Security Council and the League of Arab States on Tuesday each issued strong statements on the matter . `` The world has spoken with one voice , '' he said . `` The government of Libya must meet its responsibility to protect its people . '' Ban added that he was sending his senior advisers to the region . In Washington , President Barack Obama said the United States condemns the use of violence . `` The suffering and bloodshed is outrageous and it is unacceptable , '' he told reporters as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stood beside him . Libya `` must be held accountable '' for its failure to meet its responsibilities , he said , adding , `` The entire world is watching . '' He said he was sending Clinton to Geneva for international meetings about Libya . The United States is considering a range of tools to pressure Libya to end the violence and respect the rights of its people , U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Wednesday . `` That certainly includes sanctions that could be imposed either bilaterally or multilaterally , '' Crowley said . Peru and Botswana announced they were breaking diplomatic ties with Libya . Peruvian President Alan Garcia said his country suspended diplomatic relations after condemning `` the repression unleashed by Gadhafi . '' Botswana 's foreign affairs ministry said in a statement that it was joining the international community , `` which is calling for action to be taken against those persons who have committed crimes against humanity in the continuing conflict in Libya and hopes that such persons shall be referred to the International Criminal Court to account for their deeds . '' But ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo noted that Libya is not a party to the Rome Statute , which set up the court . `` Intervention by the ICC on the alleged crimes committed in Libya can occur only if the Libyan authorities accept the jurisdiction of the court , '' his statement said . `` In the absence of such step , the United Nations Security Council can decide to refer the situation to the court . The Office of the Prosecutor will act only after either decision is taken . '' French President Nicolas Sarkozy called for prompt European Union sanctions against Libya on Wednesday , such as `` a ban on access to EU territory and financial monitoring . '' Residents in the Libyan capital of Tripoli heard sporadic gunshots overnight , a resident said Wednesday . By daybreak , the main roads in the city had been `` cleaned off as if nothing happened , '' she said . More checkpoints have been set up , especially near the city center , restricting residents ' movements , she said . And a food shortage is getting worse , she said . When her family tried Wednesday morning to buy bread , they found the bakeries were closed . Police cars and downed trees blocked many of the roads in the neighborhoods , and security officials were not allowing pictures to be taken . Witnesses reported seeing about 10 burned-out civilian cars and bodies lying in the streets . Many of the streets were stained with blood , a witness said . In Tripoli 's Dahra neighborhood , people driving white vans cleared away makeshift barricades , a witness said . Wednesday evening , planes circled overhead and shots were fired , though it was n't clear whether the shots were coming from the air or the ground , a witness said . The streets were largely deserted , but one man could be heard in the street screaming in Arabic , `` There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his prophet ! '' -- a liturgical slogan often invoked by Muslims in challenging situations , the witness said . Witnesses said security forces increased their presence after Gadhafi defended his regime in a defiant speech Tuesday . He vowed to die a `` martyr '' and blamed the unrest on `` rats '' who are `` agents '' of foreign intelligence services . He warned that people found to be cooperating with outside forces fomenting discord and those who carry weapons against the country will be executed . A government spokesman blamed U.S. and Israeli intelligence operatives for the unrest . `` We will get rid of them , in collaboration with our people in the eastern province , '' he said . Referring to reports that the military had attacked civilians , the spokesman said , `` We have reports and evidence they are not using arms unless against those who attacked the barracks . '' The government version of events differed markedly from what witnesses reported , including helicopter gunships firing into crowds of protesters . Those caught up in the unrest include asylum seekers and refugees , the U.N. refugee agency said , as it urged neighboring countries not to turn them away . Speaking to reporters in Geneva , Switzerland , the chief spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said she had received troubling reports about their plight . `` A journalist has passed information to us from Somalis in Tripoli who say they are being hunted on suspicion of being mercenaries , '' Melissa Fleming said . `` He says they feel trapped and are frightened to go out , even though there is little or no food at home . '' The U.N. refugee agency praised Tunisia and Egypt for `` positive indications '' that they will keep their borders open to people fleeing Libya . The agency 's staff is working at the Tunisian border to monitor the situation and identify `` vulnerable individuals for whom immediate assistance is needed -- such as children without parents , women with children , and the elderly , '' the agency said in a statement . An English-speaking Egyptian fleeing Libya told CNN of systematic destruction of cell phone cards and cell phone memory chips at checkpoints on the road to the border with Tunisia . He also reported thousands of people gathering at the Tripoli airport , both inside and outside . Meanwhile , the United Nations terminated Gadhafi 's daughter 's stint as a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. Development Program . U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said Aisha Gadhafi was appointed goodwill ambassador for Libya in 2009 to address HIV\\/AIDS and violence against women in the country . Nesirky said the U.N. agency ended its agreement with her given recent events in Libya . In an interview on Libyan state-run television , Aisha Gadhafi said she had heard the news . `` I ca n't verify if it 's true or not , but all the Libyans who know me ... know that I am the goodwill ambassador with or without the United Nations . '' On Wednesday , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad urged leaders of regional countries to let people express their opinions , according to the Islamic Republic News Agency . The Iranian official news agency also reported that Ahmadinejad wondered how the ruler of a country could kill his own people using guns and tanks . But after Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's regime was toppled this month following 18 days of protests , Iranian protesters emulated them by taking to the streets , where they were met with force .

February 25th , 2011 7:58 am ET it is amazing . where is united nation ? where is u. s ? loss of life is nothing for them if it is note take place in a big country or europe . my god who can hear the cry of civilians in libya ? who can help them ? they are saying these world is interconconnected and united but where is the effect ? just seeing the massacreto present the report finally ? February 25th , 2011 2:16 pm ET Opposition groups in Libya are armed with machine guns and machetes . Even half the military has defected to support the opposition . Hence what is happening in Libya is an armed revolution . It certainly is n't a group of peaceful protesters being cut down by a mad dog dictator . Even the opposition admit they have captured cities with force . The western media has turned on Gaddafi but has not produced a genuine alternative leader which is any better than Gaddafi . Whats the deal here ? Are we suppose to support an armed gang without knowing if its eventual leader is better than Gaddafi ?? . What happens in Libya is not the business of any outside nation . But Libya has oil which the west needs . Can you imagine when the USA had it 's civil war , if Europeans claimed business interests in America need to be protected via sanctions or force . This would have been unjustifiable interference in another countries business . So why does Britain and America constantly feel they have a right to interfere with other countries ? Libya 's issues are for Libyans to resolve , but all middle east protest movements are being co-opted by the west . How about a fair policy of non interference in other peoples issues . How about an even handed approach such as no financial aid to any state in the region and let them sought their own lives out . Lets not pretend the west is acting is self defense , the west is more than capable of defending its own territory . So why not just keep our noses out of others business ? This also applies to Israel . Why not let them sought their own problems out ? If the anger all their neighbors to the point where Israel is invaded , tough luck on Israel . If Israel feels provoked by Arabs and invades them , tough luck on the Arabs . But currently the west has supports Israel with the biggest military in the region , allowed them to break international law and then tries to pretend it is neutral . Just let them all have space to sought themselves out and no more aid or military favors to anyone . Alternatively lets just own up and admit we are all still colonialists at heart . We have the power to control other people land . We want their oil and we want them subservient to our interests . This might not be moral , but at least it would be open , honest and without all the BS hypocrisy about democracy . Democracy being good as long as it is the democratic leader the west wants etc. . . February 25th , 2011 2:39 pm ET p.s. how long before Egypt also realizes it 's been cheated out of its revolution . Mubaraks hand picked men remain in control and nothing has really changed . Within six months -LRB- when real elections are due -RRB- Egypt 's revolution will not look so peaceful any more . But the real elephant in the room is Pakistan . All these revolts have been inspired by rising food prices . -LRB- Because the dollar is the worlds reserve currency and because the Federal reserve has created enormous inflation by pumping in trillions of new dollars . QE1 & QE2 have caused the dollar to lose tremendous value and poor people cant buy so much food -RRB- Pakistan is the biggest grain importer in the world !! Its people are starting to starve like those in the middle east , but Pakistan has nuclear weapons . There is en enormous chance that Pakistan will be the first nuclear power to experience civil war before the end of the year . But why does n't the media examine the consequences of the revolts which it gleefully covers with extreme prejudice ?? February 26th , 2011 9:15 am ET It is really heartening to see the people protesting in Libya and seizing control of the cities . It is a great moment of history and for Arab civilization . In the Middle East , the thugs and dictators were ruling . And democracy must come whatever the cost may be . I appeal to the people of Libya and other countries in the middle East that they should not tolerate the dictators and kings anymore . They suck the blood of the general mass . All these years they have exploited the common man in the name of good rule , but in fact they have been busy in filling up their coffers . Whenever there is a news of protests in the middle east i really rejoice that at last the people are demanding change in the form of the government . The people around the world are with you . Do not fear the might of the dictators and thugs , very soon they will flee the country . They just do not have option . And they have to go . Congratulations to the people of Arabian countries for rising against the thugs . February 26th , 2011 12:06 pm ET its about time that the libyan people must show their unity in ousting a desperate dictator . Imagine for 42 years the people were made to believe that the kind of leadership he -LRB- khadafi -RRB- perpertrated in libya is the only key to a prosperous nation . But what had happened now ? This oil rich nation started to crumble . . khadafi is hellbent on staying to power . No matter what , he will continue to use force and psychological warfares . . Dictators are made to use this methods . All I can say is the Libyan people must continue and advance their struggle . Protect the conquered cities in the east ... and most importantly unite for one common enemy against the madman . February 26th , 2011 4:06 pm ET From the shores of Tripoli As I sit in Kuwait , a cloudy day for a celebration , but none the less the Kuwaitis have and are celebrating their 50th year of Independence -LRB- 25 Feb -RRB- and their 20th year of Liberation Day -LRB- 26 Feb -RRB- and we are watching the Kuwaitis in their usual elevated sense of nationalism and patriotism -LRB- akin to our 4th of July -RRB- move forward into their life in a very jubilant manner . I remember quite well the sense of relief when Iraq and it s barbaric occupation of Kuwait came to an end at the concerted effort of the coalition forces , not the least of which was the United States . We are now observing the many activities of nations here in the Middle East as they go through the struggles to move forward and build democratic nations . Currently , the largest and most notable effort is in Libya . Freedom from oppression and freedom of choice does not come free , and never will . Americans , who established a nation , built from wilderness and paid for by the blood of men and women who desired to live a free life in a democratic society with a government whom they controlled are now looking as they have progressed for several hundred years from the meager beginnings as pilgrims to the nowadays pioneers in the countries of the Middle East . Those pioneers desire the same basic human rights as felt by their brethren in many other places in the world . When Americans sit idly by , great evil is furthered by those who would oppress the ones who feed them . We have seen this all over the world and unfortunately , as even we recognize the wrong , we are slow to respond to the cries of the oppressed . It happened in Germany , most notably , prior to the outbreak of World War II and several times since . We are currently fighting in several locations around the world were people have been oppressed and downtrodden , rights denied , lives lost and freedoms forbidden by those who have claimed to be leaders . As times have marched on , so has technology and the atrocities of today , are witnessed and commented on ... today . WE also have the ability to react today and not by just sucking in our breath as we see and hear of such unacceptable actions such as what is apparent in Libya . Americans are great businessmen , probably the greatest in the world . Our economy , our business systems and finance are efficient and profitable . The world has recognized this for some time . Our country is a beloved country and most wanted after by most countries , if not simply a great enjoyment to visit . The people of the Middle East have a great love for the United States . They may not always agree with our President , our international politics and relations with other countries , but greatly love the country and its people . This point is something which , I believe our politicians have missed , ignored or simply have no idea on how to capitalize from the benefit of such an asset in foreign relations actions . WE have wavered between the balance of power , sovereign recognition of powers in countries , benefits of business and economics , the benefits of balance in the lesser of evils and so on . In most cases this is the best anyone could do . In the worst case , which is where we usually find ourselves , we can please all the people and all the countries all the time . WE have helped many and been criticized for doing so by just as many . The question remains , as any individual must ask , did I do the right thing ? You can t please everyone , but you can be true to your ethics and principles in doing what is right , what is fair and what is generous to help others . Simply put , it is the American way and also the way of a vast majority of other people on this planet . Our inaction towards Libya is pathetic . We are looking at a country which , has not been our friend , but could be . We are looking at a country that needs and whose people greatly need and have asked for our guidance , help , support and any assistance which we could easily provide . It is now obvious to the world that things are not right there with the ruler , Gaddafi , killing his own people and oppressing the country in the way it now appears . WE have nothing to lose at this point . We don t have to go in like the Marines did long ago . WE don t need to arrive en masse and occupy the country after saving it . WE do need to show support with more than a limp speech and a wait and see attitude . The entire Middle East is upset to say the least with Gaddafi and what is happening . The vast supporters of the opposition in Libya wish they could do something to help . The Arab world will without doubt , sit , watch , and not take any direct action to save the people of Libya . Now , for the less liberal , less weak approach we need to make some threats of a rather direct type -LRB- sanctions are meaningless and only hurt the folks we should be helping -RRB- . WE should , and we easily have the resources sitting in the Mediterranean , park an aircraft carrier , a destroyer , a missile frigate and a contingency of US Marines off the coast of Libya and provide some sort of direct intervention into the situation if the Gaddafi government does not cease and desist immediately . WE can do this and guess what , who cares if we get another black eye kicking a bully out and taking care of some people who need our help . WE might even make a few new friends . If I were calling the shots , the threats would only be a veiled pretext to just carrying out what needs to be done in a rather surgical manner anyway . You get what you ask for . February 26th , 2011 6:11 pm ET One question that is shouting in our face and nobody seems to be aware of it : WHY DOES N'T THE ARAB LEAGUE INTERVENE ???? There is talk of NATO and US military intervention to stop the unbelievable atrocities of Gaddaffi against his own people , of gathering up UN support for such an action . The problem is we all know what will happen after a NATO or US military action ; it will eventually be seen and portrayed as another imperialist action by the west , trying to impose its own values on an arab state , and doing it anyway only for the oil there . This will in turn weaken the moral standing in the arab world of those that genuinely want democracy and freedom . The only solution is for the Arab League to intervene on the ground to stop this madness , and thus preventing any `` western imperialism '' argument against the local democracy advocates later on . It has already given verbal condemnation of Gaddafi 's actions , and they should prove that these are not empty words . February 27th , 2011 1:45 am ET News of former Justice Minister Mustafa Abdul Jalil to head the Libya by replacing Gadhafi is great & healthy news . It is an indication that Gadhafi & his sons have given up to people pressure & voices of world in response to USA & UNO sanctions whatever . It is better for Gadhafi to transfer the power to Justice Abdul & other countries in the Mid-East should also respond with similar action wherever the turmoil is to hand over power to Justices ex of Courts to facilitate legal & democratic Govt . with written Constitutions to avoid exploitation of people & natural national resources for few elite & political families . It is time for Iran too To give up fake Islamic spiritualism & hand over power to people of Iran who are struggling since last election frauds to Justice of Supreme Court if they have one or opposition group to move forward with legitimate & legal agenda of Iran Democracy which was supposed to be after dethroning Shah of Iran & expected by people of Iran & young generation of Iran who struggling for liberty , freedom & development . Who is this `` Kadafi '' you speak of ??? You pretend to know something and yet you have no clue how to spell a name which has been splashed all over the media for two weeks ??? Yes , you must know so much ... A squirrel in a tree has more knowledge than you . I guess you must be one of those orthodox Jewish Israelis who does n't go to school or get a job , but lives freely of the Israeli state -LRB- US taxes -RRB- to study orthodox Jewish mythology . Your ideas are probably really popular in your mentally challenged environment . February 27th , 2011 10:01 pm ET It was explained why the U.S. and\\/or Obama is low-key on this country and what 's happening ! The reason is\\/was to protecct any Americans i.e. , not to have them taken Americans hostages ! February 27th , 2011 10:05 pm ET It was explained why the U.S. and\\/or Obama is\\/was low-key on Libya and what 's happening there ! The reason is\\/was to protect Americans i.e. , not to have Americans taken as hostages . Israel does not have the biggest military in the ME although it may be the strongest and best organized . It , without doubt , has the most thorough , honest and transparent legal division which ensures that international law is consulted before every mission and any deviation from approved codes of conduct is subsequently investigated and if necessary refered to external investigation . If is argued by some that the Israeli army would be even stronger if it did not have to spend almost 80 % of the military aid it receives from the US back in the US which although providing for thousands of American jobs also hinders Israel 's ability to increase further its own advanced military developments . -LRB- Israel receives only military aid . No economic aid so forget your claims that Israeli education , or ultra-orthodox lack of it , is paid for by US taxpayers . Save that argument for the hate and anti-semitism that is taught in Arab schools\\/midrassas throughout the region paid for by US and EU etc taxes -RRB- . Meanwhile , as you may have been implying , the US and others have provided far more support to regimes in the ME which are finally being revealed for what they are . You fail to question the West 's neutrality in that respect when their hypocrisy and moral compromise is staring you in the face . Everyone kicks up to the level of his personal potential . Good example : John A. - kicks very low ! - Fight forever to impose worldwide a 7 century culture - Making revolution and busting Islamism 's Muslim brotherhood Islamist - Politicians agenda do n't call to deal with Muslim society issues March 1st , 2011 10:30 am ET Miriam , Even Israel 's Jewish Virtual Library explains your ideas are as delusional as your friend Ariely 's . A pro Israeli Library states American aids to Israel is -LRB- but they forget to mention many other benefits , because the real numbers would terrify American tax payers -RRB- : Altogether , since 1949 , Israel has received more than $ 106 billion in assistance . This includes the four special allocations , the $ 10 billion in loan guarantees -LRB- spread over five years -RRB- approved in 1992 , the $ 9 billion in guarantees offered in 2003 , and a variety of other smaller assistance-related accounts , such as refugee resettlement -LRB- nearly $ 1.6 billion overall since 1973 -RRB- , the American Schools and Hospitals Abroad Program -LRB- ASHA -RRB- , which supports schools , libraries and medical centers that demonstrate American ideas and practices -LRB- -LRB- $ 144 million -RRB- , and cooperative development programs -LRB- a total of $ 186 million since 1981 -RRB- . The total does not include funds for joint military projects like the Arrow missile -LRB- for which Israel has received more than $ 1 billion in grants since 1986 -RRB- , which are provided through the Defense budget . President Bush requested $ 60 million for the Arrow for FY2003 and $ 136 million in FY2004 . The United States also has provided $ 53 million for the Boost Phase Intercept program and $ 139 million for the Tactical High Energy Laser program under development in Israel to complement the Arrow . Though the totals are impressive , the value of assistance to Israel has been eroded by inflation . While aid levels remained constant in total dollars from 1987 until 1999 , the real value steadily declined . On the other side of the coin , Israel does receive aid on more favorable terms than other nations . For example , all economic aid is given directly to the Israeli government rather than allocated under a specific program . Also , starting in 1982 , Israel began to receive all its economic aid in a lump sum early in the fiscal year instead of in quarterly installments as is done for other countries . Israel also receives offsets on FMS purchases -LRB- U.S. contractors agree to offset some of the cost of military equipment by buying components or materials from Israel -RRB- . It was inevitable that Libyans would sack Gadahafi despite the propaganda he attempted to spread at a time even the military turned against him . Mercenaries in Libya were only interested in loot . Whatever they could derive from the chaos . He lost his legitimacy the moment the protests began and the honorable thing for him to have done was to quit . It 's really worthy of celebration . Bravo to Libyans and the rest of the world . Cheers guys and all the best . It can only get better . Ok guys and I 'm always much obliged . Firstly , the Jewish Virtual Library is not Israeli and is a reference library encyclopedia . Since you provided the link , it is easy for everyone to see that you have selectively copied and pasted a couple of paragraphs obviously written number of years ago . The whole article has clearly - been updated several times over several years . You conveniently do n't include the details of how there is no longer any US economic aid to Israel , that US economic grants to Israel ended in 1959 and until 1985 aid consisted of loans that were repaid . One can also read that before 1971 , Arab states received three times more aid than Israel , plus additional aid from the USSR , Europe , Asia etc. . So , far from being delusional , the facts are clear . Israel does not receive economic aid from the US . What you have succeeded in doing is bringing to are attention the fact that you have a persistent ability to be very selective in your copy and pastes , conveniently obscuring the whole picture . You 've also enabled us to again refute many other claims you have repeatedly made about US military aid and support for Israel . March 5th , 2011 1:38 pm ET John A ur such a smart ass . . I bet u eat books for breakfast . haha Miriam , obviously your not good with economics . American loans paid to Israel at preferential rates , are given as a lump sum at the beginning of each year . This allows Israel to gain interest which would normally benefit American tax payers . Not to mention the long history of fuel subsidies etc. . . Not to mention all the American businesses which set up in Israel to create Israeli jobs and not American jobs . Most of Israels tech industry is an off shoot of American business with guaranteed American orders and free technology transfers . Orders given to Israel which could have been given to American businesses and American workers . You think that is n't economic aid ?? Clearly this does n't even include the free gift of 3 billion every year on military aid . Miriam , as Hilary Clinton said the USA has lost the information war . Because everyone knows the USA and her ally Israel lie , lie and lie some more . Marc , Is the term `` smart '' an insult in America ? That would explain a lot hahaha March 7th , 2011 5:40 am ET Obama is afraid of kadafi , am a nigerian when i was in lybian 7yrs ago 3 of my friends where hang to death coldely by lybian authority while because they were found guilty by toasting a girl at noon in the aftenoon , this man kadafi need to be naked nd floog him mercilessly ... You think a new era of democracy and public good will start with a merciless flogging ? Perhaps you should go back to your cave and return to this blog after you have had time to evolve ... Lets say in another 2000 years ... Loan guarantees are not grants and no US funds are transferred to Israel . There is absolutely no effect on US domestic programs and they have no impact on US taxpayers , unless Israel defaults which it has never done . The only effect on the US is the conditional increased expenditure by Israel in the US . It is widely agreed that the loan guarantees are no longer needed by Israel and that their continuation is probably a US measure designed to be able to pressure Israel with conditions . Since this is a ME blog , it would be interesting if you would occasionally enlighten us about US and EU aid , loans , grants , guarantees etc etc to all the other countries in the region . We would all be shocked at the tax-payers ' cost in supporting the anti-democratic , dictatorial , autocratic , oil-controlling , terror-supporting , already wealthy regimes . Its really hard to believe you cant already understand . But imagine you went to a bank , without any security and was offered a 3 billion dollars loan and at a cheaper interest rate than everyone else . The loan is also repeated every year in lump sum which you can place in your bank to invest and make more money from . Are you not intelligent enough to exploit this unique privilege ? Miriam , its time that you start to be honest with yourself . Its not that everyone who disagrees with you is wrong . Its not that you are a horrible person . Its simply you have not been blessed the basic intelligence needed to understand the world you live in . Probably you are great at sport , art or music . But leave economics , law , business , politics to others , as clearly these subjects far , far are beyond you . March 9th , 2011 3:17 pm ET And Miriam , you rightly state Israel is not the only country receiving aid in the middle east . For example , America funded the dictator Mubarak if Mubarak agreed to close the Gaza boarder and kiss Israels behind . America also funds the Saudi dictatorship , if they agree to send oil to Israel and kiss Israels behind . All the aid sent to the region is either to directly fund lazy Israels existence or to buy friends in the region for anti social Israel . Do you think the people of Egypt benefited from the billions sent to arm the dictator Mubarak . Was that money sent to create freedom and democracy ? Or was it even more American tax payers money being used to prop up illegitimate allies for the criminal state of Israel ? In return Israel remains as Americas key attack threat to the oil regions . If the Saudi 's do n't do what America wants , the CIA can let a car bomb of in Jerusalem , blame the Arabs and give Israel the green light to invade in supposed retaliation . Thats all the Jews are being used for in the middle east . Come on , how many times has Israel invaded its neighbors and for how many decades has Israel been unable to find a peaceful solution . Even the entire Arab league offered peace and recognition of Israel , if it withdrew to its internationally recognized boarders of 1967 . Bup there is no way Israel wants peace , theres no way America will allow peace . Israel is there to be Americas out of control rottweiler and use terror to manipulate middle east politics . The games up Miriam . Its all becoming to obvious . The stars and stripes fly over Iraq . America threaten war with Iran , they prop up most other regions with dictators who receive instructions from Washington . America is the only nation that supports Israel at the UN . The picture is clear . Israel has nothing to do with Judaism or any other religion . Israel is just one of several American strategies to destabilize the middle easter and control its oil . There never were any `` internationally recognized 1967 borders '' . There were recognized 1949 Armistice Lines , accepted by Israel but subsequently rejected by Arabs , confirmed by their repeated attacks across those lines preceding the 1967 war . In fact it was internationally recognized that those lines were never to become borders since they were indefensible and had no political or legal significance . Peace agreements with Jordan and Egypt were based on those facts and Palestinian negotiators are fully aware of those facts but that does n't stop them deceiving others with their rhetoric . The Jewish Agency\\/Israel accepted all UN resolutions concerning partition and negotiation , the same resolutions rejected by some or all of the Arabs . For example , the three `` No 's '' of the Arab League in Khartoum , no peace , no negotiation , no recognition . Go ahead propagating lies , but everyone should know that that 's what they are . The world may not like Khadafi , but he 's the only moslem in the middle east that does n't wait for `` consensus '' or look over his shoulder to see if he has backing or whatever . The SOB is one smart north african that will not hesitate to slaughter several thousand fellow moslems to maintain his way of life , and that of his buddies . Trust me , after the smoke settles and the other moslem nations do NOTHING , the sand will swallow up the mass graves of the few thousand brave that opposed him . Amazingly , the `` great '' moslem leader , Egypt will sit on its hands and show the world that islam is a do nothing , cowardly theology that is only capable of killing those that are less capable of a good fight . However many moslems this madman kills ... IT 'S A DAMN GOOD START !!! March 21st , 2011 9:20 am ET We are broke , the US is in shambles and we are now ramping up yet another middle east war ? This is crazy and misdirected . No more wars take care of US business and your own people none of these other country help us in our own civil war . . Its time to STAND AS ONE AND TAKE BACK OUR GOVERMENT AND STOP THE BULLYING . . If they want to kill each other then so be it . I do not want to see my tax dollars going to these other countrys that do NOT GIVE A CRAP ABOUT U. . . HOW MUCH WILL YOU GUYS TAKE BEFOR YOU STAND UP FOR YOURSELFES AND YOUR KIDS . . REMEMBER THIS OUR GOVERMENT HAS KILLED ITS OWN PEOPLE AND NO ONE WAS THERE TO HELP US ... THINK ABOUT IT !!!

On his feelings about the Libya crisis : `` I think I 'd make it very clear that the United States is not going to stand by and watch a country slaughter its own people in cold blood , that there is a sense in which there 's a virtual genocide going on . I 'm still hopeful that Libya 's army will take Gadhafi out and I think that 's the solution we can all hope for . There 's clearly a man who has virtually escaped the asylum who is in a position of extraordinary power . '' `` But when a person starts talking about killing his own citizens and then following up on it , creating rivers of blood in his own streets and blowing up the one resource that his country has to give it a foundation for any economic hope , he 's clearly a mad man and this is a person who is maniacal and now we are beginning to learn that he did in fact order the bombing of Pan Am 103 over the Lockabee , the disco in Berlin . You know these are acts of international terrorism and I expect more than a strongly worded letter from the UN . '' On what actions he 'd take toward Libya if he was president : `` I think a no-fly zone would be absolute -- yeah a no fly zone very important because that way you keep him from flying mercenaries in , maybe even a naval armada somewhere off the 3 mile international boundaries , just as a presence , and even to say we stand ready to do what is necessary to make sure there 's not an act of genocide against those people . '' On whether President Obama is being too timid in his handling of the crisis : `` In light of the urgency , but I do n't have the NSA report sitting in front of me . So I 'm always a little careful to say , here 's what I would do , because I think you have to base a decision based on good intelligence and information which a person in my capacity as an ordinary citizen at this point simply does n't have . '' On the role his new book plays in his presidential decision-making process : `` This is the message . If people read this book and say those are some ideas I can relate to , these are ideas I think would be good for the country , then that 's going to help me believe that there is real support for what I stand for . I do n't think politics and running for president is just about can I go through the political manipulations to get the job . It 's , if I get that job , do the people of the country support what I would do and I think I owe it to them to say , ` Here 's what I do , here 's where I stand . These are my principals . ' '' On Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels ' call for a `` truce '' on social issues until economic problems are dealt with : `` I make it very clear , in the very first chapter , I establish that the issues about family and marriage are economic issues . We have a 300 billion dollar a year dad deficit in this country . That 's the cost that the taxpayers for dads who disappear and let the government pick up the tabs for their kids . We have an issue also where two thirds of the children of this country who live in poverty would n't live in poverty if their mothers were married to the fathers of those kids . So when people say , ' I do n't want to talk about social issues ' - and let me be very clear , I love Mitch Daniels . I think he would be a great presidential candidate , I think he would be a good president , but I 'm not arguing with Mitch Daniels . I 'm making the case that you can not say these are peripheral issues if you really are concerned about the economy because there is an economic consequence of a broken family . '' On overturning Roe v. Wade : `` I think it 's a bully pulpit and it goes beyond just Roe versus Wade . See , all that did was say that the states no longer could make the decision , the federal government would . If you turned it back to the states , some states would have more liberal abortion than they have now . It would n't necessarily fix anything and then you have this geographical morality which I find absurd . That is the logic of the civil war , that you can have some states where slavery is okay and others where it is n't . That does n't make sense . If it 's right then everybody ought to abide by it . If it 's wrong , them everyone ought to change . So the question is , is it right for one human being to take the life of another human being because it represents a financial burden or a social disruption ? Now that 's an argument we can have but once we 've had it , we have to decide that either it is okay or is n't okay . I say it 's not okay . '' `` I think the president stepped off into a deep hole when he decided arbitrarily and I think illegally that his attorney general and his justice department will not even defend the law of the land which is the Defense of Marriage Act . I think I 've spent a page , maybe a page and a half of that entire book dealing with this issue . It 'll probably get a lot of controversy . I invite people to read it for themselves . Read it and if they think that I 'm off-base , fine -- then they can sell it at a used book store . `` Government should legislate affirmation of what marriage is . Marriage is not whatever we want it to be . Marriage is a man and a woman committed in a relationship for life , that 's all it 's ever been . Thirty-three states have had this on the ballot . Thirty-three , including very liberal states like Maine and California , and in every one of those states , no exceptions , none , those states have affirmed marriage to mean what it has traditionally meant . On Mitt Romney 's imposition of a universal health care plan in Massachusetts when he was governor : `` I think the objective analysis of the Massachusetts plan has been that it is done exactly opposite of what it was supposed to do . It was supposed to lower costs , it raised costs . Supposed to create access , people now have a hard time getting into the doctor . It was supposed to open up broader levels of coverage , now people are having to cut back coverage because they ca n't afford everything that they put out there on the plate I do n't think this is a political killer for Governor Romney , but I think he has to come out and say , ` States are supposed to take bold actions . ' '' I mention in the book the quote by Louis Brandeis , Supreme Court justice back in 1932 , who talked about states as a laboratory so that you test it in a state , not the whole country . If it works you do it , if it does n't work you do n't inflict it upon the other fifty states . '' He needs to explain why can not win the primary . That way he can stop waisting our time . He will lose the primary again , and he knows it . February 24 , 2011 03:14 pm at 3:14 pm | Unless someone is feeding him information that he should not have , he has no idea what the President know or why the WH is doing this or that . So until your in charge , shut up . February 24 , 2011 03:15 pm at 3:15 pm | DemoCommunists for a Better Way - Bankruptcy Obama has been a JOKE when it comes to Libya . He was more out spoken with Mubarack , one of our allies . Where are our aircraft carriers ? No where to be seen . I heard there was ONE US warship ship in the Med , a destroyer . Obama has shown the world just how weak kneed he is . And hundreds , maybe thousands , will die because of it . February 24 , 2011 03:18 pm at 3:18 pm | Keep your nose out of Libya 's business . You may be or have some authority here , but last I checked it 's somewhat diminished by the fact that you are not now holding office . Keep your opinions to yourself , and please allow the Libyan people the respect they deserve by letting them fix their country the way they want to . February 24 , 2011 03:32 pm at 3:32 pm | Obama is clueless on how to handle foreign affairs . Or did you forget he picked Biden as his foreign policy expert ? Yeah , what a disaster and other countries know it . February 24 , 2011 03:34 pm at 3:34 pm | The no fly zone is not entirely up to Obama and Huck is right he is not privy to the information needed to pass an opinion . He should share that with Republican leader Palin . The efforts in Libya are not just that of the US and people have to realize there is a lot at stake here and a no fly zone is a gamble that could go horribly wrong . Obama was excellent on this issue by making sure that he did not cock off towards Gadhafi before the Americans in Libya were secured . Gadhafi could potentially blow up the oilfeilds and kill thousands of innocent people and this has to be handled properly just like Obama is doing . Good for Huck in keeping the right tone here February 24 , 2011 03:35 pm at 3:35 pm | Yes , I see it now . Huckabee would be a good president for Libya . And I 'm sure ` DemoCommunists for a Better Way -- Bankruptcy ' will vote for him too . If there are two people who deserve to be in Libya , it is those two , becasue they have clearly given up on being in any western country that embraces the Enlightenment . February 24 , 2011 03:56 pm at 3:56 pm | Does the man understand the term civil war ? It is not our job to go into ither countries and do anything ! This is not gencide , this is civil unrest . It 's mind boggling to think Republicans of which he is one , will oppose healthcare for our citizens on the basis of states rights , yet expect the President to step into Lybia 's problems . And what of the 5000 please US troops our goverment has allowe dto die for no reason - we should not have invaded Iraq , yet he does n't condemn us for sending our men and women over ther . Sound hypocritcal to me February 24 , 2011 03:59 pm at 3:59 pm | Why was a question directed to Huckabee regarding the Republicans efforts to union busting ? He seems to have an answer for ever thing . President Obama is doing just fine . The previous administration left this country in the ditch and it is going to take years to get this ship right . We have two wars that we are currently engaged in that is a big drain our economy and the damage that banks did to us with the toxic loans is more than enough . All of this corruption and no one is being prosecuted because of what ? We also have the Kouch brothers that are influencing the Republicans to bust the unions to put more money in their pockets . So IMO the President is doing just fine . February 24 , 2011 04:06 pm at 4:06 pm | Frankly , I do n't mind Huckabee as a person , seems likable though I completely disagree with his beliefs . Way too religious for office . February 24 , 2011 04:18 pm at 4:18 pm | February 24 , 2011 04:21 pm at 4:21 pm | equal means equal ! all americans , gay or straight or somewhere in between , should have the same basic rights and that includes the right to marry . they may not want to exercise that right as often as newt gingrich has but they should have that option . February 24 , 2011 04:23 pm at 4:23 pm | -LRB- Insert Repub dipster 's name here -RRB- comments included criticizing President Obama over -LRB- anything and everything -RRB- . Only a fool would ever listen to these media whores who continue to flap their lips and are completely uninformed -LRB- they do n't get high-level briefings -RRB- and have absolutely no responsibility with the outcome of the situations President Obama deals with every day . It 's such a sad commentary on our nation that we have so many willing to do so much to try to make our president and our country fail , simply to gain personal and political power . February 24 , 2011 04:25 pm at 4:25 pm | Why is n't Huckabee advocating we attack North Korea ? The government there has been starving its people to death for years . How about invading Saudi Arabia because their religious police would rather let girls be burned alined in a school than let firefighters help them ? When Scotland pardoned the Lockerbie bombers , should we have invaded Great Britain ? What about Somalia and the former Yugoslavia ; did Huckabee support our efforts there or did he sit on the sidelines and criticize President Clinton -LRB- because he 's a Democrat -RRB- ?

Libya has denounced al Qaeda in the past Documents show that more Libyans than citizens in other Arab nations join al Qaeda -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Al Qaeda 's North African wing has said `` it will do whatever we can to help '' the uprising in Libya , according to a statement the militant group posted on jihadist websites The statement by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb was posted Thursday , said SITE , a terrorist-tracking organization based outside Washington . In the statement , the group said Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's decision to hire mercenaries and use planes to fire on protesters invalidates claims that the group is killing innocent civilians . Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb started as the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat with aspirations to overthrow the Algerian government . Around 2004 , it joined forces with al Qaeda and extended its reach across North and West Africa . To stop the militant group 's growing influence in Libya , the country has in the past denounced al Qaeda and formed an alliance with the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group , which once was aligned with al Qaeda before it formally ended a nearly two-decades armed struggle against Gadhafi 's regime . In 2006 , al Qaeda documents found by U.S. forces in Iraq showed that per capita , Libya surpassed other Arab nations in the number of citizens joining al Qaeda . The regime 's fear was that the terror group would bring its fight back to Libya .

The 23-year-old American basketball player had tried several times to get to the airport , but his efforts were repeatedly derailed by mercenaries , soldiers , and bureaucratic red tape . Now safely on a U.S.-chartered ferry bound for Malta with about 300 other passengers -- 167 of them fellow Americans -- Benzegala said Friday he 'll only let himself feel relief when he 's back in the United States . `` There 's so many details I just ca n't get into until I get home and feel safe , but at least I 've made it this far , '' said Benzegala , who had come to Libya only three weeks ago to play on a government-run team backed by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's son , Saif . `` I 'm just thankful to be alive , '' he told CNN . ... Anything could have happened . There was no guarantee I was going to get out safely . '' Even though he 's on his way home to Ohio , he 's still haunted by stories of those he left behind , including a teammate who was held at gunpoint by a mercenary one day as he tried to get to the airport . A Libyan soldier was able to calm the mercenary down , Benzegala said . `` He definitely was in serious danger and probably would have been killed . ... The mercenary was very , very violent and aggressive ; he just looked like he was itching to shoot somebody . '' For Americans Erika and Franz Fearnley , the sound of protests and gunfire that kept getting closer and closer to their neighborhood just outside the Libyan capital ultimately forced them to make a dash for the airport in hopes of leaving the violence behind . `` The crowds sounded as if more and more people were joining in , -LRB- and -RRB- just hearing the gunfire and just knowing that people were probably losing their lives '' finally made them pack up , Erika Fearnley told CNN 's `` Parker-Spitzer '' on Thursday . They and other Americans who have fled Libya 's descent into chaos have harrowing tales of escaping the carnage . As Benzegala ran out of food and money -- living off of a single bowl of spaghetti for the past two days -- he decided he had to take a chance and get to the airport to leave the country . It was a fateful decision by the former University of Tampa star point guard , so used to taking chances on the court but feeling out of his element in a foreign city under siege . As the Fearnleys headed to the airport , they were stopped at a checkpoint manned by soldiers with machine guns , a scene Franz Fearnley described as `` terrifying . '' `` They knocked on the window ... they wanted to see our passports , '' he explained . `` It was scary , '' Erika Fearnley added . Salah Gamoudi , 24 , returned to Oregon on Tuesday from Libya , where the dual citizen was working with Ernst & Young as an auditor of oil companies . As security forces started cracking down on protesters , Gamoudi said he , like other Tripoli residents , became fearful for his life and the lives of his family members . He picked up a baseball bat to use as a weapon , if he needed one ; his neighbors fortified the streets and guarded their homes . At the airport , the scene was one of confusion and disorder , Benzegala and the Fearnleys said . `` The airport was full to capacity . They were not allowing anyone else in , '' said Franz Fearnley , who had been working on a land development project in Libya for the previous month . But `` our -LRB- Libyan -RRB- driver had an uncle at the airport , thank God , and he was able to get us in , but once we got in , you could n't even move '' because it was so crowded , he said . George Sayar , who was in Libya with his Florida-based construction company building roads and bridges , described the airport scene as `` utter chaos . '' `` I would say there was approximately 30-40 ,000 people , most of them without tickets , trying to get into the three entrances to the terminal , '' Sayar told CNN on Friday . `` We pretty much had to push and shove our way through thousands of people , and myself and two of my colleagues finally made it after about three hours of pushing , shoving , and kicking . '' Another contractor who managed a tight escape was Cyrus Sany , who was working as an electrical engineer in Libya for a Virginia-based firm . He said it took him six hours to get from the airport parking lot to the ticket counter . Sany said it was a `` very extreme experience '' that he 'll never forget . Benzegala found himself crushed between the gates and travelers storming to get in after he arrived at the airport . `` I got in a skirmish , actually , trying to calm people down and got pushed to the ground by a guard and when I got up he hit me in the face and there were a couple other guys I saw get hit as well . '' In the end he got a ticket and arrived at the departure area , but that was the end of the line . Immigration officials saw that there was no entrance stamp on his U.S. passport , and refused to let him board his flight , or book a new ticket out . Benzegala is a dual U.S.-Algerian citizen and had used his Algerian passport to enter the country . He said he did n't think twice when he turned the passport over to his agent after getting the entrance stamp . He returned to the abandoned sports complex and managed to call the U.S. Embassy , but officials there would only tell him to keep away from the windows and wait out the violence . He learned about the chartered ferry in talking to CNN , and decided to make a run for it around dawn Wednesday when the fewest number of people were in the streets . Calls to his agent finally got through and his Algerian passport was returned along with a ride out to the port . His teammate , a U.S. resident whose name Benzegala did n't want published for fear of his safety , did n't think he 'd be allowed on the ferry since he was not yet a U.S. citizen . He planned to make another attempt to get to the airport , but his whereabouts are unknown . On board the ferry , Benzegala said people stretched out on the floors to sleep , feeling safe at last . Those awake shared stories about their escape and the violence they had witnessed , but also fears about friends and family left behind . A U.S. Embassy official on board the ship , which was delayed for nearly two days because of high seas , warned Benzegala not to speak to the media before departure , explaining that revealing details about the situation could jeopardize the safety of all those on board . As for the Fearnleys , now staying with family in New Jersey , they 're also worried about the friends they left behind . `` It 's just sad , '' Franz Fearnley said .

They predicted the death toll would rise by morning . Six pro-regime soldiers who were captured said they had been told that the city was being run by Arab militants and it was their job to liberate it , according to the doctors , who asked not to be identified . The soldiers added that they had been misled so that they would fight against their countrymen , the doctors said . By the end of the day , the situation was calm in the seaside city , they said . The casualties were announced shortly after Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi accused followers of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden of brainwashing the youth of Zawiya with hallucinogenic drugs , resulting in the unrest . `` They put it with milk or with other drinks , spiked drinks , '' he said . After taking the tablets , `` they attack this police station or that one so they can steal from there the criminal records . '' Why are people flocking to Malta ? CNN crew greeted as ` liberating heroes ' He pleaded with the protesters ' mothers to track them down in the streets of the coastal town about 55 kilometers -LRB- about 35 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli and take them home . He added that he had ordered an end to the violence there , but his order upset his security forces . `` They told me they are being shot at and they were doing it in self-defense , '' Gadhafi said . `` Why do you give us orders to stop ? '' Addressing the people of Zawiya , he sent condolences to the families of the dead and wounded . `` These are our children , '' he said . `` We are quite upset about the senseless loss of lives . '' Zawiya 's residents are free to do as they like , though there will be consequences , he said . `` If you want to pit against one another , then it 's up to you , '' he said . `` But the borders of the city will be sealed in order to stop it from spreading elsewhere . '' He added , `` How can such lunatic youth cause such anarchy ? '' Gadhafi said Libya has peaceful ways for its citizens to address their grievances . `` We are not like Egypt or Tunisia , '' he said , referring to two countries that have ousted their leaders in recent weeks . `` Here , the authority is in the hands of the people . You can change your authority , just make committees . And if you think they are corrupt , take them to court . In an apparent allusion to calls for government officials to be held accountable for violence against Libyan civilians , Gadhafi said it is bin Laden who should be prosecuted . `` He 's responsible for any acts of murder or sabotage , '' Gadhafi said . He accused foreigners of fomenting the discontent . `` These acts can not happen by Libyan men , '' he said . `` No Libyan of any background would go into this , join these acts of sabotage . '' Some of the people involved in the opposition , he said , were detained by the United States in Guantanamo . Finally , he expressed confidence that all will end up will for his regime . `` I believe Zawiya will toe the line , '' he said , then directed his final comment to the city 's residents themselves . `` Please live up to my expectations , people of Zawiya . '' A resident of Tripoli who said she was too afraid to give her name for fear of retribution , called Kadhafi 's speech `` crazy . '' `` We 're all in our houses like we 're sitting in jail , '' she said . `` We ca n't go outside or we get shot . We hear the bullets . '' She called for other nations to impose a no-fly zone so that Kadhafi would not be able to fly in mercenaries . Violence occurred elsewhere too Thursday . A formerly pro-government newspaper in Libya reported Thursday that African mercenaries were shooting at unarmed civilians in Tajura , about 25 miles east of Tripoli . CNN could not confirm the report . Ten days into protests that have resulted in his loss of control of eastern Libya and led members of his government to defect , Gadhafi faced new international pressure Thursday . Switzerland ordered that his assets , and those of his entourage , be frozen , the Swiss Foreign Ministry said . Gadhafi 's characteristically rambling remarks followed reports that anti-government forces had gained control of Zawiya . At the hospital , a woman who said her son had been shot told CNN , `` Blood is all over the streets . '' We ca n't go outside or we get shot . We hear the bullets . The woman said unarmed people had been fired on indiscriminately . `` We want to call all human beings : Zawiya is finished , '' she said . `` The people -LRB- are -RRB- finished . The people -LRB- are -RRB- dying . '' She said it was unclear who was behind were shooting . Many seemed to be African mercenaries , but they may have been from the government or military , she said . `` People are crying , '' she said , calling for help from the world . `` Where -LRB- are -RRB- the people ? Where is the peace ? '' The hospital in Zawiya is `` a disaster , '' she said , adding that some shooters had entered the hospital and insisted that no one was killed . CNN could not confirm reports for many areas in Libya . The Libyan government maintains tight control of communications and has not responded to repeated requests for access to the country . CNN has interviewed numerous witnesses by phone . Misrata -- sometimes spelled Misurata -- is in the hands of the opposition , who have driven out the mercenaries , witnesses and media reports said . It is the country 's third-largest city and is east of Tripoli . Witnesses and reports also said the town of Az Zintan was under opposition control . The opposition already controls Libya 's second-largest city , Benghazi , where crowds cheered as international journalists drove through . The only shooting that could be heard was celebratory gunfire . Men in their 20s were guarding the city with shotguns , clubs or hunting knives . But Tripoli was a different story . Gunfire erupted at dawn Thursday as chanting crowds dispersed . Government security forces were tightening their grip on the capital , according to sources . In one neighborhood , no one was allowed in or out . `` There 's nobody walking in the street , nobody is trying to get out , even to look through the window , '' said a resident who , for security reasons , did not want to be identified . `` It 's a little scary . '' She said she was risking her life by talking to a reporter . `` I 've been trying to keep my identity hidden , '' the woman said . `` There are reported kidnappings happening in homes for anybody credible that is talking to the media and giving them the truth about what 's happening in Libya . '' Continuing a stream of defections among Libyan diplomats , the ambassador to Jordan , Mohammed Hassan Al Barghathi , said Thursday he was resigning because of the unrest . So , too , did a cousin of Gadhafi , Ahmed Gadhaf al-Dam , a top security official who was considered one of Gadhafi 's closest aides . In a news release , his office said he left Libya last week `` in protest of the way the crisis was handled '' and that he had resigned . Underscoring the growing distance between the Gadhafi regime and Libyan diplomats , the flag hanging outside the Libyan Mission to the United Nations in New York was the opposition flag ; the regime 's flag had been taken down . But an anchor on state television said that Libyan diplomats and staff in Saudi Arabia had sent a cable of support `` paying their respective loyalty to the leader of Libya . '' The U.N. Security Council will meet privately at 3 p.m. Friday to discuss taking additional measures against Libya . The U.N. Human Rights Council also plans to meet Friday to discuss a resolution that would suspend Libya from the council . The resolution would condemn `` the massive and unacceptable violence currently being perpetrated in this country , '' French Foreign Minister Michele Alliot-Marie said Thursday in a statement . `` It holds the Libyan authorities accountable . This violence could constitute crimes against humanity . '' Governments around the world scrambled to get their citizens out of the country . A ferry chartered by the United States to evacuate U.S. citizens remained in port in Tripoli because of bad weather , diplomatic sources said . Dena Drotar said her mother , who was on the ship , told her that her fellow passengers were being fed , but were anxious and having difficulty sleeping , `` so they 're also getting a little bit giddy . '' In Washington , a senior U.S. military official said the Pentagon was looking at `` all options '' it can offer President Barack Obama in dealing with the crisis . `` Our job is to give options from the military side , and that is what we are thinking about now , '' said the official , who declined to be identified because of the extremely sensitive nature of the situation . `` We will provide the president with options should he need them . '' Obama called French President Nicolas Sarkozy to discuss the situation , and both presidents `` reiterated their demand for an immediate halt to the use of force against the civilian population , '' the French Embassy said .

In the wake of an uprising that has put anti-Gadhafi forces in control of Benghazi and other Libyan territory , President Barack Obama spoke Thursday with the heads of other Western countries on a coordinated response to the crisis , according to the White House . The president has condemned the violence in Libya , and the United States is seeking to evacuate its citizens . American officials have said sanctions and a no-fly zone were among options being discussed to try to stop the Libyan government from attacking protesters . Zakaria said in an interview that he does n't believe sanctions would work . `` The one thing that would make a difference is if the president of the United States called for his ouster , '' Zakaria said . `` And it would make a difference mostly to the opposition , to the anti-Gadhafi forces , and I think they would be tremendously emboldened . '' The author and host of CNN 's `` Fareed Zakaria GPS '' spoke to CNN on Thursday . Here is an edited transcript : CNN : Where are events headed in Libya ? Zakaria : I think Gadhafi ca n't last . The unusual thing about Libya is that it 's a very large country with a very small population , but the population is actually concentrated very narrowly along the coast . So when you hear these stories about cities on the coast being moved over to the anti-Gadhafi forces , this is increasingly most of the country . I think Gadhafi is holed up in Tripoli asking to be treated like a constitutional monarch , so it feels as though these are the last days . Unless he really surrenders , it could be bloody but I think the end is preordained . CNN : Why do you think the Libyan military wo n't rally to his side ? Zakaria : That 's the real question , but I think the military wo n't rally to his side because they see the writing on the wall . They see that the only way to keep this regime in power would be a wholesale massacre of thousands or tens of thousands of Libyans . I ca n't believe they would do that or that ultimately the world would let it happen . At some point there is going to be a crack in the regime , at some point some general or the head of the intelligence service is going to turn and at that point , when the regime cracks , I think then it crumbles . CNN : What opportunities and difficulties does this present for the United States ? Zakaria : Well I 'm a bit puzzled by the Obama administration 's somewhat cautious approach here . I supported the way in which they handled Egypt and Bahrain . I think in both cases , they had longstanding allies that they had very good relations with . They were trying to make sure there was some stability and continuity . The Egyptians had been very good on most foreign policy issues the United States cared about , from fighting al Qaeda to making peace with Israel . In Bahrain , you had not only an important American ally but also a country that hosts a very important naval base and also a somewhat reformist policy . Gadhafi , for all his comical aspects , has been one of the most thuggish , brutal , repressive dictators in the world . But here you have an anti-American rogue state , the principal state sponsor of terrorism for decades , that was under sanctions and international isolation for years and with a dictator who ruled his people in the most brutal manner possible . Gadhafi , for all his comical aspects , has been one of the most thuggish , brutal , repressive dictators in the world . I do n't see why the administration ca n't push harder and be more forceful in its policy on Libya . CNN : The suggestion has been made that the reason is a fear that Americans trying to leave Libya would be taken hostage . Zakaria : If that 's the case perhaps it 's valid , but the truth of the matter is that they took a stronger line against Mubarak than they have taken against Gadhafi . They made clear they thought there needed to be a regime change in Egypt , there needed to be a political transition , a fundamental change , whereas in Libya all they have asked for is an end to the violence . If the president of the United States were to get to the podium and say we believe that the regime in Libya needs to change , that Gadhafi needs to resign , that would be a very important moral signal , and would , I think , give a huge boost to the anti-Gadhafi forces . All this talk about sanctions and international coordination is meaningless . Libya has been under sanctions most of the last 35 years . This is a regime that could n't care less about that . They get their money from oil revenues , they do n't trade much with the world . This is where Libya is different than Egypt and Tunisia . Zakaria : Both of them had active trading relations with the rest of the world , particularly Europe . In Egypt 's case , they are heavily dependent on tourism , so they cared about the international community . I do n't think Gadhafi does at all , he 's never seemed to care in the past when he was not even threatened . I do n't think he does now . CNN : In recent years , the west has agreed to improved relations with Libya in return for concessions by Gadhafi . How does that look in the light of the latest developments ? Zakaria : The way Gadhafi has been willing to slaughter his own people highlights what has always been a central feature of his reign which has been a completely callous attitude toward human life -- whether it was sponsoring terrorist attacks against Americans , or sponsoring terrorism in the region . CNN : So should the United States and the United Kingdom have reached an accommodation with him years ago -- or should they have been focused on regime change ? Zakaria : That 's a tough one . Look he was giving up his nuclear program . That was a very worthwhile diplomatic effort the United States was engaged in . Imagine if Gadhafi had nuclear weapons or even a nuclear program today how much greater the anxieties would be . In order to get him to give up his nuclear program , he wanted something in return . Now we can have a debate about the precise nature of those negotiations and whether he was given too much , but in general I think it was a good thing that we got him to abandon his nuclear program .

Amid six lanes of traffic on the interstate , it was not difficult to see the oversize sticker plastered on his rear window : `` Where is my father ?

Now , a popular revolt in Libya has presented new hope for the Almegaryaf brothers . Gadhafi has vowed rivers of blood to preserve his power . But for the first time since he seized Libya 's helm in 1969 , his fate seems uncertain . As images and reports from Libya flooded the brothers ' television and computer screens this week , Ahmed , Youcif and Bashir could think of nothing except their father . And the possibility that at last , they might find answers to the question that has defined their lives . Youcif , 27 , remembers the day his father was taken away , and could hardly watch footage of Gadhafi 's crackdown on protesters . This was the man he believes is responsible for destroying his own family . How could he simply watch from afar ? He said his goodbyes to Ahmed and Bashir , busy studying economics and international relations at Emory University . Now 21 , Bashir has chosen to study subjects that were dear to the father he has never known . Youcif made his way to the Atlanta airport Tuesday evening to board a flight to Cairo , Egypt , compelled to help in any way he could . For now , he plans to shuttle medical aid into eastern Libya . The Almegaryaf family believes the Libyan people will prevail . They believe Gadhafi is in his last hours , desperation oozing from his words and actions . With that prospect , improbable for so long , the three brothers know only this : They are perhaps on the verge of finally knowing many truths about their nation -- and about their father . Libyan activist Izzat Almegaryaf , with sons Ahmed , left , and Youcif in the late '80s , was a target of Moammar Gadhafi 's . ` Daddy , I want to go with you ' On a March evening 20 years ago , a man wearing a traditional Arab disdasha appeared at the apartment in Cairo that the three young Almegaryaf brothers shared with their parents . Izzat Almegaryaf had fled Gadhafi 's Libya several years earlier , but he had never surrendered his dreams of freedom . The man in the disdasha demanded that Izzat go with him . `` Daddy , I want to go with you , '' pleaded Youcif , then only 6 . His father did not turn back . Plucked from his home and blindfolded , Izzat was put on a jet to Tripoli , the capital of his homeland , and thrown behind bars in one of Gadhafi 's jails . No one informed his family of the charges against him . No one told them of his whereabouts . Gadhafi had called for a `` physical liquidation '' of his political opponents , many of whom were arrested and put to death in public executions , according to Amnesty International . Izzat Almegaryaf was one of Gadhafi 's targets . On that March evening , a family 's life was shattered . A husband , disappeared . A wife , Nora , suddenly alone . And three little boys left fatherless . Youcif and Ahmed , then 5 , yearned to go to the Cairo zoo again with their father so they could feed carrots to the giraffes . Or sit and watch their father play cards with his friends , trying to learn how to mimic his every move . They missed their father 's embrace . Bashir was -- blissfully perhaps -- only five weeks old when Izzat was taken and does not harbor the memories of his older brothers . He grew up constantly asking questions about their father : `` What was Baba like ? '' Three years later , the family settled in suburban Atlanta under the wing of Mohammed Almegaryaf , the boys ' uncle and once a high-ranking Libyan government official who founded the opposition National Front for the Salvation of Libya . They eked out a new life , becoming citizens of a place far from North Africa , always waiting for the day when Gadhafi would tumble and their father would be released . For two agonizing decades , they spent their days longing for one man and hating another . Over the years , people told Nora to forget the life she made with Izzat , a handsome former army officer and political activist who loved poetry and music . They told her she should remarry , find happiness again . Nora refused to abandon her husband . She believed in her heart he would return . And yet , the boys knew that they could not kid themselves . They were dealing with one of the most ruthless regimes in the world . They learned snippets of their father 's circumstances through his letters from Abu Salim prison . But the last was received in the mid 1990s . There has been no direct news of Izzat since then , though reliable witnesses working with human rights groups including Amnesty International and the United Nations Human Rights Council have reported sightings of him up until 1996 , the year Gadhafi squashed an uprising at Abu Salim with brutal force . Human Rights Watch says 1,200 prisoners were killed that day . It would be one thing to cope with a father 's detention . It is another to pass each waking hour not knowing . The boys recalled always being asked by strangers : `` Where is your father ? '' `` He 's away on a business trip , '' Youcif would reply , knowing the security risks for speaking the truth . The family had received anonymous telephone calls threatening them right after Izaat 's abduction . Another time , a suspicious phone call came to Youcif 's elementary school in Atlanta from a man who alleged he was Izzat and that the school should have the boy ready to be picked up . The family felt they were being watched ; that too many people knew too many things about them . That was the nature of Gadhafi 's security apparatus , they said . Sometimes , Youcif had nightmares of his father being pulled out of his cell and shot . Ahmed developed nonepileptic seizures -- sometimes up to seven an hour -- that his therapist concluded were trauma-induced . At first , Nora read out only parts of her husband 's letters that were addressed to the boys . She wanted to spare her tender children the harsh truth . She knew the letters were genuine -- they were written in her husband 's distinct Arabic calligraphy , often difficult to decipher by those unfamiliar with it . He told her he had not been the best husband and father and that it had been due to his `` preoccupation with the Libyan cause . '' To his sons , his `` three musketeers , his dear ones , the light of my eyes , '' he wrote : `` You are my dreams for a better future for all of us . I can not express to you how much I do miss you , for writing wo n't do it justice . You are always on my mind . Your greetings reach me with every breath of fresh air I get in the early morning . They reach me with the birds , which have made a nest on my pillow . Whenever the guards go to sleep , the birds come to me telling me stories about you . Your greetings reach me as the wind plays music on the walls of my cell . You come to me with the sunrise of every sun and fill my heart with love . You come to me at night with every moon . You are always with me . '' He told them to learn how to be strong , to learn to swim and ride a horse . To always be good Muslims . And that one day , he knew , they would be reunited in a free Libya . `` I taught you that our country does not become greater without us standing up to defend it . It only grows with our efforts , sweat and sacrifices , '' he wrote . `` When I was with you , I used to worry for your safety , show you endless love , and give you whatever you asked for , you can only imagine how I feel now as I am far away from you . '' The boys held on to every word . They tried to picture their father sitting in a dark cell . Where did he get the paper ? What was he wearing ? Was he in pain ? How was he treating his diabetes ? Later , they learned from the letters that their father was detained by a Col. Mohamed Hassan , an Egyptian security agent . He had `` disappeared '' along with Jabballah Hamed Matar , another leading Libyan opposition figure in Cairo . The two men were taken to the headquarters of the Egyptian military security for further interrogation and then transferred to Abu Salim prison in Tripoli . `` Your mother may have told you how I asked the butterflies , the flowers and birds to take care of you , '' he wrote to them . `` I asked the wind to gently play with locks of your hair and lessen the difficulties of your life . As for the clouds , I have asked them to rain candy on you , and give you shade when it gets hot , and the sky , I asked it to gently rain love and tenderness onto you . I wrote for you songs and stories about the homeland and made it into a necklace I placed on you when you were young . '' And he asked : `` Do you also think of me ? '' A third brother , Bashir Almegaryaf , 21 , protests this month against the Libyan regime in downtown Atlanta . One step closer to knowing Youcif , who began working at 16 to help support his family , has in many ways stepped into his father 's shoes . Of the three sons , he bears the closest resemblance to Izzat . He has been outspoken in denouncing Gadhafi . He has taken his family 's cause to the U.N. Human Rights Council and to the British Parliament , where he broke down while speaking about his brother 's seizures . He has written to U.S. congressmen and senators . Under international law , he tells them , forced disappearances qualify as torture for the victim and his family . He can not understand why America wo n't help its own citizens who are being tortured . Now , he has committed his strongest act to date , stepping aboard a plane that would carry him physically closer to that place that has fully occupied his heart . Before he left , he spoke of the unbridled violence unfolding in his country . `` It 's literally a genocide , '' he said . `` And we 're doing nothing about it . '' He contemplated the possibility that soon , he might set foot on the soil of his ancestors . It is a land of pristine beaches and majestic mountains , of people and traditions hidden from the world under Gadhafi 's black curtain . His father , like thousands of educated Libyans , knew his country was doomed when early in his rule , Gadhafi scrapped Libya 's constitution and implemented revolutionary law . `` I think the devils work for him , '' chimed in Youcif 's brother Ahmed , who has been compiling as much information as he can about the uprising and disseminating it on Twitter , YouTube and Facebook . `` It 's hard to explain how ruthless he is , '' Ahmed said . `` It 's frustrating to see what he 's done and for the world to shrug it off . '' Sometimes , he allows himself images in his head of his first meeting with his father . More than anything , he just wants to look at him , feel him . He wonders whether his father will be able to recognize his little boy . But the images from Libya on television quickly remind him of Gadhafi 's police state . And Ahmed returns to reality . `` What if he did pass ? '' What if , after all this time , the family is shattered all over again ?

By Paul Cruickshank , CNN Terrorism Analyst A border guard in an empty customs hall on the Libya-Egyptian border . Fears are easing that al Qaeda will fill the void in Libya . Cruickshank : Militant Islamists have played almost no role in the uprisings in the Arab world Cruickshank : For most Arabs , al Qaeda appears more irrelevant than ever But spiraling violence in Libya may provide future opportunities for militants -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libya 's beleaguered leader Moammar Gadhafi Thursday blamed the uprising sweeping Libya on Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda , accusing the terrorist group of supplying Libyans with pills inducing them to revolt . `` Our children have been manipulated by al Qaeda , '' he told Libyan state television by telephone . Some may view this as Gadhafi 's greatest delusion yet . Militant Islamists have played almost no role in the uprisings in Libya or anywhere else in the Arab world , and for most Arabs , energized by a powerful democracy movement , al Qaeda now appears more irrelevant than ever . But there is nevertheless a danger that spiraling violence in Libya may provide militant Islamist groups future opportunities in the country . Radicalization has run higher in Libya in recent years than many other Arab countries , especially in Libya 's impoverished , restive eastern provinces , whose tribes have long felt discriminated by Tripoli . At the peak of the Iraqi insurgency , more Libyans per capita traveled to join al Qaeda in Iraq than any other country . Anger over the Iraq war contributed to the radicalization of a generation of young Libyans . Some are concerned that the increasingly chaotic scenes in Libya are the beginning of a videotape that has been played before . Moammar Ghadafi talks Osama bin Laden In Iraq , chaotic conditions after the fall of Saddam Hussein gave foreign Islamist terrorists led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi an opportunity to build up operations in the country . The ensuing sectarian civil war , which they helped provoke , radicalized the local population , and provided al Qaeda with greatly expanded recruiting opportunities among Iraq 's Sunni community . More than 100,000 Iraqis died before the insurgency was contained , more than 10,000 of whom were killed by al Qaeda suicide bombers . In Algeria , a 1992 army coup following electoral gains by Islamist parties spawned a violent Islamist insurgency which saw the emergence of the GIA , a hard-line Islamist terrorist group founded by veterans of the Afghan anti-Soviet jihad , which had no qualms about massacring civilians . More than 100,000 Algerians were killed in the crossfire of civil war before the insurgency waned in the mid-1990s . Noman Benotman , a former Libyan jihadist , is under no illusions about the opportunities available to al Qaeda and like-minded groups if there is an extended period of turmoil in Libya . `` If there 's chaos , there will be an opportunity for them . That 's just alphabetic , '' Benotman , now a senior analyst at the Quilliam Foundation , a UK counter-extremist think-tank , told CNN . Benotman returned to London Monday after a two-week visit to Tripoli , and his warning comes at a deeply uncertain time for Libya . A post-dictator era in the North African state was always going to pose more challenges than in neighboring Egypt and Tunisia because of the country 's deeply tribal structures , lack of experience with elections , and only slowly emerging middle class . Such conditions were created and compounded by Gadhafi 's deliberate suppression of civil society , his refusal to develop and empower state institutions , and his strategy of divide and rule between a baffling array of competing power centers , including revolutionary committees across the country that were intentionally created to cement his rule . All this would have made a post-Gadhafi transition difficult at the best of times . But the country is now in deep disarray and , unlike in Egypt and Tunisia , the army may be too weak and divided to step into the breach . Difficulties for jihadists in exploiting the unrest According to Benotman , even during a period of sustained unrest , al Qaeda and like-minded groups will not find it easy to seize the opportunity and build up their operations in Libya . Benotman points out that there is no established jihadist group left on the scene in Libya to exploit the unrest by recruiting , organizing and directing potential recruits . Freedom , political opening , and democracy will reduce the threat of extremists groups in Libya . -- Noman Benotman , former Libyan jihadist In 2009 , Benotman 's former group , the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group -LRB- LIFG -RRB- , formally ended its campaign to overthrow the Libyan regime , and it repudiated al Qaeda . In the mid-1990s the LIFG had conducted a deadly campaign of attacks on Libyan security services , before a crackdown largely constrained the group 's ability to operate inside the country . The breakthrough was the result of a two-year dialogue launched by Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , the son of Libya 's leader , and brokered by Benotman , a former high-ranking figure in the group . The agreement also saw the group publish a new code of ethics for jihad , forbidding attacks on civilians and outlawing attacks in the West . Senior CNN International Correspondent Nic Robertson and I interviewed leading figures of the LIFG in Abu Salim prison in Tripoli in September 2009 , shortly before the group 's leaders were released . Although they were then behind prison bars , their disavowal of violence appeared genuine , and they appear to have stuck to their side of the bargain since . Some have argued that with the LIFG sidelined , the best-placed group to take advantage of deteriorating conditions in Libya is al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -LRB- AQIM -RRB- , a largely Algerian terrorist group that grew out of the GIA . In an indication that it seeks to exploit the situation in Libya , AQIM Thursday released a statement in support of the uprising in Libya , stating that it will do whatever it could to help . AQIM may have some opportunities in the medium term to establish itself in Libya . In an interview with CNN 's Robertson in September 2009 , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi said a number of Libyans had joined AQIM 's ranks in Algeria and Mali and that the group would `` love to energize young Libyans . '' In the near term , however , AQIM is neither well-placed to join in the uprising nor to exploit it . The group , now largely based in the Sahel region of Mauritania , Mali and Niger , has very little presence in Libya because of the previously tight grip of Libya 's security services , and has been largely driven out of neighboring Algeria . Furthermore , according to Benotman , there has been lingering animosity between the Algerian terrorist group and Libyan jihadists ever since the GIA killed a number of LIFG members in Algeria in the mid-1990s , after the Libyans took issue with the GIA 's super-extremist ideology . According to Benotman , the LIFG 's new code of jihadist ethics , widely made available across Libya , will make some young Libyans think twice about joining terrorist groups . Al Qaeda has had no role in this uprising , none of the demonstrators are calling for an Islamic state . -- Noman Benotman , former Libyan jihadist The reduced relevance of al Qaeda Another factor that will make it difficult for Islamist terrorist groups to exploit the situation in Libya is the reduced relevance of al Qaeda 's message as a pro-democracy movement sweeps across the Middle East . `` Al Qaeda has had no role in this uprising , none of the demonstrators are calling for an Islamic state , '' Benotman told CNN . Even senior al Qaeda figures now concede this . The revolutions sweeping the Arab world were not the `` perfections for which we hoped , '' purportedly wrote Attiya Allah , a leading Libyan al Qaeda ideologue believed to be based in Pakistan . Some reports had indicated that Allah died last year . The statement posted on the internet Wednesday , and translated by the SITE Institute , was authored on February 16 as protests started gathering force in Libya . Expressing rather limited ambition , Allah said he hoped that a post-dictator era would give al Qaeda greater freedom to proselytize in the Middle East . Al Qaeda currently has no `` magic wand '' to provide the necessary manpower to overturn governments in the Middle East , added Allah . Libyan officials have painted a different picture , but their claims have been difficult to verify . Officials , for example , alleged Sunday that a group called the Islamic Emirate of Barqa carried out deadly attacks on military installations in and around Darnah , a town on the Mediterranean coast in eastern Libya , with a population of around 80,000 . CNN has not been able to verify the claim The town may emerge as something of a litmus test for the reach of al Qaeda 's influence in Libya . If militant extremist groups gains traction anywhere in Libya , they will likely do so first in places like Darnah , where years of neglect by the Gadhafi regime have created some of the bleakest socioeconomic prospects for young men in the Middle East , as well as simmering anger toward Tripoli . By most accounts , radicalization has run high in the town in recent years . According to al Qaeda administrative records seized by the U.S. Army in Sinjar , Iraq , in 2007 , 52 men from that town -- more than any other city in the Arab world -- traveled to join al Qaeda 's Iraqi affiliate . Benotman says extremists may now be losing ground in Darnah . He points out that Islamist demands have been absent from television images of the townsmen chanting in celebration of what they believe to be the end of Gadhafi rule . If prospects improve in places like Darnah , young men will likely be less attracted to groups like al Qaeda , its blame-all-on-America narrative , and its promise of jihadist adventure , glory , and rewards in the afterlife . For young Libyans the sense of excitement of being part of a historic democracy movement sweeping the Middle East may also make the lure of al Qaeda fade . These events are creating a powerful narrative and promise of their own . `` Freedom , political opening , and democracy will reduce the threat of extremists groups in Libya , '' Benotman told CNN . In the battle to shape the future of Libya , much will depend on what happens in the next days and weeks . Thus far , eastern Libya -- the most promising recruiting ground for Islamist terrorist groups -- has largely been spared the brutal crackdown taking place in an around Tripoli . If forces loyal to Gadhafi were able to retake control of eastern Libya , all bets would be off . The bloodletting would undoubtedly play into the hands of al Qaeda and like-minded groups . Benotman says Libya 's best hope for avoiding a dangerous slide into chaos may now lie with the Free Officers , the group of young army officers who overthrew Libya 's monarchy and brought Gadhafi to power in 1969 . Benotman says many of the Free Officers still have high-ranking positions in the country 's military , and increasing numbers of them have defected from the regime , disturbed by Gadhafi 's brutal crackdown on civilians . `` This is a group drawn from all the tribes and regions of Libya , and they would be seen as representing the whole nation , '' Benotman told CNN .

The embassy is not closed . Relations are not broken , '' Under Secretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy told reporters . State Department Deputy Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs Janet Sanderson reiterated at the same briefing that Libya 's Embassy in Washington is still `` up and running , '' and the department has not been informed of any change in the status of Libya 's ambassador to the United States . Americans escape danger in Libya `` We still continue to reach out to the Libyans where appropriate , both directly and through third parties , '' Sanderson said . Kennedy said all American official employees were withdrawn from the embassy Friday , and only Libyan employees are `` still on the payroll ' and still working there . These remaining employees are not authorized to conduct any U.S. government business , he said . Local and national security guards remain at the embassy , Kennedy said , but he would not discuss what measures if any are being taken to secure documents and the like inside the embassy . `` But I can assure you that there is nothing left behind that could be compromised , '' he said . American operations at the embassy will resume when the security situation permits it , Kennedy said . In addition to pushing both unilateral and multilateral sanctions , Washington will use the `` full extent '' of its intelligence capabilities to monitor Gadhafi 's regime and gather evidence of atrocities committed against the Libyan people , White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said . Steps were also taken to ensure that top Gadhafi officials do n't steal Libyan financial assets in what may be their final days in power . The Treasury Department advised banks to monitor accounts held by the regime 's key political figures and to report financial transactions `` that could potentially represent misappropriated or diverted state assets , '' according to a government statement . Gadhafi 's `` legitimacy has been reduced to zero in the eyes '' of the Libyan people , Carney told reporters . `` The status quo is neither tenable nor acceptable . '' The point of U.S. action -- particularly the sanctions -- is to `` make it clear that the regime has to stop its abuses '' and end the bloodshed , Carney said . Reports from Libya suggest that possibly hundreds of protesters have been killed . Washington also announced the suspension of all military cooperation with Libya , reversing a course of action taken after Gadhafi 's government ended its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction . Obama will meet with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in Washington on Monday to discuss the full range of diplomatic , legal and other steps that may be taken to bring a halt to the violence , Carney said . The new steps against Gadhafi 's government were announced less than an hour after a flight chartered by the U.S. government departed Tripoli for Istanbul . The flight carried personnel from the U.S. embassy and other American citizens . Earlier , a ferry chartered by U.S. authorities carried roughly 300 people to Malta . As U.S. citizens continued to flee the spreading unrest , clashes between Libyan security forces and protesters were reported in Tripoli , which has been a Gadhafi stronghold . Eastern Libya appeared to be largely in the hands of anti-government forces . Obama spoke Thursday with the leaders of France , Italy and the United Kingdom on coordinating an international response to the crisis in the north African nation . In separate phone conversations with French President Nicolas Sarkozy , Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and British Prime Minister David Cameron , Obama `` expressed his deep concern with the Libyan government 's use of violence which violates international norms and every standard of human decency , and discussed appropriate and effective ways for the international community to immediately respond , '' a White House statement noted . While some critics say the Obama administration has been slow to react to the deteriorating situation in Libya , the statement said Thursday 's discussions were to `` coordinate our urgent efforts to respond to developments and ensure that there is appropriate accountability . '' On Friday , Obama discussed the Libyan crisis with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan . Earlier in the week , Obama strongly condemned the use of violence against protesters in Libya and said a unified international response was forming . `` The suffering and bloodshed is outrageous , and it is unacceptable , '' he said . `` This violence must stop .

Born in Woodland , California , to Libyan parents , she graduated from The University of Arizona with degrees in journalism and Near Eastern studies . Aboard the U.S. evacuation ship -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I 've been in Tripoli for nearly three months ; the past three days have felt about that long . We have been stuck on a boat bound for Malta that could n't leave port because of heavy winds and waves as high as 9 meters . As the boat sat in Tripoli Harbor , not far from the Green Square , which just a few days ago was packed with pro-Moammar Gadhafi protesters attempting to drown out the escalating opposition to the regime , images from movies continuously crossed my mind : That scene in `` Titanic '' where everyone scrambles to get off the boat , `` Speed 2 '' and an imagined James Bond flick to be set in Libya . That third movie is not even in pre-production , though I call dibs to star as the Bond girl . As for Bond , well , he must be tripping on Gadhafi 's speech , because he has yet to show up . I have a feeling Libya 's revolution will go on without him , though I did n't hear it from Jamahiriya TV . Aboard this ship , many of us continued to follow the People 's Movement , huddling around one computer we took turns sharing , as someone read Twitter feeds and news headlines aloud rather quickly before the internet cut off again . Libyan-Americans are the most concerned . We keep asking each other if we 've heard any news from friends or family around Tripoli , and where the latest violence took place . My family -- including my mom , two of my sisters and my brother -- are on this ferry with 300 other people . Before boarding we were cooped up in our house , glued to several news stations -LRB- except Al-Jazeera Arabic which we could n't get -RRB- and wondering if the gunshots we heard overhead would hit us . Even then we had no intention of leaving Tripoli . We wanted to witness history , and it felt wrong -- especially for my mom -- to leave the rest of our family and other Libyans behind . We changed our mind after Gadhafi addressed the country and alarmed the world in his speech on Monday . We felt his threats in our bones , and it hit us : This man will massacre and burn the entire city . We felt his threats in our bones , and it hit us : This man will massacre and burn the entire city . On Tuesday at 5 a.m. my brother was watching CNN , which reported a U.S. Embassy boat would be in Tripoli in a few hours to evacuate American citizens . We barely had enough time to pack and make it over to the harbor , only to wait around until 6 p.m. to actually board the boat . That 's when we were told it would n't leave because of severe winds . Three days on a small boat in the heart of town during a war is not an ideal place to be . `` We feel like sitting ducks , '' one passenger said , yet we also feel safer knowing we are protected by U.S. personnel . We 've been living off of cold sandwiches , chocolate and potato chips , -LRB- the food available on deck -RRB- and trying to think of options other than just sitting there to pass the time . Most people sleep very little , scrunched up in their chairs or lying on the floor , covering themselves with sweaters or sharing blankets . We 've all gotten to know each other . Libyan-Americans are especially eager to exchange stories about what they 've seen and heard . Tareq , from Houston , says he joined the protesters in Gergarish on Sunday and Monday night , the first and second day of the uprising . He saw young men burn Gadhafi 's picture and throw rocks and shoes at billboards displaying the number 41 , the number of years he has been in power . `` They were throwing rocks at it so hard it sounded like guns , '' he said . `` When the police showed up , they fired at us . I 'd never heard an automatic rifle up close before . It 's really intimidating . '' Some of Gadhafi 's thugs posed as anti-government protesters and told men on the street to join them , he said . A protester I interviewed earlier confirmed that , saying they were spreading rumors that Gadhafi had left the country . A Libyan man from Dubai said he could n't reach his hotel that same night because it was blockaded by military closing in on around 100 anti-regime protesters who set trash cans and photos of Gadhafi on fire . He heard machine-gun fire and saw three government land cruisers drive by . Two of the three cars were filled with African mercenaries , and the third seemed to be Eastern Europeans , he said . All the men carried AK-47s , he said . Saleh , a Libyan-American working in Tripoli , took part in the protests at the Green Square . He was attacked by Gadhafi 's militia and fled the scene . `` I ended up having to hide out in an alleyway all night because I could hear them searching for us , '' he said . On the first night the protesters in the Green Square thought they were victorious because they had driven out some of Gadhafi 's thugs . Then the military showed up and started attacking protesters , who fled to different areas . Saleh and Tareq both confirm reports that help from Benghazi is on the way . `` We are united . There is a plan , and the people of Libya are not giving up . '' An American from Wisconsin overhears our conversation and expresses his support for the protesters , saying Gadhafi 's end is `` imminent .

Security Council voted unanimously Saturday night to punish Moammar Gadhafi 's government in Libya for violence against unarmed civilians , hours after the nation 's budding opposition picked a former top official as its interim leader . The draft resolution includes an arms embargo , asset freeze and travel bans for Gadhafi and several of his family members and associates . It also refers the situation unfolding in Libya to the International Criminal Court . `` This resolution will be a signal -LRB- to -RRB- put an end to the fascist regime that is still in existence , '' said Abdurrahman Mohamed Shalgham , Libyan ambassador to the United Nations , who urged action Friday in an emotional appeal . He 'd earlier renounced support for Gadhafi , calling him Saturday `` a leader who loves nobody but himself . '' Military and security forces loyal to Gadhafi have killed more than 1,000 people , U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon has estimated . Meanwhile , Libya 's deputy amassador to the world body , Ibrahim Dabbashi , indicated Saturday that he and fellow diplomats `` support ... in principle '' a caretaker administration to lead Libya under the direction of former Justice Minister Mustafa Abdul Jalil . Embassy head : ` We were lucky to get out ' State Dept. ` concerned ' for Libyans City councils in areas no longer loyal to Gadhafi chose Jalil to head an interim government that would represent all of Libya and ultimately be based in Tripoli , according to Amal Bogagies , a member of the coalition of the February 17 Uprising , and a separate Libyan opposition source . Both are based in Benghazi . Jalil was in Gadhafi 's government through February 21 , when he quit to protest the `` bloody situation '' and `` use of excessive force '' against unarmed protesters , according to Libyan newspaper Quryna . Days later , he told a Swedish newspaper he had evidence that Gadhafi ordered the 1988 bombing of a jet over Lockerbie , Scotland , that killed 270 people . Protests began February 15 in the eastern city of Benghazi , Libya 's second largest . It and many others are now thought to be under opposition control , according to eyewitnesses . There have been numerous reports of widespread violence , some of it perpetrated by foreign mercenaries and military and security forces loyal to Gadhafi . Libya 's foreign minister said earlier Saturday that talks are underway between Gadhafi 's government and figures in the eastern part of the North African nation . Benghazi-based opposition spokesman Jalal Igallal , however , strongly knocked down reports of any discussions between anti-government figures and officials supportive of Gadhafi . He urged Foreign Minister Musa Kasa to say who is being talked to , if such negotiations are in fact ongoing . Early Sunday , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi -- one of Moammar ' Gadhafi 's sons and a prominent member of his government -- told CNN 's Nic Robertson that he was confident the regime could survive the unrest and ultimately reunite Libya . Saif Gadhafi added that he wanted this reunification to be accomplished without violence . While CNN does have staff in some cities , the network could not independently confirm reports for many areas in Libya . But CNN has compiled information through telephone interviews with witnesses . Tripoli itself was noticeably tense but largely quiet overnight Saturday , its streets largely barren except for police , armed men in civilian clothing and young people with sticks at some intersections . One man , who is not named for safety reasons , described an `` eerie feeling '' around the capital , even as fear of violence drove many people to hunker down in their homes . `` You can feel the tension and the anticipation that something big is going to happen , '' he said . `` Everyone is waiting for it . '' The situation at the main airport , about 20 miles south of Tripoli , was far more chaotic . Several thousand people camped outside in makeshift tents , waiting for the chance to leave the war-torn country . More than 200 Arab organizations and a group of 30 prominent intellectuals from across the Middle East and North Africa urged global bodies , including the Security Council , the European Union and the African Union , to take action to limit further death and destruction . A protester 's view from Libya Libyan : U.S. ` does n't give a damn ' `` We fear we may be witnessing the calm before the storm , '' said their statement . `` The window of opportunity to prevent further atrocities from occurring is closing fast . The people of Libya need you to act quickly and decisively . '' The group urged the international community to devise contingency plans for intervention and impose immediate sanctions on the Libyan regime . `` We appeal to you as leaders who have the power to bring an end to this horror , '' the statement said . `` Your failure to do so would be a lasting stain on the responsibilities of world leadership and on humanity itself . '' U.S. President Barack Obama also weighed in Saturday , telling German Chancellor Angela Merkel to `` coordinate our urgent efforts to respond to developments and ensure appropriate accountability , '' according to a White House statement . In some of his strongest wording to date , Obama said , `` when a leader 's only means of staying in power is to use mass violence against his own people , he has lost the legitimacy to rule and needs to do what is right for his country by leaving now . '' Later , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a statement urging Gadhafi to step down . `` Moammar Gadhafi has lost the confidence of his people and he should go without further bloodshed and violence , '' Clinton said . `` The Libyan people deserve a government that is responsive to their aspirations and that protects their universally recognized human rights . '' Tripoli 's Green Square , occupied by pro-Gadhafi demonstrators on previous evenings , was empty Saturday night , a witness told CNN . She said her neighborhood near the square was eerily quiet . Another man said men carrying automatic weapons had set up checkpoints at `` every major intersection or traffic light , '' while hospitals are heavily guarded by armed security personnel . Other frightened residents said they stayed indoors , though unable to shut off the sound of gunfire or put aside the words of Gadhafi in a public address the day before in which he vowed to keep unleashing force . `` We can destroy any assault with the people 's will , with the armed people , '' he said on state television Friday . `` And when it is necessary , the weapons depots will be open to all the Libyan people to be armed . '' Libya 's prime minister , meanwhile , announced on state television that every family would receive 500 Libyan dinars -LRB- $ 406 -RRB- from the government . The humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders said in a statement Saturday one of its teams was in Benghazi . Their arrival , and a promise of future aid , marked one of the first humanitarian inroads into Libya in recent weeks . Three main hospitals were all `` well equipped and have managed to deal with the numbers of wounded people and medical needs , '' according to the group . But the facilities also face shortages of drugs , bandages and other medical items , which Doctors Without Borders said it will provide . The group plans to send an orthopedic surgeon , anesthesiologist and nurse on Monday . The advocacy group Human Rights Watch said the situation was appreciably worse in Zawiya -- about 55 kilometers -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli and the epicenter of violent protests Thursday . `` West of Tripoli in Zawiya city , government security forces firing on demonstrators are causing bloodshed and chaos , '' said Sarah Leah Whitson , the group 's Middle East and North Africa director . Operations at several embassies -- including those of Great Britain and the United States -- in Tripoli have been effectively shuttered , for the safety of their personnel . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he planned to speak with Obama in Washington on Monday . For now , Libyans themselves are left to wait to see what happens next . `` We wait and see what tomorrow will bring , '' a Tripoli man said early Sunday . `` We pray for a quick ending to this nightmare , with minimum bloodshed . No one is naive , however , to believe that Gadhafi is going to go easily . '' CNN 's Nic Robertson , Ben Wedeman , Jack Maddox and Whitney Hurst contributed to this report .

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told reporters unequivocally : `` The violence must stop . '' His remarks came as state television was airing images of the embattled but defiant strongman urging viewers to defend the nation . A man CNN will identify only as Reda to protect his identity said in a telephone interview that armed men dressed in plainclothes fatally shot his two brothers Friday as they were demonstrating against the government . Also killed were his two neighbors , he said . `` The bodies have been kidnapped from the street , '' Reda said . `` My other neighbors told me they kidnapped the injured people in the hospital to somewhere , nobody knows -LRB- where -RRB- . This is the perfect crime . He 's hiding all evidence for every crime he has . This is the horrible situation that nobody knows . '' State Dept. ` concerned ' for Libyans More than 1,000 people have been killed , according to estimates cited Friday by Ban . He noted that the eastern part of the country `` is reported to be under the control of opposition elements , who have taken over arms and ammunition from weapon depots . '' At least three cities near Tripoli have been the site of daily clashes , and the streets of the capital are largely deserted because people are afraid of being shot by government forces or militias , he said . Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's supporters `` are reportedly conducting house-by-house searches and arrests . According to some reports , they have even gone into hospitals to kill wounded opponents , '' Ban said . Accounts from the news media and human rights groups and witnesses `` raise grave concerns about the nature and scale of the conflict , '' he said . He said they include reports of indiscriminate killings , shooting of peaceful demonstrators , torture of the opposition and use of foreign mercenaries . The victims have included women and children and `` indiscriminate attacks on foreigners believed to be mercenaries , '' he said , referring to reports . Ban called on the international community `` to do everything possible '' to protect civilians at demonstrable risk . Ban said there appeared to be a growing crisis of refugees , with some 22,000 people having fled to Tunisia and a reported 15,000 to Egypt in the past few days . For many , the trip has been a harrowing one . `` There are widespread reports of refugees being harassed and threatened with guns and knives , '' Ban said . `` The violence must stop , '' he said . `` Those responsible for so brutally shedding the blood of innocents must be punished . Fundamental human rights must be respected . '' Ban said he will travel Monday to Washington to speak with U.S. President Barack Obama . Report : Libyan protesters fired upon Also at the United Nations , Libyan Ambassador Abdurrahman Mohamed Shalgham told reporters that he hoped Gadhafi and his sons would end the rampage `` against our people '' within hours . Asked why he had continued to support Gadhafi until just a few days ago , the diplomat said , `` I could n't imagine in the beginning that it was going to be -LRB- this bad -RRB- . '' But he now supports the protesters . `` It 's not a crime to say , ' I want to be free , ' '' he said . The Libyan ambassador to the United States , Ali Suleiman Aujali , told CNN that he too has joined the opposition . `` When I see the mercenaries killing our peoples , and we see our women screaming in the street , and I see there is no distinguishing between who they are target , I ca n't take this , '' said the diplomat , who served the Libyan government 's foreign service for more than 40 years . He said his fellow diplomats and many of the country 's police had also turned against Gadhafi in his quest to retain control of Libya . `` The problem now is western part , '' he said , speaking in Washington . `` Unfortunately , they 've been confronted with mercenaries . '' Asked whether he would want to see his former boss dead , he said , `` I want him to be out of my country . I want him to be out of the Libyan life . '' As he spoke , reports emerged of sniper and artillery fire in Tripoli , said Mohammed Ali Abdallah of the National Front for the Salvation of Libya , which opposes Gadhafi 's regime . He based his account on reports that he said he received from witnesses . Another witness told CNN that protesters in western Tripoli were met by plainclothes security forces who fired guns at them and later tear gas to disperse the crowds . Prior to the clashes on Friday morning , security forces had removed barricades , disposed of bodies and painted over graffiti in Tripoli , witnesses said . On state television , Gadhafi -- wearing a fur trooper 's hat and addressing a crowd of supporters -- threatened to escalate the violence . `` We can destroy any assault with the people 's will , with the armed people , '' he said . `` And when it is necessary , the weapons depots will be open to all the Libyan people to be armed . '' At that time , he continued , `` Libya will become a red fire , Libya will become an ember . '' He vowed to overcome what he described as external forces attempting to take down his nation . `` We will defeat any foreign attempt like we defeated them before , like we did with the Italian colonization , like we did with American airstrikes . '' But he presented a carrot with his stick , offering to increase state salaries by 150 % and to give $ 400 to each family . Earlier , Gadhafi 's son said his father has no intention of stepping down . Asked if Gadhafi has a `` Plan B '' to leave Libya , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi told CNN Turk : `` We have Plan A , Plan B , Plan C. Plan A is to live and die in Libya . Plan B is to live and die in Libya . Plan C is to live and die in Libya . '' He said he hoped Libya would emerge from the crisis united . `` I am sure Libya will have a better future , '' he said . `` However , such a strong state as we are , we will never allow our people to be controlled by a handful of terrorists . This will never happen . '' But global leaders were meeting Friday to talk about what kind of pressure can be brought on Gadhafi to surrender control and limit the humanitarian consequences . White House press secretary Jay Carney said Washington was suspending embassy operations in Tripoli and pursuing sanctions . `` It has been shuttered , '' he told reporters about the embassy . But State Department officials said they still have channels through which they can still communicate with the Libyan government . Libyan employees were remaining at the embassy , said Under Secretary ofState for Management Patrick Kennedy . `` The flag is still flying . The embassy is not closed . Operations are suspended , '' he said . `` Relations are not broken . '' The charge d'affaires at the embassy , Joan Polaschik , expressed relief that she and other Americans had left . `` It 's a very dangerous and fluid situation , '' she told CNN in a telephone interview from Istanbul , Turkey . But she praised the Libyan forces who were charged with providing security for the embassy . `` They stayed with me till the bitter end , '' she said . The United Nations Security Council discussed a proposed draft resolution that would impose new sanctions on Libya . They include an arms embargo , asset freeze and a travel ban . The draft also refers Libya to the International Criminal Court . An Obama administration official involved in deliberations regarding sanctions told CNN that the Libyan government has said it has as much as $ 130 billion in reserves and another $ 70 billion in foreign assets held abroad . The legally binding resolution is backed by the possible threat of force but approval of such measures could be stalled by Russia and China , both unlikely to support military intervention . A vote on the resolution could occur Saturday . CNN crew greeted as ` liberating heroes ' NATO Secretary-General Anders Rasmussen said the alliance has assets that can be used in this crisis and that it could `` act as an enabler and coordinator , if and when , individual member states want to take action . '' Meanwhile , foreign nationals faced a `` massive challenge , '' Rasmussen said , as they braved rough seas to escape the violence in the north African nation . A British ship left Benghazi -- the nation 's second-largest city -- with 207 people on board . A ferry carrying 338 people -- 183 of them Americans -- departed Tripoli Friday and arrived in Malta at night . `` I feel for the people who are still there and did n't get a chance to get out , because it 's chaos , '' said Yusra Tekbalim , one of the passengers . She said she had remained hunkered down in her house for four days , during which she heard what sounded like machine-gun fire . `` I think that the Libyans know what this regime is capable of , but I think for the first time the world is actually seeing it , '' she said . Another ferry arrived in Malta from Tripoli carrying more than 300 people , including 200 employees of Schlumberger , the oil and gas technology , and their families , a company spokeswoman said . Libya 's uprising , after four decades of Gadhafi 's iron rule , took root first in the nation 's eastern province . Benghazi and other smaller eastern towns are no longer within Gadhafi 's control . But closer to Tripoli , where the dictator maintains some support , protesters were still being met with brute force . The city of Zawiya -- about 55 kilometers -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- west of Tripoli -- was the epicenter of violent protests Thursday . Doctors at a field hospital said early Friday that 17 people were killed and 150 more wounded when government forces attacked . CNN could not confirm reports for many areas in Libya . The Libyan government maintains tight control of communications and has not responded to repeated requests for access to the country . CNN has interviewed numerous witnesses by phone . Anti-government forces said they had gained control of Zawiya as Gadhafi accused followers of Osama bin Laden of adding hallucinogenic drugs to residents ' drinks to spark the unrest . `` They put it with milk or with other drinks , spiked drinks , '' he said Thursday in a telephone call to state television . The international fallout , like the protests , has also spread . Switzerland ordered Gadhafi 's assets frozen , the foreign ministry said .

'' There was concern that the language could be interpreted as including military intervention . That section of the resolution was softened in the approved version to call on member states to work together to `` facilitate and support '' the return of humanitarian agencies .

He vowed not to leave Libya , she reported , and denied having used force against his people . `` He seemed to be in complete denial about the protests against him , and that other big cities in Libya , particularly those in the east , had been taken by his opponents , '' she said . `` He simply rejected the notion that any walls were closing in on him . He denied he was besieged in the capital and said he would survive the current situation .

In a joint interview with ABC News ' Christiane Amanpour and the BBC , Gadhafi also denied using force against his people , Amanpour reported .

Government forces have repeatedly clashed with demonstrators over the past two weeks in Libya , fired on crowds and at times shot indiscriminately at people in the streets , numerous witnesses have told CNN . The death toll has topped 1,000 , according to an estimate from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon . UN imposes sanctions on Libya Clinton outraged at Libya , Iran Gadhafi control wanes outside Tripoli Soon after Gadhafi 's interview , U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said the Libyan strongman sounded `` delusional . '' `` And when he can laugh in talking to American and international journalists while he is slaughtering his own people , it only underscores how unfit he is to lead and how disconnected he is from reality , '' she said . Gadhafi 's regime has lost control of parts of the country to rebel forces , and with each passing day more Libyan officials around the world have defected , joining calls for his ouster . The use of the term `` rebel '' to describe the anti-government forces is apt , said Kurt Volker , former U.S. ambassador to NATO and now a senior fellow at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Forces . `` In Egypt , you did n't have a force that was developed ; you had protesters who were demonstrating against the government and the government relented , '' he told CNN in a telephone interview . `` Here , you actually have a government that retains force at its disposal and you have demonstrators joined by elements of the military that have forces at their disposal . So it really has become an armed rebellion . '' Even as Gadhafi sought to project confidence Monday , reports came in that a military jet bombed a military base in an area controlled by rebel forces . The base is near Ajdabiya , 90 miles south of Benghazi , a stronghold of government opponents . Some bases in the area have fallen into the hands of protesters as more members of the military have abandoned Gadhafi 's regime and joined demonstrations . Several soldiers told CNN they switched their allegiance after refusing to use weapons against peaceful demonstrators . CNN saw the military jet fly overhead and heard the sounds of explosions . Witnesses reported a bombing at the base . But Libyan state television later denied any such bombing had occurred . The Temporary General Committee for Defense said reports that the Libyan air force conducted strikes on the ammunition depots in the cities of Ajdabiya and Rajima were false , state TV reported . While CNN has staff in some cities , the network can not independently confirm reports for many areas in Libya . CNN has gathered information through telephone interviews with witnesses . Pro-Gadhafi forces also tried to attack a radio station in Misrata , a city controlled by protesters , a witness said . A military chopper with soldiers on board has tried to land a couple of times over the past three days , but the opposition fired at the soldiers and kept them away , the witness said . The international community , meanwhile , launched new efforts Monday to pressure Gadhafi to halt the violence . Senators take tough stance on Libya Gadhafi 's history of tension with the West `` He has lost his legitimacy when he declared war on his people , '' Secretary-General Ban said about embattled Libyan leader , urging him to heed the call of his people . Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan said the United States is `` repositioning '' naval and air forces in the region to be prepared for any option that it may need to exercise . He would not comment on whether any ground forces are being put on alert or having leaves canceled because of Libya . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said at a meeting in Geneva , Switzerland , of the U.N. Human Rights Council that the United States is exploring `` all possible options , '' and that `` nothing is off the table so long as the Libyan government continues to threaten and kill Libyan citizens . '' `` Colonel Gadhafi and those around him must be held accountable for these acts , which violate international legal obligations and common decency . Through their actions , they have lost the legitimacy to govern . And the people of Libya have made themselves clear : It is time for Gadhafi to go , now , without further violence or delay , '' she said . Asked at a news conference whether the U.S. planned an imminent military response , Clinton said , `` No. '' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday that `` exile is certainly one option '' for Gadhafi . Carney also said the U.S. government is considering the possibility of imposing a no-fly zone over Libya . Also Monday , the United States became the latest country to announce it had frozen Gadhafi-related assets . The U.S. government froze at least $ 30 billion in Libyan government assets under U.S jurisdiction after enacting sanctions on Friday , a Treasury official said . It marked the largest amount ever blocked under a sanctions program , according to Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David Cohen . In Tripoli , protesters stayed off the streets , telling CNN they feared violence . Government officials spread word that thousands of people could die if the popular uprising continues . On the 14th day of protests , there appeared to be a stalemate . Some in Tripoli told CNN they feared their protest movement was losing momentum . But around the world , support for the protests was growing . Yet another prominent Libyan official , the country 's ambassador to South Africa , added his voice to the calls for Gadhafi to end his nearly 42-year grip on power . Gadhafi `` should take the ultimate decision to step down in the interest of Libya , '' Abdullah Alzubedi told reporters in Pretoria . The European Union 's high representative for foreign affairs , Catherine Ashton , said the U.N. Human Rights Council `` has a grave responsibility to ensure that our often-stated intentions are translated into real actions and real progress . '' Speaking at the meeting in Geneva , Ashton said , `` What matters in the end is not the number of resolutions passed but results in the real world . '' In an interview with CNN , Ashton said stopping the violence means trying `` to persuade the people concerned that they will be held to account , that there will be the International Criminal Court , that we will stop their assets being moved , that we will hold them to account for their actions . That 's what we do as an international community . That 's what we have to make clear . And there 's no doubt in my mind that actually they do listen to what 's being said . '' The U.N. Security Council over the weekend voted for tough restrictions and possible war crimes charges against the Libyan regime . The Security Council measures -- which include an arms embargo , an asset freeze and travel bans for Gadhafi and members of his family and associates -- also referred the situation unfolding in Libya to the International Criminal Court . On Sunday , Gadhafi criticized the Security Council resolution , telling private Serbian station Pink TV by phone that council members `` took a decision based on media reports that are based abroad . '' He added , `` If the Security Council wants to know about something , they should have sent a fact-finding committee . '' The protests , which began February 15 , have been fueled largely by people demanding freedom and decrying high unemployment . As the 68-year-old Gadhafi has appeared increasingly cornered , some Libyan officials have begun to discuss openly what a post-Gadhafi Libyan government would look like . Over the weekend , Libya 's deputy ambassador to the United Nations , Ibrahim Dabbashi , indicated he and fellow diplomats support `` in principle '' a caretaker administration under the direction of former Justice Minister Mustafa Abdul Jalil . Jalil quit February 21 to protest the `` bloody situation '' and `` use of excessive force '' against unarmed protesters , according to Libyan newspaper Quryna . Dabbashi told CNN Monday that Gadhafi has asked for a change in Libya 's U.N. representation , though the diplomat vowed to stay on to represent the people . About 100,000 people have fled Libya to Tunisia or Egypt in roughly the past week , the U.N. high commissioner for refugees said Sunday , citing reports from the Tunisian and Egyptian governments . The evacuees include Tunisians , Egyptians , Libyans and many from Asian countries . Tunisia and Egypt are the two countries that have seen their leaders overthrown in the wave of protests that has swept through the Arab world over the past several weeks . Tunisians on the border with Libya waved pre-Gadhafi-era Libyan flags in support of the opposition . The Tunisian army , charities and ordinary Tunisians were trying to help Libyans on the border . Refugees said Tunisians were offering them food , water and the use of phones .

Joe Lieberman , I-Connecticut , to arm rebels in Libya fighting Moammar Gadhafi . They had mixed thoughts on whether the United States should be involved in imposing a no-fly zone in that country to protect protestors from attacks by Libyan war planes . I would not suggest either of those courses for the moment , said Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana , the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee who indicated U.S. involvement could lead to war . Depending upon the method of delivery and what we decide to do we could decide to have a war in Libya to join the war in Afghanistan and Iraq . Sen. Susan Collins , R-Maine , a member of the Armed Services Committee , said she would be leery of providing arms at this point but said she supports a no-fly zone . I do believe our allies may be able to join together with us to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya to help protect the people from Gadhafi , she said . Any actions that we take I believe should be in concert with our allies . Sen. Lindsay Graham , R-South Carolina , who is also on the Armed Services Committee , credited the diplomatic efforts underway by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and suggested the U.S. work with the United Nations to stiffen and enforce sanctions against Libya . Providing arms , I m not sure that helps us , Graham said . I don t know if you could control right now who would get the arms . What I would suggest is that we really keep implementing U.N. sanctions on the economic side , on the travel side , go after assets , Graham added . And a no fly zone would make a lot of sense to me . The three senators spoke in a Capitol hallway after a vote on the Senate floor . Earlier Monday , Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said he would withhold judgment on the idea from Lieberman , who made his comments Sunday on CNN s State of the Union . McConnell said he has asked Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona , the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee , to brief Senate Republicans at their weekly policy lunch in the Capitol Tuesday about his trip to Egypt over the weekend . Lieberman traveled to Egypt with McCain , and they appeared together on CNN Sunday . McCain supported the idea of a no-fly zone but did not say if he supports providing arms to Libyans fighting Gadhafi . A no fly zone is a UN scenario ! February 28 , 2011 09:57 pm at 9:57 pm | Liebermans take on anything in the middle east is an opinion that no one should listen to , and Bomb Bomb McCain lost all judgement and respect the day he brought the Palin Plague to the forefront . Lieberman works for another country and can not be trusted and starting another war is just another way Republicans think they can get out of creating jobs like they promised to get back in the house . February 28 , 2011 10:11 pm at 10:11 pm | What is it with Mccain and Lieberman ? We cant even afford these other two wars we are fighting , and they are ready to get neck deep in Libya ? These guys just dont get it . February 28 , 2011 10:11 pm at 10:11 pm | GOP = Greed Over People P.S. Props to CNN for the heads up on the Sojourner 's WWJC bracelet . Mine is in the mail . I hope and suggest other Christians avail themselves of the bracelets to counter the `` christian '' cons and their heresy . 787 billion tax cut for the rich and cut 61 billion from WIC and other help for the least among us ? Buy and wear a bracelet that says What Would Jesus Cut ? February 28 , 2011 10:14 pm at 10:14 pm | Why are Republicans so flakey ? Makeup your mind already . You criticize the late response by Obama and wished he had done something sooner and now You have a problem with siding with the rebels ? February 28 , 2011 10:17 pm at 10:17 pm | Apparently , the opposition has not agreed to give U.S. companies first rights on the oil . If it had , Congress would declared war by now , and U.S. troops would be ready to land . Unfortunately , we 've been there , done that with Iraq already , but do n't put it past these oligarphic puppets to do it all over again . February 28 , 2011 10:39 pm at 10:39 pm | Although the Republicans do n't know what to do , they do agree that whatever Obama is doing is bad for America and too slow and indecisive . February 28 , 2011 10:44 pm at 10:44 pm | Please let us send Obama to Libya with a one way ticket so he can harm that nation and stop pushing the US towards a second c i v i l war . February 28 , 2011 10:53 pm at 10:53 pm | I agree that we should not be arming these groups in Libya . Once their current leadership is out and new government can be looked at , then we can decide if we are to sell them weapons . February 28 , 2011 11:22 pm at 11:22 pm | February 28 , 2011 11:30 pm at 11:30 pm | At last some common sense prevails . The time has come for America and Americans to realize just like the brits had to that Gunboat diplomacy or in the US case the threat or actual execution of military intervention on whatever pretext in another sovreign nations affairs is very , very rarely justified or brings the result liked by the invader . I must also add I 'm really fed up with the likes of Lieberman and McCain jumping in to criticise the Obama administrations handling of the Libya situation , even no fly zones because the British and German SAS and Airforces respectively were still rescuing thier nations people from outlying areas who worked in the Oil fields . The kind of pre-emptive ideas of the above two and liberman sending arms risked leading to another embassy hostage crisis or other similar catastrophe . Do they also realize that tens of thousands of non Libyans of mutiple nationalities are still trying to get out and cross borders to flee from a civil war . A no fly zone might be realistically imposed thru the UN and NATO . For the US to do it alone is not good policy unless you are among many -LRB- too many -RRB- Republicans who think declaring war solves all diplomatic or revolutionary situations anywhere in the world . Keep US arms and forces out of Libya ! The US has already bankrpted itself fighting unwinable wars in Afghanistan and Iraq we certainly have no need to arm rebels in Libya who could then sell or give the arms to anyone , or start using them against the UN . March 1 , 2011 12:37 am at 12:37 am | McCain is the one making awful decisions and Lieberman with him . McCain is the one who put the curse of Palin on our nation . I seriously question his judgment on anything after choosing Palin . Karl Rove even does nasty impressions of her making fun of her stupidity . Why is it Republicans always want a military solution to everything ? I love Secretary Gates comments to the West Point cadets that any Sec of Defense who suggests military action in southeast Asia or the Mideast to the President should have his head examined . In the case of Rumsfeld , Cheney and Bush - they should be in jail for intentionally starting a fraudulent war in Iraq and breaking international war crimes law on torture . The GOP proposed budget has been criticized by multiple Republican economists as killing up to 1.1 M jobs and destroying our economic recovery and Republicans acknowledge they know that but still want to ram it through . Seems the GOP needs to have their collective heads examined on many issues . They are not credible leaders . March 1 , 2011 02:35 am at 2:35 am | Would n't you know that Lindsey Graham would be involved in appeasement ... ... sounds like shade of Czechoslavakia in the late 1930 `` s and Hungary in the 1950 's . Way to go folks ... ... I would think that we have enough intelligence to know who to funnel assistance to in Libya . To simply support the U.N. is unreal ... this is the most incompetent organization on the face of the Earth next to the U.s. government !! March 1 , 2011 05:33 am at 5:33 am | We will not miss crazy Joe ! If it were up to him , our entire national budget would be spent on war with arab countries . March 1 , 2011 06:52 am at 6:52 am | March 1 , 2011 07:24 am at 7:24 am | Finally , something I can agree on coming from a GOPer !!! That would be a very dumb thing to do . I mean have we not learned that arming revolutionaries sometimes backfires ? March 1 , 2011 07:38 am at 7:38 am | I say we supply arms and training to the rebels ! We did that for the Mujahadeen in Afganistan in the 80s , look how well that turned out ! We need a new Osama bin Laden , and I think someone in Libya is just itching to step up and fill that role . Pretty much `` the enemy of my enemy is my friend '' works for about 10 years , then they become our enemy . No thanks , my tax dollars should go to schools , not another vietnam -LRB- besides our 21st century vietnam , Afganistan -RRB- March 1 , 2011 08:15 am at 8:15 am | Wow -- three GOP leaders that 's NOT following the advice of their leader Sarah Palin , who knows BEST about every issue that concerns the USA !!!!! It 's OBVIOUS we should not provide ARMS and it 's obviously difficult to impose a `` no-fly '' zone -- The guns will end up in the WRONG hands and the same guns and ; or bombs will end up blowing up `` friendly '' aircraft !!!

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon The European Union has imposed new sanctions against the Libyan regime Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States has frozen at least $ 30 billion in Libyan government assets , a U.S. Treasury official announced Monday -- one of a series of steps being taken by international leaders designed to break strongman Moammar Gadhafi 's grip on power . The $ 30 billion is the largest amount ever blocked under any sanctions program , according to David Cohen , the acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence . American officials slapped the sanctions on Libya last Friday , and the U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution on Libya on Saturday . President Barack Obama met Monday with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to discuss a variety of measures under consideration . Ban later told reporters that `` further action may well be necessary . '' UN imposes sanctions on Libya For rebels , a long road to Tripoli Gadhafi `` has lost his legitimacy when he declared war on his people , '' Ban said of the Libyan leader . `` This is again a totally unacceptable situation . I sincerely hope and urge him to listen to the peoples ' call . That 's my message to him . '' All options are still on the table , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said at a meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva , Switzerland . `` Gadhafi and those around him must be held accountable -LRB- for any actions -RRB- which violate international legal obligations and common decency , '' she said . `` Through their actions , they have lost the legitimacy to govern . '' Susan Rice , U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , called Gadhafi `` delusional , '' adding that `` when he -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- can laugh when talking to American and international journalists while he is slaughtering his own people , it only underscores how unfit he is to lead and how disconnected he is from reality . '' The imposition of a no-fly zone over certain portions of the increasingly chaotic country is among the courses of action being contemplated , White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters . Carney indicated that exile is `` certainly one option '' for the Libyan leader . He also said that American officials are `` actively reaching out '' to Libyan opponents of the ruling regime , Carney said . But any speculation on U.S. assistance to the Libyan rebels is premature , Rice said , calling it `` unclear at this point who will emerge as the critical opposition element . We await to see how the opposition will coalesce . '' Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan said the U.S. military is moving Navy ships closer to Libya . Two U.S. Navy warships -- the carrier USS Enterprise and the amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge -- are currently in the Red Sea and available to assist , U.S. military officials told CNN . Lapan refused to indicate whether any American ground forces have been put on a heightened state of alert . British PrimeMinister David Cameron echoed Washington 's call for Gadhafi to step aside . `` We are taking every step possible to isolate the Gadhafi regime , deprive it of money , shrink its power and ensure that anyone responsible for abuses in Libya will be held to account , '' Cameron told members of Britain 's parliament Monday . In Brussels , the European Union banned the sale of arms and ammunition to Libya . It also prohibited any trade with Gadhafi 's government that could lead to the acquisition of equipment that could be used for the repression of Libyans . The EU also froze the assets of Gadhafi and five members of his family , while imposing a visa ban on Gadhafi and 15 other people tied to the regime 's crackdown . `` The massive violence against peaceful demonstrators shocks our conscience , '' EU High Representative Catherine Ashton said . `` It should also spring us into action . '' Over the weekend , Italy suspended a treaty with Libya that includes a non-aggression pact , helping to pave the way for possible military action by U.S. or NATO troops . Italy is home to the U.S. Navy 's Sixth Fleet . Kurt Volker , a former U.S. ambassador to NATO , told CNN that Italy 's suspension of the pact would not immediately suffice for military actions to be launched from that country . The question , from the perspective of the Italian government , is `` if you 're really trying to think about military action , do you have some kind of authorization to do so ? '' he said in an interview . `` You would need a U.N. mandate and possibly a NATO declaration or both , and there is n't anything like that on the table at the moment . '' But , Volker said , others in the international community may soon have to decide whether to intervene militarily . `` At some point we have to face the question of are we willing to help them or not , '' he said . The situation in Libya differs from that of Egypt , where the United States was trying to balance various interests , Volker noted . `` We have no countervailing interests -LRB- here -RRB- . ... -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- has been a terrible dictator . He was a terror plotter . He blew up the plane in Lockerbie . So we have no reason not to be helping the people of Libya get rid of this tyrant . '' Despite the growing international pressure , Gadhafi stood his ground Monday . Protesters fearful of violence stayed off the streets in Tripoli . Government officials warned that thousands of people could die if the popular uprising continues . The death toll from the unrest -- now in its 14th day -- has already topped 1,000 , according to a U.N. estimate . Clinton noted Monday that U.S. humanitarian teams have been dispatched to Libya 's borders at Tunisia and Egypt .

A short distance away , a red flag flew for Tunisia . In between , a mass of humanity waited in no man 's land , desperate to flee escalating rebellion in one nation and cross into another that has already succeeded in toppling a dictator . Periodically , a ripple flowed through the crowd of thousands of refugees as men took turns passing forward dazed and unconscious travelers , overwhelmed by a treacherous journey to the border and exposure to the elements . Tunisian emergency workers rushed with fluorescent orange stretchers to evacuate the sick . Chaos reigned along Libya 's western border Tuesday as Tunisian police attempted to hold back a tide of people , mostly foreign workers caught in the storm of change blowing through the region . Libya evacuees have stories to tell A majority are Egyptians -- more than 1 million Egyptian citizens were working in neighboring Libya . But the fleeing foreigners also include citizens of Bangladesh , Thailand , Vietnam , Ghana , Sudan , Mali and other countries who traveled far from home in search of economic salvation . Now , many of them said they had everything stolen from them on the road to the border and are left with nothing but the clothes on their back . Gadhafi 's militia took my money , '' said Mohammad Ataye , an Egyptian who spent the last year working as a hairdresser in Libya . He was referring to troops still loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi . Ataye said he tried to catch a flight out of Tripoli 's airport to Egypt , but was forced back by thousands of people waiting there . When he and a friend decided to make a run for the Tunisian border , Libyan soldiers robbed him of his savings and his two mobile phones on the way . Now what for the Egyptian refugee ? `` I do n't know . I do n't know , '' he said . Some of those fleeing Libya do not possess passports and other travel documents , which are often confiscated by the companies that employ them until their contracts are fulfilled , said Mathieu Luciano of the International Organization for Migration . Luciano , deployed to the Egyptian border town of Sallum to help shuttle people out , said his agency was working with the embassies of nations involved as well as the companies that hired the migrant workers to return them home safely . The agency is paying for a charter flight from Bangladesh that is scheduled to arrive later Tuesday . The Egyptian government has reported 69,000 people crossing into that nation . One of them is Mohamed Sohel . Sohel , who had been working for a Korean construction company in the eastern Libyan city of Durna for three years , was anxious to board a plane back home to Bangladesh . He said he has been surviving by sharing one piece of flatbread with two other men since arriving at the Egyptian border town of Sallum six days ago . His passport was locked up at the company 's Libyan headquarters in the western town of Misrata . `` We called the Bangladeshi embassy a thousand times , '' Sohel said . `` We never got any advice , or help . '' It 's easier for Egyptian workers to make it back home , Luciano said , but nonetheless , they face a difficult situation . They were the breadwinners , supporting families in rural Egypt . They are returning with no livelihood in a time of uncertainty in their own homeland . Some said they were frustrated with their interim military government for not doing more to help them . `` As we know , Egypt is also under a lot of stress now politically , '' said Hovig Etyemezian , a field officer with the U.N. refugee agency . `` So any country that is able to provide air lift or sea movement should pick up the ball so that more people leave , more Egyptians are able to go back to their country . '' On Libya 's border with Tunisia , the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees staff erected 500 tents . All of them are full . The global body appealed to member nations to help evacuate the stranded . `` The biggest priority is to take people out of the country , '' Etyemezian said . `` Now the -LRB- border -RRB- crossing is anywhere between 10 to 13,000 people a day . And the outgoing is 3 to 4,000 . So we need to have a bigger capacity of people leaving the country . '' Police and soldiers watched , as young Tunisian volunteers used sticks to beat back people trying to jump over a wall next to the border gate into Tunisia . Volunteers threw bread and bottles of water into the no man 's land between the red and green flags . Thousands of people have been waiting there for as many as three days , enduring bitter cold without shelter . Staff members with the U.N. refugee agency described the water and sanitation situation as precarious . Tunisian authorities told the agency that about 75,000 people have streamed into Tunisia . Up to 15,000 more people are expected to arrive Tuesday and the agency said it was `` becoming critically important that onwards transport becomes quickly available to avoid a humanitarian crisis . '' The refugee agency said it was particularly concerned about a large number of sub-Saharan Africans who are being denied entry into Tunisia . They may be targets for retribution after reports that embattled Gadhafi recruited mercenaries from those nations to suppress the uprising in his country .

Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi has made it clear he will not be forced out of power . He continues to attack and kill his own people who dare to protest his dictatorship . It 's estimated more than 1,000 people have been killed so far . The country has sunk into a civil war that has caused tens of thousands to flee to the Libyan-Tunisian border . And it 's getting worse by the day . So what 's the United States , the world s only superpower , to do ? After days of not saying much while Americans were evacuated , the White House has started to talk tough , saying all options are on the table with respect to Libya . The U.S. has frozen $ 30 billion in Libyan assets . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has met with top diplomats to discuss possible next steps . Today , Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he is positioning two naval warships in the Mediterranean near Libya . He said the focus is on humanitarian assistance and evacuations , and there has been no authorization for use of force . In a piece for the UK Telegraph , foreign affairs analyst Nile Gardiner asks whether tyrants even fear the United States anymore . He writes , `` Just a few years ago , the United States was genuinely feared on the world stage , and dictatorial regimes , strategic adversaries and state sponsors of terror trod carefully in the face of the world 's most powerful nation . Now Washington appears weak , rudderless and frequently confused in its approach . '' Here s my question to you : Should the U.S. do something to protect Libyans from Gadhafi ? Interested to know which ones made it on air ? No , they seem to be doing quite well on their own . If the leaders of the opposition ask publicly for our help we would then be justified in doing so , otherwise it would be construed as the Americans attacking another Muslim country . Enforcing a no-fly zone would be a good first step , arming the rebels an excellent second , and hanging the consequences a necessary third . Innocent people are being slaughtered while wise men ponder . If acting now is not who we are , then who are we ? Unfortunately , countries like France , China and Russia do not come forward during such times to take steps to protect innocent people from being killed by their own people . Yet , they will hide behind the U.S. and criticize us for whatever actions we take . The UN really does not have much credibility and effectiveness . We need to do the right thing rather than standby and watch the slaughter of innocent people . Humanitarian aide , yes . Diplomatic pressure , of course , But no acts of war . We have plenty on our plate right now . Let the British do it . Gadhafi 's their buddy . Did n't the British let out that `` dying '' terrorist , who flew off to a hero 's welcome in Libya ? Does n't the British government get most of their oil from there ? So let them deal with him . Jack , the United States should stay out of this , condemn the violence , and let the UN send food and medical aid . If the Libyans want freedom , they will need to shed their own blood to achieve it . The U.S. government has enough to do protecting us from ourselves , which includes not getting into all the world 's conflicts . For the first time since Paul Wolfowitz first opened his mouth in public I find myself agreeing We should recognize the temporary Government and ask them what help they need but agreeing with a person that signed the PNAC agreement one has to wonder why he might speak with such logic . March 1 , 2011 at 5:58 pm | I may go as far as putting In a No fly-Zone In so the Libyan people would n't have too worry about being attack from the sky . But no more than that . Unless Ask by the Libyan people Provisional Government and ask to do so on TV so the rest of the middle east can hear It . March 1 , 2011 at 5:58 pm | The US has sponsored this dictator . We are the reason he has held onto power for so long , and why he is incredibly wealthy while his people just get by . The protest signs read `` go out US '' . The world should stand by and not become involved beyond humanitarian purposes . The Libyans need to be allowed to form a government representative of them , and them solely . March 1 , 2011 at 5:58 pm | Jack , I think they 've got it under control . The US should provide humanitarian aid , food , medicine , and shelter in the interest of fostering peace and cooperation in the region . Any military action on our part will be viewed as usurping the right of Libyans to total self-determination . Although on the other hand , we could n't have done it 200 years ago without the French . March 1 , 2011 at 5:58 pm | I 'm getting tired of the ripping of Obama for not being ` tough ' enough on Llibya . What is he supposed to be doing that he is n't already ? have n't we learned the painful lesson that there is a limit to our ability to impose our power without drastically negative consequences for all involved ? -LRB- see iraw -RRB- . We must get off this quick draw , send in the marines mentality . Tthe Libyan people do n't want it and Americans certainly do n't want it . It is an international crises that needs ot be handled by the international community , of which , finally , we are trying to be a part instead of being the lonesome cowboy . March 1 , 2011 at 5:59 pm | Do you have any earthly idea how much the U.S. Marines aboard the 6th Fleet want to do this thing ? March 1 , 2011 at 5:59 pm | Yes , but only with the same number of troops went onshore with on D-Day in France ... if not then stay out of it and let the Libyans settle it among themselves . March 1 , 2011 at 5:59 pm | I support the Libyans in their fight for freedom but we can not protect or defend the entire world . Our ATTEMPT to do this has resulted in a military budget that is greater than all the others in the world combined and debt we can no longer ignore Others in the world need to step up and help ... Let the Australians or Germans or Japanese -- they dont spend what we do or have the debt we do , maybe they can afford it . March 1 , 2011 at 5:59 pm | We 'll be damned either way . Where is the new world leader ... China ? March 1 , 2011 at 6:00 pm | No more wars except to defend our shores . We are overextended militarily . We are already upside down in debt . The American people have sacrificed far too much for international corporations , big banks and the oil companies . But , arming the oil executives and dropping them off on the beaches of Libya would be O.k. with me as long as they pay for their weapons . Also , no air or naval support . March 1 , 2011 at 6:00 pm | People fighting and dying for democracy and freedom ... DUH ! 200 + years ago did France not come to our aid and help us build America ! We have no greater duty in our role as the world leader than to support Libyans , albeit in concert with the U.N. and NATO . NO !!! We need to take care of ourselves for a change . Who cares what other nations think of us . This is none of our business and we need to keep our noses out of it . We are in debt . 2 ENDLESS wars still going on . . Nobody elected us the worlds savior ... And who would pay to save them ? We would just borrow the money from China again ... March 1 , 2011 at 6:00 pm | This is a no-win situation for Obama and for America . If he uses military force and Libyans die , America will be blamed for intervening in another country 's sovereign affairs . If he lets Libyans sort this out for themselves and Libyans get annihilated , he will be accused of standing by while another Rwanda occurred . A good option might be for Obama to assemble some sort of UN-backed coalition to establish no-fly zones backed up with military force . March 1 , 2011 at 6:00 pm | The U.S. should not meddle in the affairs of other countries . This is a civil war , and we have no reason to interfere . March 1 , 2011 at 6:01 pm | Yeah , we could `` protect '' them right out of their oil like we protect other Mideast countries . March 1 , 2011 at 6:01 pm | Jack it looks like a lot of Libyans are doing a pretty good job on their own without our assistance . Should we send in troops that will open us up to a mess like Iraq ... no. . We bombed Iraq back to the stone age . Guess who will be stuck with the bill for rebuilding . I can see helping people and providing food , medicine , but sending in troops ... no way . March 1 , 2011 at 6:02 pm | No. . We 've lost too many boys\\/men for the sake of some other country 's ` liberty ' . In the meantime , the American people lose more and more liberties to protect these countries . I 'm tired of them hating on us . After all , most of the world views us as the Ugly Americans . March 1 , 2011 at 6:03 pm | The U.S. by itself should never feel free to act militarily . If the U.N agrees , after all other measures failed , then a multi-national force should act , but only as a `` Peace keeper '' ... As leaders of the free world we do n't want to get rid of a dictatorship with another type of forced government brought by us ! March 1 , 2011 at 6:03 pm | Perhaps the presence of the Enterprise , -LRB- same ship from the Gulf of Sidra Incident -RRB- and her escorts enforcing a no fly zone would send a much stronger and forceful message to Ghaddaffi Duck . Since the British RAF and the German Luftwaffe are already engaged in operations to rescue their people from Libya , then why not ? The Libyan military is hardly a threat to most nations nowdays , they ca n't even defend themselves from themselves with equipment left over from the 1980s ... In fact , mybe Malta might mount a military operation of its own and probably suceed in ousting Mo. . March 1 , 2011 at 6:03 pm | Absolutely not . We should focus all our efforts in the U.S. economy . Nothing else comes close in terms of importance , especially Libya . March 1 , 2011 at 6:03 pm | Historically though one thing than can unite a regime collasping from internal revolt is an invasion by another nation -LRB- Iran during the Iran-Iraq war for a quick example -RRB- . Gadaffi is rambling like a madman about Americans blah blah and the last thing we 'd want is to give him the distraction he needs . The country will fall on its own ; all we need to and should do is support the new government afterward . However supplying and supporting rebels in the nation should be considered , and offering asylum to those requesting it should be done . We can not let Gadhafi butcher his people , but we can not afford any sort of occupation whatsoever , so we need to support Libyan protesters without an actual invasion . The United States must protect those Libyans who otherwise would be slaughtered by Gadhafi . We sit on the sideline too long and many die unnecessarily . Let 's make a decision , Washington , D.C. Administration ... the time is at hand ! March 1 , 2011 at 6:03 pm | US is to lead consensus with other nations , not to act alone . Freezing assets , no fly zone , support the cities that have already been freed . stop arm sells to Libya 's goverment . No american ground troops should be send unless the UN approves that . March 1 , 2011 at 6:03 pm | Jack-we are not the world police and i do n't see anyone offering to help us with our messes . Let these nations pay for our help . March 1 , 2011 at 6:04 pm | A tough question . If we indeed stand for people s freedom to demonstrate and petition their governments for change and are willing to act with something like a no-fly zone -LRB- an entirely justifiable action -RRB- , where do we draw the line ? A small time dictator like Gadhafi offers up an easy response . However , does anyone think that the Saudi government would do anything different than Gadhafi should its people protest the utter oppression there ? Would we enforce a no fly zone in SA if the royals started bombing their own people ? Considering they are our dealers for our gross addiction to the almighty barrel , my guess is no. . March 1 , 2011 at 6:04 pm | I can still see the people there cheering and having a good time when the PanAm 903 bomber was returned to Libya , no let them fight it out and then make sure that no other arab country goes in and tries to take over . March 1 , 2011 at 6:05 pm | The world should provide humanitarian assistance however should allow Libya & its citizens to fight `` their '' civial war . March 1 , 2011 at 6:06 pm | We have to deal with realities . We are still stuck in Bush 's quagmire of Iraq plus we are still are trying to finish what Bush did not finish in Afghanistan . This does n't even begin to cover the financial disaster Bush and Republicans caused . How can we step in ? We can only step in so much into the world 's problems . We are not the world 's police or the world 's guard dogs . I hate to see people mercilessly slaughtered . but we have to take care of our out citizens first . Other countries have militarily also . Why does n't China . Germany or France step in for once ? They want to be power houses well with the good comes the bad let them help clean up some of the messes . This is part o why the deficit is so high we are always playing world police . We should only step into Libya if Oil prices get too high and it will damage our economy worse . March 1 , 2011 at 6:06 pm | I think giving more arms and ammunition to Libyans -LRB- as Great Britain is doing -RRB- and humanitarian aide -LRB- as France is doing -RRB- are good concrete aids we should DO . The words are important about our outrage ; but Libyan who are more than willing to ` do this for themselves ' would appreciate actual aide . I do n't know why we seem frozen in place ? We have watched the slaughter of thousands in Darfur , is it they have no oil ? Let me be clear , we do n't care if there is nothing to gain . My question is do we crank up the war machine ? We are presently only involved in two wars . Do we need a third ? March 1 , 2011 at 6:08 pm | March 1 , 2011 at 6:09 pm | If we can get in and get out quickly , white taking out Gadhafi , then yes , but only if our presence is wanted by the Libyan people . How to gage that I 'm not too sure . We went into Afghanistan and Iraq ... how does our government pick and choose ? I do n't know . I do think it is encouraging that these people want their freedom and want to be a part of the free world . Less places for terrorists to plan and train is a good thing . March 1 , 2011 at 6:09 pm | The better question is whether we should follow the path of the Libyan people and do something to protect America from the gang of cutthroats that has overthrown our government . March 1 , 2011 at 6:09 pm | Nothing ! leave them alone !!! and leave the entire arab nations alone !!!! March 1 , 2011 at 6:10 pm | The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq cost 1 billion dollars a day . If these wars were ended , US would see large reduction in spending . These wars contributed to most of the debt . These wars are not being fought to protect Americans . They are being fought for oil and Iridium . US is in these countries until `` favorable '' governments are set up in them . So oil companies and mining companies can set up there . After all , they do not want a repeat of Chevron and Venezuela . These wars are immoral . American service men and women are being killed and maimed as are the civilians caught in the crossfire . Meanwhile , programs to help the poor and middle class in this country are being cut . So the rich can get richer . The wars need to be stopped . March 1 , 2011 at 6:10 pm | Yes , but make it quick !! Maybe a few cruise missiles in Tripoli . March 1 , 2011 at 6:11 pm | In retrospect , one could argue that whatever the reasons for us going into Iraq were publicly -- privately we as Americans were hoping to ` push ' stable , peaceful democracy in the Middle-East . In Libya , we see a natural ` pulling ' toward such a paradigm shift . If we are willing to run up our debt and ask soldiers to fight and die to PUSH such an agenda -- we damn well better be ready to support the people on the other end who would help us PULL it in Libya . I think we should enforce a no fly zone at a minimum ; keep in mind that military action like that would only occur in a fantasy world where our conntry did n't waste money & time in countries that did n't pose a threat to our security like Iraq . March 1 , 2011 at 6:11 pm | How about protecting the iranians from Najad , how a bout protecting Tunisian , Yemenies and so on why the focus on Libya because of the oil again we shouldnt intefer in any countrys business we dont need new wars , , we didn finsh the wars we started 10 yrs ago . March 1 , 2011 at 6:11 pm | The U.S. does NOT need to protect Libya or it 's people . We have enough problems in this country to deal with such as The Economy , Welfare , Homeless and Starving people of our own . We seem to rush to the aid of other countries but do nothing to help our own people . What is our country thinking . Let them fight their own battles . We need to step it up here and get help for the United States . March 1 , 2011 at 6:12 pm | We lost all our credibility for humanitarianism when we invaded Iraq . With our record of torture , renditioning , inhumane treatments of detainees and other atrocities , perhaps aiding the Libyans for purely unselfish and humanitarian reasons might restore our standing in the world . March 1 , 2011 at 6:12 pm | Although I would like to help out the Libians the reality is we are already fighting a two front war and can not risk opening a 3rd front . This country is not an endless supplier of military power and money . March 1 , 2011 at 6:13 pm | No ! The Libyans did n't lift so much as a finger to save us from Bush , Cheney , and Rumsfeld , so why should we save them from Qaddaffi ? March 1 , 2011 at 6:13 pm | No , not unless asked to do so and then sparingly if that . They have told the rest of the world they want to handle this on their own and I think we should respect that . We have already bankrupted ourselves with Iraq , it 's not fair to the taxpayer to get involved in another war . Who do we think we are to position ourselves as the world 's parent ? I find this sort of arrogance both sickening and embarassing . March 1 , 2011 at 6:13 pm | The United States simply does n't have the resources to assist every nation that is encountering sociopolitical difficulties . It is n't fiscally responsible for us to get involved , when we have many people in our own country without decent food , healthcare , or shelter . I am glad that we are a nation that helps people out that are in need , but when will be the `` right '' time to help ourselves ? March 1 , 2011 at 6:13 pm | At this point I care less about what we do than how we are going to pay for it . If we are going to take military action , let 's pass a tax in advance . March 1 , 2011 at 6:13 pm | Right now , tue United Sports needs to sit tight and stop worrying about any other country but ITSELF ! March 1 , 2011 at 6:13 pm | I would n't waste ONE OUNCE , of American Blood , for ANY of them ! I wish we could line ALL the Arabs up on ONE side and All the Jews up , on the OTHER side , give EACH side some short-range nuclear weapons and count to three ! Those two have been hating and killing each other , over that barren strip of land , since the BEGINNING OF TIME ! And they will be fighting and killing each other , when we 're all dead and gone ! There will NEVER be peace in The Middle East ! March 1 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | The initial knee jerk answer to your question is CERTAINLY . However , we have US Citizens dying in the streets , some continuing to lose jobs , schools in danger of having no teachers and two political parties that can do NOTHING for any of the above mentioned citizens save throwing stones at each other . If we do anything for Libya , it will have to be in concert with the rest of the free nations of the world . We can not afford to pay for the freedom of everyone in the world when our own citizens ca n't see the light at the end of the tunnel . March 1 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | NO , NO , NO. not unless libya pay us twice the value of what we spend on them in oil . -LRB- for every dollar we spend on them they pay us two dollars in oil -RRB- if we are going to be the world police we need to be paid first , fight later ... March 1 , 2011 at 6:17 pm | No , the United States should not get involved in the political unrest in the Middle East . We can not afford the wars we are in now . We need to protect our own borders and the people in this country . None of these countries want us there and never appreciate the extreme cost our beautiful country takes on to help the world . The people of these countries will never change their way of treating each other and us . March 1 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | No. . . with our current involvement in 2 other countries -LRB- Afganistan & Iraq -RRB- and our economic plight here at home , we can not be the global savior . March 1 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Stay out of it ! We do n't have any money so why should we be posing as the worlds Big Brother . Spend our money here . Leave the Middle East and Libya to the Middle Easterners and Europe and Isreal . Concentrate on competeing with China ! Create Jobs here shrink the Military . March 1 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | john j. grimes watertown , ma . The United States should cease it 's meddling in the Middle East when we ca n't even take care of our own problems . The last time we instituted a no-fly zone was in Iraq which resulted in the shooting down of a civilian airliner and the deaths of over 200 innocent civilians . I voted for Obama because he said he would get us out of Iraq & Afghanistan which he has not done . Now he wants to start up another incident with Libya . March 1 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | No the people stated they do n't want us and they know best . We should respect their wishes . They have been told for too long whats good for them . Lets respect them March 1 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Unfortunately countries like France , China and Russia do not come forward during such times to take steps to protect innocent people from being killed by their own people . Yet , they will hide behind the US and criticize us for whatever actions we take . The UN really does not have much credibility and effectiveness . We need to do the right thing rather than standby and watch the slaughter of innocent people . we also need to stop supporting all of these dictatorial regimes around the world on one hand and preaching democracy on the other . March 1 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Not yet . The rebels seem to be holding on and gaining so allow them to handle their own affairs for the time being . March 1 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | I have 2 sons , 2 grandsons , and a granddaughter in service to our country . They , along with other courageous soldiers , have answered the call to protect us and our freedoms . I do n't want to see any other brave Americans die in the middle of another country 's civil war . Have we not done enough ? March 1 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Jack most Americans do not even know where Libya is on a map if you were to show it to them and i doubt most Libyans know where America is on a map either . America is not the keeper of the world . We are one country among many and we are now a poor country that is ass deep in debt to other countries . No jack we do n't need to help Libya . Their neighbors need to help them as they stand to gain or lose the most out of what Libya becomes . March 1 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | We want do squat til it 's to late . Sticks & stones will break their bones but words ' well you get the drift . We have successfully made ourselves irrelevant and have CHANGE YOU CAN TO BELIEVE IN TO BLAME . The Eagle is grounded . March 1 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Yes , Jack , just what the secretary of defense has announced that we would do . I 'm sich and tired of all these hawks who ca n't wait to get more of oour kids killed while other countries of the world sit and let us do all the dirty work . March 1 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | We should provide humanitarian aid only , unless we 're asked to intervene . We have n't had much success in intervening in disputes since WW11 . The Libyan people do n't seem to want foreign intervention . Many on twitter ask US NOT to step in . Also there are pictures of banners in Libya saying `` No Foreign Intervention '' . But there are thousands on the borders with Egypt and Tunisia . . We should help the refugees or the chaos might endanger 3 revolutions -- Egypt , Tunisia and Libya March 1 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | Yes . We 've forced our way into enough countries for political and economic reasons , all too often with barely any hesitation . How about doing it for the right reason for a change . No occupation , just get in , help the Libyans , and get out . It would certainly help me feel a little less embarrassment about the obviously unjust wars the last administration got us into . Let 's put our morals where our mouth is for a change . March 1 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of ... send our boys in , it 's way past time . March 1 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | Obama is being very careful , rightfully so . If we take military action against Gadhafi , do we do the same for the Iranian protestors ? That would be entering a hornet 's nest ! March 1 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | All the hawks want to send American GIs into Lybia to overthrow Gadhafi . They say 1000 Lybians have died so far , and 10,000 have fled the country . Why do n't the 10,000 that fled the country pick up a gun and turn around and go fight for their own independence . We lost 50,000 in 3 days in a town called Gettysburg and how many did we lose fighting for our independence from Britian ? Let the Lybians fight for their own independence . Even if we help them , they 're not going to like us anyway . March 1 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | absolutely not . That is a revolution in their own country . If Libians in the USA are worried about their families , they will have to go on there own and fight and help . March 1 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | No , definitely no. . We can t save the whole world , we can not afford to do this even though it might be the right thing to do . If we do , it wo n't surprise me if everyone who said we should will complain that we did . March 1 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | Jack I have always admired you and your comments . USA administration should do no more than it is doing at this time simply because this is the better way for everyone involved . Keep in mind it is better to be respected and loved than to be feared because the previous administrations have always somehow stood by these dictators we are now trying to get rid of which makes the present administration 's cautious action the only action to take now . March 1 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | yes , The US should help libyans because people are being killed for no reason , that is a enough reason to help them . March 1 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | Leave Lybia alone . It 's not our country , it 's not our issue and yes , I know all about their oil . Having been born in Alaska -LRB- pre Palin era -RRB- and having spent the better part of my life around the oil industry I know that Alaska and the Continental United States have MORE THAN ENOUGH OIL reserves to last an extremely long time -- the oil industry just does n't want you to know that . So , we actually have no real interest in Lybia , let it go . Get back to the business of figuring out how to take care of America and her citizens . March 1 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | America should not get involved in Libya . If there is a humanitarian or even a military necessity for intervention there is the Arab league and others in the hemisphere with a vested interest that should be allowed to respond . our sending 3 warships to the coast implies that we will , by force , impress upon Libya what the world thinks we are intending to impress upon any nation we feel that it is in our interest to do so . So , after we eliminate another dictator that we either implanted , supported or allowed to exist unbridled , then we 'll impose our will to usher in someone we feel WE are comfortable with . A military option is no option but , the military industrial complex and others with dollars signs in their eyes will impose their will and our sons and daughters will be in another far off place fighting for a reason they know not what other than it 's their duty ! We need to get our own house in order and not be the world 's dictator ! March 1 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | I 've been saying for over a year and I still say ... We need another Ronald Reagan . March 1 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | We got involved in Iraq to eliminate the problem of Saddam Hussein and we are still there and their `` government '' is still corrupt . We can not afford another war in the Mideast . Let 's get out of there and let them solve their own problems . If we would open up drilling in the US , we do n't need their oil either . We should n't be the `` caretakers '' of the world . March 1 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | No. . The situation in Libya is a civil war . We should be ready to offer humanitarian assistance if called upon by the Libyian people , but let the Libyians take care of themselves . It will build their pride in their accomplishment . March 1 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Jack , maybe great Britain should be making that decision . The deal brokered for the release of that terrorist bomber is proof enough that GB is involved with that nation . March 1 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | We can not be the World 's policeman ! We are over extended and if we follow a policy of rushing in where angels fear to tread , our enemies will deliberately goad us into this self destructive behavior whenever they can . Direct intervention would be stupid , but a little gun running probably would not hurt , and possibly save lives . March 1 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Our military is involved in Afghanistan , Iraq , all over the world , we even still have tens of thousands of troops in South Korea , where the Korean war has never officially ended . Our government has incredible debt , the financial resources are not there to resuce any other country . We came to the aid of Iraq and Afghanistan , and the people there arguably , hate us more now . Let some other great democratic power step in ! March 1 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | No , it is time we stopped being the police for the world . It was the foreign adventures of our previous regime which spawned the economy and Federal fiscal crisis we now enjoy . The Republicans want to cut spending , this is an excellent area in which to start . Would we like it if the Taliban tried to free us from Obama ? It is past time we started minding our own business and taking care of our own . It is none of our concern what other countries do to their people as long as American lives are not in danger . March 1 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | This is the same US who did nothing to prevent genocide in Rwanda or Sudan and has propped up numerous regimes throughout the years who have been brutal to their own people but subservient to us . The tragedies in those places saw many , many , more people killed than in Libya , Egypt , or Yemen . All of a sudden we have to actively support `` freedom '' in the Middle East so we will be `` respected '' . Sometimes we have to be careful what we wish for !!!! March 1 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Yes we should help the people of Libya . in whatever way necessary to get Ghadaffi out . especially since he is killing his own people . 42 yrs of hell . Great opportunity for Libya , the Arab region and the USA . March 1 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | The U.S. can hardly stop now . After decades of being the worlds police : how would it look if we didn ` t help at a time like this ? March 1 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Yes , we should do something ... One Bomb will do it !!!!! We Know where he is and we can end with one strike ... I really do not think anybody would be against it ... March 1 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | tough choices , Damned if you do damned if you do n't . Humanitarian aid would be a good start . It would be easier if the Republicans would stop critasizing the president long enough for us to speak with one voice . I hate to say this , but taking out Kadafee would probably save many lives . I know we ca n't do this but somebody could . March 1 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | March 1 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Quite frankly , the U.S. doesnt even know how to take care of its own citizens , why on earth would we want to be involved in another quagmire ? We are currently engage in a conflict under false pretenses , losing precious blood and treasure , our economy is in the rocks , and 9 % of our population are unemployed with the future forecast being nothing but grim news . We are in no condition to do anything . . The ` preliminary ' FBI 6 month report from Jan. to June 2010 on violent crime as of now has almost 6K homicides across the country . The United States foreign and domestic policies has been far too often to the detriment of its citizens Period ! March 1 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | NO ! We have enough to deal with . Anyone with a brain in their heads knows that Democracy and Freedom can not be imported , but must be born in the hearts and minds of the people ! Libyans will either choose to fight for their Freedom or they wont . Its up to the Libyans to FREE their Nation from a tyrant ! March 1 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | The US should not intervene with our military or secret service . This question is remarkably easy to answer . If the US gets involved and Gadhafi is removed from power , the legitimacy of the new government in Libya will be suspected of being a `` puppet government '' of the US . Did we learn anything from Iraq ? Did we learn anything from supporting dictatorships in the interest of oil ? Its clear -- we do n't get involved . We do n't lose a single friend or family member in Libya . I have a new found respect for the people in the Middle East right now . They are showing the world they do n't support such tyranny and oppression . Let them win their freedom and stamp out those who betrayed them and their country . March 1 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | Yes , I believe US is already doing a lot to protect the Libyan citizens , short of a direct military intervention . Keep in mind , Libya is still a sovereign nation and their current crisis is an internal affair , with an anti Gadhafi opposition rising against the 41 years of dictatorship . Although a US military action might sound simple and tangible in the name of protecting human lives and rights , we have to consider the fact that our entrance into an internal turmoil would not be seen kindly by other Arab nations . I do believe only a unilateral agreement by UN would allow a coalition of military forces to protect Libyan citizens and oust Gadhafi , if he decides to commit a mass genocide upon his population . No , because this is n't as simple as people fighting for freedom . This involves tribal grudges going back 1000 years . The only solution the Libyans will be happy with is one they come up with on their own . At a minimum , before a single U.S. military asset is committed to `` fight for Freedom in Libya '' , the president and his advisors should take a class on North African tribes and their history . Remember when we invaded Iraq completely ignorant of the difference between Shiite and Sunni ? Such folly should not be repeated . March 1 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | We are a global society now . Yes , of course the US should help , as all able countries should . March 1 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | Hi Jack , your question is one that started to get to me big time today . Yes , the U.S. should get involved in helping the Libyans against Ghadafi . Our forces are already strained in Afghanistan but Canada always played a huge role in UN Humanitarian and Peacekeeping efforts in the past . Helping Libyans will also help the Egyptians and Tunisians who are already strapped and under new and tentative regimes . March 1 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | No , it should be very limited in what we do in Libia . Why oh why do we have to get our nose in every damm thing that goes on in the world . We are way upside down in debt , got two wars , got military in almost every country in the world . The europeans should be doing most if anything that needs to be done . Verbal support , thats it .

Until the leadership is overthrown , then Tripoli is where the tipping point will need to happen It appears at the moment that both sides are heading for a stalemate If talks can progress in rebel-controlled Zawia and Misrata it could provide incentive for other areas The government is feeling international and domestic pressure but it is also a diehard leadership Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In Libya , the rivals for power appear to be heading towards a stalemate . CNN 's Nic Robertson explains what 's happening in the capital , Tripoli , why two cities in rebel control could be key to the country 's future , and why neither side has the power to dislodge the other completely . What 's it like on the streets of Tripoli ? We have seen about three rings of security around the capital . They include Army checkpoints with armored personnel carriers , anti-aircraft batteries and tanks . But there are not that many soldiers around and they do n't stop many vehicles . They are more interested in vehicles coming into the city than those leaving it . On the streets in the outskirts where we know there have been anti-government protests we saw some police in armored vehicles and riot gear . But we are talking about a couple of dozen at any one location . At street intersections there might be a couple of soldiers or police armed with automatic weapons but it is not a complete lockdown of every street . The traffic passes through and they are not stopping people . How willing are people to talk to you ? Fuel truck causes blasts in Tripoli Quiet but not normal in Tripoli For rebels , a long road to Tripoli Some people , as soon as they see the camera , they come up and tell us how much they love Gadhafi but if you engage in conversation you can scratch the surface and they will tell you they want reforms . Often you hear the chant or people saying `` miya miya '' which means they are 100 percent for Gadhafi . Others may not want to share their opinions but it is clear they are not happy with the situation or the government . Yet others are brave to explain their positions . One man who came up to me took me into his confidence . He said they had tried anti-government protests and thought they were doing well , but now they 've been so badly beaten and forced off the streets that they are afraid to come out again . Is Gadhafi 's message resonating with Libyans ? There is an uneducated population that will go with their tribe . If the tribe says `` go with Gadhafi '' then they support Gadhafi . Government officials will tell you a good part of the population will follow the tribe . It is not a developed society . It 's tribal and basic and people are not taught to analyze for themselves . When you speak to the more middle class people they take it with more of a pinch of salt . But a lot of these people are worried by how the protests developed . I talked to a lawyer who said he protested the regime but when he saw weapons in the hands of protesters he felt the protest was being hijacked . These people have a lot at stake -- their kids ' education , their businesses or professional reputations . They are worried that violent protests threaten stability . They want change but do not want it through violent means . There were others , intellectuals among them , who think they have to really pressure the regime to make the change . Can the protesters in other parts of the country affect what happens in Tripoli ? Protesters in Benghazi can come out on the streets but it will not change anything in Tripoli . Until the leadership is overthrown in Tripoli , then Tripoli is where the tipping point will need to happen . But they can make a difference by organizing politically to either negotiate with the government or to build international pressure . And they can organize militarily to move forces and try to take the capital . But that is not going to happen anytime soon . In a place like Zawia the center is controlled by the opposition but they are surrounded by government forces . The more they engage the military the more it stretches the government but it does not appear they are doing that . We are in a stand off . There is no pressure point where the opposition can push through . What do the options seem to be at the moment for how this will play out ? The government says it wants to negotiate . I do not think the government can get away with wholesale bloodshed to retake parts of the country . I am not sure that they have enough loyal military to mobilize against the opposition . The government does not have the strength to breakout from where it is . And the opposition does not have the strength to tip the balance at the moment . I think a key test will be in Zawia , west of Tripoli , and Misrata , east of Tripoli . We are told the government is trying to negotiate with the rebels in these areas . If they can negotiate then they may be able to be productive with rebels elsewhere . But I do n't think it will come together in the next few days . The situation can not go on for much longer but it could still be a few weeks . A senior government official told me dealing with the opposition is `` chaotic . '' The opposition is divided . There are the protest leaders and former government ministers who have just resigned and swapped sides . It is possible the government is reaching out to the former government elements . There is no effective process for any sort of dialogue . I think the government here does not quite know what to do . It is still on the back foot . The government is feeling international and domestic pressure but it is also a diehard leadership .

A delegation of U.S. House members visits the Libyan Embassy Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Obama administration is considering whether it should cut diplomatic ties with Libya , a senior U.S. official told CNN on Tuesday . `` Whether to maintain relations or sever them is under review , '' the official said . Cutting ties would send a strong message that the United States no longer considers the government of Moammar Gadhafi to be legitimate . President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton both said in recent days that Gadhafi has lost his legitimacy to rule the Libyan people and should leave power . According to the senior U.S. official , the last high-level communication with Gadhafi 's government was last week , when Clinton spoke with Libyan Foreign Minister Musa Kusa . Mass Libya exodus creates border chaos Fuel truck causes blasts in Tripoli U.S. preps Libyan humanitarian effort Who makes money from Libyan oil ? However , the official also said there was `` still some utility '' in reserving channels of communication with the Gadhafi government , noting that some American citizens remain in Libya and there could be a need to talk to Libyan officials about humanitarian activity . `` There may be instructions one has to give to Libya depending on what happens going forward , '' the official said . The official added that the United States still considered Ali Aujali to be the legitimate Libyan ambassador to the United States , even after the Gadhafi regime notified Washington that Aujali no longer represented its interests . Last week , Aujali said he no longer represented the regime because of Gadhafi 's brutal repression against the Libyan people . But he said he still represented the Libyan people and told the State Department he would remain a liaison to the Libyan opposition . On Monday , the State Department received a fax from the Libyan government saying Aujali was no longer the ambassador and it had named the deputy ambassador as the new `` charge d'affaires , '' spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters . The senior U.S. official said the fax from Libya was not an official diplomatic note and until State Department lawyers review its authenticity , `` Ambassador Aujali continues to be the head of mission at this time . '' At the Libyan Embassy on Tuesday , Aujali greeted a delegation of U.S. House members led by Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas who came for a visit as a few dozen anti-Gadhafi protesters chanted on the street . Afterwards , Jackson Lee said she and her colleagues would try to ensure that the U.S. government continues to recognize Aujali to be `` the representative of the Libyan people . '' She praised Aujali for condemning the Gadhafi regime , saying that , `` In jeopardy of his life , he has been willing to stand with those who fight . '' Aujali asked for support from the United States . `` Please stand with us to change this regime , to stop the killing of the Libyan people which is taking place every day , '' he said , later adding : `` This regime is a brutal regime . The slogan of the regime is , ' I rule you or I kill you . ' '' As Jackson Lee 's delegation prepared to get in vehicles to leave , they were surrounded by demonstrators who wanted to shake their hands and hug them . We stand with the people of Libya , '' Jackson Lee repeated over and over amid a barrage of embraces .

The Obama administration is considering whether it should cut diplomatic ties with Libya , a senior U.S. official told CNN . `` Whether to maintain relations or sever them is under review , '' the official said . U.S. officials have said all options are being considered with respect to Libya . Underscoring that point , the amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge and the amphibious transport dock USS Ponce were to be repositioned in the Mediterranean to `` provide us a capability for both emergency evacuations and also for humanitarian relief , '' Defense Secretary Robert Gates told reporters . But , he noted , the U.N. Security Council has not authorized the use of armed force . The U.N. General Assembly adopted by consensus a resolution to suspend Libya from its seat on the 47-member chamber Human Rights Council . It was the first time the assembly had suspended a member of the council . `` This is a harsh rebuke -- but one that Libya 's leaders have brought down upon themselves , '' said Ambassador Susan E. Rice , U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations , in a statement . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the General Assembly that he welcomed the decision and urged the international community to investigate allegations of human rights violations in Libya . `` The world has spoken with one voice , '' he said . `` We demand an immediate end to the violence toward civilians and full respect for their fundamental human rights , including those of peaceful assembly and free speech . '' Should U.S. arm Libyan rebels ? U.N. fears refugee crisis in Libya Guns and oil in rebel controlled Libya Libyan protests : Raw and online He added that reports from the ground `` are sobering , '' with continuing loss of life and ongoing repression . `` Arms depots and arsenals have reportedly been opened to gangs who terrorize communities , '' he said . `` There are reports that government forces have fired indiscriminately on peaceful protesters and bombed the military bases in the east of the country . '' `` The death toll from nearly two weeks of violence is unknown , but likely to exceed 1,000 , '' with thousands more wounded , Ban said , using the same fatality figure he had used Friday . Libya 's ambassador to the United States estimated Monday that the death toll was about 2,000 . But Gates stressed the number of casualties is uncertain . `` I think the honest answer is that we do n't know , '' he told reporters . The government of Canada has frozen $ 2.3 billion in assets tied to the Libyan government ; the assets were frozen after Canada enacted sanctions over the weekend , Canadian Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Lynn Meahan said Tuesday . A number of other countries , including the United States , have ordered an asset freeze . Though some witnesses have accused pro-Gadhafi forces of firing on civilians from the air , Gates and Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said they could not confirm the reports . What are U.S. options for Libya ? Clinton said imposition of a no-fly zone is under consideration , but Mullen said doing so would be `` an extraordinarily complex operation . '' A top U.S. general said Tuesday that any effort to establish a no-fly zone over the country would include eliminating Libya 's air defenses . It would be `` challenging , '' U.S. Central Command leader Gen. James Mattis told the Senate Armed Services committee . In western Libya , Ban said , there were reports of ongoing clashes between government forces and armed opponents . He noted `` allegations of extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions and torture . '' Though more members of the military have reportedly sided with the opposition , Gadhafi 's supporters `` appear to be holding a tight grip on western parts of the country , chiefly Tripoli , '' he said . He warned of `` serious indications '' that the numbers of refugees and displaced persons were reaching crisis proportions and worried that the violence could disrupt distribution networks and lead to food shortages . The U.N. refugee agency reported that nearly 150,000 people had crossed Libya 's borders into Egypt and Tunisia and thousands more were arriving hourly at the borders . Ban called for immediate action by the international community . `` Time is of the essence , '' he said . `` Thousands of lives are at stake . '' Indeed , at the border with Tunisia , many recent arrivals said they had been robbed or forced to pay bribes en route . Some said they had been threatened with death . One man said Libyan soldiers used electric cables to beat him as he waited at the airport and demanded $ 500 from him . When he told them he did n't have it , they said , `` Die then '' and threw him into the street . Tunisian authorities appeared to be struggling to cope with the arriving wave of refugees . Volunteers hurled fresh bread and water into the crowds . `` There is nothing for them on that side , '' a policeman turned volunteer said from the Tunisian side of the border . He was one of many Tunisians donating their time to take food , water and supplies to the border . Many said they were livid that international organizations were slow in arriving . Meanwhile , more parts of the regime have broken off , joining calls for Gadhafi to halt the violence . In London , the Libyan Embassy said it was siding with the opposition , condemning what it called `` all acts of murder and terror '' taking place in Libya . The military situation on the ground was complex : Forces loyal to Gadhafi tried to retake a town near the capital that is under opposition control but were repelled , an opposition leader in the town told CNN Tuesday . The source said pro-Gadhafi troops with tanks and anti-aircraft guns attacked Zawiya from east and west at nightfall Monday , but did not capture the town . A senior official in Gadhafi 's regime denied that government forces attacked rebels in Zawiya . Senior members of the government told CNN that Zawiya and Misrata are key to their effort to regain control of the country . The officials insisted they want a peaceful resolution , but witnesses have described repeated violent efforts by the regime to regain control of areas Gadhafi has lost . Zawiya was calm Tuesday , but Gadhafi 's troops remained nearby , the opposition leader and another source in the town said . CNN is not naming them to protect their safety . Misrata was protected by its residents and military defectors and the situation there on Tuesday was stable , said Abd al Baset Imzeereq , who identified himself as the spokesman for the newly formed city council . Pro-Gadhafi forces are stationed in the Navy college about 15 kilometers -LRB- nine miles -RRB- outside the city and have not attempted to move into the city center since its fall , he said . The forces appear to be stationed there not to try to retake the city , but to protect the ammunition depot in the college and `` to terrorize the people '' by opening fire on them . At least two farmers were killed Monday when these forces shot at their vehicle , Imzeereq said . Still , some semblance of normalcy was visible Tuesday , when some banks had reopened in Misrata and people were able to withdraw money or get loans , he said . Food supplies were ample , he said , but medical goods were scarce . Imzeereq said at least 33 have been killed and another 487 wounded in Misrata since the unrest began . The capital city of Tripoli was quiet Tuesday as more people here also tried to resume normal life . Prices of basic goods have increased ; a Tripoli resident said she could not get paid due to unspecified problems in her bank . Some residents told CNN they want to protest but fear being killed . Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , the leader 's 38-year-old son who has spoken on behalf of the regime during the protests , told CNN his talks with the opposition are in `` chaos '' because the opposition is divided , with no clear leaders . Many Libyans have rejected the younger Gadhafi 's remarks during the uprising . But U.S. officials made similar comments about the rebel forces . A U.S. official who wished to remain nameless because the official was not authorized to speak on the record said it 's `` unclear who the leaders in the opposition are and that makes it difficult '' for the U.S. to provide assistance . `` The intelligence community is aggressively pursing information on the ground , '' said the official , who added that the CIA has had a presence in the country for some time . `` I think it remains to be seen how effectively military leaders who have defected from Gadhafi 's forces can organize the opposition in the country , '' said Gates . `` We are watching that unfold . '' Over the past two weeks , government forces have repeatedly clashed with demonstrators and rebel forces , fired on crowds and at times shot indiscriminately at people in the streets , numerous witnesses have told CNN . The elder Gadhafi made no public appearances Tuesday , but he appeared out of touch on Monday , denying having used force against his people and even denying the existence of the protests . `` No demonstration at all in the streets , '' the 68-year-old ruler told ABC and the BBC in a joint interview in Tripoli . `` They love me , all my people with me , they love me all . They will die to protect me , my people , '' said Gadhafi , who has controlled Libya for nearly 42 years . But Libya 's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Ibrahim Dabbashi disagreed . `` I do n't believe that even his family loves him at this moment , '' said Dabbashi , who has joined the rebel movement in calling for Gadhafi to step down . `` I think no one loves him at all . I think the whole Libyan people hate him now . With all the bloodshed , all the killing ... he 's certainly out of his mind .

They are our brothers , '' he said in a speech televised on the government-run network . Chavez and Gadhafi have a close relationship , having bonded partly over shared opposition to U.S. global influence .

That same year , a new football stadium in Benghazi was named after the Venezuelan leader .

Djerba , Tunisia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama said Thursday he approved the use of U.S. military aircraft to help return to Egypt those Egyptian citizens who have fled to Tunisia to escape unrest in neighboring Libya as the United Nations called for stepped-up aid to refugees . Nearly 180,000 people , mainly foreign workers , have fled to the neighboring nations of Tunisia and Egypt amid fighting between government troops and rebels pushing to oust longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi , the U.N. refugee agency reported . About 95,000 people have crossed into Tunisia and another 83,000 into Egypt , the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimated .

Chaos has reigned on the Tunisian border for days as thousands have clamored to get out of Libya , and many have found themselves trapped in a no-man 's land between the two countries . Thousands more were housed in tents provided by UNHCR and the Tunisian military , and many have little money and no travel documents with them . In Djerba , about 90 km -LRB- 55 miles -RRB- from the border , hundreds of refugees waited Thursday for flights out . Some napped on the floor ; others sat up against the walls waiting . But the process appeared orderly , given the number of would-be passengers , as airport officials moved them along in orderly lines with no pushing or shoving . The majority carried only small bags containing the bare necessities that they managed to escape with . One elderly man 's luggage consisted of a tightly wrapped blanket -- the only possession that survived his journey out of Libya . ` Awful ' conditions along Libyan border No-fly zone in Libya explained Gadhafi 's options if he leaves Libya Tired , filthy and stuck at border Earlier Thursday , UNHCR sounded an urgent appeal to governments to help in the mass evacuation required to get people out . And after a call among Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and representatives of Middle Eastern , European and U.N. organizations , the world body called for help to avert a humanitarian disaster . `` There is a strong need for urgent relief -- food , water , sanitation and shelter to the thousands on both sides of the Tunisian and Egyptian borders due to significant population movements , mainly of migrant workers , '' a U.N. statement warned . `` It is also necessary to prepare for a further possible escalation of humanitarian needs should conditions deteriorate inside Libya . '' The participants in Thursday 's talks , which included the Arab League , the European Union and the Organization of the Islamic Conference , urged Libya to allow `` immediate and unimpeded access '' to determine what was needed . `` The situation here remains tense , '' said Firas Kayal , a spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency on the Tunisian border . `` There is lots of congestion on this side of the border and we are hearing that many thousands are waiting on the Libyan side to come through .

The refugees include Bangladeshis , Vietnamese , Thais , Koreans , Malians , Ghanaians and Sudanese who had entered Libya seeking work .

Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan aircraft bombed a section of eastern Libya on Wednesday as leader Moammar Gadhafi tried to retake control of an area seized by rebel forces . A CNN crew saw the aircraft drop two bombs near al-Brega , a town in the east with key oil and natural gas facilities . Later , a military aircraft dropped a third bomb . People on the ground shot and threw whatever they could at the aircraft , then fled . After one of the attacks , people carrying stretchers were seen running to the site of the bombing . Fighting also raged on the ground , as Gadhafi 's forces tried to take control of a university in al-Brega . A doctor told CNN there were four dead and 23 wounded at his hospital in the area , all victims of gunshot wounds . Residents of the town said the rebels maintained control of al-Brega , repelling Libyan ground forces . Earlier Wednesday , military aircraft bombed military camps on the outskirts of the town of Ajdabiya , a tribal leader said . The tribal leader , who did not want to be identified for safety reasons , said youths in Ajdabiya were massing and heading toward the conflict area to help defend the town , which has been in the control of rebel forces in recent days . Some military bases in eastern Libya have fallen into the hands of rebels as more members of the military have abandoned Gadhafi 's regime and joined the opposition . The bombings could support calls for the imposition of a no-fly zone over Libya to prevent such attacks . The United States has said all options are on the table . Adm. Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said imposing a no-fly zone would be `` an extraordinarily complex operation . '' Senator John Kerry , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said Wednesday that , while Libyans are not asking for foreign troops on the ground , they need `` the tools to prevent the slaughter of innocents on Libyan streets , and I believe that the global community can not be on the sidelines while airplanes are allowed to bomb and strafe . A no-fly zone is not a long-term proposition , assuming the outcome is what all desire , and I believe that we ought to be ready to implement it as necessary . '' The Arab League met Wednesday to consider a resolution rejecting foreign military intervention in Libya , where protesters have been demonstrating for weeks , calling for more freedoms and for the longtime ruler to step down . `` We perceive what happened and what is happening is an internal affair that is decided by the people and their governments , '' the Arab League said in a statement . Bombing in Libyan oil town Writer tells of brutality in Libya Should U.S. arm Libyan rebels ? Guns and oil in rebel controlled Libya As Gadhafi 's forces launched their attacks , the 68-year-old leader warned that `` thousands and thousands of people will be killed '' if the United States or NATO `` intervene in our country . '' In another of his trademark , rambling speeches carried live on state television , Gadhafi continued to claim that there are no peaceful Libyan protests , only al Qaeda-backed efforts to tear the country apart . He blamed the problems on former prisoners at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , who were released to Libya and then freed by Libyan authorities after they pledged to reform . He said they turned out to be members of al Qaeda sleeper cells -- but insisted that his country is `` stopping al Qaeda from flourishing '' and preventing Osama bin Laden from moving into North Africa . Gadhafi , who has ruled Libya for more than 41 years , also denied having any assets besides `` history , the people , the glory -- not the American dollars or the oil . '' The speech lasted about 2-1\\/2 hours . He also spoke Wednesday with Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez , according to the Venezuelan Ministry of Popular Power . Later , several thousand people , including many young men and women , took part in a pro-Gadhafi rally in Tripoli 's Green Square . Some residents of the capital have told CNN they want to protest Gadhafi but fear being killed by his forces . And some have said Gadhafi forces have dragged residents into the streets and forced them to take part in rallies praising the leader . A spokesman for the Libyan government , Musa Ibrahim , told CNN that assertions of widespread military attacks on peaceful demonstrators are wrong . `` This is an armed rebellion , with people going around attacking police stations , army offices , getting a hold of guns and attacking , '' he said . He said the government had supported the initial peaceful protests , but said al Qaeda supporters have hijacked that movement `` and they are leading the country into chaos . '' Asked for evidence , he said , `` We have captured dozens of these people , we have figures , we have interviews , we are willing and prepared to take these people and show them on international media . '' But numerous witnesses have described indiscriminate killings and attacks . The International Criminal Court announced it is opening an investigation into Libya . `` Following a preliminary examination of available information , the prosecutor has reached the conclusion that an investigation is warranted , '' the court said in a statement . US , allies debate no-fly zone for Libya Libyan protests : Raw and online CNN crew witnesses air bombing in Libya Mass Libya exodus creates border chaos The conflict between Gadhafi 's government and opponents , in its third week , followed protests in neighboring Egypt and Tunisia that ousted those countries ' leaders . International efforts to persuade him to follow the message of protesters and step down have also ratcheted up . The U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution Tuesday to suspend Libya from its seat on the 47-member chamber Human Rights Council . It was the first time the assembly had suspended a member of the council . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the General Assembly that he welcomed the decision and urged the international community to investigate allegations of human rights violations in Libya . `` The world has spoken with one voice , '' he said . `` We demand an immediate end to the violence toward civilians and full respect for their fundamental human rights , including those of peaceful assembly and free speech . '' He added that reports from the ground `` are sobering , '' with deaths and ongoing repression . `` Arms depots and arsenals have reportedly been opened to gangs who terrorize communities . There are reports that government forces have fired indiscriminately on peaceful protesters and bombed the military bases in the east of the country , '' Ban said . `` The death toll from nearly two weeks of violence is unknown , but likely to exceed 1,000 , '' with thousands more wounded , he added , using the same fatality figure he had used Friday . Libya 's ambassador to the United States estimated Monday that the death toll was about 2,000 . Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , the leader 's 38-year-old son who has spoken on behalf of the regime during the protests , told CNN Tuesday that his talks with the opposition were in `` chaos '' because the opposition is divided , with no clear leaders . U.S. officials made similar comments about the opposition . A U.S. official who wanted to remain anonymous because the official was not authorized to speak on the record said it is `` unclear who the leaders in the opposition are and that makes it difficult '' for the United States to provide assistance . The capital city of Tripoli remained under the control of Gadhafi 's rule , though opposition forces have taken control of the eastern city of Benghazi and a number of other cities . The U.N. refugee agency reported that nearly 150,000 people had crossed Libya 's borders into Egypt and Tunisia , and thousands more were arriving hourly at the borders . Ban called for immediate action by the international community . `` Time is of the essence , '' he said . `` Thousands of lives are at stake .

S. Previously , Lawrence had worked as a correspondent for CNN based out of the network 's Los Angeles and Chicago bureaus . He is also a veteran of the U.S. Navy Reserve . -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The people 's revolt against Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi remains dangerous -- and fluid . On Thursday , U.S. military aircraft and French charter jets joined efforts to get tens of thousands of people fleeing the fighting back home as the United Nations called for stepped-up aid to refugees . The humanitarian gestures came a day after Gadhafi warned that `` thousands will die '' if the United States or its allies attack Libya , and Defense Secretary Robert Gates cautioned members of Congress of the difficulties that would be inherent in such a move . CNN.com turned to Pentagon correspondent Christopher Lawrence for some insights into the complexity of the situation . Question : The Arab League has said it is against any foreign intervention in Libya , even though it has called for Gadhafi to leave . Is it possible for the U.S. and its allies to work around this ? Calls for military action in Libya Tired , filthy and stuck at border Christopher Lawrence : The United States still has the ability to impose a successful no-fly zone , even without the Arab League , -LRB- but -RRB- Defense Secretary Robert Gates is extremely hesitant to project American military power into this conflict -- especially a highly visible symbol like U.S. fighter jets . Question : If a no-fly zone is to be enforced , Robert Gates has said it must begin with attacks against Libyan air defenses . `` That 's the way you do a no-fly zone , '' he told a House committee . He also said such an engagement is not possible with a nation the size of Libya `` with the planes you would find on a single aircraft carrier . '' Chief of Naval Operations Gary Roughead indicated that the USS George H.W. Bush is still in Norfolk , Virginia . Is the sense here that the clock is ticking and it might be too late for the U.S. to mount a meaningful no-fly operation on its own ? Lawrence : Part of Gates ' comment about `` not enough planes on one carrier '' refers to the fact the United States would not undertake this mission unilaterally . So even if the USS GHW Bush arrived , the Pentagon would not want to solely depend on U.S. assets . They would be expecting to use some land bases in Italy , for example , which has recently suspended its `` friendship treaty '' with Libya . That conceivably opens up Italy to the ability to stage missions . And British Prime Minister David Cameron has already signaled the British military to start working up plans with allies in case a decision is reached to impose a no-fly zone . Question : What are the main issues that need to be addressed if the decision is made to enforce a no-fly zone ? Lawrence : There would need to be numerous answers to `` rules of engagement '' questions first : -- What 's considered a `` hostile act '' ? -- Is it Libyans firing on other Libyans -- or coalition planes ? -- Would the U.S. jets be able to fire on Libyan air assets on the ground , before they take off ? There is a sense that before any no-fly zone is imposed , the United States and its allies need to answer a fundamental question : Is this no-fly zone being enforced to protect the Libyan people on humanitarian grounds ? Or is it being enforced to help the Libyan people overthrow Gadhafi ? It sounds simple , but each answer can come with vastly different rules of engagement . Question : Would the Obama administration consider the possibility of redeploying any troops and materiel from Iraq or Afghanistan ? Lawrence : I have n't heard talk of any -LRB- redeployment of -RRB- forces and\\/or equipment of any real scope mentioned . Afghanistan is such a priority right now . With the president 's July 2011 date to at least symbolically start the withdrawal , it 's hard to conceive assets being diverted from there to Libya . This is unlike say Bahrain , where the U.S. bases its all-important 5th Fleet or even Egypt , which keeps the peace with Israel . Libya does not rise to a level of strategic importance that officials would take assets from Afghanistan . CNN.com 's Cameron Tankersley contributed to this report .

'' President Obama cites Libyan leader by name for the first time U.S. steps so far are humanitarian Obama says all options , including a no-fly zone , are on the table Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama said Thursday he authorized the use of U.S. military and civilian aircraft to help return to Egypt those Egyptian citizens who have fled to Tunisia to escape unrest in neighboring Libya . At a joint news conference with visiting Mexican President Felipe Calderon , Obama said the United States is examining a `` full range of options '' in the Libyan crisis . For the first time since the Libyan crisis began , Obama cited Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi by name in a public statement , saying , `` The violence must stop . Moammar Gadhafi has lost legitimacy to lead , and he must leave . Those who perpetrate violence against the Libyan people will be held accountable , and the aspirations of the Libyan people for freedom , democracy and dignity must be met . '' However , Obama stopped short of committing U.S. help for creating a no-fly zone over Libya , as called for by anti-Gadhafi figures and some U.S. Congress members . Instead , he announced steps to deal with the growing humanitarian crisis involving refugees from Libya who have crossed the border into Tunisia and Egypt . In addition to military aircraft , Obama said he authorized the U.S. Agency for International Development to charter civilian aircraft to help in the refugee effort . `` And we 're supporting the efforts of international organizations to evacuate people as well . I 've also directed USAID to send humanitarian assistance teams to the Libyan border so that they can work with the United Nations , NGOs and other international partners inside Libya to address the urgent needs of the Libyan people , '' he said . Asked about a no-fly zone , Obama said it remained among the options available in case the situation in Libya deteriorates . `` What I 've instructed the Department of Defense as well as our State Department and all those involved in international affairs to examine is a full range of options , '' Obama said . `` I do n't want us hamstrung . I want us to be making our decisions based on what 's going to be best for the Libyan people in consultation with the international community .

'' In apparent response to criticism that the United States should be more involved in toppling Gadhafi , through a no-fly zone or arming anti-government forces in Libya , Obama said it was important to ensure that the Libyan people feel `` full ownership '' for any transformation and cited Egypt 's recent revolution as an example . `` We did not see anti-American sentiment arising out of that movement in Egypt precisely because they felt that we had n't tried to engineer or impose a particular outcome , but rather they owned it , '' Obama said .

The situation in Libya is different from those in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt , where uprisings turned into revolutions that overthrew their rulers .

U.S. military and diplomatic officials -- including Defense Secretary Robert Gates , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Michael Mullen and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- have all said enacting a no-fly zone is complicated and risky , and international support for the idea is not there yet . `` If it 's ordered , we can do it , '' Gates said , but imposing a no-fly zone `` begins with an attack on Libya to destroy the air defenses .

Gadhafi 's regime Thursday sought to create an impression that it still controls the vast majority of the country , with rebels in charge of only pockets . The government organized a trip for a CNN crew to visit a refinery in Zawiya controlled by the government . Rebels control the center of the city , but the refinery is on the outskirts . The refinery , Libya 's second largest , is operating at 80 % of its capacity , officials told CNN 's Nic Robertson .

Musa Ibrahim , a spokesman for Gadhafi 's regime , told CNN , `` We need tribal intervention , social intervention to help us convince these people to come to the negotiating table . '' The government spokesman denied any attacks on peaceful protesters despite numerous reports from the country of unarmed demonstrators being shot indiscriminately . More than 1,000 people are reported to have been killed and many more injured during the protests , according to the United Nations . Libya 's ambassador to the United States has estimated that the death toll was about 2,000 . The International Criminal Court Thursday said Gadhafi and some of his sons and advisers are under investigation for alleged crimes against humanity . `` I would like to use this opportunity to put them on notice , '' ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo told CNN . `` I want to be clear : If their troops commit crimes , they could be made criminally responsible . '' It is the first time the court will be investigating claims as they are allegedly occurring . Libya is not a signatory to the Rome Statute , which created the ICC , and does not recognize the authority of the international court . But the United Nations Security Council referred the matter to the court , essentially giving it `` jurisdiction '' over the situation in Libya , the court said . Nations have scrambled to evacuate hundreds of citizens as the unrest continues . The Netherlands defense ministry said Thursday that three Dutch navy personnel were captured by armed men loyal to Gadhafi during an evacuation operation Sunday . The ministry did not release information earlier because of safety reasons . Libyan state TV said the personnel were in a fighter helicopter and did not have permission from Libyan authorities to enter .

'' Continuing unrest and violence has left experts warning of a major humanitarian disaster , as thousands of people flee across the borders into neighboring Tunisia and Egypt . So what can the international community do to stop further bloodshed ? And will anything they do convince Gadhafi to step down after more than 40 years in power ? What about a no-fly zone to keep Libyan military aircraft out of the skies ? Some witnesses have accused pro-Gadhafi forces of firing on civilians from the air , but U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said Tuesday that these reports could not be confirmed . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the imposition of a no-fly zone was under consideration . But Mullen said doing so would be `` an extraordinarily complex operation . '' Ali Suleiman Aujali , the Libyan ambassador to the U.S. who broke with the Libyan government over the use of force against protesters , told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer that his people were being `` slaughtered like sheep '' and the international community needed to step in -- or else stop encouraging the uprising . Should US arm Libyan rebels ? John McCain pushes Libya no-fly zone `` They have to dominate the skies , they have to stop the march of the tanks towards Misrata and towards Tripoli , '' he said . `` They have to take measures to stop these massacres going on in my country . If you ca n't act now , then do n't encourage us to die . '' John Bellinger , a former legal adviser to the U.S. State Department , told CNN , `` Legally , there is no authority for the United States or any other country to do that under international law unless authorized by the Security Council . `` Politically it could be quite problematic ... for the United States or NATO to begin shooting down Libyan aircraft , even in the face of the things that Gadhafi is doing against his own nationals . '' What role does the United Nations play ? The United Nations Security Council has already taken some action against the Gadhafi regime , but it has not authorized the use of armed force . Its members met at the weekend and voted unanimously for sanctions , including an arms embargo , assets freeze , and a travel ban for Gadhafi , his family , and key associates . However , they did not support calls for a no-fly-zone , and any decision on whether to impose one is likely to have to wait for a further U.N. resolution . If the U.N. did vote in favor of a no-fly-zone , NATO would likely play some role in enforcing it , but NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen insists no action could be taken without a U.N. mandate . `` A no-fly-zone is not a part of the U.N. Security Council resolution , and a far-reaching approach like that would require a U.N. Security Council mandate , '' he told CNN . `` It 's a hypothetical question at this stage , but if the issue is raised , and if there is a request -LRB- for cooperation -RRB- then the NATO council will consider it , but that 's not the case for the time being . `` We have started preparations for all eventualities , but I think it is a bit premature to outline any timeline . '' Is Italy 's decision to suspend its non-aggression pact significant ? If any military action , such as enforcing a no-fly-zone , were to be taken , troops would likely have to use air bases in Italy . Italy is also home to the U.S. Navy 's Sixth Fleet . Under a friendship treaty , signed three years ago by Gadhafi and Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi , Italy agreed to pay Libya compensation for its colonial rule of the country , and Libya pledged to help stem the tide of refugees heading for Italy from its shores . But the pact also included a non-aggression clause , under which Italy promised not to allow its territories to be used to launch military operations against Libya . The treaty was suspended over the weekend . What happens to Libya after Gadhafi ? Explain it to me : Libya unrest Possible military aid to Libya Explain it to me : Libya unrest Kurt Volker , a former U.S. ambassador to NATO , told CNN that Italy 's suspension of the pact would not immediately enable military operations to be launched from that country . `` If you 're really trying to think about military action , do you have some kind of authorization to do so ? You would need a U.N. mandate and possibly a NATO declaration or both , and there is n't anything like that on the table at the moment , '' he said . Aldo Amati , deputy press secretary for the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , insisted the treaty had not been suspended to pave the way for military action . `` There 's no connection , '' he told CNN . `` There 's no link between the two things . '' What about sanctions against the Gadhafi regime ? Gadhafi is no stranger to sanctions : He was subject to them for many years following Libya 's refusal to hand over suspects in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988 , in which 270 people were killed . This time around though , the international community has taken further action , freezing the Libyan leader 's assets and those of his family and the regime . The U.S. alone has blocked access to at least $ 30 billion in Libyan government assets , the largest amount ever blocked under a sanctions program . Travel bans too are likely to impact the Gadhafi family 's jet-setting lifestyle . What will the U.S. do ? Secretary of State Hillary Clinton insists that : `` Nothing is off the table , so long as the Libyan government continues to threaten and kill Libyan citizens . '' However , analysts say it seems unlikely that that the U.S. would launch attacks on Libya without a U.N. mandate . Rosemary Hollis , Professor of Middle East Policy Studies at City University London , said : `` The messy fact of Afghanistan and Iraq has been to deter any kind of gung-ho notion that you can sort our any very foreign country by force . '' But some prominent figures have called for other forms of military action to be taken - and quickly . Senator John McCain -LRB- R-Arizona -RRB- is one of those urging the introduction of a no-fly-zone : `` Libyan pilots are n't going to fly if there 's a no-fly-zone . '' And Senator Joe Lieberman -LRB- I-Connecticut -RRB- has gone one further , arguing that as well as offering aid to the rebels , the U.S. should be supplying them with weapons . Thomas Donnelly , of the American Enterprise Institute , says the mere sight of U.S. fighter jets over Libya would send a powerful message to Gadhafi . `` Even if we just buzzed the palace and did n't release any ordnance , the symbolic action or the psychological effect could be enough to bring the war to a quick conclusion , '' he said . The U.S. military is already close by : At least one destroyer is in the Mediterranean , and the amphibious assault ship the USS Kearsarge is in the Red Sea , close to the Suez Canal . The Kearsarge is well equipped to deal with casualties : it houses a floating hospital -- including six operating theaters -- which can care for up to 600 patients . The aircraft carrier USS Enterprise and its strike group are also in the region , able to move closer , if needed . However , Hollis said without a U.N. resolution , action remains unlikely . `` The only way I think they would launch military action without a clear U.N. mandate is by covertly supporting the opposition on the ground , '' she said .

And the influential Zintan tribe , allied in the past to Gadhafi 's own tribe , broadcast a statement of support for the opposition . One after another , Libya 's myriad tribes are falling in line against Gadhafi , and the implications are enormous , said longtime observers of Libya , because for centuries , tribes have formed the backbone of the North African nation . Many Americans pride themselves on God and country . In Libya , it 's God , tribe , then country . Refugees flee Libya for Tunisia No-fly zone in Libya explained Who is the opposition in Libya ? Libya 's 140 or so tribes and the clan and family structure that fall under them remain the most important aspect of a society that lags behind many others in the region in development , said Ronald Bruce St. John , a scholar who has visited Libya numerous times and published several books about the country . With the exception of the Red Crescent Society and the Boy Scouts , few civil society institutions exist anymore in Libya , crushed by four decades of Gadhafi 's authoritarian rule . There are no trade unions , PTAs or Lions Clubs . The tribes have filled those gaps and because of that , they have perhaps taken on a stronger role in Libya than in other Arab nations . `` Libyans have a strong loyalty to tribe , '' said Philip Carl Salzman , a McGill University professor of anthropology and author of `` Culture and Conflict in the Middle East . '' `` A tribe provides welfare in times of need , '' he said . `` They have a collective responsibility . '' If one member of a tribe is attacked , the reaction is to help or exact vengeance , Salzman said . Tribes are especially involved in resolving family disputes . Gadhafi recognized the power of his nation 's tribes when he seized control in 1969 . He saw tribal leaders as traditional forces opposed to his radical socialist agenda , St. John said , and , at first , he tried to suppress them . But later he tried to co-opt them , establishing a People 's Social Leadership Committee , which essentially was a collection of tribal leaders . St. John said it was Gadhafi 's way of telling the tribes : You are now responsible for your people . If any member steps out of line , we expect you to discipline him or her . The committee 's creation followed an abortive coup supported by the Warfallah tribe , whose members formed a chunk of the military . LSE head quits over Libya links Celebs under fire for Libya concerts According to a U.S. State Department document , Gadhafi `` began to purge the military periodically , eliminating potential rivals and inserting his own loyal followers in their place . '' He filled the higher echelons of the military and elite government posts with members of his own Gadhadfa tribe , but pitted them against others . Gadhafi 's actions back then reflected Libya 's lack of nongovernmental organizations and the strongman 's official recognition of tribes in his own ideological manifesto , `` The Green Book , '' said St. John . Now , almost two decades later , tribal elders may hold the cards to their national future . Libya 's tribes have never wielded political power , but if Gadhafi falls , it 's likely that a provisional government would resemble a patchwork of their leaders , Salzman said . `` I think the tribal elders would have to meet from different tribes and agree on some kind of structure , '' Salzman said . The problem , said Salzman , may lie in divisions between East and West that sprouted in Roman times with the carving of Libya into three states : Tripolitania in the west , Cyrenaica in the east and Fezzan in the south . The states and the tribes that lived in each remained independent until 1931 when Italian colonizers put down a rebellion with brute force and unified Libya again . But the nation was split again when Italy was defeated in World War II -- Tripolitania and Cyrenaica were controlled by the British and Fezza , by the French . A unified and independent Libya emerged in 1951 but the east-west tribal divisions remained deep , said St. John , because the king , a scholar of religion from the east , showed little interest in running his country . `` King Idris was a poor monarch , '' St. John said . `` He was disinterested in government . He was a religious scholar interested in tribal affairs . The eastern tribes benefited from Idris more so than the western tribes . '' Gadhafi always saw the tribes in eastern Libya as natural opponents , St. John said . Now , with the Libyan crisis sliding closer to war , the embattled leader is sure to see other tribes in the same vein . For now , several tribes in the west and south are reportedly loyal to Gadhafi , among them Gadhafi 's own tribe and the Magariha , the tribe of the Lockerbie bomber Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi . But the powerful Warfallah have already defected as have the Zintan , one of the first towns in western Libya that revolted last month . In a recent speech delivered on state television , Gadhafi 's son Saif a-Islam Gadhafi , blamed Libya 's unrest on tribal factions and warned of civil war with members of different tribes `` killing each other in the streets '' . But when they rose up to fight their Italian colonizers , Libya 's tribes stood as one against a common enemy . Gadhafi 's foes are hoping for that unity again . A November 18 , 1922 , New York Times story began this way : `` The latest to enter the Near Eastern struggle are the Bedouins of Tripolitania and Ceryainica , who are reported to have sunk their local differences and united ... to expel the Italians and establish their own government . '' The article went went on to raise speculation on how long the tribes , who have fought each other for generations , could stay united to fight someone else . Almost a century later , the same question seems eerily relevant .

Gadhafi military units are defecting , says a U.S. official Aiding the opposition is complicated Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Anti-Gadhafi fighters appear to have the resources to carry on the fight against the Libyan government for some time , according to a U.S. official . `` This could be a sustained conflict , '' said the official , but acknowledged this was a fluid situation . When asked if the conflict in Libya was now becoming a civil war , the official , who is knowledgeable about U.S. assessments , said the fighting `` has the characteristics of a civil war . '' The anti-government forces are bolstered by some weapon caches previously under the control of the Libyan government , according to a U.S. official and military officials not authorized to speak on the record . Defectors from the Libyan military are helping the rebels with fighting and armaments . `` Whole units of the Libyan army have now defected '' said a military official . That said , the United States does not have a good read yet on how much of the Libyan military leader Moammar Gadhafi still may control . When asked about what the anti-government forces had in their control , one of the military officials said they have tanks and anti-aircraft guns . Some of this , of course , comes from defecting units , but there also has been captures of weapons caches , the officials said . There are large caches of weapons around the country that the official said are no longer secure . Rebels have been seen with shoulder-fired missiles , anti-tank missiles and small-arms such as rocket-propelled grenades . The prospect of a civil war could dampen the will of the United States and other countries to intervene directly in the country . American officials have expressed caution regarding military intervention , stressing the need for humanitarian aid first . President Barack Obama said Thursday he wanted to ensure the United States was ready to respond , if `` defenseless civilians were finding themselves trapped and in grave danger . '' Aiding the opposition is also complicated , officials said , because of the lack of clarity about the capability , motives and strength of the disparate groups comprising the opposition . White House and State Department officials said Friday that even though the opposition is arming itself and fighting the government , that does not entitle Gadhafi to fight his own people . Gadhafi , officials said , lost his legitimacy when his forces fired on innocent protesters . `` It is the people of Libya that are forced to defend themselves in light of the aggression that the Libyan regime has carried on , not just a military forces , but by these mercenaries that are in the employment of Colonel Gadhafi , '' State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said . `` The unrest is aimed at ending his rule , his oppressive and violent rule , and we believe that that would result in a more peaceful Libya and would allow the Libyan people to take the kind of steps that they want to take towards a representative democratic government that addresses their legitimate grievances and respects their aspirations , '' said White House spokesman Jay Carney . Earlier in the week , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the situation demands `` a strong and strategic American response . '' `` In the years ahead , Libya could become a peaceful democracy , or it could face protracted civil war , or it could descend into chaos . The stakes are high , '' said Clinton . Libya being in a civil war would `` neither enhance or diminish your right as a third party actor to intervene , '' but the foremost consideration needs to be whether Gadhafi is needlessly cruel to the people of Libya , said Ruth Wedgwood , professor at Johns Hopkins School of International Advanced Studies . `` Can a government defend itself ? Yes , '' Wedgwood said . `` Can a government use means that are grotesquely excessive ? No. '' CNN 's Barbara Starr contributed to this report .

Show CNN what 's happening . Please do not put yourself in a dangerous situation . Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` Indescribable '' violence rippled through the Libyan city of Zawiya on Friday , according to a witness who said pro-government forces gunned down peaceful protesters there . The witness said battalions of forces loyal to Moammar Gadhafi attacked protesters with mortars and machine guns as they were demonstrating in the city 's Martyrs Square , and they assaulted an ambulance , killing its occupants . `` We buried nine people so far , '' the witness said . `` The attack was indescribable . Direct gunfire was opened on people . '' It was unclear who controlled the city . John McCain pushes Libya no-fly zone People in Zawiya , west of Tripoli , and `` their public leadership have secured and took control over the city from the armed terrorist elements , '' state TV reported . Libyan government spokesman Majid al - Dursi told CNN that `` Zawiya has been captured , Zawiya has been liberated . '' However , the witness said protesters retained some control inside the city , which security forces were surrounding . `` They -LRB- Gadhafi 's forces -RRB- have n't been in control and they never were in control , '' said one rebel fighter , who said his forces lost seven men in fighting in Zawiya on Friday , versus what he said were some 20 casualties among government fighters . Referring to Gadhafi , he said , `` All the man has left is his lies . '' By late Friday , the situation was quiet , he said . `` However , we 're surrounded by three areas -- the east , the west and the south . '' At least 15 people died and 200 others were wounded in the city , according to one doctor , who said there was `` a river of blood '' at the hospital where the wounded were being treated . `` The situation is very bad , '' he said , adding that the facility was short of medical supplies . It was not clear if the casualties at the hospital were wounded during the Martyrs Square confrontation . The doctor said the wounded started arriving at the hospital Friday morning , and most of the wounds were from gunshots . In the capital city of Tripoli , security forces aboard flatbed trucks shot tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds of protesters who had formed after Friday prayers in the Tajura neighborhood , witnesses said . Government officials would not allow CNN into Tajura , whose outskirts were patrolled by a heavy security presence . Security forces were searching cars along the Corniche , a main street in the city . Tired , filthy and stuck at border Who is the opposition in Libya ? Witnesses said anti-government protesters hid journalists in abandoned buildings and helped move them from location to location so that they could report firsthand in safety . Near Green Square , in the center of the city , anti-government protesters emerged from a mosque to find pro-government supporters outside . Police intervened and fired shots in the air to head off a confrontation , ushering the anti-government protesters back into the mosque for their safety . In the eastern city of Ras Lanuf , meanwhile , forces loyal to Gadhafi fought with opposition members Friday , opposition fighters and commanders said . Thuds could be heard in the distance , indicating heavy fighting around the city itself . `` It 's a war , '' said CNN 's Ben Wedeman , in Ras Lanuf . `` The protests are now over . '' He described seeing truckloads of people `` organizing themselves in a rather haphazard way '' and headed toward the front with no command-and-control structure . `` It 's complete chaos , really , '' Wedeman said . Such clashes have spurred throngs of people to flee the country . The number of people trying to leave the country has declined in recent days , however , as heavily armed government forces have intensified their presence at the Tunisian border and on roads leading up to it , the United Nations refugee agency said Friday . `` We are concerned that the presence of the forces and the large drop in evacuees could mean that people are being prevented from leaving , '' said Sybella Wilkes , a spokeswoman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees . Roughly 15,000 people had been crossing the border every day , but that number plunged to fewer than 2,000 per day on Thursday and Friday . In all , 200,000 people have fled Libya , according to the International Organization for Migration , which has been working with the U.N. refugee agency on mass evacuations . Meanwhile , a doctor on the northwestern town of Misrata said it was attacked by forces loyal to Gadhafi . The assailants fired at doctors and ambulances , the doctor said . `` We are holding our city , we are trying to protect our city , '' the doctor told CNN Friday morning . `` We are doing our job in the hospital and trying to treat everybody . This morning , they shot at our ambulances . One of them exploded ... they shot at our doctors . '' At least 40 people were killed in the city and 300 wounded , the doctor said . While CNN has staff in some cities , the network can not independently confirm reports for many areas in Libya . CNN has gathered information through telephone interviews with witnesses . Musa Ibrahim , a spokesman for Gadhafi 's regime , has denied reports of attacks on peaceful protesters and military installations . In an interview late Friday , Gadhafi 's son Saif Gadhafi told CNN that reforms will not begin until `` militias '' in the east have been defeated . He called international efforts to persuade his father to give up power `` a big mistake , '' and said his father remains a popular figure in the country . `` Even if we were to hold tomorrow an election , my father would win with a big majority , '' he said . Gadhafi 's aerial attacks have prompted the West to step up discussions about imposing a no-fly zone over the country . U.S. military and diplomatic officials have said enacting a no-fly zone would be complicated and risky , and international support is not strong . `` If it 's ordered , we can do it , '' Defense Secretary Robert Gates said earlier this week , but imposing a no-fly zone `` begins with an attack on Libya to destroy the air defenses . '' The United States is exploring a `` full range '' of options , Obama said Thursday . Analysts said the Iraq war has prompted nations to be more cautious . `` We went into Iraq with a very dubious understanding of the situation on the ground , '' Christopher Hill , a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq , told CNN . `` So I think there is some concern about whether refugee reports are entirely accurate in a sort of macro sense . '' He added , `` I think what the president is trying to do is to try to build diplomatic support and see where we can go with this . And I think it would be highly problematic if he just jumped into something . '' The Arab League has rejected international intervention , saying Libya is facing `` an internal affair that is decided by the people and their governments . '' But the league can not ignore the suffering of civilians and would consider the imposition of a no-fly zone in coordination with the African Union if fighting were to continue , said Hisham Yousef , chief of staff of the Arab League . The protests have left more than 1,000 people dead and many more injured , according to the United Nations . Libya 's ambassador to the United States has estimated that the death toll was about 2,000 . The United Nations has proved to be a sore point for the Libyan government . On Friday , the United Nations said it was studying Libya 's request to install a more loyal diplomat as its ambassador . A letter from Libya 's government asked that former Foreign Minister Ali Abdussalam Treki be approved as its envoy . Treki would replace Mohamed Shalgham as ambassador in New York . Shalgham and his deputy , Ibrahim Dabbashi , have denounced Gadhafi and requested that he stop leading Libya . A separate letter from Libya to the United Nations demanded that Shalgham and Dabbashi be denied the right to speak for Libya . In emotional scenes last week , the New York-based ambassadors were hugged by fellow ambassadors after the Libyans criticized Gadhafi and pleaded in the Security Council chamber for international assistance to the country . U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said the situation `` is complicated '' and that the world body 's legal office was looking into the dueling diplomats ' situation . The International Criminal Court said Thursday that Gadhafi and some of his sons and advisers are under investigation for alleged crimes against humanity . Venezuela 's president has said Gadhafi is receptive to the idea of an international commission coming to the country . The two heads of state spoke this week . `` I consulted with him . I asked him if he was willing to accept a commission of countries , '' Hugo Chavez said on state-run VTV Thursday night . CNN 's Nic Robertson , Ben Wedeman , Jill Dougherty , Catherine E.

Subject : URGENT OPEN LETTER TO BAN KI-MOON , UN SECRETARY GENERAL Date : Sat , 5 Mar 2011 14:30:12 +1100 I urge you , that either you or the UN or the Prosecutor of the International Court of Justice issue a warning ASAP to Gaddafi 's pilots and army that they will be individually held responsible for any civilian deaths and charged with crimes against humanity . Secondly , a no fly zone over Libya should be declared ASAP . Gaddafi has all the money in the world to finance mercenary armies and pilots as China and India are continuing importing Libyan oil , with payments going to Gaddafi 's regime . Thirdly , the UN should resolve to send in UN troops to Libya to stop the civil war and to allow the people of Libya to decide their own future . The world ca n't just stand by when there is a totally unequal David and Goliath struggle unfolding in Libya between the rag-tag army of revolutionaries and Gaddafi 's well equipped professional killers . It 's the duty of the world to prevent the massacre of the civilian freedom fighters of Libya , as it happened in the 1956 Hungarian Revolution . There too , the revolution started as a peaceful demonstration against the tyrannical regime . People only took up arms there too after State Security Police shot at them . The revolutionaries held out for over a week , but the overwhelming force of the invading Soviet army , comparable to Gaddafi 's reliance on external professional mercenaries , squashed the revolution , killing over 2500 freedom fighters .

Each aircraft carried three pallets of aid supplies , including 2,000 blankets , 40 rolls of plastic sheeting and 9,600 10-liter water cans , according to a statement from the U.S. Agency for International Development . The supplies , meant to help up to 2,000 people , will be handed off to Tunisia 's Red Crescent organization for distribution , the statement noted .

Clinton noted , however , that there is currently `` a lot of confusion on the ground '' in Libya that makes it tough to understand exactly what is happening there . Addressing reporters on Air Force One , White House Press Secretary Jay Carney reiterated the administration 's position that Gadhafi needs to step aside . `` Col. Gadhafi has no legitimacy and should step down and should cease all violence , '' Carney said . `` We believe that that would result in a more peaceful Libya . '' The violence in Libya escalated Friday as pro-government forces took control of Zawiya , a city near Tripoli , according to state TV .

Two Marine planes left the airport in the Tunisian island of Djerba with a total of 132 Egyptians on board , the U.S. State Department said . Two additional Air Force C-130s are en route to Djerba and will take another group of Egyptians home . All four U.S. planes are expected to arrive in Cairo by Saturday night , U.S. officials said . Two Italian military cargo planes landed at the Djerba airport delivering humanitarian aid . There are at least 10 other evacuation flights scheduled for Saturday -- six British , three Spanish and one Italian -- said Firas Kayal , a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency . Nine of the flights are to evacuate Egyptians and the other is for Malians . There are a few thousand Egyptians left in Tunisia awaiting evacuation after more than 40,000 were taken home . Kayal said there are also three ships preparing to evacuate people . The violence in Libya has generated an exodus out of the North African nation . Almost 200,000 people , a majority of them foreign workers , have fled Libya -- nearly 100,000 to Tunisia and a similar number to Egypt -- according to the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees . The numbers of people entering Tunisia daily from Libya dropped to 1,800 Thursday and Friday and stood at 3,000 Saturday . Previously , they averaged 10,000 to 15,000 people . Hovig Etyemezian , a field officer for the U.N. refugee agency , attributed the drop in part to fear and the manipulation of the flow of refugees by Libyan authorities . `` A lot of them were scared from leaving because of the fighting so they were staying in their houses , '' he said Saturday . `` We fear the regime might be blocking refugees from the border . '' A Sudanese man who crossed into Tunisia said Libyans had been confiscating phones and SIM cards of people fleeing . He said people are afraid to make the journey because of the fighting and the cost for bus or taxi transport to the border has spiked . However , he said , Libyans are not stopping traffic toward border . Raoul Gernali , a Filipino engineer who had been working on a Libyan water project , said Libyan soldiers at the Tunisian border stole his laptop , money and mobile phone . Because of complications with his group 's flight home , he and his Filipino colleagues have had to spend three days at the airport . Many countries , such as India and China , put in place well-organized evacuation operations for their citizens . But others , including Egyptians and Bangladeshis , have been left to fend for themselves . The U.S. State Department said Saturday it would donate $ 3 million to the International Organization for Migration -LRB- IOM -RRB- as part of a joint U.S.-IOM partnership to help get home thousands of Egyptians and other nationals from Africa , South Asia and Southeast Asia . Kayal said more than 10,000 Bangladeshis are awaiting transport in Tunisia . Many Bangladeshis have had to walk to the border because their money was stolen by soldiers and they could not pay for transportation costs .

Forces loyal to leader Moammar Gadhafi withdrew from the city 's Martyrs ' Square and returned to their positions on the outskirts after intense clashes with rebels , according to a witness who is serving as a rebel spokesman . Volunteers arm for Libya conflict Libya weapons available on black market He reported heavy gunfire and mortar shelling and saw the bodies of three slain opposition members carried in the square en route to burial . The witness said pro-Gadhafi forces entered a residential area in the city and shot live ammunition and automatic weapons at residents in the streets . The sounds of automatic weapon fire and people yelling could be heard during a telephone interview with the witness . After a lull in fighting , clashes erupted again Saturday evening . The pro-Gadhafi security forces are using tanks , armed vehicles , and heavy weapons , and the anti-Gadhafi forces are well-armed , a second witness said . Many deaths and injuries have occurred in the latest round of fighting , and protesters managed to seize tanks and weapons from the security forces . Saturday , rebels also captured the strategic oil port of Ras Lanuf , a day after pro-Gadhafi forces fought with opposition members there , fighters and commanders said . The development appeared to embolden opposition members , who prepared to advance west to Gadhafi 's birthplace of Sirte . Government forces , however , worked to thwart their push . CNN reporters following the movement of rebels in As Sidr , just west of Ras Lanuf , saw an air force helicopter pound opposition positions . There was no word on casualties . Rebels near Ras Lanuf said they shot down a Libyan air force plane , a Soviet-made Sukhoi Su-24MK that crashed in the desert . CNN located the plane 's debris , spread over a kilometer -LRB- about half a mile -RRB- , with the headless bodies of two pilots at the site . The plane was printed with the emblem of the Libyan Arab Air Force . In the capital , a pro-democracy activist who spoke to CNN described a city filled with tension and mistrust . The woman , who asked not to be named because of fears for her safety , said she has seen people in the streets who , she believes , are monitoring residents ' comings and goings and phone conversations . `` I see cars that have people inside them , and they are usually connected with a computer , '' the woman said , adding that special antennae are connected to the computers . The same people are also interrupting cell phone signals and hacking mobiles , she said , and the internet has been unavailable since Thursday . The family 's business has been robbed , with millions of dollars ' worth of materials stolen , she said . Squatters have also moved into one of the family 's homes . `` The police wo n't do anything about it , '' she told CNN . `` Everyone is focusing on what is going on politically and losing focus on the crime . '' The woman said she has been trying to smuggle medication and other supplies into Libya , and that 's one reason she refuses to leave -- even though so far , she said her efforts have been unsuccessful . The strife engulfing the besieged north African nation is reverberating across the country , the region and the world . Death toll estimates range from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000 , and the international community has been pondering strategies on how to end the violence and remove the Gadhafi regime . The government has been reviled across the globe for violence against civilians , and the International Criminal Court this week launched an investigation of Gadhafi , some of his sons and other leaders for possible crimes against humanity . Opposition-controlled radio announced Saturday that the country 's sole legitimate representative was now the National Transitional Council , a group with 31 representatives for most of the regions in Libya . The council held its first meeting Saturday in the eastern city of Benghazi . They called Benghazi their temporary location until the `` liberation '' of the capital , according to a decree the council issued late in the day . Former Justice Minister Mustafa Abdeljeleel , whom the council said had tried to resign from Gadhafi 's government several times , was announced as the council 's new leader . The council also named a representative for military affairs and established a military council to oversee the `` liberation '' of Libya and reconstruct the armed forces , according to the radio announcement . The council said its main missions are to represent all of Libya internationally , liberate the country , draft a constitution and hold elections . In Benghazi , witnesses said forces loyal to Gadhafi pounded a weapons depot , an airstrike that caused casualties and widespread damage . One witness said the airstrike there was powerful enough `` to destroy a whole city . '' News footage showed the remains of buildings and debris and ambulances arriving . Such aerial attacks have prompted the West to step up discussions about imposing a no-fly zone over Libya . U.S. military and diplomatic officials have said such a zone would be complicated and risky , and international support for it is not strong . `` If it 's ordered , we can do it , '' U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said earlier this week , but imposing a no-fly zone `` begins with an attack on Libya to destroy the air defenses . '' The Arab League has rejected international intervention , saying Libya is facing `` an internal affair that is decided by the people and their governments . '' However , the league can not ignore the suffering of civilians and would consider the imposition of a no-fly zone in coordination with the African Union if fighting were to continue , said Hisham Yousef , chief of staff of the Arab League , on Wednesday . The fierce fighting has sparked the flight of Libyans and foreigners out of Libya , with nations across the globe scrambling to help people leave . Almost 200,000 people have fled Libya with nearly equal numbers going to Tunisia and Egypt , the United Nations refugee agency said . The United States announced Saturday it is contributing $ 3 million to the International Organization for Migration to help return home thousands of non-Libyans who fled to Tunisia . Four U.S. military flights Saturday were taking a total of 312 Egyptians back to Cairo , the U.S. State Department announced . Thursday and Friday , about 1,800 people crossed from Libya to Tunisia , and about 3,000 crossed on Saturday , said Firas Kayal , spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees . He said the situation at the border is `` very calm . '' A few thousand Egyptians are in Tunisia awaiting travel home , and more than 10,000 Bangladeshis are there awaiting evacuation with hundreds more still arriving , Kayal said . The agency confirmed that a Bangladeshi migrant worker died after a heart attack from the exhaustion of walking to the border . Many migrant workers told aid workers they had to walk to the border because soldiers took their money and they could n't afford paying for a taxi .

Tunisian authorities have established an air bridge from a provincial airport on the island of Djerba that is now moving out thousands of migrants a day . `` We are expecting 10,000 passengers to leave every day with 66 movements , that 's to say 66 planes , '' said Djerba airport director Zouhaier Badreddine told CNN . `` The majority go to Egypt . But there are also Chinese , Pakistanis , Filipinos , Bangladeshi , Vietnamese , Turks in the beginning but now they all seem to have left . There are many nationalities and many destinations . '' 15 reported killed in Zawiya , Libya ` Awful ' conditions along Libyan border No-fly zone in Libya explained Tired , filthy and stuck at border As of Thursday , more than 172,000 people had left Libya , most of them migrant workers returning home , the U.N. 's emergency relief coordinator , Valerie Amos , said in a statement issued Friday . Among them were women and children , she said . The United Nations ' figure was slightly less than that of the International Organization for Migration , which has been working with the U.N. refugee agency and estimated that 200,000 people had fled Libya . Some of those crossing the border told CNN that government forces in Tripoli had confiscated their mobile phones and cameras . A majority of those fleeing are Egyptians who had been working in Libya . But the foreign workers also include citizens of other nations including Bangladesh , Thailand , Vietnam , Sudan , Ghana and Mali . A U.S. Agency for International Development official said approximately 90,000 people were in transit camps over the Libyan border in Tunisia . Almost half of them are Egyptian , said the official , who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak on the record . Closer to the Egyptian border , in the eastern city of Benghazi , about 8,000 foreigners awaited evacuation . They included Eritreans , Ethiopians and Somalis , according to the refugee agency . `` They appear to have gathered spontaneously and are camping together for security as they await , '' refugee agency spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said in a statement . She said most of those people will be evacuated within two days . Who is the opposition in Libya ? Refugees flee Libya for Tunisia Another 110,000 people inside Libya have been affected by the crisis , the International Committee of the Red Cross said Friday . It appealed for $ 26 million to help those inside the country and those in Tunisia . The agency said it will use the money for food , water , medical care , sanitation and hygiene items . As the violence has escalated in the past few days , U.S. military aircraft and French charter jets have scrambled to evacuate tens of thousands from the north African nation . In Washington , President Barack Obama said he has approved the use of U.S. military aircraft to help Egyptians who have fled the unrest to return home . He said he authorized the U.S. Agency for International Development to charter additional planes . `` Tens of thousands of people from many different countries are fleeing Libya , and we commend the governments of Tunisia and Egypt for their response , even as they go through their own political transitions , '' Obama said . The Pentagon announced that two planes carrying humanitarian supplies were being dispatched Friday to Tunisia in what has been dubbed Operation Odyssey Dawn ; the planes were carrying blankets , rolls of sheeting and water cans . CNN learned that a C-130 cargo plane labeled with a U.S. flag landed in Tunisia . Badreddine stood in the departure hall of an airport that normally welcomes sun-hungry European tourists traveling to the wind-swept beaches of Djerba 's Mediterranean coast . Instead , the hall was filled with hundreds of tired and dirty migrant workers . Some camped out on the floor on blankets . Others stood in orderly lines in front of a booth normally reserved for car rental companies and money exchange , which instead held Tunisian volunteers distributing sandwiches , fruit and water to the arrivals . `` Of the 50,000 refugees who have come through here '' since the crisis began , Badreddine said , `` everybody has been given shelter and food at the airport . '' The conditions at the airport were dramatically better than the scene that awaited many migrants immediately after entering Tunisia from Libya . On Thursday , more than 5,000 Bangladeshi men were camped out in a vacant lot next to the border gate , huddled under blankets next to a fetid pond of muddy water as howling winds whipped dust through the compound . Tunisian authorities and volunteers distributed food and water . A tent city that serves as a transit center was erected this week some 10 kilometers from the border . But the camp can hold only some 15,000 people -- that 's how many people are estimated to have arrived in a single day and not near enough to accommodate all those in need . Still , conditions have improved dramatically since Wednesday , when Libyan authorities began regulating the flow of refugees across the border . Instead of allowing them to mass by the thousands in front of the Tunisian border gate , refugees must now approach the border with Tunisia in orderly groups in single file . The U.N. refugee agency said Friday that the number of civilians fleeing the violence in Libya to Tunisia `` has dropped significantly since Wednesday afternoon , '' with armed , pro-government forces manning the Libyan side . Compared with earlier in the week , when 10,000 to 15,000 people were crossing daily into Tunisia , fewer than 2,000 made it across on Thursday and about the same number did so on Friday , the agency said . The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it was `` very concerned that the security situation in Libya may be preventing people from fleeing . '' The Libyan government appeared eager to show off the orderly border . Officials bused in a group of foreign journalists from Tripoli Thursday afternoon as part of a guided tour of the frontier region . But , upon their arrival in Egypt , dozens of refugees have said they had been robbed at Libyan checkpoints . Many said that , as they sought to get out of Libya , they were stopped and searched by Libyan security forces who confiscated their cell phones and computers . Many refugees also accused Libyan police and soldiers of having robbed them at gunpoint . `` I have no passport , only a passport photocopy , '' said Mohammed Shafiq al Islam . The 29-year-old man sat on the floor of the airport with more than 100 Bangladeshis -- all of them awaiting a flight home . He wore a uniform labeled `` Hanil , '' the name of the supply company that paid him $ 250 a month to work in Libya . `` The Libyan people take my money and passport and all the time say ' I will kill you , I will kill you , ' '' al Islam said , speaking in broken English . `` I am run away -LRB- for -RRB- my life . '' Like many Bangladeshi migrant workers , al Islam had borrowed some $ 4,000 to pay employment agencies to give him a job in Libya . Upon their arrival in Libya , many migrant workers were forced to hand over their passports to their employers . Human rights groups have denounced such practices , arguing they amount to little more than indentured servitude . The flight back to Bangladesh for al Islam and his fellow migrants will be free , but he and many of his fellow Bangladeshis face crushing debts . `` We are very helpless now ; we are beggars now , '' al Islam said . Djerba airport officials said 25 flights were scheduled to take off Friday for Cairo . The French government has helped with the Egyptian airlift by chartering several passenger planes to Cairo . A number of charter flights are scheduled as well to India , Jordan , China , Vietnam and Dubai .

The first of the C-130 cargo planes landed in Cairo at about 3 p.m. Sunday , carrying 82 passengers , the U.S. embassy in Cairo reported . Two more planes were en route with 90 and 72 passengers , respectively . The fourth plane was yet to depart from Tunisia . On Saturday , U.S. military planes carried out similar evacuations , returning passengers to Egypt . There are a few thousand Egyptians left in Tunisia awaiting evacuation after more than 40,000 were taken home , said Firas Kayal , a spokesman for the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , on Saturday . Many countries , such as India , conducted well-organized evacuation operations for their citizens . Nearly 36,000 Chinese nationals , for instance , have been evacuated from Libya since February 22 -- the largest such effort in the Communist state 's 61-year history , the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Sunday . The last 149 of those evacuees touched down in Shanghai late Saturday , having arrived back in China after a stop in Malta , according a statement from China 's foreign ministry . Beijing coordinated evacuations using 91 China-based charter flights , 35 rental charter flights from non-Chinese airlines , 12 flights on military airplanes , 11 non-Chinese passenger ships , five cargo ferries and one escort ship , in addition to 100 bus runs , Xinhua reports . But people from other countries , including Egyptians and Bangladeshis , have been left to fend for themselves . Kayal said Saturday more than 10,000 Bangladeshis are awaiting transport in Tunisia . Many of them have had to walk to the border because their money was stolen by soldiers and they could not pay for transportation costs . One man suffered a heart attack and died , aid officials confirmed . On Sunday , the British government said it would provide emergency evacuation flights to repatriate 500 stranded Bangladeshis . Three commercial charter planes will take the Bangladeshis home from Djerba airport later Sunday , the British government said . `` I have seen for myself the scale of the humanitarian situation on the Libyan border with Tunisia , '' said Andrew Mitchell , the international development secretary . `` I vowed that we would do everything possible to give those stranded shelter and get them back home as quickly as possible . '' Meanwhile , three people died and 14 were missing when they tried to get off a ship headed from Libya 's capital , Tripoli , to Crete , the Greek Ministry for the Protection of Civilians said Sunday . The ship -- flying under Cyprus ' flag -- was carrying about 1,280 passengers , mostly Bangladeshis . The ministry said passengers were killed or went missing as they were trying to get off the ship using a rope . Nigeria 's National Emergency Management Agency announced Sunday that 1,243 Nigerians `` who had been stranded in Tripoli '' arrived in Nigeria . In total , nearly 2,300 Nigerians have been evacuated , the agency 's director general , Muhammad Sani-Sidi , said in a statement . The operation has involved large chartered planes and commercial aircraft , the statement said . The violence in Libya has generated an exodus from the north African nation . Almost 200,000 people , a majority of them foreign workers , have fled Libya -- nearly 100,000 to Tunisia and a similar number to Egypt -- according to the United Nations refugee agency . The numbers of people entering Tunisia daily from Libya dropped to 1,800 Thursday and Friday and stood at 3,000 Saturday . Previously , they averaged 10,000 to 15,000 people . Hovig Etyemezian , a field officer for the U.N. refugee agency , attributed the drop in part to fear and the manipulation of the flow of refugees by Libyan authorities . `` A lot of them were scared from leaving because of the fighting , so they were staying in their houses , '' he said Saturday . `` We fear the regime might be blocking refugees from the border . '' The U.S. State Department said Saturday it would donate $ 3 million to the International Organization for Migration as part of a partnership to help thousands of Egyptians and other nationals from Africa , South Asia and Southeast Asia get home .

U.S. gasoline prices increased nearly 33 cents in two weeks , the second-biggest two-week jump in the history of the gasoline market , according to a new survey of filling stations . The latest Lundberg Survey of cities in the continental United States was conducted Friday . It showed the national average for a price of self-serve unleaded gasoline at $ 3.51 , an increase of 32.7 cents from the last survey two weeks earlier , survey publisher Trilby Lundberg said . The jump was the biggest since a 38-cent hike between August and September 2005 . At the time , the price increase was driven by damage caused by Hurricane Katrina . `` This time around , the spike comes not from nature , but from people , '' Lundberg said . `` The armed struggle in Libya has shocked international oil markets and here it is at the pump . '' As the fighting between opposition forces and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's troops begins to look more like a civil war , expect prices to continue to rise , she said . Prices have risen nearly 82 cents since September 2010 , the survey found . While Libya is not among the top suppliers of U.S. oil , and only 3 % of Libyan oil exports head to the United States , global economics link the events there to the pumps at home . Libya produces a light , high-gravity crude oil that is most in demand by less complex refineries around the world , Lundberg said . As this oil becomes unavailable , it forces buyers of crude to substitute crude with similar properties from other oil producers , thereby increasing demand and starting a chain reaction that raises prices of crude and gasoline in the United States . The current average price of $ 3.51 is 61 cents below the all-time high price recorded in July 2008 . Today 's price is 78 cents higher than a year ago , Lundberg said . On a side note , Lundberg noted that the rising gas prices could dampen the nation 's economic recovery . Gas demand -- one of the reflections of the American economy -- has been growing at a rate of 1 % , she said . `` Higher prices today are certainly capable of halting that gasoline demand growth , which would reflect bad news in the economy , '' she said . The Lundberg Survey sampled prices at about 2,500 gas stations . Of the cities surveyed , the highest average price in the continental United States was in San Diego at $ 3.87 per gallon . The lowest price was in Billings , Montana , at $ 3.15 . California has garnered headlines lately for its high gas prices , though the average price in the state remained below $ 4 , at $ 3.83 per gallon for regular gas . The average California price for premium does break that barrier , at $ 4.04 per gallon .

Using machine guns , sticks and anything else they could find , crowds protected the courthouse , serving as an operations center by the opposition in Misrata , and successfully repelled Gadhafi militias armed with tanks and heavy artillery , the witness said . `` The will and the determination and dedication that people are showing here on the ground , it just makes you speechless , '' he said . A doctor at Central Misrata Hospital said 42 people were killed -- 17 from the opposition and 25 from the pro-Gadhafi forces -- and that 85 people were wounded in the fighting , which continued on the city 's outskirts . The youngest victim , 3 years old , was killed by direct fire , the doctor said . Witnesses and other sources are not being named for their own safety . Humanitarian and medical aid to the central Libyan city has been blocked , U.N. emergency relief coordinator Valerie Amos said in a statement Sunday . She urged authorities `` to provide access without delay to allow aid workers to help save lives .

The opposition also worked to keep control of Ras Lanuf . Thousands trying to leave Libya Opposition at work in Benghazi The young and inexperienced go to war The battles came in stark contrast to the image Gadhafi 's regime sought to portray in the capital , Tripoli . Throngs filled Green Square , cheering their support of Gadhafi , with some insisting they were celebrating the government 's victory in Misrata . A government official said Gadhafi 's regime was victorious in Ras Lanuf and in Zawiya , as well . CNN was not allowed to enter Zawiya on Sunday , and could not reach people inside the city . Reports said communications had been cut off . Libyan state TV also claimed that the government had gained control of the eastern port city of Tobruk . `` Morning victory , oh people of Libya . Victory city of Tobruk from terrorist gangs , '' the station said . Witnesses in Tobruk , though , said it was still under opposition control . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon talked Sunday morning with Libyan Foreign Minister Musa Kasa , appealing for an end to hostilities and discussing `` the increasingly troubling humanitarian situation , '' according to a statement from his office . The release criticized Gadhafi 's government for what it called `` disproportionate use of force and indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets . '' After reports of the opposition successfully fighting off pro-Gadhafi forces in Misrata , Libyan state TV showed a graphic -- in both Arabic and English -- saying that `` strict orders have been issued to the armed forces not to enter cities taken by terrorist gangs , who took civilians as human shields and threatened to slaughter the inhabitants of those cities . '' The report cited `` military sources , '' and said those cities `` are being circled by the armed forces except those neighborhoods where the terrorist gangs have sought refuge . '' While the pro-Gadhafi rally in Tripoli was crowded and boisterous -- including the sounds of car horns and celebratory gunfire -- such demonstrations do not offer a clear sign of how much support the 68-year-old leader actually has . Throughout the uprising , which began February 15 , witnesses in Tripoli have described the government using all sorts of methods to drum up crowds , including forcibly dragging people to them , while keeping anti-Gadhafi demonstrators off the streets . On Sunday , police forces searched cars to try to ensure that no anti-Gadhafi protesters were out on the streets , though some still managed to venture out , a witness said . Traces of bullets and blood could be seen in some districts near Tripoli 's Green Square , and people were mopping the streets and cleaning the walls , the witness said . On Saturday , opposition forces had claimed two major successes : preventing pro-government forces from taking Zawiya and capturing Ras Lanuf along the coast . Opposition forces in eastern Libya briefly detained a group of British special forces . The group was let go Sunday , British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement . `` I can confirm that a small British diplomatic team has been in Benghazi . The team went to Libya to initiate contacts with the opposition . They experienced difficulties , which have now been satisfactorily resolved . They have now left Libya , '' Hague said in a statement . `` We intend , in consultation with the opposition , to send a further team to strengthen our dialogue in due course . This diplomatic effort is part of the UK 's wider work on Libya , including our ongoing humanitarian support . We continue to press for Gadhafi to step down and we will work with the international community to support the legitimate ambitions of the Libyan people . '' The strife engulfing the north African nation is reverberating across the country , the region and the world . Death toll estimates range from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000 , and the international community has been pondering strategies on how to end the violence and remove the Gadhafi regime . The protesters are seeking the ouster of Gadhafi after nearly 42 years of ruling the country -- the kind of revolution that was seen in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt . But unlike in those countries , the uprising has turned into warfare . Benjamin Barber , a fellow at the New York-based Demos think tank who had worked closely with the Gadhafi Foundation , told CNN 's Fareed Zakaria that he felt Gadhafi , his son Saif and their supporters would likely `` fight to the death '' -- meaning a prolonged war , compared to the relatively quick and peaceful political transition that happened in Egypt and Tunisia . Even if Gadhafi is somehow ousted , Barber predicted the violence could continue as tribes duke it out for supremacy in a nation that has few significant public institutions that could fill a potentially chaotic void . Gadhafi 's government has been reviled across the globe for violence against civilians , and the International Criminal Court has launched an investigation of Gadhafi , some of his sons and other leaders for possible crimes against humanity . Opposition-controlled radio announced Saturday that the country 's sole legitimate representative was now the National Transitional Council , a group with 31 representatives for most of the regions in Libya . The council held its first meeting Saturday in the eastern city of Benghazi . It called Benghazi its temporary location until the `` liberation '' of the capital , according to a decree the council issued . Former Justice Minister Mustafa Abdeljeleel , whom the council said had tried to resign from Gadhafi 's government several times , was announced as the council 's new leader .

The eight M16 officers and SAS soldiers were arrested then deported after only two days in the country . The prime minister 's official spokesman was reluctant to reveal details , partly due to the involvement of special forces , but told a briefing Hague had approved the operation `` in the normal way '' .

'' Menzies Campbell , a former opposition leader from the Liberal Democrats , called the mission `` ill-conceived , poorly planned and embarrassingly executed . '' But that 's just rhetoric at the Commons . It 's part of the usual thrust and parry of British politics , and it 's internal . The real embarrassment for Britain was played out across TV screens in Tripoli . Here 's what happened : 10 Downing Street 's man in Libya was called in to explain what the `` diplomats '' were doing in eastern Libya . British Ambassador Richard Northern spoke to a rebel leader to explain the mission . And , you guessed it , the call was intercepted by Gadhafi 's regime and duly found its way to Libyan state television on Sunday . Now all of Libya will have a very different take on James Bond . The whole fiasco makes it ever more important for countries to think very carefully before they engage with Libya . There 's also the question of who you 're dealing with in Libya -- Gadhafi himself , or the varied opposition groups that are rising up in arms ? And how will they respond ? As U.S. Defense Secretary Gates testified at a House hearing last week , discussing no-fly zones without fully understanding the repercussions is just '' loose talk . '' The British military like ours have absolutely no business in Libya except for humanitarian purposes . We need to stay out of Libya 's civil war and stop instigating the insurrection there and let the chips fall where they may . March 7 , 2011 at 9:29 pm | Reply Actually , I believe you will find that as fighting began to break out it was the Royal Navy -LRB- part of the British military -RRB- Which rescued Us citizens living in Libya , as well as British , French and other foreign nationals , or do you think the UK left US citizens to become collateral damage ? Of course it might be the ` business ' of a different country to rescue our people ? March 9 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | Reply Who can rule out Al Quida , Jehad or other Muslim Fundamentalists behind Libya Freedom Fighters Movement ? col Gadhafi was fighting against those forces otherwise Libya already may be Muslim fundamentalist country ! What is better for Libyan people is better for world . I think Libyan people like Gadhafi over Muslim Fundamentalist Regime . So Libyan issue is complex thing which need to handle very carefully without allowing any blood bath there . March 19 , 2011 at 12:21 pm | Reply To the Editor , CNN March 7 2011 There is an ongoing debate and Republican Party pressure on Pres. Obama to intervene militarily on the side of the Rebels in Libya . Another suggestion is to create a No-Fly zone . Defense Secretary Gates has rightly labeled this as ` Loose Talk ' . In case US acts without concurrence and active participation of the World Powers and without a UN Security Council Resolution backing such action , and if Gaddafi survives the rebellion , we will have created a problem for the world as Libya exports 12 % of the worlds petroleum exports . And our military participation on the Libyan Rebels side might create expectations in the other democratic\\/rebel movements in the Middle East . Libya is not our business plain and simple , the Libyans must engage in their own self-determination efforts as bloody as it may become . The Republicans will just need to chill on this latest opportinity to engage in war-profiteering for their favored corporate interests , our goverment needs to spend money on people , infrastructure , research and development here at home .

March 19 , 2011 at 12:28 pm | March 8 , 2011 at 9:21 am | Reply The USA is still the worlds strongest economy , much like the UK before WW2 . China is growing , very strong economy , like the USA before WW2 . Before WW2 Great Britain was the worlds richest country , and spent all of its wealth -LRB- and lost its empire -RRB- during the war . The United States an upcoming great power did not get involved in the war for two years , preferring to sell arms to the UK , in order to make money . In fact it took a direct assault an US sovereign territory to provoke the nation to fight , rather than turn a profit . Asking China to get involved is ridiculous , if the USA is allowed to profit from a war -LRB- a slightly more important one in terms of human rights and world peace -RRB- , why not China ? After WW2 The United States was the only major participant to have made a profit , largely by sitting on the side and letting British , Soviet , and free European soldiers do the fighting . These days the USA posses the worlds largest armed forces and strongest national economy , like the British Empire before WW2 , why cant the USA make a stand and fight against Libya , like Britain against The third Reich , after all , Libya is n't as powerful a country as Nazi Germany was is it ? Or is the US government still afraid to fight the bad guys ? March 9 , 2011 at 6:24 pm | Reply Now that 's just BS . We saved your a $ $ es from getting kicked by the Nazis . No matter how long it took us to get into the war , its obvious that we were the ones who helped the most to end it . March 10 , 2011 at 9:13 am | Best solution is to send multinational peace keeping troups after permanent cease fire . China , Russia , India , Germany and others will support it . But UK , France & USA want to see blood in Libya like allied forces killed thousands of civilians by areial bombardments ! Civilized world should not allow this to happen again in any country . Gadhafi is Dictator but he is better than Islamic Fundamentalists . World can foce Gadhafi to go for democratic reforms which they have signalled to do in the future . Majority Libyan people like to see Gadhafi become prodemocratic than to power is transfer to Islamic Fundamentalists ! So it is complex issue . March 19 , 2011 at 12:38 pm | The British SAS was conducting `` special operations '' in Basra , Iraq a few years ago . They dressed up as Arabs and were shooting at a police station . They got arrested for doing this and then the British sent in tanks to `` rescue '' them from jail . I wonder what sort of hijinks they had planned for Libya ?

CNN 's Nic Robertson reports that fighting is getting closer to the Libyan capital of Tripoli . Also Monday , as several families in Ras Lanuf fled for cover , Gadhafi 's forces made headway in the city of Bin Jawad , which was hotly fought over during the weekend . Anti-government protesters have been rallying for weeks in the hopes that Gadhafi , who has ruled the country for 42 years , will leave power . Similar uprisings occurred earlier this year in Egypt and Tunisia , and other protests have raged throughout the Middle East and North Africa as demonstrators have called for changes in leadership and power structures in their countries .

CNN 's Ben Wedeman recounts moments before , after air strikes in area of Ras Lanuf , Libya Wedeman : Journalists in hotel awakened early Monday amid fear of government attack CNN crew drove within eyesight of what probably was Libyan army Editor 's note : CNN 's Ben Wedeman filed this first-person account of the scene in rebel-controlled Ras Lanuf , Libya , as Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's forces prepared to launch an aerial strike against the town Monday . Ras Lanuf , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` Down ! the man at my hotel room door said . It was 4:30 a.m. Monday in Ras Lanuf , and I had hoped to get a decent night 's sleep for the first time in weeks . Yet again , my hopes were dashed . Through the haze of sleep deprivation and exhaustion , I could say nothing . The staff of the Fadeel Hotel was going from room to room , telling guests -- journalists only -- that they had to leave , at once . I quickly dressed , packed my bag , and went downstairs . It was still pitch black outside , and the lobby was teeming with still photographers , cameramen , translators , fixers , producers and print and TV reporters , all trying to understand why the urgent need to leave . Libya conflict moves closer to capital The young and inexperienced go to war Opposition at work in Benghazi Thousands trying to leave Libya There were plenty of rumors , and no facts . Gadhafi is using poison gas ! '' one of the fighters told me . `` The army is coming here , they 'll be here soon , '' said another . `` You must go now , '' the hotel manager told me . `` It 's not safe in Ras Lanuf . '' The television in the lobby was tuned to the Arabic satellite news channel Al-Arabiya , which was flashing that Libyan government forces had taken up defensive positions around Ras Lanuf , which had been taken over by anti-Qaddafi rebels two days before . The rebels had advanced beyond Ras Lanuf , by about 30 kilometers , to the town of Bin Jawad , but were pushed out within hours . Their advance westward , begun in the refinery town of Al-Brega , had come to a screeching halt . And now it was beginning to look as if the tide was turning . As we waited in the lobby , I had visions of the Libyan army pulling up outside the hotel , rounding us all up and taking us back to Tripoli , hands bound and blindfolded , to be put on trial . Libyan state television had announced that all journalists who had entered the country from Egypt without visas would be considered outlaws and , worse , collaborators with al Qaeda . As the first Western television journalist to enter Libya from Egypt during the current crisis , I had reliable information I was high on Tripoli 's wanted list . I watched as the Ras Lanuf press corps bundled into cars , or onto the back of pickup trucks , and drove away in the dark . We decided to wait until first light before moving . In the meantime , the hotel staff was removing the big flat-screen TV in the lobby , and desktop computers and printers from behind the reception desk and back offices . After the other journalists had left , the cleaning staff -- migrant workers from Bangladesh -- cleared away dozens of paper coffee cups , mopped the floor and emptied ashtrays overflowing with the butts of dozens of jumpy journalists . When it became light , instead of going east -- away from the supposedly advancing Libyan army -- we and a crew from the BBC went west , toward Bin Jawad , to see if there was any truth to the claims Gadhafi 's men were on the move . Libya witness : Rockets on the ground Searching the Gadhafi family tree We drove slowly , stopping regularly to survey the terrain , to ask any fighters along the way about what they had seen and what they knew about the front lines . The few we met assured us the government forces were still on the outskirts of Bin Jawad and were n't moving forward . It was disconcerting , however , that as we continued to drive , there was almost no one to speak with . The usual gatherings of boisterous , friendly rebel fighters gathered around cars , pickup trucks and Chinese - and Soviet-made anti-aircraft guns were nowhere to be seen . The road was almost empty . We stopped one last time about five kilometers east of Bin Jawad . Three kilometers away we could see something blocking the road . The BBC crew , who had a bigger and better camera , went a bit further to get a better look , but after about five minutes came racing back , lights flashing . Meanwhile , we heard a jet overhead . We 'd had two close misses with bombs a few days before , so we jumped to the side of the road , ready to lie flat in the sand in case they bombed again . In the distance we heard the loud , hollow pop of anti-aircraft fire . The plane flew in a wide arch twice above us , but dropped no bombs . When it flew on , we regrouped with the BBC crew , who recounted that while videotaping down the road , a shot had been fired over their heads . The cameraman said he saw in his viewfinder vehicles pointing east toward Ras Lanuf , and men who were all wearing identical uniforms . That did n't sound like the motley opposition forces . And if they had been opposition forces , they would have opened fire with everything they had on the jet above . But they did n't . In other words , those dots down the road were probably soldiers from the Libyan Army . Driving back toward Ras Lanuf , we saw a huge plume of black smoke and brown dust a few kilometers up ahead . Libyan Air Force jets were attempting to bomb rebel targets again . It was just one of many such air strikes in the area Monday . Along the main Benghazi-Tripoli road that skirts Ras Lanuf , we found groups of opposition fighters chanting and joking about Gadhafi `` the dog , '' Gadhafi `` the donkey , '' but it was beginning to all ring hollow . There seemed to be less of them about , and fewer and fewer appeared to be moving to the front . We returned to the hotel in mid-afternoon . It was open again , but the staff had fled . The new `` staff '' was comprised of men and teenagers with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades . They were going from room to room , turning on the TVs , using the bathrooms , calling to their friends from the balconies . In the parking lot outside , they regularly fired rounds from their automatic weapons . Although I did n't see it , a print reporter friend told me they had spent much of the afternoon smoking hashish . To borrow a line from one of my old scripts , `` morale is high , and so are the troops . '' In the coffee shop , more fighters were crowded behind the bar , helping themselves to whatever was available , handing out bowls of cornflakes with milk and chocolate syrup . Pickup trucks had pulled up in front of the hotel , and they were loading them with food and crockery from the kitchen . Theoretically , I suppose , they were commandeering supplies for opposition forces in the area . All the while , they were eager to reassure the few journalists who had returned in the hopes of spending another night in the Fadeel Hotel that all was well , that they would be safe , that they would sleep soundly . The more insistent their reassurances , however , the more tenuous the prospect of a night at the hotel became . The thought of stoned adolescents armed to the teeth stumbling around the halls at night , in addition to the very real possibility of a nighttime assault by the Libyan army on Ras Lanuf , was more than even the most battle-hardened war correspondents cared to ponder . The CNN crew was among the last guests to leave the hotel just after sunset . There was no need to settle the bill or return the keys .

Gadhafi 's forces seemed to make headway in the city of Bin Jawad , where the Libyan army appeared to have control Monday after fighting over the weekend . But in Zawiya -- a city that the government insisted it had retaken -- the opposition still appeared to control the city center , and fighting was under way Monday . CNN saw pro-Gadhafi forces moving through the city , small arms fire , anti-aircraft gunfire and artillery . As the Libyan military brought in reinforcements , CNN could see about 150 troops moving into the city . Libya witness : Rockets on the ground Searching the Gadhafi family tree Anti-government protesters are seeking the ouster of the 68-year-old Gadhafi after nearly 42 years of ruling the country -- the kind of revolution that was seen in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt . But unlike in those countries , the Libyan uprising has turned into warfare . Libya 's foreign minister dug in Monday , saying the international community does not understand what is happening in Libya and accusing certain Western countries of helping divide the African nation . `` It is clear now the U.K. and the U.S. are getting in touch with the defected -LRB- people -RRB- in the East , '' Foreign Minister Musa Kasa told reporters . `` This means a conspiracy to divide , partition the country . '' `` It is clear these super powers are undertaking a plot against Libya , '' he added . Though rebel groups are long on passion , many are short on military training . CNN 's Ben Wedeman , just outside Ras Lanouf , heard someone say , `` We 'll capture -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- , put him on top of this car and drive all around Libya . Every Libyan will get one shot . '' A special forces captain told Wedeman he is trying to teach volunteers `` it 's impossible to attack artillery with a Kalishnikov '' rifle . Foreign Secretary Hague , speaking to Britain 's Parliament , said that in the Libyan capital , Tripoli , `` there have been disturbing reports of hostage taking and large military deployments around the city designed to consolidate Gadhafi 's position and intimidate his opponents . His forces remain in control of Tripoli , Sebha and Sirte ; but his authority is contested in large swathes of the country where local tribes have withdrawn their support . There is a clear risk of protracted conflict and an extremely dangerous and volatile situation in large parts of the country . '' With no clear end to the deadly clashes in sight , U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed a new special envoy to Libya to discuss the crisis with officials in Tripoli , the United Nations said in a statement Monday . `` The secretary-general is deeply concerned about the fighting in western Libya , which is claiming large numbers of lives and threatens even more carnage in the days ahead , '' read the U.N. statement . `` He notes that civilians are bearing the brunt of the violence , and calls for an immediate halt to the government 's disproportionate use of force and indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets . '' Death toll estimates have ranged from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000 , and the international community has been pondering strategies on how to end the violence and remove the Gadhafi regime . The fierce fighting has also sparked the flight of Libyans and foreigners out of Libya , with nations across the globe scrambling to help people leave . About 200,000 people have fled Libya with nearly equal numbers going to Tunisia and Egypt , the U.N. refugee agency has said . But not everyone has been able to get out . Between 15,000 and 17,000 people are still at a refugee camp near the Libya-Tunisia border . Of those left , the majority are from Bangladesh , the U.N. refugee agency said . The group plans to start running chartered flights to there Tuesday . President Obama authorized Monday sending up to $ 15 million in humanitarian aid to Libya out of the United States Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund . Humanitarian and medical aid to Misrata , in central Libya , has been blocked , U.N. emergency relief coordinator Valerie Amos said in a statement Sunday . She urged authorities `` to provide access without delay to allow aid workers to help save lives . '' After reports of the opposition successfully fighting off pro-Gadhafi forces in Misrata on Sunday , Libyan state TV showed a graphic -- in both Arabic and English -- saying that `` strict orders have been issued to the armed forces not to enter cities taken by terrorist gangs , who took civilians as human shields and threatened to slaughter the inhabitants of those cities . '' The report cited `` military sources . '' There have been numerous conflicting reports over who controlled what cities , with the government declaring victory in some cities while witnesses in those cities told CNN the opposition was still in control .

Sudanese tell U.N. refugee agency of rape and forced removals The agency is `` alarmed '' by the accounts Thousands of migrants remain at Tunisian and Egyptian borders The U.N. is able to truck emergency food into eastern Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United Nations refugee agency reported disturbing accounts of violence and persecution of sub-Saharan Africans within Libya Tuesday , urging a recognition of their particular vulnerability in the midst of civil war . A group of Sudanese who arrived in Egypt from eastern Libya told representatives of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees -LRB- UNHCR -RRB- that armed Libyans were going to door to door , forcing people from sub-Saharan countries to leave . They also reported the rape of a 12-year-old Sudanese girl and said many of their documents had been confiscated or destroyed . Spokesman Adrian Edwards said the agency was alarmed by such accounts , increasing in number as the situation in Libya intensifies . Sub-Saharan Africans came under attack after reports that strongman Moammar Gadhafi had recruited them to serve as mercenaries . Libya 's war has forced out 215,000 people , many of them poor migrant workers who have been stranded at both the Tunisian and Egyptian borders . The refugee agency has been working with the International Organization of Migration -LRB- IOM -RRB- to evacuate people , many of whom have been spending cold nights under the stars and with very little to eat . Others have been sheltered in cramped , unsanitary conditions . The IOM said it was accelerating repatriation of Bangladeshis , who remain stranded by the thousands on both borders with Libya . The agency said it will need at least 20 more chartered flights to evacuate Bangladeshis remaining on the Egyptian border alone . A Bangladeshi man died over the weekend after a fight over food distribution at the Egyptian border , the UNHCR staff reported . They said many of the 3,500 Bangladeshis at that border have been waiting for up to 10 days for transportation and are becoming increasingly agitated . Fewer people are crossing over from Libya into Tunisia , a drop the UNHCR said coincided with intensified fighting in western Libya . Those fleeing have described risky travel conditions and numerous roadblocks . As the fighting escalates in Libya , many are in dire need of help just to survive , U.N. agencies said . The U.N. World Food Programme said a convoy of its trucks was able to enter eastern Libya and was due to arrive in Benghazi some time Tuesday . The convoy , carrying high-energy date bars , was part of a $ 39.2 million emergency operation intended to provide food to more than one million people in Libya , Egypt and Tunisia over a three-month period . CNN 's Moni Basu contributed to this report . "}, {"uid": "340", "dct": "2011-03-08", "dates": [null, null], "text": "When it comes to Libya , the United States is in a very tough spot . Not as tough a spot as the Libyan people are in by any means but difficult nonetheless . We are mostly hated in that part of the world . And rushing to the aid of the Libyan rebels trying to overthrow Gadhafi would be played up on the Arab street as the United States again interfering in a Muslim nation 's internal affairs . On the other hand , it 's in our national DNA to want to come to the aid of people who are struggling to gain their freedom . Plus there is all that oil , of course , but that 's a much more cynical view . People are laying down their lives trying to get out from under the yoke of arguably one of the world 's most brutal dictators . We have the military wherewithal to make their struggle a lot easier , but so far we have n't done that . Here s my question to you : When it comes to Libya , what s the right thing for the U.S. to do ? Interested to know which ones made it on air ? Kent in New Castle , Indiana : I sympathize greatly with the Libyan people trying to gain freedom , but I strongly feel we have to learn that we can not direct the destiny of every country in turmoil . I think we should let them solve their own problems unless a strong majority in the UN supports intervention . The U.S. should not carry the burden of the efforts . The U.S. should definitely maintain a humanitarian effort but we need to keep our troops out . It 's not our fight and by stepping in , we take the news away from the Libyan people and suddenly it 's our story . I 'm afraid history will be critical of our inaction . No , we should n't send troops , however , we should supply small arms , a no fly zone , food and medical supplies . If we believe in freedom of the people we should help the people and make a better name for ourselves in the region . We help every one else , why not them ? The right thing is to create and enforce a No Fly Zone in Libya . It can be done quickly and effectively with the forces already in the area . It effectively evens the field and will quicken Gadhafi 's departure as the Military will have more defections as they see their major advantage go away . The key for us with the Muslim world is to immediately withdraw the strategy when the fight is settled . Stay offshore , off the holy land and leave when it 's done . If we do not stand for freedom , then why have so many Americans died in Europe , Korea , Vietnam , and the Middle East ? Is our government s decision to fight for freedom based on oil , money , or a principle ? I think that the biggest problem in this country is that America thinks about the problems of other countries before our own . What will it take for the ruling powers in our own country to put the U.S. , first ? This nation has enough problems already that we need to deal with now . The right thing to do is give the protesters weapons and leave American troops out of it . March 8 , 2011 at 5:41 pm | The Lybian people have to win their own revolution . We should help with humanitarian aid , keep the media on Ghadaffi as protection of his people , and agree to abide by whatever the united nations decides to do . March 8 , 2011 at 5:49 pm | I wonder what Reagan would do ? We know what he would have done because he did it before . And , as a result we got a look at Gadhafi 's true character . No I think a coward is more fitting . I believe we take out his air defense , gun ships and send a cruse into his tent , and he 'll be gone . We then work with and support the new government . Other arab nations are nervous about us not supporting them , but they are more worried that the US has no stomach for standing up to what it supports . Bush put these governments on notice with the Freedom Agenda . Now we need to `` walk the talk '' . March 8 , 2011 at 5:53 pm | The US should participate in a plan agreed upon by the leaders of the world -- no more , no less . March 8 , 2011 at 5:57 pm | Stay out of it . Let the Arab nation fix there own problems . March 8 , 2011 at 5:58 pm | A no fly zone looks simple on paper ; however , in reality it means war on Libya . I recommend the US does not do anything until there is genocide of Libyan people in which the US should support the UN and all countries of Europe presenting a `` United Front '' That will give Qaddafi a clear message that the world will not tolerate his behaviors March 8 , 2011 at 5:59 pm | I think it 's very important that we do what we can remotely , by enforcing a no-fly zone and arming the rebels , without direct military engagement on the ground . We need to help level the playing field , but understand and respect the attitudes there about us . March 8 , 2011 at 6:00 pm | The right thing to do is stay out of it . Like you said , if we help , we create a bad reputation both for ourselves and for the Libyan opposition groups . No one will appreciate what we do , no matter what . And it 's not clear that the Libyan opposition wants a secular democracy anyway ... we 'd really look foolish if we spent the time , effort , money , and possibly lives to pave the way for a Hamas or Muslim Brotherhood kind of group to take over the country . March 8 , 2011 at 6:02 pm | We lost 68000 boys in Vietnam , for what ? We went into Iraq for What ? We armed the Afghans and called them freedom feighters against the Russians and now we call them insurgents . Let make war unprofitable and we will make them inpossible . To have our boys come back in boxes for Libya . -- Libya March 8 , 2011 at 6:04 pm | We have the military wherewithal to make their struggle a lot easier ? We still have n't managed to win in or extricate ourselves from Iraq or Afghanistan . What in the world makes you think we could get it right in Libya ? Get a clue , Jack . The right thing , indeed the ONLY thing for us to do with Libya is stay the Hell away and let the Libyans sort it out for themselves . We should declare was on the sucker like we should have during the bombing of our comercial airlines . It is high past time that we side on the people who oppose oppression . We need to stand on the side that is morally right for a change , not just the politically expedient . March 8 , 2011 at 6:10 pm | America is crumbling under a huge debt contracted with China to fuel 2 wars that are still going on , killed millions of Iraqis , Afgans , and our soldiers , maimed as many and displaced many more . We are fighting healhcare , cutting education , cutting social security budgets to our children , elderly and handicaps . . So we do n't have money for our people and we have money for another war ? . Do we really want another war on our hands ? March 8 , 2011 at 6:10 pm | help them , we help every one else , why not them March 8 , 2011 at 6:11 pm | No matter what we do , people will think it is wrong . March 8 , 2011 at 6:11 pm | Simple ! The U.S. has watched and worst still , aided Israel indulge in a genocide against the Palestinian People for 62 years . There 's no reason for us to `` leap '' into Libya on some `` trumped '' up moralistic justification or prod NATO into doing so . Where was all this concern for civilian deaths when the U.S. murdered six million Iraqi civilians in an invasion justified with lies and deceit and breaking of International Law ? We need to get past these unrealistic wars of capturing natural resources and deal with the corruption and inherent failures of capitalism which has itself failed the people of our nation time and again while assisting multinational corporations . March 8 , 2011 at 6:11 pm | We should let them take care of their own problems . If they need our help and ask us to step in , that 's one thing -- but stepping in without that could lead to disaster and yes , us being seen as poking our nose into other peoples ' business yet again . March 8 , 2011 at 6:11 pm | The United States should just stay out of it . Once again the American government is getting involved within the business of other nations . The best way to handle the situation is to let them solve it for themselves . The American civil war ended up creating a great nation , why not let Libyans have the chance to create a nation of their own or try and change certain aspects of their society they are fighting for ? The US should support morally first and demand that the United Nations act under the United Nations flag and help the Lybian people . We can not police the world anymore . March 8 , 2011 at 6:11 pm | Give the opposition some weapons to take out the tanks Let the opposition fight it out with the military . I think it may even be fair to say ... military does not have the right to use tanks to fight against their own citizens . Restrict or remove all tanks from Ghadaffi 's arsenal . March 8 , 2011 at 6:12 pm | I totally support the U.S not helping this situation ; helping this situation will breed hatred in the hearts of Qadaffi 's supporters . Eventually we might be looking at another terrorist attack in the future . March 8 , 2011 at 6:12 pm | Send our new best friends , the Egyptian Army , to support the Libyan rebels . Problem over in three days . March 8 , 2011 at 6:12 pm | It 's very easy , give them some anti-aircraft shoulder propelled missiles and some good anti-tank missiles . It was done in Afghanistan , and if you review the Lybian history they lost a war against Chad in the 80 's and the war was called the Toyota War , chad fighters in toyota 's with Milan anti-tank missiles beat the lybian army . Does n't really take a brain surgeon does it ? March 8 , 2011 at 6:12 pm | We should go in as a full military force . If it was 3 weeks ago , it would 've been interfering . But now , that the death toll is at least 1,000 . Gadhafi is slaughtering his own people ; we should just put an end to this nonsense now . March 8 , 2011 at 6:12 pm | Let Libyans take care of Libya . We ca n't get involved in all of the worlds civil wars . We are spread too thin worldwide anyway . help the protesters , put up the no-fly zone . are we going to sit back and watch another rwanda ? at the very least get them the weapons to help themselves ! March 8 , 2011 at 6:12 pm | Ask Americans can you raise their taxes to fund American intervention in Libya . Their silence will be your answer . March 8 , 2011 at 6:12 pm | Nothing . The USA has to stop being the Police of the World . Is n't that the reason we have the United Nations ? Let them deal with it . We have to start taking care of ourselves for once March 8 , 2011 at 6:12 pm | The US should do whatever the UN asks it to do . It is not up to the US to do anything , they are not the sherif of the Middle East . They are a PARTNER in the UN , and the UN should get off its DUFF and do something , and do it NOW ! March 8 , 2011 at 6:12 pm | First of all Jack , most Libyans do n't hate Americans . They want be be free like we are . We have many Libyan friends\\/family who have been free to travel in the US . We should stay out and let the UN take the lead . America is BROKE and If we hate them -LRB- Only the racists do -RRB- . Why would we save them ? to rescue the oil ? March 8 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | It 's time for us to stay out of the worlds problems . Let our friends in Europe handle this one , if they have the stomach for it . They always want us to stick our noses in and then they can blame us . March 8 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Ask our British and French and perhaps , the German allies , to do surgical air strikes on the Libyan air fields . This will keep their planes from flying and strafing the free Libya fighters . We can support the freedom fighters with arms and food , maybe surveillance Intel , but not with boots on the ground . This is a good fight , but it 's not our fight , unless we are asked for an assist , along with the UN . March 8 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Lets not procastinate regarding the Libya situation . The leader , Ghadafi , must be removed rapidly . It 's sad that the untrained , starving , young oppossition leaders are staking their lives to create a civil community . We , the US must intervene . If we dont , there will be much bloodshed and and further uncivil practices . March 8 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | We have to stay out . If there was no oil we would not care . The Ivory Coast had a valid election and the President lost but will not get out . He is killing the opposition . Where is the outcry to go in there and support democracy . No one cares when there is not benefit to us . March 8 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | We should invade Libya like we did Iraq & Afghanistan , tell the world it was for humanitarian reasons , and then tell the American Taxpayers that it is humanitarian to cut their SSA , Education , Food Stamps , Foreclose on their Homes , while the fat cats on wall street laugh all the way to the bank . I demand that the Congress show the American People how they are going to pay for any intervention in Libya before they act . Stay out of their business . Do we demand that Israel end the strife in their part of the world . Would we have accepted another nation involving themselves in our disagreements . How about the way we treated minorities in this country and having Europeans decided who was going to run this nation . Maybe the day will come when we stop sticking our noses into everything that happens elsewhere and start cleaning up what 's wrong here . March 8 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | The US should not get unto a hot war in Libya , but a no fly zone with our European allies might be the only way to help the Libyan people . March 8 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | Alan Stuart - Albuquerque , NM What should we do with regard to Libya ? Jack , let 's not get involved in this civil war . We are hated in that region and our involvement would only give fuel to the extremists and fundamentalists . Why ca n't the Arab countries like Saudi Arabia get more involved ? On the one hand they do n't want us there but when the brown stuff hits the fan they all wake up and cry for western help . No , no more wars . We 've done too much damage in that region . We ca n't afford it financially nor the potential loss of US and Nato lives . Oh , who was there to intervene in the US civil war ? March 8 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | hello jack i think the US should just not get too involve in the gaddafy govt . but if they want to they should instead help out the rebels who are poorly trained and no weaponds . March 8 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | March 8 , 2011 at 6:18 pm | We should give it some time and MIND OUR OWN BUSINESS . If their own people can not fix it , send in a sniper , WE TAXPAYERS are our of money to support another war signed . . March 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | Stay out of it ! Here we are worrying about our own government having a shut down along with a national debt that we will never get out of , and we 're going to give away more of our help ? If we 're not careful , we 're gonna end up in similar situations soon . Maybe not with our president , but with the government in general . March 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | I 'm afraid history will be critical of our inaction . No , we should n't send troops , however , we should supply small arms , a no fly zone , food and medical supplies . If we believein freedom of the people we should help the people and make a better name for ourselves in the region . March 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | The U.N. should be calling the shots in Libya , not the U.S. . We have gone it alone for too long and suffered the consequences . You 're right , it is a difficult position but let 's cut the crap . The U.S. can not do this unilaterally , this is no longer a hegemonic world . But the U.S. should participate . The problem is that we need tougher UN actions , multipolar ones , led by strong nations that say `` Hey , you 're on the wrong side of this issue and we 're not simply going to tolerate it . '' What we do n't want to do is provide a breeding ground for individuals who already feel hatred towards the West . That 's how you prevent your 9\\/11s . The United States is supposed to stand for liberty and freedom . At least those are the words we hear . We all need to remember that actions speak louder than words . Right now action is needed . By helping the people of Libya it does n't mean we have to take on another war . All we have to do is help stop the massacre with a no flight zone , and possibly teaching them how to use their weapons properly . We could even do more . But the major thing is to leave once we help them and let them finish on their own . Helping them does n't mean we are taking on another war . The countries you say that wo n't like us are n't going to like us no matter what we do . Many people today are questioning what the United States stands for -- maybe it 's time to show them . March 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | Why do n't we ask the Libyan revolutionaries if they want our help first ? If they do , we could use the 30 billion dollars in frozen assets to pay one of these mercenary armies like Blackwater -LRB- XI -RRB- to go to Libya to train and arm the revolutionaries ? That way we are n't acting unilaterally as a nation , but the Libyans will still get the military intervention . We 've been talking wisdom of using these mercenaries to fight our wars for a decade , and now we have a perfect situation to actually use them . Private mercenary army , rich middle eastern country , using mercenaries here is a no brainer . March 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | There is no easy answer here ... however it is obvious that at the very least the US and UK should pull together a coalition to destroy the Libyan Air Forces ability to operate at will . Secondly ... supply weapons , equip . etc. to the rebels thru `` sources '' . This will at least give the anti-qadaffi forces the ability to fight while the UN wastes talks it to death ... March 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | The Libyan rebels want a no-fly zone ... we should have already done that . How about an airstrike to take out Gaddafi ? Reagan bombed Libya in 1986 . What kind of message does not doing anything send to the people of Iran and North Korea ? Tell Europe to step up to the plate always first to criticize us -- well I think it 's time to step up . Do n't they get 85 % of there oil from Lybia ? The President should say it loud and clear '' your turn take care of this problem '' March 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | We should let them fight alone . In Lybia there is n't a peaceful protest . It is an all out war and we ca n't interfere and play in Khadafi 's favor . There is n't anything that the Reps want more , but for the US to get involved in an unneeded war like Iraq . Plus , we are broke !!!! March 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | Call me crazy , but was n't Americas current situation developed via a war against Britian to gain independence and then again a civil war to define what she is today ? Sure there was no air warfare , but the superior naval forces , organization and weaponry of the era against a bunch of upstart farmers and merchants does n't seem to be that much of a strech of the imagination . We should let the situation develop as it may , our military resources are depleted as it is , a growing national debt , and high unemployment . We have more important things to worry about . The talk of the oil is nonsense , Libya produces a drop in the bucket compared to the rest of the world and our good neighbors to the north have plenty of it . March 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | The U.S. should n't intervene now that there is a rebel force . Aiding rebel forces would fuel anti-American sentiment in the Middle-East . Unless innocent people are being killed , the risk of collateral damage is too great for the U.S. to get involved . Man it gets old always helping out people that usually hate us . Whenever someone starts acting up then we , the good old USA , are supposed to forget all they never do for us , and run and save them . Short memory too , huh Jack , seems like not too long ago we were duped into a weapons of mass destruction cry of wolf . I say let the Muslim world take care of their own . We have enough on our plate right now . Joe in PA March 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | The right thing is to create and enforce a No Fly Zone in Libya . It can be done quickly and effectively with the forces already in the area . It effectively evens the field and will quicken Gadhafi 's departure as the Military will have more defections as they see their major advantage go away . The key for us with the Muslim world is to immediately withdraw the strategy when the fight is settled . Stay offshore , off the holy land and leave when it 's done . March 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | Let 's go in , get Ghadafi , hand him over to the Libyan National Council , have him hand over the army to them , and ask them if they would like us to help them with anything else , if not , than we pull out . If they ask us to help stabilize their military , than lets leave about 300 officers to help train them . If they want help with improving their economy , than we should pay them to build , and have them run , a factory . This factory would produce a new tree growing device , inspired by bird poop . It helps trees collect water , and has an 80 % success rate at growing trees in the Sahara . Then they can make and sell these tree growing devices to other desert nations in their region . March 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | Keep out of it ! The U.S. should Let the Libians have there Civil War ! The U.S. is to blame for there crisis to begin with ! If it were not for the leak of highly sensitive secret documents to Wikileaks maybe all of this unrest and toppling of dictators would n't be happening ... and think about the American Civil War did any other Country intervene when America was being formed ? March 8 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | We should not do anything without the cooperation of other countries . If the protesters have the overt backing of the Americans alone , it will stoke the flames of anti-Americanism . We have to talk softly and provide the protesters with big `` sticks . '' March 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Please stop preaching involvement . Yes it is probably the best thing to do overall but once again USA and the West will be condemmed for it . If we do anything it must be the last time , lets get off the Oil depedence , lets get out of debt , lets give our kids a country to work with . Man , we are so quick to spend on all the things that benefit others but I would love to see most of the money benefiting the USA . P.S. -- I am a Canadian observer . March 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | I say the U.S should supply the rebels with food , weapons , fuel , and traning . Also set upa no-fly zone to protect them , but let them do the fighting . March 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Give the Libians the Only thing they are asking for , a No-Fly Zone !! After all said and done , we will look like we just plain do n't care if we do n't act now ! That should be the Only opinion we concern ourselves with !! March 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | As hard as it is to witness this atrocity , we have spent our military and political resources so poorly in the last two decades , that we are seen by most of the world as part of the problem and not as a contributor of solutions , we need sit on the bench and hang our heads in shame , because we stood by while old bush and little bush made unnecessary wars around the world and marginalized our ability to contribute effectively to world peace and prosperity . Maybe if we had listened to Dr King , who pointed out that being the world 's policeman , would make it impossible to achieve social justice in our own country , who the heck are we to be interfering all over the planet , when we have so many huge problems here at home ? Libyan need to worry about Libya and we need to worry about US . So stay out of it . March 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Not a thing . How about France step up to the plate ? Or , Spain , Canada , Mexico , etc. . . March 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | The right thing to do is for America to mind it 's own business . The states has screwed up in every conflict since the dawn of it 's Sure , you 've got lots of military muscle , but you lack in military brains . What about all those other African countries that have suffered far more than Lybia ? You know , South Africa , Somalia , Ivory Coast , etc. . . Oh ya , I forgot , those countries do n't have any oil ! March 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Offer him and his family 25 million dollars and a ticket to Venezuela and let Hugo take care them . March 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | The right thing for the United States to do is deploy military resources as part of an international humanitarian aid effort to provide basic medical supplies , food , and basic necessities for refugees fleeing the fighting at the borders of Tunisia and Egypt . March 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | The right thing to do is what we are doing presently : political pressure . Perhaps you 've heard of Robert Gates , who has indicated that the United States has limited capabilities in the region which would make it difficult to set up a no-fly zone quickly , others might be in a better position to help . The French I don t know what the British have in the area but the French and the Italians potentially , I suppose , could have some assets they could put in there quicker . We have a staggering deficit , 2 `` wars '' already in the middle east , budget cutting Tea Partiers screaming for slashing programs that invest in our own citizens , and crumbling infrastructure . Let the French and Italians carry the ball on this one . How about we invest in ourselves ? I ca n't remember any other countries getting involved in our own civil war ... March 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | We need to stand down . In this world of media explosion that documents everything 24\\/7 , it would be very easy to get caught up in the violence over there . but , we need to stay out of this one . Our own troops are pushed to their limit ... . and frankly , you ca n't spout deficit reduction and then get involved in another -LRB- losing -RRB- military situation . We should NOT be the world 's peacekeeper . And , in the Middle East , it is a dangerous proposition on a long term level . I feel sorry for the Libyan people and hope via NATO , we can provide some help . But , that 's it . They need to fall back , regroup and get some leadership ... and we can not do that for them . March 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Would n't it be wonderful if the US could save the world . Wake up , Jack -- we are broke and going the way of ancient Rome who had the hubris to over-extend itself with multiple wars resulting in its demise . How many more wars do you want the US to fight -- in addition to the already ridiculous ones we are involved in ? Where is the world community ? Where is the rest of the Arab world -- are they too busy praying 5 times a day -- before they cut off someone 's hand for stealing or stone women to death because of perceived sexual misconduct . Charity begins at home . Our country is suffering -- my son has been out of work for a year with two children to raise . He has good credentials but it looks like few possibilities in today 's jobless recovery . God help us all ! A worried senior citizen . March 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | I think we should sit back and let our European neighbors take the lead in Libya , which of course is tantamount to doing nothing . Are we sure Qaddafi is not an American citizen therefore can be prosecuted under American law , as he surely must be another offspring of Martin Sheen ? March 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Nothing will be done by our government or the British government to help the rebels for one simple reason . . BP will never allow it . After all the underhanded , undercover efforts by BP to get the Lockerbie bomber released to placate Gadhafi so they could gain greater access to Libya 's oil , they are undoubtedly telling all western governments NO. . We should , at the very least , provide a no-fly zone , and help the rebels with weapons and training , but BP knows if the rebels win , they LOSE ! Do n't expect Obama to do more than make speeches , and dither , hoping the situation , like the Gulf oil spill disaster , will resolve itself and relieve him from having to take any action . March 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | First of all Jack , most Libyans do n't hate Americans . They want be be free like we are . We have many Libyan friends\\/family who have been free to travel in the US . We should stay out and let the UN take the lead . March 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | We should stay on the sidelines and keep our soldiers out of harms way . There is no way we should be rushing to help anyone militarily because they are protesting or even fighting their current government . Maybe we should stop the ban on showing our military deaths . Then people would think twice before always wanting to send the US Military into harms way . We do pay for each and every military combat mission with more then just money . March 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Why not apply the same standard for Palestine ? US has to take into account how its action in other parts shows of the double standards it applies . Herein lies the hesitation for US action . Credibilty is the key March 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | Nothing . let them take care of their country . We have our problems to worry about . we are figthing two wars and you want a third one ? let them take care of themselves ! March 8 , 2011 at 6:20 pm | March 8 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | 1 . Support a NATO or Arab Nations Directed ` No Fly Zone ' . Provide humanitarian support as needed .3 . Absolutely no sending of military assets of any military ground force\\/support type . Enough blood has been spilt in the name of freedom -LRB- Oil -RRB- ? This is a classic case of damned if you do and damned if you do n't . I 've always thought of myself as a peace-nick . But when thousands of people are being slaughtered while fighting for their freedom , we should stop sitting on our hands in a committee and make some hard decisions toward getting them assistance and achieving their goal . I do n't think the U.S. should do this unilaterally , but we should openly support the cause of freedom and lean on other U.N. nations to come to the table and help get this conflict resolved before more Libyans die needlessly . March 8 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | Perhaps we should admit that it 's ok to be your brother 's keeper , perhaps we should all accept higher taxes and business owners should agree to do their very best for this economy in spite of higher taxes , and then perhaps we could afford to really help the people in Libya . March 8 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | The right thing for the US to do is stay out of the Middle East completely !!! Stay home and solve our own problems !! We need a no Cross zone on the Mexican boarder ! Stop the killing on our own boarder . Stop the killings in the cities across the US from gangs ! Stop the drugs that ruin peoples lives ! Get rid of all the self centered politicians that say they will do this and that and end up protecting their own interests instead of our ! etc !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 11 March 8 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | Ai n't my job Jack nor my responsibility . I am busy working & paying taxes . President Obama was elected to handle such things . What does he have to say about this turmoil that is hurting poor people & hurting the world 's economic recovery ?? Leadership is all about leading , not following the popularity polls . I think the US should step in , and help the Libyan people , because whatever the Obama administration may do to help the people of Libya , it wont come as close as the mess the Bush administration did in Iraq . So politically the Obama administration should be alright from that prospective . March 8 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | There needs to be an international coalition to take any military action . Morally speaking though we do need to try and get NATO to set up a no-fly zone . Unless we 're going to try to arrest Gadaffi for war crimes or the lockerby bombing , we need to let the Lybians fight it out on the ground . March 8 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | I think that the biggest problem in this country is that America thinks about the problems of other countries before our own . What will it take for the ruling powers in OUR OWN country to put US first ? This nation has enough problems already that we need to deal with NOW . March 8 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | It comes down to the issues here in the US . We have serious unemployment , Rising Petrol prices , Food prices and a two front war in the region . Can the US with our policies of Freedom resolve the Libyan conflict ? A swift multinational coalition is the answer . If Gadhaffi can not agree to the concerns of multi-national countries he needs to exit , and do the `` Baby Doc '' road , and go to Venezuela or another country that would have him . The US has to use serious considerations before taking Military action . March 8 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | Jack : It always looks easy from a distance and although we do n't have all the facts , it becomes increasingly difficult to listen to phrases like ... everything is on the table ... we are considering all the options and a hundred other different euphemisms . Do something that will prevent the slaughter of poorly armed , poorly trained people who are simply fighting for their freedom . While freedom lives in the hearts of all of us and has always done so , perhaps the United States has done the most to champion it , defend it and espouse it . Those who pursue it do so in great part because America has led the way . They need real help . March 8 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | How are we going to feel tomorrow , next week , next month when those fighting for democracy are being slaughtered every day as they wait for the world to come to their aid against a ruthless mentally disturbed dictator . It 's not as if we do n't know what 's happening - we 're standing by `` watching '' it happen . Maybe Thursday ??? - too late !!!!! One hour more ? March 8 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | The U.S. needs to refrain from overpowering influence . Let the Arab nations sort it out . This is the time for the U.S. to take the position of the supporting role vice the supported role . If the U.S. takes a lead role in trying to fix the issues of Libya , or any other Arab state with internal trouble , the U.S. will be blamed for everything that does not turn out right . It is time for the U.S. to speak quietly and carry a big stick . James March 8 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | The situation defines the concept of difficult . While the US must be more forceful , I have to wonder where is the rest of the world in the puzzle that depicts a proper response to Libya . Our range of responses is arguably limited by the `` ready , fire , aim '' approach of the `` Decider . '' We should be careful of what we wish for . Given Khadafi 's ruthless repression of meaningful infrastructure , what is the range of outcomes when , hopefully , Khadafi is banished ? March 8 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | You hit the nail on the head saying , `` It is in our DNA to want to help the Libians who are being oppressed by a brutal dictator '' . I have become a regular news junkie . I keep checking and checking , hoping to find that we have done something decisive to help them in their struggles . So far , it has been a lot of `` we are considering ... '' , blah , blah , blah . What we have been doing is sitting on our hands with our thumbs inconviently sticking up . March 8 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | Do we want to be perceived as a nation lacking compassion for those who are suffering and dying for a just cause ? The Libyan government obviously has no compassion when they even kidnap victims of their violence from hospitals to conceal what they have done . Do we want a post-revolution Libya that hates us because we could have helped them but did n't ? There are things we can do -- like a no-fly zone so rebel forces can move without being sitting ducks for air attacks , maybe arming rebels . Why do we have to wonder what the Libyan people are like ? Listen to those who lived there , like the American teacher , who says they are wonderful people . They deserve our help and it 's clearly in our long term interest to be their friends . March 8 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | I think its a doubled edged sword . On one side , we have that part of the world hates us and stepping in would further ignited reason to dislike us because of what we have already done in that part of the world . On the other hand our intensions are to give freedom to those who are oppressed . We have been the acting world police for decades . Now when its time to step up to the plate and practice what we have preached we can ?! . We have to step in . Its just the right thing to do ! March 8 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | I think NATO should engage in Libya and calm the stance of aggression and bring a government to life there that will bring a good quality of life to the citizens of libya . March 8 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | Jack , we claim to be the beacon of freedom . The reason we 're hated in that part of the world has little to do with religion , most ordinary citizens see us as siding with their dictators -- and seemingly reluctant to come to the aid of suffering masses . For fear of upsetting the despots that do our bidding ? Here 's a chance to finally be seen as siding with the people -- and what do we do ? Taking weeks to decide if we want to stop bloodshed . I think we should take as long time as possible , after Ghadafy has massacred his people into submission , the survivors will really love the United States for not coming to their aid . No , they wo n't remember how Clinton intervened in Bosnia to stop the massacre in Europe . They will really thank us for watching their children die as we debate what to do ! March 8 , 2011 at 6:22 pm | Our president said Gadhafi has to go ; however , no one is willing to do the no flying zone which is needed to help the Libyan people . I wish our pesident will act and not wait until Gadhafi kills more Libyans . March 8 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | First I am willing to pay 5.00 for gas here to help freedom in the Middle East and Africa . Gadhafi funds wars all over the world , so ending his rule helps the world and not just Lybia . Our President can not tell Gadhafi to step down and then do nothing . Why are we hated in the MIddle east -- maybe because we are only there for the Oil and money . What does the While House think -- if Gadhafi stays our companies can return and invest in the country ? There is a freedom movement in the middle east and we are behind the curve and seem to be backing all the wrong sides . Lets take some military action to help the freedom fighters we need to show up here -- I read some Arab group is asking for help I can not beleive we need an engraved inviation . If we want to change policy in the Middle Wast and how we are looked at we need to solve our oil issues at home and encourage and get invovled in freedom movements . This is our oppertunity to live up to our rhetoric of defending freedom . If the United States imposes a no fly zone countless lives would be saved , yet Libya would still be in the hands of Lybian people . We need to send the message that we stand by those who support freedom , not the dictators we allied with in the past like Mubarak . Thats why we are so hated in the reigon . Is there any way to find out whether the rebels in Libya want our help ? Is there a way to find out whether the people of Egypt and the people of Algeria think we should help their neighbor Libya ? Never mind the rest of the Arab world . If those North African nations think we should help , then we should DO IT right -- get rid of Gadhafi & his sons and get out ! Show those 3 nations that we merely want to stop the massacre of the Libyan people . Let them handle their freedom their way . March 8 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | H. Stouffer from Charles Town , WV , we can help them by using our aircraft to intercept Libyan aircraft which are intent on killing their own people . If we do not use our aircraft then we should not use any ground forces other than supplying rebel forces with anti-aircraft missles against pro-govt aircraft . Any U.S. aid should cease as soon as Gadhafi is eliminsated as the Libyan leader . March 8 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | We should be ashamed of ourselves to even talk about democracy . Thousands of Libyans and Egyptians were murdered by the dectators who were supported by the United States for the past thirty years and when people rose and ask to have democracy all we are doing is just talking about what we are going to do . People are being slutered today Mr. president not in the future . Perhaps a no fly zone is the least we can support . March 8 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | Same old , same old . Should we sit on our hands and do nothing because we 're afraid of how it will effect our image , or do the right thing . It 's a question of right and wrong , this is a no-brainer . March 8 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | The U.S needs to be careful in libya , but it also needs to help the people of libya in their plight for freedom . Just because there is a no fly-zone in affect over libyan air-space does n't mean that Gadhafi 's loyalists wo n't keep on taking back opposition controlled territory on the ground . I think its in America 's best interest to arm and train the rebels , if Gadhafi wins America has a whole new enemy in the middle east who 's as crazy as he is brutal . March 8 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | Im not American but I believe that America has to stand up for Libya My great great great grandfather was an American and I think if he could speak he would ask America to do what he had the to do when he followed General George Washington many yrs ago . . It 's freedom so we must follow the steps that our for fathers fought and died for Because our time might come and WHO WILL FIGHT FOR US ? March 8 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | hey jack , come on ... help the libyan people ... ... . ! obama needs 2 get off his butt and do something . its as easy as 1 2 3 ... . . March 8 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | The right thing to do is clear to everyone outside of the District of Columbia . We are for freedom of speech everywhere . We are for freedom from tyranny everywhere . Why is it that our leaders ca n't answer a question our elementary students can ? Not every situation is about whats cheaper or politically safe . Unalienable rights ... LIfe ... LIberty ... Pursuit of happiness . Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed ... does any of this ring a bell to anyone ? March 8 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | Paul Ernest Show Nashville , TN The US should not be staging any military presence in Africa , if she needs continued support fighting terrorism and other future interests . The secret is that African leaders have strong disdain against Western military intervention in Africa . They might appear supportive , but somewhere along the line , years to come , they will sabotage America 's interest , as punishment . Foreign interventions remind them of colonialism and quietly unite them . March 8 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | After fighting wars in Viet Nam , Irag , Afaganastan is n't it time we realize we should mind our business and focus on our own problems . We are not the world 's police force . Paul , Rochester , NY March 8 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | The US should stay out of it . Interfering in other countries only earns us hatred . It may be in American DNA to do something , but we should follow the advice of our Founding Fathers and NOT interfere in another country 's internal affairs . Besides , whatever the outcome in Libya , who 's to say they wo n't end up with worse than what they have now ? That wo n't buy us friends if we 're involved , as we were with Saddam , Bin Laden , and the list goes on ... The US needs to utilize its own internal energy and resources , before we can reach out to others or else we will continue to damage the future of our own country . March 8 , 2011 at 6:39 pm | What the United States should do for Libya is simple . We should provide the overdue detoxification treatment for Kaddafi in our Guantanamo recreational park as soon as possible . And to keep us safe at home , we should effectively block Bin Laden s hallucinogen from seeping into our Hollywood stars drinks . I have seen the effect of halucinogen in one of the star 's uncontrollable ranting lately . March 8 , 2011 at 6:39 pm | It 's way past time that we minded our own business . I would like to see no more aid to any country until all of our citizens who want to work have a job and medical care . As I see it , that will be never . March 8 , 2011 at 6:40 pm | The US is in a catch-22 situation and should only pursue solutions agreeable to all permanent members of the UN Security Council . One thing for sure , ground troops are out of question . The US might consider helping to arm the Libyan opposition only after thoroughly thinking through where some of those arms might end once Gaddafi is gone . March 8 , 2011 at 6:40 pm | It is a serious mistake for anybody to believe that Libya could not turn into another Afghanistan\\/Vietnam . Libya is much closer to that than it is to Iraq . Given our current situation the most we should consider taking the lead on is a no-fly-zone . That is a relatively contained activity that politically would not force us to get more deeply involved . Realistically if a truly serious assault on our country or one of our allies were to break out we would already be hard-pressed to fight a war against them . Much as the Libya situation is troubling -LRB- as are Sudan and other places -RRB- we have to start letting the UN be the world 's police force -LRB- which may involve us but does n't force us to make a permanent commitment -RRB- . We have bigger problems . March 8 , 2011 at 6:40 pm | Encourage NATO to establish a no-fly zone . Provide equipment and supplies to the rebels . Do not under any circumstances have a physical presence on the ground . Be prepared for a huge oil crisis . March 8 , 2011 at 6:40 pm | Let the French and Italians deal with this . They are the ones that have to worry about an extended disruption of supplies , not us . I do n't see them doing us any favors in Af\\/Pak . I do n't see them helping us with anything in fact . All I see is their citizens going to college for free , getting free health care , and getting extended periods of unemployment insurance all while existing under the American Security Umbrella that we pay for and they do n't . Make them stand up for themselves . March 8 , 2011 at 6:40 pm | Take the Ghadaffi 's out with a covert action , and at the same time launch air strikes to disable Gadaffi 's air force . If newsmen can get to Ghadaffi why ca n't a covert action get to him . We , meaning the U. S. , has supported dictators around the world and CorpRats have cuddled up to them . Now its time for the people to speak and take dictator Ghadaffi out . March 8 , 2011 at 6:40 pm | I am Arab , and I have been in the US for more than 30 years , and I ve never been more proud to be an Arab than I do right now . ALL Arab leaders are corrupt -LRB- may be not all , perhaps 99.99 % -RRB- . Ghadhafi is not any different , he must go , and we , the US MUST help the Libyans now . The Arab leaders have been covering their greed and their ill intentions under the slogan of We love Palestine . These leaders have always played that Palestinian card to blind-side the Arab masses and distract them from focusing on the crimes they re committing against their own people . We were able to bomb his very house before , why not now , the Arab people have always disagreed with EVERY US administrations throughout the years , I don t think this will be the one that broke the camel s back . US , please help the innocent , hopeless , and hungry-for freedom Libyans March 8 , 2011 at 6:41 pm | Gadhafi 's worst fear would be for the United States to get involved . But , what are we ? I am not sure any of us really know . We might spend billions of dollars helping some other country fight for its freedom , yet people in the United states are without jobs , losing their homes with little hope of getting back all they have lost . I feel for the the people that want freedom , but I would like to enjoy my freedom in the United States too . Just what we 're doing , working with the international community . This go it alone cowboy attitude of ours needs to fade into history . I 'm beginning to wonder with people like Gingrich wanted to go in with guns drawn , and Rep. King wanting McCarthy-like witch hunts if we , as humans , have progressed as far as we 're capable of going . March 8 , 2011 at 6:41 pm | Simply put ... let NATO level the airports and gadhafis headquarters in Tripoli . Then let Arab n African countries establish the no fly zone . This may be just what the `` free '' citizens of Libya need to advance to a victory . This then is still there fight ... we can help just enough to level the playing field . This will also send a message to other countries similar to Gadhafi that attacks on civilians will not go without consequences . It will also make it clear that other options will be considered and utilized besides embargo 's and financial restraints . March 8 , 2011 at 6:41 pm | What do you think would happen if a large group of people wanted the us government out of power and they took over a army base and handed out guns and bombs and said lets take over the government ? Do you the there would be a clash with the military of the govrenment and do n't you think people would die at the hands of the president in charge to save his power , and would that president than be charged for killing his own people HHMMMMMM i wonder ? maybe the us should mind its own biz and not always be first to police the world . looking from the outside Dan in CANADA March 8 , 2011 at 6:41 pm | Jack , it is a difficult question for sure , but as a mother with a daughter married to an Egyptian and two grandchildren living in Yemen , -LRB- which I believe is next in line to be toppled -RRB- I would hope the US would do what they could to save the slaughter of women and children who are ever present behind the pictures we watch every day . March 8 , 2011 at 6:42 pm | United states is not the only country in the world . We have created more problem and enemies to ourselves by bearing the world burden on our shoulder . What is the united Nations for ? This is not about Libya , is about the middle east . So the US should leaver them . The absolute worst thing for the US to do is to give the rebels weapons . This scenario has happened in the past , and history repeats itself . If we give them powerful weapons , and when the rebel government deicides , once they overthrow Qaddafi , that they are dead set against destroying the West , and we attempt to intervene , they will be fighting us with our own weapons -LRB- like Afghanistan -RRB- . The best solution is to sanction a no-flly zone over Libya and shoot down all of their planes with our weapons in our hands . March 8 , 2011 at 6:46 pm | We need to stay out , because if we ca n't afford it . Its time that we gave humanitarian aid to the American people . March 8 , 2011 at 6:48 pm | United States should wait until ordered by the UN to act . People must remember that USA are not the police of this world . Thats why United Nations was created . March 8 , 2011 at 6:48 pm | The right thing to do is to hold people accountable for war crimes . Obviously , we should hold our own war criminals accountable before we go looking outside our borders for others to hold accountable . March 8 , 2011 at 6:48 pm | March 8 , 2011 at 6:48 pm | We are not the world 's policeman . Look at the trouble we are in now because we think we are enough is enough . March 8 , 2011 at 6:49 pm | Jack , as a Canadian , I 'm just as thrilled about Canadians potentially being in a second war -LRB- and as we are part of NATO , we would be -RRB- , as you are being in your third . But as much as we should worry about the probable blowback to bombing Libya , we have to be sure that having Gaddafi win this would be much , much worse , and not just for the Libyans that have defied him . In the end , I don t see an alternative but for Obama to eventually come full circle , get in front of the camera , and demand that an Arab dictator and his sons leave . Without doubt the United States is the gorilla on the world stage and it is in our DNA to help other countries realize the human rights benefits we enjoy . But with that said we do not have a clear right to put our young people at risk to resolve civil unrest around the world . I believe we should have a clear policy in place under which we would help a country resolve it 's conflicts . These policy issues should include , at the very least , : 1 -RRB- Both sides should ask the US to intervene , 2 -RRB- Hostilities must cease immediately , 3 -RRB- US involvement will only involve peacekeeping and humanitarian aid . 4 -RRB- Resolution of the conflict will focus on the establishment of a government that includes the basic needs of both sides . March 8 , 2011 at 6:49 pm | Jack forgive me for being politically incorrect , but we dont need to be involved in another war . We have enough involvement in the mid east to keep us busy for now . Who knows who is in line to take the helm there . March 8 , 2011 at 6:51 pm | It does n't matter what we do in that part of the world because we are always damned if we do and damned if we do n't by the people in that part of the world . If we help them , anything and everything that goes wrong will be our fault . If we do not help them , anything and everything that goes wrong will be our fault . Am I the only person who has noticed this fact ? March 8 , 2011 at 6:51 pm | Arm both sides to the teeth and buy the oil from who ever wins ?

In the eastern oil city of Ras Lanuf , rebels fired antiaircraft guns after Libya 's air force carried out fresh raids . Video shot by Sky News showed that fighting was continuing in Zawiya , despite government assertions that forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi controlled the oil-refining city . Hundreds of anti-government demonstrators could be seen marching in the street , many of them pumping their fists in the air . As the crackle of gunfire could be heard , the demonstrators ran toward the camera . Four men could be seen carrying a fifth , then putting him into an ambulance . A doctor who left the city in the morning told CNN that Gadhafi forces had fatally shot two fellow doctors in the main square and were shooting wounded civilians rather than allowing them to be treated . The city 's two medical clinics were closed , he said . Military casualties were being taken from the city by ambulance , he said . CNN was not able to witness the fighting and could not independently confirm reports of what was happening there on Tuesday . Opposition officials accused Gadhafi of bombing water reserves in Ras Lanuf , the site of intense fighting in recent days . Rebels have seized several cities and the army has fought fiercely to reclaim some of them . On Tuesday , Gadhafi addressed a tribal group of youthful supporters in a talk broadcast on television and repeated his assertions that the nation 's youths have been misled and drugged by al Qaeda . `` For them , everybody 's their enemy , '' he said . `` They know nothing other than killing . '' He praised the Libyan standard of living as one that others in the world envy and called on his countrymen to defend it . `` They want to take your petrol , '' he said . `` This is what America , this is what the French , those colonialists , want . '' He cited people from Pakistan , Afghanistan and Algeria as among those who have joined the rebel forces -- `` hunting children who are not mature , who have certain deficiencies ; they offer them pills . This is what we understood so far . '' He called anti-government forces in Benghazi , a rebel-held town in the east , `` traitors '' and predicted that the pro-Gadhafi residents `` are going to throw them out .

Representatives of key Western powers also highlighted the possibility of establishing a no-fly zone in Libya -- part of growing campaign to break strongman Moammar Gadhafi 's grip on power . British , French and U.S. officials were working on a draft text that includes language on a no-fly zone , diplomatic sources at the United Nations told CNN . The language in the text will deal with triggers rather than timelines for taking such a step , one diplomat noted . If gross violations of human rights are committed , the diplomat added , the elements of the text could be quickly turned into a resolution . Any resolution on military intervention in Libya , however , would be subject to a vote by the 15 members of the U.N. Security Council . Such intervention could face sharp criticism from Russia and China , who rarely approve of such measures . U.N. Western powers mull no-fly zone Inside the mind of Saif Gadhafi British diplomatic team taken in Libya Libya conflict moves closer to capital `` The violence that 's been taking place and perpetrated by the government in Libya is unacceptable , '' U.S. President Barack Obama said at the White House . Moammar Gadhafi 's government `` will be held accountable for whatever violence continues to take place there . '' Obama stressed that NATO is considering a wide range of responses -- including military options -- for dealing with the crisis . White House Press Secretary Jay Carney later cited three potential responses under active consideration : establishing the no-fly zone , military-backed humanitarian aid , and stronger enforcement of the U.N. arms embargo . Carney downplayed speculation about the possibility of providing arms to the Libyan rebels , telling reporters that `` it would be premature to send a bunch of weapons to a post office box in eastern Libya . '' `` We need to not get ahead of ourselves in terms of the options we 're pursuing , '' he warned . A senior U.S. official familiar with the administration 's deliberations on Libya denied a report in the British press that the administration had asked Saudi Arabia to arm the rebels . U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague told members of the British parliament , however , that `` we are making contingency plans for all eventualities in Libya . '' NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters in Belgium that the organization has no immediate intention to intervene in the Libyan civil war . But `` as a defense alliance and a security organization , it is our job to conduct prudent planning for any eventuality , '' he said . Rasmussen stressed that it is important to `` remain vigilant '' in light of `` systemic attacks '' by Gadhafi 's regime against the Libyan population . `` The violation of human rights and international humanitarian law is outrageous , '' he said . Rasmussen also noted that the defense ministers from member states will meet Friday and Saturday to discuss how the organization can help partner countries in North Africa and the broader Middle East . `` We can see a strong wind of change blowing across the region -- and it is blowing in the direction of freedom and democracy , '' he asserted . Libyan Foreign Minister Musa Kasa lashed out the Western leaders , calling their response part of `` a conspiracy to divide -LRB- and -RRB- partition the country . '' `` The English are yearning for the colonial era '' while Obama is acting `` like a child , '' he said . `` Territorial integrity is sacrosanct and we will die for it . '' U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , meanwhile , appointed a new special envoy to Libya to discuss the crisis with officials in Tripoli , the United Nations said in a statement Monday . Abdelilah Al-Khatib , a former foreign minister of Jordan , will `` undertake urgent consultations with the authorities in Tripoli and in the region on the immediate humanitarian situation as well as the wider dimensions of the crisis , '' according to the statement . As diplomats debated various options , the violence in Libya continued to intensify . Forces loyal to Gadhafi took aim at the rebel-controlled town of Ras Lanuf , launching aerial strikes meant to help crush the uprising against him . Death toll estimates from the conflict have reached as high as 2,000 people . Roughly 200,000 people have fled Libya , with nearly equal numbers going to Tunisia and Egypt , according to the United Nations .

CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : CNN is one example . So is CNN Student News . In fact , you could be an example , and you 're going to see how and what we 're talking about in the next few minutes . I 'm Carl Azuz . CNN Student News takes off right now . AZUZ : After three weeks of fighting between people who support and oppose Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , other world leaders are calling the situation in Libya a civil war . Rebels have taken control of several cities . The Libyan army has fought to regain some of those cities . Officials estimate more than a thousand people have died in the violence . There were reports yesterday that Colonel Gadhafi was negotiating with rebel leaders , saying he would step down if they could promise that he 'd be able to leave the country safely and that he and his family would not be put on trial . But later on both sides denied these reports . Some rebel leaders said the negotiations never happened , and a government spokesman called the reports lies . The international community is trying to find ways to end the violence in Libya . And one suggestion is a no-fly zone over the country . What that would mean is that no military planes could fly over Libya without permission . The United Nations Security Council is talking about it , and the idea has a lot of support from countries in the Middle East . NATO , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , is already running ` round-the-clock surveillance flights over Libya . AZUZ : In neighboring Egypt , about a thousand people showed up for a pro-women demonstration yesterday . Women were a major part of the protests that forced former President Hosni Mubarak out of power from Egypt last month . But this protest turned into a shouting match when groups of men started yelling anti-feminist chants , like `` go home , that 's where you belong . '' There were men on both sides of these protests . The people who organized the women 's march said they 're demanding `` fair and equal opportunity for all Egyptian citizens -- beyond gender , religion or class . '' AZUZ : Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made a similar point at an event that commemorated the 100th anniversary of International Women 's Day . When referring to the political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa we 've seen lately , Secretary Clinton said women `` have just as much right as the men to remake their governments . '' She and first lady Michelle Obama honored 10 women with the International Women of Courage Award . Secretary Clinton said the women 's courage comes from putting others ' well-being before their own . And Mrs. Obama said the awards send a message to women that `` you are never alone in your struggle . '' TOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : See if you can I.D. Me ! In the U.S. , I was first celebrated in Mobile , Alabama . I 'm an annual event whose colors are purple , gold and green . In French , my name translates to `` Fat Tuesday . '' I 'm Mardi Gras , known as Carnival in other parts of the world . AZUZ : Mardi Gras is the last day of the Carnival season . This whole celebration lasts for several days , but it always ends on Fat Tuesday , also called Shrove Tuesday , and that was yesterday . A lot of cities host Mardi Gras celebrations , and it might have started in Mobile . But most people associate the annual event -- in the U.S. anyway -- with New Orleans . The typical attendance for Mardi Gras : more than a million people . They show up for the parties and for the parades , and those are organized by social clubs called `` krewes ; '' `` krewe '' with a `` k '' . Traditionally , when the clock strikes midnight at the end of Fat Tuesday , a group of New Orleans police march down the city 's famous Bourbon Street , announcing the end of Carnival . CHRISTINE ROMANS , CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT : It 's not only the uber famous who can brand themselves . Digital media , Twitter and Facebook make it easy for almost anyone to create a brand . From skateboarder Tony Hawk ... ROMANS : It 's something that you started before everyone was trying to become a brand . TONY HAWK , PROFESSIONAL SKATEBOARDER : The first thing , you have to have something to offer , you know what I mean ? I do n't really believe in being famous just because you 're famous . ROMANS : ... To chef Paula Deen . PAULA DEEN , CHEF : You know , you kind of have to reinvent yourself . You know , you have to keep things fresh . I did start this little lunch business called The Bag Lady , y ' all . ROMANS : What about the average person ? Could creating your own brand give you an edge ? SAM CHAKO , JOB SEEKER : I do n't know how to market myself to get employers to notice me . FORD R. MYERS , CAREER COACH : The market is too tough . Unemployment numbers are still high . Every candidate needs to find a way to stand out . ROMANS : So , how do you create your own brand ? Career counselor Ford Myers has some tips . MYERS : Every candidate can identify what is their unique selling proposition or what is their special brand . Look through their own background , their own resumes , their letters of recommendation , their performance reviews and find what stands out . ROMANS : Leadership and management author Bill Taylor has a cult following . ROMANS : You walk into the boardroom ... BILL TAYLOR , AUTHOR , `` PRACTICALLY RADICAL '' : Right . ROMANS : When you walk into the job interview , when you walk into your dining room ... ROMANS : Are we all becoming brands ? TAYLOR : I think , you know , being a brand is not being flamboyant . It works for Lady Gaga . It would n't work for you in your organization . Being a brand , as everybody knows , when I meet Christine Romans , this is what she stands for , this is the impact she was trying to have . AZUZ : All right , last week , we told you the story about how the people of Christchurch , New Zealand found a time capsule after an earthquake leveled parts of their city . We tried to get you thinking about what you would leave for the next generation to discover . What would you put in your own time capsule ? Here 's what some of you had to say about it . iPod : very popular choice for many of you . Cassidy says `` songs contain everything about a generation : the moods , language and technological advances of our time . '' Leah would also leave an iPod , but added that she 'd leave `` 20 bucks , because so many people have been tight on money due to the economic status '' of the country . She said she 'd also include a note saying why she left each thing in order to tell people about the world 's turmoil . But , if she could leave something out , it would be the note because history , she says , should n't repeat itself . Lucus wants to include fast food wrappers in the time capsule . He feels the world is slowly becoming obese from the fast food people eat . Sierra wants to include a book . I thought this was interesting . Sierra thinks that books are the highs and lows of humanity on pieces of paper . And finally , Ben says he would n't leave a thing because , according to him , the economy , the violence : it 's just not worth preserving for future generations . AZUZ : Really interesting insight , if a little cynical there . All right , our next story is one we think will get a lot of you talking on our blog . St. Augustine High School in New Orleans uses corporal punishment -- paddling -- to discipline students . This past Friday , students at the school held a rally in support of the policy . The students actually want to keep paddling . It 's been part of St. Augustine for its entire 60 year history . But the school stopped corporal punishment this year after the local Archbishop said paddling does n't belong in a Catholic school . He said , `` I believe hitting a child , or a young man , does not build character . '' And the Archbishop said a study showed that St. Augustine does n't have any safeguards in place to prevent the paddling from turning into abuse . Listen to this , though . They say corporal punishment is part of the tradition that makes St. Augustine work . This can not be argued . This can not be changed . JACOB WASHINGTON , ST. AUGUSTINE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT : You 're not just taking away a form of discipline . You 're taking away a form of life at St. Augustine . AZUZ : You 've heard what the Archbishop had to say . You 've heard some of the students ' opinions . Now , we want to hear yours ! Head to our blog at CNNStudentNews.com . Tell us your reaction to what 's going on at St. Augustine . We 're looking forward to reading what you have to say . But one thing we want you to remember , on our blog , it is first names only . Please do n't give us any more info than that . AZUZ : Finally today , many of you saw it , that PIXAR movie `` Up '' ? This is the real-life version ! A team of scientists and engineers wanted to see if they could pull off the movie 's stunt of lifting a house with a bunch of balloons . Took them two weeks ; all they needed were 300 massive balloons ! The house made it all the way up to 10,000 feet , flew around for about an hour . We wonder if they were careful of insects that high up though . AZUZ : I mean , after all , you could run into some huge houseflies . And after two weeks of hard work , it 's nice to see the project get off the ground . But imagine if it had n't worked . That would really burst their bubble . All right , we 're gonna take off before these puns balloon out of control . But we are gonna be back tomorrow to float some more headlines by you . "}, {"uid": "110", "dct": "2011-03-09", "dates": [null, null], "text": "By Dr. James Lindsay , Special to CNN Hopes that revolutionary fervor would quickly sweep Moammar Gadhafi from power look to be dashed . The Libyan strongman has secured his hold over Tripoli , the country s capital and largest city , and his forces have begun attacking rebel strongholds . A protracted Libyan civil war may be looming . That prospect presents President Obama with a dilemma : How does he encourage Gadhafi 's ouster and minimize harm to Libyan civilians without entangling the United States in yet another Middle East conflict ? He has seven options . The administration has already taken several steps to pressure Gadhafi to go . It has frozen $ 30 billion worth of Libyan assets in the United States , joined with the rest of the international community in banning members of the regime from traveling internationally and voted to suspend Libya s membership in the UN Human Rights Council . None of these measures is likely to make a difference , at least any time soon . The travel ban and Human Rights Council suspension are purely symbolic . Sanctions could take months to pinch the regime , if at all . So what are the White House s next steps ? Direct U.S. military intervention is off the table . Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and senior U.S. military officials oppose sending U.S. troops into Libya . The American public feels likewise . Here is a figure to keep in mind : a majority of Americans -- 58 percent according to the latest CNN poll -- oppose the war in Afghanistan . Americans don t want to get out of Afghanistan just so we can go into Libya . So what might the administration do instead ? Here are the seven possibilities : 1 -RRB- Impose a no-fly zone . This is what the U.S. did over parts of Iraq for more than a decade after the 1991 Gulf War . We could also go beyond that and bomb airport runways so they are unusable . Neither of these steps would help the rebels much . The Libyan Air Force has been a non-factor in the fighting so far . A no-fly zone and cratered runways also would not help the rebels deal with the real threat they face , namely , artillery and multiple launch rocket systems -LRB- MLRS -RRB- . These advanced weapons are capable of leveling entire neighborhoods . 2 -RRB- Impose a no-drive zone . The White House could tackle the artillery and MLRS threat by bombing these and other heavy weapons . That , however , clearly makes the United States a participant in Libya s civil war . A no-drive zone would also be ineffective if Gadhafi 's forces have already dispersed their heavy weapons into cities and towns . Attacking them in place runs a high risk of killing and injuring civilians . 3 -RRB- Push someone else to intervene in Libya . But who would volunteer ? European countries don t want to re-assume the colonial mantle . Most of Libya s neighbors either lack the ability or desire to take on a peacemaking mission . Countries outside the region would prefer to worry about their own problems . 4 -RRB- Directly arm the rebels . This policy is gaining support on Capitol Hill . But it may merely increase the carnage rather than give the rebels the upper hand . Sophisticated weapons require training to use , but no one is talking about sending in trainers . Equally troubling , the weapons we want Libyans to use against Gadhafi could wind up in the wrong hands and be used against us down the road . What succeeds Gadhafi 's regime may not be a stable , broad-based government but something that looks more like Somalia . 5 -RRB- Ask other countries to arm the rebels . Unfortunately , that doesn t solve the problem of weapons ending up in the wrong hands . Would the Saudis , for instance , be careful to make sure that weapons don t fall in to the hands of Islamic extremists who are as mad at the West as they are at Gadhafi ? 6 -RRB- Provide tactical military intelligence to the rebels . Real-time information about the regime s troops movements would help the rebels direct their own forces . But it would not be a game changer . 7 -RRB- Provide the rebels with moral and humanitarian support but nothing else . Debates in Washington always presume that the White House has to do something . But it can choose to do nothing . That sounds cold-hearted , especially when cable news , YouTube , and Twitter will bring the fighting into our living rooms . But the United States has stood on the sidelines many times before when people struggled to overthrow a tyrant . Moral outrage can give way to calculations of self-interest or political expediency . None of these options is appealing . That is why inside the White House officials are no doubt hoping that events will save them from having to choose among them . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Lindsay . We dont get involved . Since out money went to china , tell them to do it . March 9 , 2011 at 10:05 am | Reply I agree totally China is killing the North American Economy IMO , so why dont thye contribute !!! March 9 , 2011 at 10:25 am | Reply because China is smart !!! you do n't increase your net worth by assisting everyone else , not unless you can exploit your good deeds . By staying out of `` it '' keeping to themselves and letting other countries do all the work all while selling products to Libya is making China money . let the other countries spend their resources on helping people who will turn on you in a heartbeat , we will sell them our products and even sell products to the countries that are assisting Libya and make even more money . Even if countries demand that we help\\/do our part in assistance we will crush them by slowing down trade to that country . if you do n't like this then hurt us by not buying any products Made China and make them in your own country !!!!!!! March 9 , 2011 at 11:37 am | Nodat : Name me something not made in china that we require for our daily lives ? Mind you this idea would also involve a worldwide boycott of Wal-Mart ? Not very realistic with all the ignorant and poor around here , huh ? March 9 , 2011 at 2:08 pm | thank you usa for all of your money . i love vacationing at all of the usa resorts that the people own . please , mr. b. hussein osama , please do something stupid in libya , so that the people can sweep in and recover the oil and take over another countries economy . March 9 , 2011 at 2:42 pm | Before WW2 Great Britain was the worlds richest country , and spent all of its wealth -LRB- and lost its empire -RRB- during the war . The United States an upcoming great power did not get involved in the war for two years , preferring to sell arms to the UK , in order to make money . In fact it took a direct assault an US sovereign territory to provoke the nation to fight , rather than turn a profit . Asking China to get involved is ridiculous , if the USA is allowed to profit from a war -LRB- a slightly more important one in terms of human rights and world peace -RRB- , why not China ? After WW2 The United States was the only major participant to have made a profit , largely by sitting on the side and letting British , Soviet , and free European soldiers do the fighting . These days the USA posses the worlds largest armed forces and strongest national economy , like the British Empire before WW2 , why cant the USA make a stand and fight against Libya , like Britain against The third Reich , after all , Libya is n't as powerful a country as Nazi Germany was is it ? Or is the US government still afraid to fight the bad guys ? March 9 , 2011 at 6:04 pm | and they will continue as long as we keep allowing Companies to outsource and put jobs elsewhere . PUT A 25 % tarrif on all goods coming into the country and we will see the factories come alive here but there will be short term pain ... March 10 , 2011 at 9:09 am | Well , it seems US oil makers and arms dealer stand to gain the most out of any conflict in the world , especially any turmoil in the middle east . It gives US a great opportunity to expand its influence into the region , or should I say to to conitnue the Americanization process , to do what an empire should be doing . Compared with the US , China is a real lame duck ; only thing it can do is to sell some trivial merchandise and make some pocket money ! China was never an empire and it never will be one for it is in the blood of the Han people to make peace not war ; to trade and not to invade .

March 9 , 2011 at 11:53 am | Bernie and FannieMae\\/Freddie Mac were not the main culprits of the economic down turn it was GREED ! greed from the Wall Street hustlers , greed from the mortgage brokers that gouged anybody that was warm , greed from the banks that bought the fraudulant loans from the greedy mortgage brokers and greed from the American public that bought these homes knowing ful well they could not afford them and then defaulted on them ! March 9 , 2011 at 1:42 pm | Reason101 . Try combining all of those factors ? March 9 , 2011 at 2:09 pm | Yeah , and the whole reason Africa 's in this mess in the first place is because Europe is a bunch of douche bags . March 9 , 2011 at 5:14 pm | Ya hit it on the head . This darn mess we have been in started with Bushy and Dicky when they deregulated the Banks and Wall Street , failed to fund the war in Iraq , and failed to get on top of the worst recession since the great depression in time . Anyone feeling the drip drip drip of tax cuts trickling down to the middle class ? That was a Reagonesque move and did not work then and will never work . Those tax cuts for the wealthy just result in bigger mansions and longer yachts . March 9 , 2011 at 5:58 pm | YES ! Title should have been ' 8 Options ' with # 1 being Do Nothing . # 7 still costs U.S. Citizens money mortgaging OUR future for their freedom ... There 's too much tolerance for the `` rest of the region simply lacking the ability of desire to act '' so the conclusion is the U.S. has to save the World ... It 's getting Really OLD staging wars that have only added TRILLIONS to the Nationat Debt -- For What ?? March 9 , 2011 at 11:18 am | Reply I have to agree . For all of the talk about deficit reduction , we are still in Iraq - for what again ? We created that conflict on credit we did n't have and the same deficit busters are busting at the seams because Obama is not reacting like the last cowboy who got us unto a useless war that taxpayers continue to pay for . We do n't need another one without deep thought and consideration about what the heck we 're doing . March 9 , 2011 at 11:46 am | `` Doing nothing '' is not a zero cost option . One simple word , like it or not -- OIL . Protracted instability in or bordering any oil producing nation will have a negative effect on the US economy . It does n't matter that we do n't get much oil from Libya , since oil is a standard , globally traded commodity -- any reduction in suplly reliability affects the global market . We have oil prices in the $ 100.00 per barrel range now , in a global recession -- what do you think oil prices would be if the US economy was strong -- driving demand in China and elsewhere , in addition to increased domestic consumption . Rising oil prices , if sustained , will put the brakes on any economic recovery in the US . Libya is not an isolated situation , either -- the Egyptian military and security forces are no doubt watching the situation closely , to see how far they really have to go with reform -- if Qaddafi is successful , that will have a demoralizing effect on Egypt 's opposition , and the Egyptian military and security apparatus will likely just pick another front man and continue much of the Mubarak era status quo . If Qaddafi falls , then opposition movements throughout the arab world will be energized and more insistent on reform or regime change . The beneficial end result for the US is not going to come from US bought thugs like Mubarak -LRB- our friend so long as we fed his regime billions in aid -RRB- , but from the emergence of stable governments and domestic economic growth in the arab world . We would not even be discussing options with respect to Libya if the results did not have major geopolicital and global economic significance for the US . Bloodshed and butchery have occurred in the Congo and Darfur for years , and we 've never considered intervention . Political oppression is rampant throughout the world , and the US does n't consider intervention . This `` policeman of the world '' concept is self-deluding propaganda . We have never endeavored to be the world 's `` policeman '' -- US foreign policy and foreign military or intelligence interventions have always been guided by an intent to protect or enhance US economic interests . Libya is no different in that regard , and we have a clear economic interest . Just ask any yuppie commodities trader working at NYMEX . March 9 , 2011 at 1:42 pm | Actually , we do n't get ANY oil from Libya . The prices have n't gone up in America because the world market has been drastically effected at this point . The prices have gone up because greedy assholes fear in advance that they will . On top of that , what is this crap about Obama contemplating using our reserves to offset prices in America ? The American oil market income and consumption has not changed . He should penalize the companies who are raising the prices for no reason and DEMAND the price go back down but , Obama ai n't really doing shit about nothing . OUR GOVERNMENT IS FUCKING USELESS . TEAR IT ALL DOWN ! March 9 , 2011 at 2:13 pm | You have the most informed analysis of the situation . The article itself has nothing to offer . We can not afford another war and even if we were to get involve , it will give the Al Quada and other of their ilk will exploit that . One way to help this could be by recognizing the rebel government as representing the new Libya . This will allow the recognized government to request weaponary and humanitarian assistance . We have already burned out bridges with Ghaddafi and recognizing the new government would not effect the future . March 9 , 2011 at 2:50 pm | # 7 . We are presently doing what we should be doing . We are helping people to go back to their homes . We should do NOTHING militarily !!!! Let the UN get involved , as they should . March 9 , 2011 at 11:28 am | Reply I 'll agree on this one . Let the U.N take this one , as they should have anyway , and when they screw up -LRB- and they will -RRB- , Americans can finally shrug and say hey was n't us . March 9 , 2011 at 2:46 pm | WHY CA N'T WE SEND SPECIAL FORCES TO WIPE GADDAFI AND HIS SONS OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH ? WE COULD THEN COME HOME .

March 9 , 2011 at 3:23 pm | They are sitting on the sidelines waiting it out , hoping the U.S. will do something stupid as usual .

March 9 , 2011 at 1:27 pm | March 9 , 2011 at 1:30 pm | It 's time that we keep our noses , hands , and mouths out of other countries problems , issues and civil wars . If we as a nation are so worried about oil prices then we as a nation need to figure something else out and stop depending on so much oil . We ca n't afford it now , and we ca n't afford it in the future . Butt out , and leave other countries civil unrest to themselves . Let other countries learn how to feed , clothe , educate , and defend their own , while we regroup and start bringing our nation back up to the levels we once had , economically , educationally , ethically , spiritually and morally .

IF You chose to begin a Revolution & all You have is a AK47 then You are going to Die . It 's that Simple . AK 47 vs a Military Tank DUH ?

We belong in Afghanistan , Pakistan or where ever Al Quida is located & that includes Saudi Arabia . Those are the S O B 's that Killed 1000 's of Innocent Americans on `` 9\\/11 '' & Yes They should Die . If we attempt to protect all of these Arab Revolutions across Northern Africa & the Middle East then the focus & the $ $ will be directly away from Our True Mission : Killing Al Quida , That 's Where We Belong . All of this is DaJaVu , Invade Iraq when We should have been focused on Afghanistan ?? Keep getting involved in SomeOne Else 's Revolution then there will be another Military Draft in America ! That 's a Shocker to think about . OPTION # 8 : Stay out of it . There are no Americans in danger there . It 's time the U.S. starts letting other countries stand on their own feet .

March 9 , 2011 at 2:56 pm | What everyone who calls for China and\\/or Russia to step up and intervene fails to recognize the reason why they dont and always oppose foreign intervention . That reason is that they do n't want a precendent set for when their own populations rise up against their oppression and they need to start taking their own heavy handed tatics to slap them back down . China can talk a good game about condemning Gadaffi killing his own civilians but since they have done it before themselves and will likely do so again , they sure wo n't support anyone else getting involved less they find them selves on the recieving end of that in the future .

The ability to use air assets to bomb , scare , and watch the rebels has surely got to be a major factor . I do not think that the United States should , alone , create a no fly zone . If NATO goes through with plans of a no fly zone then I think the United States could use its military to help with that . The United States can not be seen as the ` instigators ' of this revolution or it will be used against us .

March 9 , 2011 at 12:51 pm | Reply Stay out , let the Libyans solve their own problems . If the UN authorizes humanitarian relief , we should contribute so long as the Arab League and African Union -LRB- both of whom list Libya as a member -RRB- participate . The US can not be seen as `` leading '' anything in Libya other than neutral humanitarian missions . On the other hand . if we have some extra small arms -LRB- guns , RPGs , Stingers , etc -RRB- lying around we can discretely drop off in Benghazi without them being traced back to us , we ought to do it . Those hand-held weapons are unlikely to ever come back to hurt us even if the rebels sold them on the black market instead of fighting Gadhafi . Sharing real-time intelligence is another low-cost , low-risk option that we can easily deny ever doing later . See , we want to topple Gashafi , but we do n't want to be seen as helping to topple him , so we have to be discrete . No US personnel on the ground whatsoever .

France will have a very limited supporting role , and other NATO forces will be put on alert . The timing of the no-fly zone will coincide with an announcement from the UN that a no-fly zone has been authorized . Gadfi will immediately declare war on the west . NATO support of rebels will escalate . Gadhafi 's forces on the ground will be directly targeted . Gadhafi will react so violently , targeting his own people en masse , that NATO will be forced to directly target him and remove him as soon as possible .

Via land lines ? -RRB- 4 -RRB- Where is Gadhafi right now ? 5 -RRB- What does Gadhafi value ? What could we take away from him that would hurt him ? 6 -RRB- Can drones -- which are low-flying and usually subsonic , from what I understand -- target helicopters ? 7 -RRB- And finally -- what are the options that are n't on that list ?

We have seen the chaos that overtook Iraq once Saddam fell . It 's now a breeding ground for terrorists , and we will come to regret trading the devil we knew for the devils we did n't know . Why make the same mistake ? Gadhafi is n't our friend , by any means , but does anyone seriously think that Libya is going to evolve into a stable , peaceful democracy once he 's gone ? The fall of Gadhafi will lead to a power vacuum , which will be filled by the usual squabbling warlords and thugs .

Besides the rebels dont really need anything capable of carpet bombings because tehy are trying to not kill civilians , Ghadafis side on the other hand ...

If there are any mercenaries maybe send in some spec ops teams so silently kill them off -LRB- I do admit that if Ghadafi has mercs then shouldnt the rebels also get some help ? -RRB- , and keep the aid of doctors and food going to the rebels , that would be enough to give the dignity to the libyan people that China demands they retain yet at the same time improve our relations with Libya down the road -LRB- right now they are getting more and more frustrated with the west !! -RRB- That in my opinion would keep things in pretty good shape , its not like anyone in the east is afraid of being killed if they go out into the streets looking for food or medical aid , unlike Tripoli at the moment !!!

But the essential question remains : Will America and the rest of the West learn to deal with the Arabs as grown-ups rather than micromanaging their affairs through the prism of America 's antiquated foreign policy in the Middle East . As Mubarak s administration crumbled , all I heard from the West was how the Muslim brotherhood must not be trusted with power over Egypt . If I may quote Lincoln ___ Democracy is government of the people for the people by the people . Therefore America and the West need to learn to respect the choice of the people , even if it is a political party founded on the principles of religion . I 've never heard anyone criticizing the Christian Democratic Party which currently rules Germany . But the key point here is that with power comes greater responsibility for any organization . I recalled that the PLO was labeled the world 's number one terrorist group along with Arafat . Suddenly after more than two decades of isolation Arafat was given a seat at the table and everything changed , the PLO gradually became a respected organization . Unfortunately , however , when Hamas won a free-and-fair election in Palestine and unilaterally suspended all attacks on Israel , America and Europe chose to isolate and undermine them instead of engaging them constructively . The approach has so far failed woefully . But still nothing has been learned from this mistake instead , the shift now is on the Muslim brotherhood . I wonder what it would take for the brains and all the think-tanks in Washington , London and other capitals to realize that we can not impose our will on the democratic choices of other nations , but we can certainly use our brains and money to make them more responsible . March 9 , 2011 at 2:17 pm | Reply A basic problem with America and other democracies involves a combination of reactionism , lag , and obstanence . When something happens in the world that many people do n't like , there is usually a strong reaction . Often this reaction 's strength is not in line with the relative calm and control inherent in most democratic world leaders -LRB- a leader has to present as calm and in control of at least his own behavior -RRB- . So then , an opposition develops surrounding the perceived inadequate response to the reactionaries , whose reactionary behavior tends to spread like a rash . Soon , voices call for the replacing of the leader in the coming elections . But , a US president has 4 years in office before elections . So , people wait ... and they wait ... and while they 're waiting , they tend to continue to harp on their earlier reactions to events that most seem to have forgotten by now . Come election day , all most presidential opponents really know is that they 're darn angry about ... something . To keep from looking like fools , these people will trump up anything they can in order to get their consituents to react , and continue reacting , until the president leaves office . By then , anyone 's notions on what our foreign policy was , should be , or if anything was really wrong with it to begin with , are largely forgotten except for the scholars and experts on late night news TV interview programs .

If you read other articles our main concern is libya 's helicopter force . That 's true though helicopters are slow they pack a powerful punch to ground vehicles . So restating what I said earlier I think the UN should set up the `` no fly zone '' but that 's it nothing else . The people who want to leave have left so let the other people fight it out .

March 9 , 2011 at 4:00 pm | Reply Most of Lindsay 's options focus on direct action by the USA . # 3 and # 5 refer to encouraging other to act , but they are given little value . Option 1 should always be to work with local powers in instable areas . If America acts directly , it will give the Islamic radicals and other America-haters support for their positions in a very visible way . The Americanization of the wars against Saddam Hussein and the Talaban has given fuel to those groups that present themselves as valiant defenders against a new evil empire . Remember , that the greatest progress against the Talilban in 2001 was during the Northern Alliance 's -LRB- supported by embedded US special forces -RRB- offensive . Those were Afghan troops Western newsmen filmed being cheered by the people of Kabul . SFC Mike makes a good point that the powers that be in Egypt have little motive to help the insurgents . However , they have learned their lesson that they must listen to the mood of the Cairo street , who , I imagine , are firmly with the uprising . What would be the results if , rather than debating what AMERICAN military power can do , our leader defer to Egypt as the natural leader of the Arab world , and urge them to take charge of the situation ? America would appear as a supporter of the Arab and Egyption people rather than a distant puppet master , while the Egyptian military would be put in a difficult political situation if they seem to pass responsibility to the West . Privately , of course , the American government should make clear that something should come out of US-Egyptian cooperation after the billions of dollars the US has spent over the last 30 years underwriting their military .

March 11 , 2011 at 11:08 am | Reply It is ironic the economic and foreign policy consequences of our ill-advised invasion of Iraq in seem to be preventing us from acting in a conflict where our intervention is far more justified . As an American Jew of Israeli decent , I recognize the quagmire that any intervention in the Middle East can become -LRB- it is for that reason that I was vehemently against the invasion of Iraq in 2003 -RRB- . However , in dealing with a part of the world that sees us in the most cynical light , we should not underestimate the impact of non-action . The perception that we are willing to force democracy on our own terms in Iraq while we are willing to let an indigenous movement wither on the vine in Libya will not help our interests any more than it will help the citizens of that unfortunate country . I usually feel quite proud when our President reminds us of the consequences of being on the wrong side of history . However , I m deeply worried that historians a generation from now will be marveling at how we got it wrong twice : by choosing to intervene in Iraq and then choosing to do so little in Libya . A failure to answer the voices calling for our aid will not erase the mistakes of the past , it will only add to them . Let 's not forget , the impulse of isolationism has not `` done us proud '' in the past . We stood on the sidelines as Germany rose in power and started persecuting my ancestors in the 1930 's . We did this in part because of our economic troubles , but also , in part , because of collective guilt about the Treaty of Versailles after World War I.

In the eastern oil city of Ras Lanuf , rebels fired antiaircraft guns after Libya 's air force carried out fresh raids . Video shot by Sky News showed that fighting was continuing in Zawiya , despite government assertions that forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi controlled the oil-refining city . Hundreds of anti-government demonstrators could be seen marching in the street , many of them pumping their fists in the air . As the crackle of gunfire could be heard , the demonstrators ran toward the camera . Four men could be seen carrying a fifth , then putting him into an ambulance . A doctor who left the city in the morning told CNN that Gadhafi forces had fatally shot two fellow doctors in the main square and were shooting wounded civilians rather than allowing them to be treated . The city 's two medical clinics were closed , he said . Libyan rebels needs include a no-fly zone Military casualties were being taken from the city by ambulance , he said . CNN was not able to witness the fighting and could not independently confirm reports of what was happening there on Tuesday . Opposition officials accused Gadhafi of bombing water reserves in Ras Lanuf , the site of intense fighting in recent days . Rebels have seized several cities and the army has fought fiercely to reclaim some of them . On Tuesday , Gadhafi addressed a tribal group of youthful supporters in a talk broadcast on television and repeated his assertions that the nation 's youths have been misled and drugged by al Qaeda . `` For them , everybody 's their enemy , '' he said . `` They know nothing other than killing . '' He praised the Libyan standard of living as one that others in the world envy and called on his countrymen to defend it . `` They want to take your petrol , '' he said . `` This is what America , this is what the French , those colonialists , want . '' He cited people from Pakistan , Afghanistan and Algeria as among those who have joined the rebel forces -- `` hunting children who are not mature , who have certain deficiencies ; they offer them pills . This is what we understood so far . '' He called anti-government forces in Benghazi , a rebel-held town in the east , `` traitors '' and predicted that the pro-Gadhafi residents `` are going to throw them out . '' In Gadhafi 's stronghold , the capital city of Tripoli , about 100 journalists assembled during the evening in the lobby of a hotel after being told that Gadhafi would arrive . Nine hours later , just before midnight , his convoy of SUVs pulled up to the hotel . Gadhafi talks communism and Al Qaeda Shortly afterward , surrounded by his security detail , he strode into the lobby , waved at the throng of reporters , pumped his right fist several times into the air , retreated to a private room for an interview with a Turkish journalist , then left via a back door without addressing the reporters . The interview was to air Wednesday morning . The incident occurred hours after opposition members denied Tuesday that they have been negotiating an exit deal with Gadhafi , rejecting an assertion made earlier in the day by an opposition official . Gadhafi 's regime , too , denied having entered into negotiations with the rebels . Musa Ibrahim , a government spokesman , called reports of such negotiations `` lies . '' The Libyan opposition is composed not of a single monolithic group , but of various groups and individuals around the country whose shared goal is to see the 68-year-old ruler ousted . But their military skills tend to be rudimentary , at best , when compared with the relatively disciplined , well-armed pro-Gadhafi forces . `` There is no one here with military experience , but have a strong heart , '' said medical student Yahya Ali , who was manning an antiaircraft battery in the eastern Libyan town of Al-Brega after four hours of training . In Washington , U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said any departure from Libya of Gadhafi would not exempt him , his family or others from responsibility for their actions . `` We are going to hold him accountable , '' Crowley said . U.S. President Barack Obama discussed Libya on Tuesday with British Prime Minister David Cameron , the White House said in a statement . `` They agreed that the common objective in Libya must be an immediate end to brutality and violence ; the departure of Gadhafi from power as quickly as possible ; and a transition that meets the Libyan peoples ' aspirations for freedom , dignity , and a representative government , '' it said . Both leaders agreed to go ahead with planning responses , `` including surveillance , humanitarian assistance , enforcement of the arms embargo , and a no-fly zone . '' Death toll estimates have ranged from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000 . `` Both the Libyan government and opposition forces need to allow unhindered access for aid organizations to assist civilians , '' Bill Frelick , refugee program director at Human Rights Watch , said Tuesday . `` People living in areas of heavy fighting in western Libya are now in dire need of medical aid and other assistance . '' The U.N. World Food Programme said Tuesday a convoy of trucks entered Libya headed for Benghazi , the rebel stronghold in eastern Libya . `` A convoy of trucks carrying 70 metric tons of high-energy , fortified date bars crossed the Egyptian border last night on its way to Benghazi . This would be the first delivery of food assistance from a U.N. agency to enter the country , '' the organization said in a statement . Plans for more food deliveries are being made , and tons of food have been delivered to the Egyptian border to help feed refugees , the organization said . This is part of a $ 39.2 million emergency operation designed to help feed more than 1 million people in Libya , Egypt and Tunisia over three months , the group said . Late Monday , the Gulf Cooperation Council said Libya had rejected its offer of humanitarian aid . The council is composed of Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates . As reports continue to emerge of the government 's use of force against civilians , the international community has been left pondering strategies on how to end the violence . Three members of the U.N. Security Council -- France , Britain and the United States -- were working Monday on a possible resolution that would include language on a no-fly zone over Libya , diplomatic sources at the United Nations said . And the Gulf Cooperation Council said Monday night they supported such an action . The Organization of the Islamic Conference , which represents 56 member states , said Tuesday that it wants the United Nations to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya . But any kind of military intervention could face sharp criticism from Russia and China , two permanent members of the council that wield veto power . Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khalid Karim told CNN on Tuesday that Libya is not misusing its air force and that any no-fly zone would be tantamount to an act of war . He said the Libyan government has asked for international monitors to verify that assertion . He said the military `` are taking purely defensive positions ; they are not taking offensive ones '' except in self-defense . The U.S. administration remains reluctant to move forward on a no-fly zone alone . `` Well , we want to see the international community support it , '' Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told Sky News on Tuesday . And the United States has also been reluctant to consider using force alone . `` We 'd like to see this resolved peacefully , '' Clinton said . `` We 'd like to see him go peacefully . We would like to see a new government come peacefully . But if that 's not possible , then we 're going to work with the international community . '' Asked if the United States was considering lifting the arms embargo , she said , `` Well , I think everything is being looked at , but it is difficult in the midst of this civil conflict that is going on now to even know how you would do that , because right now , it 's not clear what part of the country is actually under rebel control . '' The U.S. ambassador to Libya , Gene Cretz , has met in Rome and Cairo with Libyan opposition figures to get a sense of what is happening in the country , Crowley of the State Department said . He did not give names . Crowley said there have been meetings and phone conversations with members of the National Transitional Council and others . The State Department also spoke Friday with Libyan Foreign Minister Musa Kusa in a brief conversation in which each side gave its view , Crowley said . NATO said it has begun round-the-clock surveillance flights near Libya . With no clear end to the clashes in sight , U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed a new special envoy to Libya to discuss the crisis with officials in Tripoli . The fighting has sparked the flight of Libyans and foreigners out of Libya , with nations across the globe scrambling to help people leave . About 200,000 people have fled Libya with nearly equal numbers going to Tunisia and Egypt , the U.N. refugee agency has said . But 15,000 to 17,000 people are still at a refugee camp near the Libya-Tunisia border . Most of them are from Bangladesh , the U.N. refugee agency said . A man who said he was trapped in Misrata , a city east of Tripoli that has seen heavy clashes , said the rebels were running out of weapons -- but will continue to fight . `` Maybe tomorrow I 'll still be alive , I do n't know . I have nothing to lose , '' the man said . `` Nobody believes he will be alive tomorrow . We need support .

Gadhafi 's overseas backing is based on a shared anti-colonial narrative , say analysts Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez says Gadhafi , `` has been my friend for a long time '' China , Russia and Turkey would not support an invasion or no-fly zone , says analyst -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Despite facing intense pressure from parts of the international community to relinquish power , the Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi can still count on the continued support of some prominent world leaders , say analysts . Much of Gadhafi 's overseas backing is based on a shared anti-colonial narrative and the instincts of some regimes to undermine the norms of the international community , experts believe . So while many countries have criticized Gadhafi in the aftermath of protests that have left more than 1,000 people dead and many more injured , according to the U.N. , some of his allies , including Venezuela and Zimbabwe , refuse to publicly criticize Libya . `` There is a natural alignment between all regimes which are into power maximization , that is , regimes trying to accumulate as much power as they can for themselves , '' says Barak Seener , a Middle East research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute , a London-based think tank . Who is the opposition in Libya ? `` Venezuela , for example , also has close links with Iran , '' added Seener . Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has called for an international good will commission to mediate in Libya ; in contrast the U.N. Security Council over the weekend voted for tough restrictions and possible war crimes charges against the Libyan regime . On Monday , Chavez said Gadhafi , `` has been my friend and our friend for a long time , '' in remarks broadcast on Venezuelan state television . And in comments made on Thursday , Chavez described alleged preparations to invade Libya as `` a madness , and in front of that madness , as always , the Yankee empire that tries to dominate the world , at the cost of fire and blood . '' The former Cuban President Fidel Castro on Thursday also condemned what he described as the inevitable U.S.-backed invasion of Libya by NATO to get its hands on that country 's oil . Seener said that countries with a record of `` domestic abuse , '' such as limiting freedom of speech and having no independent judiciary , have no sense of accountability to their people in the same way that elected powers do and that lack of perceived accountability tends to spill over into their foreign polices . Another close allay of Gadhafi is Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe . Libya has good relations with Zimbabwe , which has few international friends , says Jane Kinninmont , senior research fellow at the think tank Chatham House . `` She notes the contrast with Sudan , which was able to count on a far broader range of allies , including China and most of the Arab world , when it faced condemnation from the West over the ethnic conflict in Darfur '' . She adds that , for example , during the bloody ethnic conflict in the Sudanese region of Darfur , Sudan faced international condemnation but `` did still have its friends in the international world . '' There is also a second group of nations -- including China , Russia and Turkey -- which while unlikely to openly back Gadhafi , would not support an invasion and they would also be against a no-fly zone , said Seener . `` It is not simply a case of being anti-Western . Turkey for example is increasing diplomatic and economic links with Iran and as it does so it is entering the Iranian sphere of influence . They will not condemn what Gadhafi is doing in Libya , '' says Seener . Despite the continued backing of Gadhafi by his allies , some analysts predict a sorry end for the leader . Scott Horton , an international lawyer said : `` Deposed dictators now are subject to lawsuits , both civil suits by the governments that succeeded them and human rights suits , and they wind up being prosecuted and successfully sued . '' However , Barak Barfi of the New America Foundation said : `` I think there is a very good possibility he 'll fight to the death knowing he has very few options .

Watch `` AC360 '' at 10 p.m. ET Wednesday on CNN . Benghazi , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The head of the interim government in eastern Libya pleaded Wednesday for the international community to move quickly to impose a no-fly zone over Libya , declaring that any delay would result in more casualties . `` It has to be immediate action , '' Mustafa Abdul-Jalil told CNN in an exclusive interview in this eastern opposition stronghold . `` The longer the situation carries on , the more blood is shed . That 's the message that we want to send to the international community . They have to live up to their responsibility with regards to this . '' After the uprising began February 15 , Abdul-Jalil was among the government officials who broke with the regime . He has gone on to lead the opposition 's National Transitional Council , a 31-member group representing most regions in Libya . The group has met in Benghazi , an eastern town that has become an opposition stronghold . Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi told a Turkish reporter in an interview Tuesday that the imposition of a no-fly zone would simply unite the Libyan people behind him . `` They will be united against the new attempt for occupation and imperialistic interests and it will be clear that they are conspiring against Libya , '' he said . `` It will also be clear that the intentions are to control Libya 's oil , choke Libya 's liberty , land and people . '' Secret voices speak out in Libya Massive explosions rock Libyan oil town The risks of a Libya no-fly zone Abdul-Jalil 's remarks came shortly after Gadhafi 's regime announced a reward for Abdul-Jalil 's capture , branding him `` an agent spy . '' In an `` urgent '' banner on state television , the government said its General Administration for Criminal Investigation was offering 500,000 Libyan dinars -LRB- $ 410,900 U.S. -RRB- `` for whoever captures and hands over '' the `` agent spy '' Abdul-Jalil , and `` another offer of 200,000 Libyan dinars -LRB- $ 164,300 U.S. -RRB- for whoever offers information leading to his actual arrest . '' In a letter to the U.N. General Assembly , the transitional council asked that it be recognized as `` the sole representative of all Libya . '' It also asked the international community to `` fulfill its obligations to protect the Libyan people from any further genocide and crimes against humanity without any direct military intervention on Libyan soil . '' The letter , which was dated March 5 , was made public Wednesday . The move to target Abdul-Jalil came as Gadhafi fought to advance against rebels who have taken control of many parts of the country . On Wednesday , pro-Gadhafi forces launched fresh attacks on Ras Lanuf , using planes and heavy artillery in an effort to retake the eastern oil city . Opposition fighters , armed with anti-aircraft guns and Soviet rifles , were outgunned by the heavily armed pro-Gadhafi forces . CNN 's Ben Wedeman reported that an intense artillery bombardment was under way on the western edge of Ras Lanuf , where ambulances lined up to the emergency ward at Ras Lanuf 's only hospital to drop off the wounded . More than 25 people were wounded , said Dr. Ali Al-Bart , at Ras Lanuf Hospital . `` It 's very bad , the situation is very bad , '' he said . Opposition efforts remained , but appeared weak . Ahmed Faturi left his clothing store in Benghazi to carry a SAM-7 surface-to-air missile , but knew he had little chance of hitting a plane with it . And he expressed little hope that a no-fly zone would ever materialize . `` Just talk , '' he said . A few days ago , the rebel forces were advancing steadily westward toward Gadhafi 's stronghold in the capital city of Tripoli . But that advancement appears to have reversed . In Ras Lanuf , an oil storage tank to the west was hit in the fighting , though it was not clear who was responsible . Libyan state television reported that `` armed groups supported by al Qaeda blew up an oil tank as they withdrew from Ras Lanuf against the advancing Libyan armed forces . '' The attack marked the first time since the rebellion began more than three weeks ago that Libya 's oil infrastructure has been damaged . Gadhafi has shown no sign of giving up . On state television , he again insisted Tuesday night that youths misled and drugged by al Qaeda were to blame for the fighting . `` For them , everybody 's their enemy , '' Gadhafi said . `` They know nothing other than killing . '' Inside the mind of a dictator The speech was recorded earlier Tuesday when Gadhafi addressed a youth group of tribal supporters , urging them to defend Libya from those who envy its standard of living . `` They want to take your petrol , '' he said . `` This is what America , this is what the French , those colonialists , want . '' A private Libyan aircraft crossed Greek airspace Wednesday en route to Cairo , Egypt , and the pilot said there were two passengers on board , according to Greek civil aviation authorities . The pilot did not identify the passengers , aviation authorities said . Multiple media reports said the plane landed in Cairo . The development raised questions about whether Libyan officials may have flown to Cairo . On Tuesday , an opposition member said Gadhafi was negotiating an exit deal , but other opposition members and the government denied that . In the fourth week of what has become a civil war , Gadhafi 's regime has held on to the capital , while losing control to the opposition in some other areas . Benghazi , in eastern Libya , is an opposition stronghold . People in some towns in the western part of the country told CNN Wednesday their areas were under rebel control . In Zuwarah , two sources said the city , which is located between Zawiya and the country 's western border , with Tunisia , was surrounded by Gadhafi supporters but most shops and banks were operating normally . A witness described the scene as tense , with schools , government offices and businesses closed . Demonstrations were no longer being held because , the witness said , `` There is no one to protest against . '' Two Zuwarah residents said `` messengers from Gadhafi '' had warned local leaders Wednesday to surrender or face attack . The `` messengers '' told the leaders that replacing the pre-Gadhafi regime flag in the city with the government 's green flag would be interpreted as a sign of solidarity with the regime , the sources said . They added that there had been implicit threats against Zuwarah to bomb two nearby facilities : a petro-chemical plant 15 kilometers away and a gas export facility 30 kilometers away . In Zawiya , two sources said the fighting continued in the city center Wednesday , but to a lesser extent than on Tuesday . They said the opposition occupied the city center , which was surrounded by the military . On the outskirts of the city , pro-Gadhafi rallies were being held , they said . But Libyan television reported that Gadhafi supporters were celebrating `` the liberation of the town from the armed terrorist elements backed by al Qaeda '' in the main square . Access to the city was limited . A witness told CNN she tried to travel from Tripoli to Zawiya but was turned away at various checkpoints . Communications were so difficult that CNN was not able to talk with anyone in the city . One Zawiya resident , who told CNN she had to make the 40-minute trip to Tripoli to make a phone call , said there had been no electricity in Zawiya for the previous day . In addition , two medical clinics that were shut Tuesday by the military remained closed Wednesday , she said . Another source who fled Zawiya Tuesday for the Tunisian border said many bodies in the city lay unclaimed because relatives -- fearing violence -- would not go to graveyards to bury them . Residents of Zuwarah sent weapons , explosives , and medical supplies via a small boat to Zawiya , the witness said . The man who drove the boat dropped the supplies immediately upon arrival and fled out of fear . Libyan state TV showed video of government supporters cheering in Zawiya 's streets and hoisting the government flag on Wednesday . Witnesses said fear remained widespread in the capital , where schools were closed . A resident said she called several banks to ask about taking out money but was told that there was a shortage of cash . Nalut was under opposition control and calm Wednesday , a witness said . In Ajdabiya and Misrata , spokesmen for opposition groups said those towns remained under opposition control and were calm as well . Two doctors in Misrata said medical supplies were in short supply . More than 80 people remained at Central Misrata Hospital recovering from wounds suffered Sunday in fighting , they said . Libya 's government sought Wednesday to influence international sentiment , announcing that Libya 's secretary of state for international relations will travel to Portugal , Greece and Malta on an exploratory fact-finding mission that may include other destinations . Libya has invited British , French , Dutch and German fact-finding teams to Libya to examine reports of aerial bombardment and massacres . Libya had received no response from any of the invitees . The decision about whether to impose a no-fly zone is a complicated one , said Nicholas Burns , a former U.S. ambassador to NATO . `` There 's no assurance that the imposition of even a no-fly zone would make a decisive difference in the battle , '' Burns said . `` Gadhafi has ground forces . He has artillery , he has a mercenary army . That 's 95 percent of the fighting under way in Libya . '' And it would not prove to be a panacea , the head of the U.S. Marine Corps told lawmakers Tuesday . Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James F. Amos said that a no-fly zone would do little to thwart Libya 's helicopters , which he called `` their greatest threat . '' A no-fly zone would typically be enforced by fighter jets whose speed and altitude make it difficult to target helicopters , which move low and slow , Amos said . For its part , Libya said it was not misusing its air force . Any no-fly zone would be tantamount to an act of war , Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khalid Karim said Tuesday . The military , he said , `` are taking purely defensive positions ; they are not taking offensive ones . '' He said the Libyan government has asked for international monitors to verify that assertion . The protests against the 68-year-old Gadhafi began February 15 as anti-government demonstrators sought his ouster after nearly 42 years of rule . Death toll estimates have ranged from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000 . And the war has forced out 215,000 people , many of them poor migrant workers who have been stranded at both the Tunisian and Egyptian borders , the U.N. refugee agency has said . While many countries chartered planes and dispatched ships to whisk away their citizens to safety , those stuck at the border are sheltered in cramped , unsanitary quarters with little to eat . The United Nations ' special representative for children and armed conflict , Radhika Coomaraswamy , said her office had received unconfirmed reports of violence against children , `` including killing and maiming and use of children as combatants and the denial of humanitarian access . '' Valerie Amos , the United Nations under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator , called for all Libyan civilians to be protected . `` I am deeply concerned about the reportedly indiscriminate nature of the fighting , and particularly the use of heavy artillery and aerial bombardments , '' she said in a statement . `` We are also hearing reports of hospital closures at the very time when people most need medical care . '' The U.N. World Food Programme has initiated a $ 39.2 million emergency operation intended to provide food to more than 1 million people in Libya , Egypt and Tunisia over a three-month period . In the latest sign of international solidarity with the Libyan opposition , a group of people entered a home in London Wednesday owned by Saif Gadhafi , the Libyan leader 's son who has spoken on behalf of the regime in recent weeks . They could be seen hanging a banner out an upstairs window with a picture of Gadhafi in a red circle with a line through it . `` Out of Libya , '' the sign says , `` Out of London . '' London Metropolitan police said only the situation was `` being treated as a civil matter .

Even as it targeted its domestic enemies , the Tripoli government continued to parry with leaders around the globe . Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim , for instance , said Friday that Libya has suspended diplomatic relations with France , one day after the French government recognized the newly created Libyan opposition movement as the sole representative of the country . In Ras Lanuf , pro-Gadhafi forces cranked up an intense and steady bombardment of the city , believed to be by rocket , artillery and tank fire . A storage tank at an oil refinery was on fire after an air raid there . `` We saw a bomb fall about a kilometer to the southwest of the refinery , and moments later saw thick black smoke rising from the refinery . We do n't know , and no one we spoke to could say with any level of certainty or veracity , what caused the fire , '' said CNN Correspondent Ben Wedeman . Dozens of pickup trucks and cars belonging to the opposition were heading away from the city amid fear that Libyan forces were advancing as the bombardment continued . The rebels evacuated to a checkpoint outside the town , but that and other rebel positions also were targeted by airstrikes . Rebel forces retreat in Libya Are Libyan rebels losing momentum ? NATO awaits U.N. mandate on Libya Rebels said the eastern city has been essentially empty as civilians fled and opposition forces retreated from sustained attacks . On Thursday , state media said the town was `` cleansed '' of the fighters . This reflects the turn in fortunes for Gadhafi 's well-equipped military , which has gained an upper hand after rebel fighters seized ground across Libya . Along with its offensive in Ras Lanuf , government soldiers beat back rebels Thursday in Zawiya east of the capital , Tripoli . Zawiya 's Martyrs ' Square was littered with the bombed-out , scorched carcasses of army tanks and other military vehicles . Workers swept up the evidence as Gadhafi supporters chanted slogans and waved green flags . Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , one of Gadhafi 's sons and a spokesman for the regime , vowed Thursday to retake other areas in eastern Libya that were controlled by the opposition and warned the international community that Libyans wo n't welcome NATO and Americans . NATO is contemplating the establishment of a no-fly zone , but says it needs a clear U.N. mandate to do it . `` I receive hundreds of calls from the east daily , and they are saying , ` Save us . ' They are begging us and pleading for us to save them , and my answer is two words . Listen to me , and I want those armed groups to listen to me real well , and I want our people in the east to hear this as well : We 're coming , '' he said . Saif al-Islam Gadhafi is one of two Moammar Gadhafi sons who share the first name Saif . On the diplomatic front , meanwhile , opposition to Moammar Gadhafi continues to gain momentum . U.S. President Barack Obama reiterated Friday that he wants the Libyan leader to `` step down . '' He added that he `` wo n't take -LRB- the -RRB- decision lightly '' to decide whether to use military force , including helping enforce a no-fly zone , saying it is critical to `` balance costs versus benefits . '' Obama noted that NATO officials will meet Tuesday to consider whether to implement a no-fly zone . He said U.S. actions so far , including freezing assets and other sanctions , are `` slowly tightening the noose '' on Gadhafi . `` We have moved about as swiftly as an international coalition has ever moved to impose sanctions , '' he said . The U.S. Treasury Department beefed up those sanctions Friday , freezing the assets of nine more individuals . Among them are the wife and four sons of Libya 's leader , including Saadi , Hannibal , Muhammad and Saif Al-Arab Gadhafi . Libya 's defense minister , military intelligence director , external security organization head and public works coordinator are also included . Also Friday , U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon introduced former Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah Khatib as his new special envoy to Libya . Khatib will leave New York over the weekend , accompanied by humanitarian and U.N. officials , to `` convey , in no uncertain terms , the concerns of the United Nations and the international community , '' Ban said . `` I -LRB- hope -RRB- that this effort ... will succeed in stopping the killings and ending the suffering of the civilian population , in addressing their humanitarian needs and in preserving the unity of the Libyan people and the territorial integrity of their homeland , '' Khatib said , adding that Gadhafi 's government `` welcomed '' the visit . In Brussels , Belgium , the European Council , a body of the European Union , issued a declaration saying Gadhafi `` must relinquish power immediately . '' `` His regime has lost all legitimacy and is no longer an interlocutor for the EU . The European Union has adopted restrictive measures against the country 's leadership and against entities holding sizeable assets controlled by the regime and stands ready to adopt further sanctions . `` The objective is for Libya to rapidly embark on an orderly transition to democracy through a broad-based dialogue . The European Union welcomes and encourages the interim transitional national council based in Benghazi which it considers a political interlocutor . '' Some members are clearer than others in their support for the National Transitional Council as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people . French President Nicolas Sarkozy said in his news conference that `` we consider the National Council based in Benghazi as the proper interlocutors for Libya and they need to be recognized as such and encouraged . '' German Chancellor Angela Merkel was more cautious in her approach to the council and called them a possible interlocutor . Sarkozy said the European Council decision is a very strong one , and he stressed that a U.N. mandate and a request from the region are needed for intervention . `` We are considering and examining all necessary options to deal with the situation , '' he said . `` We can not stand by and watch this happen . '' He would n't say whether France or Britain would take unilateral military action if a U.N. mandate was n't achieved . British Prime Minister David Cameron said in Brussels that authorities are tightening `` the net '' on Gadhafi and `` his henchman '' with tougher financial sanctions . `` We have added the Libyan Central Bank and the Libyan Investment Authority to the Libyan EU asset freezing list and , in doing so , the UK has frozen a total of 12 billion pounds of Libyan assets , '' Cameron said . On Friday , the Libyan ambassador to the United States and to the United Nations will call on the United States to follow France 's lead and recognize the opposition as the legitimate representative of Libya . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has announced plans to meet with opposition leaders when she visits Tunisia and Egypt next week . She said the United States was suspending relations with the Libyan Embassy in Washington , and an administration official added that the embassy `` must shut down .

Ras Lanuf , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libya 's ragtag rebels in Zawiya succumbed Thursday to better armed and organized government soldiers after enduring a week of attacks that left the coastal city strewn with the debris of war . The city 's main Martyrs ' Square was littered with the bombed-out , scorched carcasses of army tanks and other military vehicles . Workers were sweeping up the evidence as supporters of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi chanted slogans and waved green flags . `` Today Zawiya , tomorrow Benghazi , '' ITV News ' Bill Neely said a Gadhafi supporteer told him in a reference to Libya 's main rebel-held city in the east . Journalists beaten , tortured in Libya Neely said he was the first reporter to reach the city center Thursday after the government wrested its control from the rebels . He said doctors had told him that scores of civilians had been wounded or killed in the siege ; they called the onslaught a massacre , a war crime . He counted more than 20 freshly dug graves . The city itself was quiet ; shops were closed and houses appeared empty . The mosque 's minaret was demolished , and spent bullets and other munitions lay on the ground with bloodied mlitary clothing . State-run television broadcast video of weapons and ammunition reportedly left behind by the rebels , whom the reporter referred to as `` terrorists , dogs and traitors , '' Neely said . Government retaliation against the residents appears to have begun , said one man , who told ITV that government forces were carrying out house-to-house searches in Zawiya . `` They start to arrest people , normal people , '' he said . `` Some of them I know personally ; they have nothing to do with what 's happening . '' Battles also raged in and around the eastern city of Ras Lanuf and many other cities , with the regime using planes and heavy artillery in its effort to reclaim areas that had been taken by the opposition . Libya 's state TV reported that `` Ras Lanuf has been cleansed from the armed gangs connected to al Qaeda . '' A doctor who worked in Ras Lanuf said at least three people were killed and 30 wounded in fighting before the main hospital had to be evacuated . Doctors at a hospital in the city of al-Brega reported two deaths and more than 20 people wounded in fighting in Ras Lanuf . Opposition forces could be seen retreating from the city . Some fighters said they had pulled back to a checkpoint five miles east of the city , but it was not clear who was in control of the city . CNN 's Ben Wedeman said the rebel forces appeared in disarray . `` It 's been a very chaotic effort on the part of the opposition fighters from the beginning , '' he said , adding that they had no command-and-control structure and little discipline . He credited them for their enthusiasm and spirit , but added , `` Once the going gets tough , the ranks start to fall apart and it descends into anarchy , chaos . '' Reporter : Libyan army fired at civilians Saif Gadhafi , a son of Moammar Gadhafi and a prominent spokesman for the regime , vowed to retake eastern Libya as well and insisted his father still commanded support . `` I receive hundreds of calls from the east daily and they are saying , ` Save us .

'' He bristled at the possibility of military intervention . `` The Libyan people they will never welcome NATO or Americans , '' he said . `` Libya is not a piece of cake ; we are not a Mickey Mouse . '' Though the Libyan government forces appeared to advance on the ground , the opposition gained momentum internationally . The French government recognized the newly created Libyan opposition movement as the sole representative of the country and the British foreign secretary spoke to an opposition representative over the phone . In response , Libyan state TV said the Gadhafi government would consider ending its relationship with France . In the United States , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced plans to meet with opposition leaders . She said the United States was suspending relations with the Libyan Embassy in Washington , and an administration official added the embassy `` must shut down . '' But an official told CNN that `` ending the operations of the Libyan Embassy does not mean we 're cutting off diplomatic ties with Libya . '' Protests against the 68-year-old Gadhafi began February 15 as anti-government demonstrators sought his ouster after nearly 42 years of rule , and the discontent devolved into a fierce and bloody civil war . America 's top U.S. intelligence official , James Clapper , took note of Libya 's military prowess at a Senate Armed Services Committee meeting Thursday . He said Gadhafi is in the fight for the long haul , with military far superior to that of the opposition . Clapper described the Libyan air defense as `` substantial , '' saying it is the region 's second-largest , after Egypt , but he did not address how fighting would fare against Libya if a no-fly zone or other military strategies were imposed . He said Gadhafi has a lot of aircraft , although many are not operational . To `` some extent , '' he said , the aircraft have been used for attacks , but they have caused more structural damage than injury . In Brussels , Belgium , NATO defense ministers discussed the option of a no-fly zone over the North African country . Its secretary-general said any move to impose one would require a clear mandate from the United Nations . NATO also decided to bolster its presence in the Mediterranean Sea and perform detailed planning on humanitarian assistance . International military officials say the imposition of a no-fly zone could be complicated , but some opposition figures -- such as Mustafa Abdul-Jalil , a former justice minister who quit last month in protest and now heads the interim government in eastern Libya -- are advocating for the move . Gadhafi has said that imposing such a zone would simply unite Libyans behind him . Saying NATO is `` united , '' `` vigilant , '' and `` ready to act , '' Anders Fogh Rasmussen , the group 's secretary-general , said the body has begun round-the-clock airborne surveillance of Libya 's airspace . `` Time is of the essence , '' he said , adding that the crisis requires `` close international coordination '' among organizations such as NATO , the United Nations , the European Union , the African Union , and the Arab League . U.S. authorities have frozen $ 32 billion in assets tied to the Libyan regime , White House spokesman Jay Carney said . British Foreign Secretary William Hague spoke by telephone with Mahmoud Jabril , the National Transitional Council 's special envoy . He said European foreign ministers on Thursday talked about how the EU should react `` to the continuing appalling and unacceptable actions '' of the regime . Hague `` made clear that planning was under way on a full range of responses , including the possible establishment of a no-fly zone , '' the Foreign Office said in a statement . `` It would need international support , a clear trigger and a legal basis . He also said that another diplomatic mission would be sent to Benghazi shortly . '' At the NATO meeting , U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said a no-fly zone option was still being considered , but was only in the planning stages . Gates added that any military response to Libya would need the United Nations to sanction it . Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed an executive order banning the sale to Libya of arms , ammunition and military equipment , according to the Kremlin 's website . The Council of the European Union Thursday announced it will extend restrictions against Libyan entities . As for Gadhafi 's government , it has sought to influence international sentiment , announcing that its secretary of state for international relations will travel to Portugal , Greece and Malta on an exploratory , fact-finding mission that may include other destinations . The country has also invited British , French , Dutch and German fact-finding teams to examine reports of aerial bombardment and massacres . None has taken up Gadhafi on the offer . Death toll estimates have ranged from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000 . As of Thursday morning , the war had forced out nearly 250,000 people , many of them poor migrant workers who have been stranded at both the Tunisian and Egyptian borders , the U.N. refugee agency said . The United States will soon send disaster relief teams into eastern Libya , White House National Security Adviser Thomas Donilon said . He said the teams ' activities should not be viewed as military operations . U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay on Thursday condemned the detention and possible torture by Libyan authorities of a BBC news team working to cover the conflict in Zawiya . The journalists , released from detention in Libya Wednesday , told of beatings and mock executions . The Guardian , a British daily newspaper , reported that one of its correspondents , Ghaith Abdul-Ahad , was missing . He was traveling with Andrei Netto of the Brazilian newspaper Estado , who was detained by authorities while reporting from Libya , the Guardian said .

Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States plans to send `` purely humanitarian '' disaster relief teams into eastern Libya , where rebels battling longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi may be losing ground in that country 's civil war , top U.S. officials said Thursday . White House National Security Adviser Thomas Donilon told reporters that the U.S. Agency for International Development teams will be sent into monitor the delivery of humanitarian aid and should not be viewed as a military operation . `` It can in no way shape or form be seen as military intervention , '' Donilon said . The teams will assess that humanitarian aid is being delivered , he said , adding , `` This is purely humanitarian to better assist in a humanitarian way the people of Libya . '' Donilon 's announcement came as officials in Washington , Europe and the Middle East are debating whether to aid rebel forces , who have been battling to topple Gadhafi since mid-February . But in a blunt assessment to Congress , National Intelligence Director James Clapper said Gadhafi 's advantage in military force makes him likely to survive the revolt . Are Libyan rebels losing momentum ? Clinton : Libya will be held accountable NATO awaits U.N. mandate on Libya McCain talks possible Libyan no-fly zone Clapper told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the rebels are `` in for a tough row '' against Gadhafi , who still commands warplanes , an air-defense network and loyal army brigades against the opposition forces . He cautioned that the situation is `` very fluid , '' but added , `` I think , longer term , the regime will prevail . '' `` I do believe Gadhafi is in this for the long haul , '' Clapper said . `` I do n't think he has any intention , despite some of the press speculation to the contrary , of leaving . From all evidence that we have -- which I 'd be prepared to discuss in closed session -- he appears to be hunkering down for the duration . '' The comment led to a call for Clapper 's firing by a member of the committee , South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham . In a statement issued after the hearing , Graham said the remarks were `` not helpful to our national security interests . '' But Clapper 's assessment was backed up by Lt. Gen. Ronald Burgess , the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency . Burgess told senators that Gadhafi `` seems to have staying power , unless some other dynamic changes at this time . '' At NATO headquarters in Belgium , meanwhile , Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Thursday the allies are moving to beef up their naval presence off Libya to provide better surveillance and have discussed `` initial options '' for imposing a no-fly zone over the country in the event the U.N. Security Council approves one . But Clapper warned that the Libyan network of radar and anti-aircraft batteries is `` quite substantial , '' though some of the equipment has fallen into rebel hands . Libyan forces also have a large number of shoulder-fired missiles , `` And , of course , there 's great concern there about them falling into the wrong hands . '' The Obama administration has called on Gadhafi , who took power in a 1969 coup , to step down . France recognized the newly created Libyan opposition movement as the sole representative of the country on Thursday . And Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told a House committee that Washington is `` suspending '' its ties to the Libyan Embassy and reaching out to opposition leaders `` inside and outside of Libya . '' The move effectively orders the embassy to close , though it stops short of breaking U.S.-Libyan diplomatic relations , a senior administration official told CNN . `` This is recognition that Gadhafi is no longer the legitimate leader of Libya , and therefore his representatives should leave , '' said the official , who was not authorized to speak on the record . Libyan Ambassador Ali Aujali abandoned Gadhafi last month , and the United States has not recognized his replacement , the official said . Aujali met Thursday with Clinton , telling reporters afterward that they discussed whether the United States should recognize the Libyan rebels -- a move he said would `` give us room to move , and to act , and to explain our views and to be received by different countries and different officials . '' U.S. recognition is `` very , very important , '' he said adding that Washington `` needs `` to stop Gadhafi and his family from killing our people . '' Clinton plans to meet with some of those figures during a visit to Tunisia and Egypt next week , she told the House Appropriations Committee . And at the White House , spokesman Jay Carney said the United Strates is still assessing opposition group `` to find out what their vision is , who they represent , what their ideas are and where they would take Libya in a post-Gadhafi future . '' The U.S. Ambassador to Libya , Gene Cretz , apparently spoke to the head of the opposition 's military council sometime after the revolt began , according to a recorded conversation played on Libyan state television Thursday . An opposition spokesman , Khaled Alsayeh , told CNN the call was intended to lay the groundwork for future communications , but the caller -- identified as Gen. Omar Hariri -- hung up before Cretz asked what equipment or support the rebels needed . A U.S. official , who would not talk on the record because of the sensitivity of the issue , confirmed the authenticity of the call to CNN , but there was no indication when it was recorded . The State Department shuttered its embassy in Tripoli and evacuated U.S. diplomats in late February . CNN 's Pam Benson and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report .

NEW : Spokeswoman says Clapper is standing by his comments on Libya NEW : National security adviser : Clapper was giving a `` flat-out resources analysis '' In testimony , he said Libyan regime would `` prevail '' over rebels , prompting criticism His statement that China , Russia pose greatest threat to U.S. irks Sen. Carl Levin Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A spokeswoman for James Clapper said the embattled director of national intelligence stands by remarks he made Thursday `` about the current military situation in Libya '' that prompted a leading Republican senator to call for his resignation . The Obama administration also said Clapper still has its `` full faith and confidence . '' Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina , a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , issued a statement criticizing Clapper 's testimony , made during a committee hearing earlier in the day , that Moammar Gadhafi 's regime would `` prevail '' over rebels seeking to oust the 68-year-old dictator from power in Libya . `` His comments will make the situation more difficult for those opposing Gadhafi , '' said Graham , adding they undercut U.S. efforts and should not have been made in a public forum . Graham cited two previous occasions in which Clapper made misstatements , and said his comments on the Libya situation `` should be the final straw . '' Jamie Smith , director of public affairs for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence , said that Clapper 's testimony `` provided a snapshot of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the regime and the opposition . As he stated in his testimony , the situation in Libya is very fluid . '' `` Many factors will come into play over time including the pressure being brought to bear by the international community as well as the Libyan people 's clear desire for change , '' Smith said . `` As this dynamic situation evolves , the Intelligence Community will continue to provide its best assessment of the current situation as well as identify opportunities that project into the future . '' Clapper 's comment on Libya was not the only one that got him in trouble with some members of the armed services committee . In an exchange with Democratic Sens. Carl Levin of Michigan and Joe Manchin of West Virginia over what nation posed the greatest threat to the United States , the director focused his responses on the chief nuclear rivals , China and Russia , rather than on the regimes in North Korea and Iran , which are openly belligerent . Clapper went on to clarify his answer , to which Levin gave lukewarm acceptance , but later Thursday , Senate Intelligence Chairman Dianne Feinstein , D-California , called the director 's response on the threat issue `` a problem '' and , when asked by CNN , pointedly declined to say she had confidence in him . `` On the question on the two nations with the greatest intent to harm ours , I do not believe they 're China and Russia , '' said Feinstein , who was not at the hearing . `` I do n't understand why that was put out there . So , that 's a problem . '' Asked whether Clapper has problems communicating , Feinstein responded , `` I do n't know what it is and I 'm not going to speculate , but clearly there 's a problem ... I would like the opportunity to look more deeply into it , OK ? '' Other senators , including John McCain , R-Arizona , and Joseph Lieberman , a Connecticut independent who caucuses with Democrats , expressed support for Clapper . McCain said the director was `` doing a very fine job . '' White House press secretary Jay Carney defended Clapper and said his words were misinterpreted . `` If you look closely at the transcript of what Director Clapper said , he was answering a question with regard to military capacity , '' Carney said . `` Obviously , Russia and China are two of the three largest nuclear powers in the world , therefore they have dangerous weapons and they have the capacity , but he made clear that we do not view Russia and China as a threat . '' And in a follow-up answer regarding Clapper 's Libya statement , Carney said Graham 's response `` was based on a real misinterpretation of what Director Clapper said today . '' Asked if the president still had confidence in Clapper , Carney said , `` Yes , full faith and confidence . '' In a conference-call phone briefing Thursday night , National Security Adviser Tom Donilon said he believed Clapper `` was presenting a kind of a flat-out resources analysis '' of the situation in Libya . `` He went through the kind of equipment and resources that the regime has . '' `` And I think if you look at it , he said from a standpoint of attrition , if you do an attrition analysis , you get to his conclusion . '' In the same conference call , Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes addressed the issue of specific adversary nations , saying the issue is `` a matter of capability -LRB- in the case of China and Russia -RRB- versus intent '' to be a U.S. adversary `` that leads you to focus on nations such as North Korea , organizations such as al Qaeda , who again are a great focus of what we do here every day . '' That seemed to be the thrust of Clapper 's protracted exchange on Thursday after Manchin asked Clapper what nations he thought posed the greatest threat to the United States . Clapper said Russia and China posed a mortal threat , citing their nuclear arsenals and military capabilities . But he added that he did n't think either nation had the intent to strike the United States . That clearly was not the answer Levin expected . . `` You did n't mention Iran or North Korea , which would have been the first two countries I would have thought of in response to that question , '' the committee chairman . `` I was really kind of taken aback almost by your answer . '' Clapper explained that he interpreted the question to be what countries pose a `` mortal threat '' to the United States . `` Iran and North Korea are , you know of great concern . I do n't know at this point in time they pose a direct mortal threat to the continental United States , '' he said . Levin pressed Clapper on whether Russia and China were a direct mortal threat to the United States , and Clapper reiterated that they both had the capability , but it was unlikely they had the intent . Levin then flipped the question : `` By that measure we represent the direct mortal threat to both of them , right ? '' Clapper seemed to avoid a direct answer but eventually answered yes . Manchin stepped in to to see if he could clarify Clapper 's position by asking which nation has the intent to be the greatest adversary . Clapper answered , `` Probably China , '' which once again set Levin off . `` I 'm just as surprised by that answer as I was by your first answer , '' Levin said . Clapper tried to explain that he was `` loath '' to pick one country and restated that both China and Russia have the capability , but he did n't think either had the intent . Levin suggested Clapper needs to be more careful with his words . `` When the Director of National Intelligence talks about what are the greatest threats , unless he starts with capabilities , and uses that , and does n't just answer ` China and Russia ' the way he did -- I was concerned by the answer . '' After the hearing , Levin issued a statement saying , `` I was taken aback by Director Clapper 's statement about China and Russia and , frankly , I was surprised by how long it took him to correct the impression that he created . He did finally correct it , however , and I am glad that he did , and I am satisfied with his correction . '' This is n't the first time Clapper has had to explain comments he has made . He was called on the carpet last month for referring to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt as a secular organization at another Congressional hearing . And during an interview with ABC News in December 2010 , Clapper appeared unaware of a terrorist plot that had been interrupted in Britain earlier in the day . In both cases , the Office of the Director of National Intelligence put out statements on Clapper 's behalf . In the instance of the ABC News interview , the office said the director had not been briefed on the UK terror plot .

His comments followed a call by European Union leaders earlier Friday for Gadhafi to `` relinquish power immediately , '' and France 's embrace of the Libyan opposition leadership . The U.S. Treasury Department on Friday added nine more Libyans , including Gadhafi 's wife and several more of his children , to a list that freezes their assets in the United States and restricts their dealings with U.S. entities .

At a White House news conference , Obama outlined steps the United States has taken so far to pressure Gadhafi to step down , including the previously announced sanctions as well as talks with NATO allies on the possibility of establishing a no-fly zone over Libya . He noted that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would meet with Libyan opposition figures in coming days during a trip to Egypt and Tunisia , and that his government has assigned `` a representative whose specific job is to interact with the opposition and determine ways that we can further help them . '' However , Libya 's former U.S. ambassador , who resigned last month in protest of Gadhafi 's violence against protesters , called Friday for the United States to recognize the newly created opposition National Transitional Council he now represents . `` We want recognition from all the rest of the world for this council , '' Ali Aujali told Libyan-American supporters and reporters . The French government on Thursday recognized the opposition council as the sole representative of the country , and the British foreign secretary spoke to an opposition representative over the phone . German Chancellor Angela Merkel was more cautious , calling the Libyan council a possible interlocutor . Clinton told a House committee Thursday that Washington was `` suspending '' its ties to the Libyan Embassy and reaching out to opposition leaders `` inside and outside of Libya . '' The move effectively orders the embassy to close , though it stops short of breaking U.S.-Libyan diplomatic relations , a senior administration official told CNN . Aujali abandoned Gadhafi last month , and the United States has not recognized his replacement , the official said . Obama has been criticized by Republicans and some Democrats for not ordering a no-fly zone over Libya or other steps intended to prevent Gadhafi from using military force against his own people . Both Obama and Clinton have said any U.S. military involvement must be part of an international effort , preferably sanctioned by the United Nations and Arab governments . Obama said Friday that NATO officials will meet next week to consider creating a no-fly zone over Libya . On Thursday , White House National Security Adviser Thomas Donilon said the U.S. government planned to send `` purely humanitarian '' disaster relief teams into eastern Libya , where rebels battling Gadhafi were losing ground . The U.S. Agency for International Development teams will be sent into monitor the delivery of humanitarian aid and should not be viewed as a military operation , he said .

ET\\/PT GPS will tackle other trouble spots around the world . The death toll in Libya continues to mount . Do the rebels have a chance of successfully fighting back ? And just what role can the U.S. play to help the opposition triumph ? Fareed offers his take on what America needs to do to keep the rebels ' hopes alive . We 're bringing you four Arab voices discussing the future of the region . What does the Arab world want the U.S. and the international community to do ? Which regime might be the next to fall ? Our all-star panel includes : - Abderrahim Foukara , Al Jazeera 's DC Bureau chief - Rashid Khalidi , Professor of Modern Arab Studies at Columbia University - Rami Khouri , editor-at-large of the Beirut-based Daily Star newspaper Then , two nations that are close to the brink : First , Pakistan continues to slip further into chaos . The assassinations mount and the drumbeat of Islamic extremism is getting louder . Fareed sits down with the man Christopher Hitchens calls `` Pakistan 's best and bravest reporter , '' Ahmed Rashid , to find out just how unstable this nuclear nation is becoming . Then , the country that seems perpetually in peril : Somalia . The new Prime Minister of Somalia , Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed , discusses whether his country can finally shake off 20 years of lawlessness . And finally a last look at just what the average Joe -LRB- or Jane -RRB- really looks like . Tune in this Sunday at 10a . What America needs to do about Libya is absolutely nothing at all . We have no right whatsoever to decide the outcome of this civil war nor Libya 's furture . Furthermore , I 'm quite aggravated at the right-wing news media for their villification of Mohammar Qadaffi and their glorification of the so-called `` rebels '' who they say wants to bring `` democracy '' to Libya ! March 12 , 2011 at 2:17 pm | Reply Perhaps some day , you and your family or your people , will be threatened by tyrants , dictators , egomaniacs and the like . You would pray for intervention by any one and any means possible to save you . As far as Kadafy be `` vilified , '' youmust be watching Libyan State TV . `` A mind is a terrible thing to waste , '' and your statement exemplifies the results of such .

March 13 , 2011 at 2:14 pm | Reply The Arab league has spoken and supports a `` No Fly Zone . '' It is time for the Egyptian Army -LRB- funded by the United States -RRB- to come to the aid of their Libyan brothers . The Tunisian and Egyptian people certainly do not think that a revitalized Gadhafi government is in their best interests . Let their ground forces and military hardware help the Libyan opposition forces while coalition forces -LRB- supported by the Arab League and the UN -RRB- take out the Libyan Airforce . March 14 , 2011 at 12:48 pm | Reply Fareed is a very smart man and thus his show is always thought provoking . His open mind and high intellect must leave him respectively loney around CNN most of the time . The Libya\\/Saudi issue has certainly painted the Americans into a corner now and it should be interesting to see how they wiggle out of it . How do you claim to support the protesters -LRB- rebels -RRB- and their fight for freedom , democracy and a better standard of living ... then ignore the same thing happening in Saudi Arabia ? To this point it actually seems worse in S.A. since the international media has been largley either contained or totally prevented from reporting ... even as Saudi leaders opennly threaten violence against any who dare raise a finger against them . So which is it ... ? Core values should n't depend on the amount of oil someone has ... but apparently it does . That 's just amazing . March 12 , 2011 at 5:54 pm | Reply Hopefully Fareed and his panel will address the hypocrisy regarding the American stance on the present Middle East situation . A previous post touches on the glorification and villification taking place in the media . As one who has followed this story very closely it certainly appears that unbiased reporting is simply not happening . We see footage of rebels firing big rockets in the general direction of cities yet by all admissions they are n't trained at all and likley have no idea where they 'll land and explode . Yet nothing of the possible relationship between that and innocent people being killed ? We saw many thousands of immigrant workers fleeing the country after being threatened , beaten , raped and robbed by Libyans ... yet no reporting on which Libyans ... why ? There 's been much reported about the Libyan planes dropping bombs yet nothing about the very obvious control being shown `` not '' to blow up crowds of armed protesters . Still waiting to hear from the the Americans if all of the compassion they seem to have for the rebels will also apply to rebels in Saudi Arabia when they stand up for their freedom and dreams of democracy ? So far it seems they 're sticking their heads in the sand and ignoring everything they claimed to care about ... supporting peaceful protest ... assisting people seeking democracy ... and stand behind those fighting oppression ... and what about that freedom of the press thing ? I guess 20 % of global oil can buy some pretty big blinders ... Wow ! March 12 , 2011 at 6:36 pm | Reply The problem here Neil , is the biased reporting by the right-wing news media against Qadaffi and the even yet more tyranical Suadi leaders , they say nothing . The same media was also biased in favor of Hosni Mubarak before his downfall . March 12 , 2011 at 7:00 pm | Reply Is Joe Biden right wing -- he asserted that Mubarak wasn t a dictator . Butw why would he know ? Doing the job they were elected to do is apparently beyond their interest and perhaps their ability . March 13 , 2011 at 2:14 pm | There should n't be a liberal or conservative , `` peaceniks vs hawks '' , view regarding the Libyan situation . We should all feel the same regarding the atrocities that Gadaffi is committing against Libyans . Unlike the previous leaders in Tunesia and Egypt , Gadaffi is willing to spill any amount of blood to preserve his power , and he has total control of his military . As such the west should attempt to equalize the advantage Gadaffi has . Libya needs not only a no-fly zone , but a NO-TANK zone enforced by the west . This will give the Libyan pro-democracy fighters a fighting chance to recover their country . This is coming from a person who is normally quite liberal and in the peacenik camp on US intervention . The Libyan people deserve help , especially since many of those weapons used against them were sold to them by the west . March 12 , 2011 at 7:10 pm | Reply It would be great to have a few of the questions I posted answered . Being left without knowledge of those things makes it difficult to take a stance one way or the other . Worse yet having such obvious questions apparently left willfully unaddressed casts doubt on what we ` are '' being told as it presents as groomed information with an agenda attached . March 12 , 2011 at 7:42 pm | Reply Today Skky News was showing the rebels in Benghazi picking out people `` presumably '' Ghadafi supporters and beating them senseless while camera is rolling ! And anyone who is black these rebels are accusing to be `` mercenaries '' , they shoot them on site and beat them to death ! What a way to `` democracy '' ! It looks to me we may be on the wrong side here and decided hastily . Is this what we are supporting ? Shame !! March 13 , 2011 at 5:45 am | Reply It is astonishing that no CNN commentors , including Dr. Zakaria , have discussed the possibility of Turkey assuming a role in the current Libyan situation . The Prime Minister of Turkey has reacted publicly to the situation , and I for one have been quietly encouraging the Turkish government to assume an active role right now , and indeed getting involved in the move towards democracy sweeping through the region . Discussion of this matter is increasing in Turkey . I urge Dr Zakaria to interview the Turkish Foreign Minister and possibly also the Prime Minister of Turkey . Soon Not one American soldier should ever be allowed to fight and die on Lybian soil . These same Lybian people who are asking for US intervention are the same ones who cheered at the downing of the plane over Lockerby Scotland , the collapse of the trade centers , and the release of the terrorists who caused the plane to go down . I do not care how much I will have to pay for gas , or anything else . No more intervention using Americans to keep a few rich from oil . The libyan people will just have to figure it out for themselves . You reap what you sow . March 13 , 2011 at 10:52 am | Reply THE TIME TO QUIT DANCING ... The word WAR is incomplete when pointing to places like Iraq , Afghanistan , Egypt or Libya War is akin to references like WW I or WW II . What we really have here is terrorism by thugs who are killing their own people and expecting other free countries to ignore them . This does not mean that America should stay on the sidelines because that would also be stupid . You would not ignore someone that was killing your family , friends and neighbors would you ? This is frankly not what good and decent people do . Should we get involved in Libya now ? Yes ... along with the rest of the world 's leaders because to ignore heavy handed nut-jobs like Libya 's Moammar Gadhafi and his sons who are killing innocent human beings and citizens of Libya . They should know that the world is watching and they too can be erased from the face of the planet . Bombs Away they should not be even given the chance to step down or have the choice to go to another country because they sure as hell have not given that choice to their own citizens . It is not time to let the situation get any worse by lost life of innocent people one day longer ! They need help now ! Whether that be arms , or a no-fly zone . This can not be looked at as a declaration of war but an act of humanity to a one sided conflict between Gadhafi and their own citizens . March 13 , 2011 at 11:04 am | Reply Fareed what would be the best use of all the seized money from Gaddafi and Mubarak ?

I feel stongly that it would make a huge difference in womens rights finally if they could see how women are treated in other countries . When you travel to Egypt it feels like being droped in a Bible setting for a movie that has never changed due to being cut off from the world . March 13 , 2011 at 11:40 am | Reply No administration should be so callous as to make statements indicating that it will support people who revolt against a tyranical ruthless regime unless it is actually prepared to do so . The first Bush administration did that at the end of the first Gulf war and many thousands of Iraqis were slaughtered . The Obama administration is doing the same thing now and many thousands of Libyans will probably be slaughtered by the psycopathic Gaddafi regime . Occasionally a golden opportunity comes along to rid the world of a particularly heinous dictator ; at a time when the local citizenry is ready to most of the fighting . But that time frame is often limited . It looks like we will miss the boat again .

Other Arab countries have the means , both financially and militarily , to assist in Libya with a no-fly-zone , if that is what the rebels are asking for . It makes no sense at all for the US to get involved in this . I support the rebels in their quest for freedom , as I think most Americans do , but it is not our place to move into this situation with military might .

My question is why do n't they do their own intervention , I do believe that those States have a Military and Air Force , since they do n't trust the US .

March 13 , 2011 at 1:44 pm | Reply One possibility for at least part of a coalition enforcing a no-fly zone would be to have Egypt join in the effort .

If he chose not to , you will nail him by his ear to the outside of the door , and let him rut there for a day , to show the world that here is somebody refusing freedom and self determination . The message is ; `` FREEDOM IS A DUTY , NOT A WRIGHT '' . People wanting freedom and self determination , need to work at it , -LRB- ala India , South Africa ... -RRB- , not wait for the world to come to their rescue , and certainly not wait till it becomes unbearable . The panel discussion was frustrating because no one first defined `` no-fly zone .

There has been almost no reference to escalation from resistance except to no-fly zones ... nothing in between , nothing giving the resistance -LRB- rebels as they seem to be called -RRB- the help they need to resolve the problems themselves . I represent a peace related org . and support the ousting of the tyrant , however no one is talking about helping the resistance defend their nation from him . Please see our letter provided to your network and a handful of others . That said , I don t think it s the job of the US to step in when the majority of people in the region distrust and dislike us , have never acknowledged the role the US played in defending Muslims in former Yugoslavia , in the Suez Crisis , but clings to the Arab\\/Israeli conflict even though none of them will give the Palestinians any help . The US will damned if they do and damned if they don t. I m always being told that Islam is a religion of compassion , that Arab and Muslim solidarity are of the utmost importance . But of course the Arab League can finally reccommend a ` no fly zone ' over Libya , without even considering participatiing in making that happen . The Western Powers have to do that , and then to take the rap for it . I suspect that one of the reasons the political culture in this part of the world is so regressive is precisely because of the lack of willingness -LRB- until recently , on the part of these awesome demonstrators -RRB- to take any risk whatsoever . Even so , I wish our US leadership could at least be more assertive on the ethical and Human Rights issues at hand here . The last US president to put honor above ` realpolitik ' was Eisenhower , -LRB- with a bow to Carter 's feeble ` heart-in-the-right-place leadership -RRB- .

March 13 , 2011 at 2:52 pm | Reply The ARAB LEAGUE has just voted for a No Fly Zone . Let Saudi Arabia take their planes to Egypt , both members , and impose it on their wayward member .

In the Libyan situation we have a chance to act at a convergence of sound Western principles of freedom and representative government , American national interest in striking an old enemy that has killed many of our citizens , and Arab aspirations . So yes lets act through NATO to acquire legitimacy then strike off the head of this evil tyrant by attacking him , his command and control and supplies . The Libyians freedom fighters have the boots on the ground they only need Western airpower as was used with success in the Balkans . Otherwise the other tyrants will learn that ruthless killing of the brave can keep them comfortably in power . March 13 , 2011 at 6:21 pm | Reply Listening to Rami Khouri presented the man to the viewers in a rare moment of transparency . Over the many years this fantastically eloquent man has basically evinced the same message spoken in a thousand different ways . That is , the sufferings of the Arab peoples begin and end on the Potomac -LRB- with multiple detours through Tel Aviv , of course -RRB- . No matter what the matter he always manages to weave `` American influence '' into the role of causality . The meta message to the Arab world has been , nothing will change , no matter what you do , as it will be undone by `` the Americans '' . And even when the lie was given to the latter by 18 days of civil unrest by the heroic Egyptian nation , he still cleaves to his life long one man war against America no matter the cost to the Arab world . The issue of GPS today was would he want America to assist the rebels in Libya . The prime concern of Mssr Khouri was that America `` follow international law '' . He does n't want America to go it alone . He insists there be Arab governmental approval , EU cooperation and UN authorization . Of course , the latter is precluded given the PRC 's veto . They 're not particularly interested in seeing successful revolts against the Middle East despots . Lest the latter replicate closer to home . But why would Mr Khouri cede the fate of the Libyan people to Beijing ? Because , for Khouri and other elitists of his region , the game is to oppose America . The people are quite dispensable , thank you very much . How utterly humorous it was indeed when Khouri finished off by saying that America has always had a hard time accepting the idea of freedom for Arabs . Yet , he himself would happily risk the latter , if America could not attain the required sign offs that Khouri mandates before America might unsheathe her sword . Now , who really has trouble with Arab freedom and democracy ? March 13 , 2011 at 11:20 pm | Reply I saw your program yesterday and was shocked to hear you imply that the monarchies in the Arab world either lacked legitimacy or were `` created by colonial powers . '' Nothing could be further than the truth . I recently returned from several months in Bahrain and decided to conduct some research on the Arab monarchies . Most of the Arab monarchies -LRB- Jordan being the notable exception -RRB- can claim legitimacy through a long and documented history . Although the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was created in 1932 , control of the Arabian Peninsula by the al-Saud family dates back to 1744 . The al-Thani family has dominated Qatar more or less continuously since the late 19th century . In the case of Bahrain , control of the island by the al-Khalifa family there dates from 1783 . In the Emirates , all their ruling families all go back to the 1700 's , too . And did you know -- the first country in the world to recognize the independence of the United States of America was the Kingdom of Morocco -- in 1777 -- under the reign of King Mohammed III . The two countries signed a Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 1787 . In fact the Arab monarchies are no less legitimate than those of the United Kingdom , Spain , Belgium , the Netherlands , Denmark , Norway and Sweden . The problems in the Arab monarchies are not due to any presumed illegitimacy of the ruling families , but rather to a lack of popular representation in government . Changes have been occurring . Bahrain , for example , has a constitution -LRB- the first constitution dates from 1973 ; a new constitution was promulgated in 2002 -RRB- . The constitution guarantees free and fair elections within universal suffrage for the lower house of its legislature . The most recent elections were held on October 23 , 2010 . This is a first step that other Arab monarchies can follow . I suggest that you conduct your own research and inform your millions of viewers of the truth about Arab monarchies . I have been watching GPS religiously for 2 years , and am now in Nigeria doing some work before the upcoming election here . I introduced my two Nigerian friends to your show this weekend , and it was a great weekend to do so ! They were `` spellbound '' -LRB- their words -RRB- by this segment and the segment about China 's military . The panel you put together for this segment on the Arab street was gripping , fascinating , and a great introduction to smart people that Americans do n't get to hear from enough -LRB- instead we get to listen to Mitch McConnell over and over -RRB- . I think Mr. Khouri was correc that the principles in the declaration of independence do apply universally , and that the United States is living proof of their veracity . We in Nigeria will see you next week ! March 14 , 2011 at 4:53 am | Reply The rebels in Libya lack careful planning and calculation . After the events in Tunisia and Egypt they just jumped on the bandwagon of freedom and played by ear . Facebook and Twitter contributed to their success at the beginning . Then they began to suffer setbacks . Maybe in the age of technology a successful revolution still needs a guide .

Security Council about humanitarian issues Demonstrators gathered in front of the Arab League headquarters Cairo , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Arab League voted Saturday to back a no-fly zone in Libya and is asking that the U.N. Security Council impose the measure , officials of the regional body told reporters . `` It has one goal : To protect the civilian population , '' Amre Moussa , the body 's secretary-general said . `` We will inform the U.N.

Opposition forces made strides in the early days of the rebellion , but Gadhafi 's military has recently gained strong momentum . The military has been pounding the key oil port of Ras Lanuf , once in the hands of rebel forces , and has taken control of towns such as nearby Bin Jawad . The Gadhafi government appears intent on retaking all territory from the opposition despite growing international pressure . The League was meeting at its headquarters in Cairo , while hundreds of demonstrators outside urged the international community to step up support for Libyan opposition groups . Pleading for international help as they continue to lose ground topro-Gadhafi forces , rebels are asking for a no-fly zone that would theoretically thwart airstrikes . No-fly zones are areas where aircraft are not allowed to fly . Such zones were put in place after the Gulf War in southern and northern Iraq as a check on the forces of the late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein . Western powers have said any action by the international community , including a no-fly zone , would have to have regional support and a clear mandate from the United Nations . U.S. President Barack Obama said Friday that he `` wo n't take -LRB- the -RRB- decision lightly '' on whether to use military force , including helping to enforce a no-fly zone , saying it is critical to `` balance costs versus benefits . '' While France has recognized the National Transitional Council as the sole representative of the Libyan people , the European Union was more restrained Friday , saying it `` welcomes and encourages the interim transitional national council based in Benghazi , which it considers a political interlocutor . '' German Chancellor Angela Merkel was even more cautious in her approach to the council , calling it a possible interlocutor . Britain 's Foreign Office issued a statement after Saturday 's vote , saying , `` We welcome the Arab League 's decision to make contact with the Interim National Council , '' which the government sees as `` valid interlocutors . '' The statement also said that no-fly zones are `` one option being considered as part of international contingency planning to respond quickly to events on the ground as they develop .

The Gadhafi government appears intent on retaking all territory from the opposition despite growing international pressure .

Also Sunday , the Maryland-based SITE Intelligence Group released a video in which it says Abu Yahya al-Libi , an al Qaeda leader , calls on Libyans to take up arms against Gadhafi .

The White House cheered the League 's announcements and stressed it will continue to pressure Gadhafi , support the opposition and prepare for `` all contingencies .

No-fly zones are areas where aircraft are not allowed to fly . Such zones were put in place after the Gulf War in southern and northern Iraq as a check on the forces of the late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein . Western powers have said any action by the international community , including a no-fly zone , would have to have regional support and a clear mandate from the United Nations . U.S. President Barack Obama said Friday that he `` wo n't take -LRB- the -RRB- decision lightly '' on whether to use military force , including helping to enforce a no-fly zone , saying it is critical to `` balance costs versus benefits .

Pro-Gadhafi troops say they are in control of Zuwara -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The key Libyan city of Ajdabiya , the last major point between pro-government forces and the opposition stronghold of Benghazi , was slipping from the opposition 's hands Tuesday , witnesses reported . Forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi fired artillery into Ajdabiya , and there were eyewitness reports of at least two airstrikes on the city . If Ajdabiya is retaken by pro-Gadhafi forces , it would give access to roads leading to the heart of the opposition 's base . Opposition fighters in Ajdabiya returned fire with anti-aircraft weapons and rocket-propelled grenades , but eventually had to pull back their defense positions . Gadhafi 's forces approached the city from the south and the west , witnesses said . Libyan state television reported Tuesday evening that `` Ajdabiya has been cleansed from mercenaries and terrorists connected to al Qaeda . '' Inside a Libyan rebel training camp Appearing to contradict that report , Khaled al-Sayeh , a spokesman for the opposition military forces , said Gadhafi 's forces had reached the western outskirts of Ajdabiya . The spokesman said a small unit of government forces had entered the city Tuesday but were repelled by opposition fighters . Sayeh said opposition forces deployed planes and naval assets to strike at the advancing Gadhafi battalion and capture an oil tanker registered to `` Hannibal Gadhafi . '' The tanker was carrying 25,000 tons of fuel . Sayeh said the opposition also attacked three oil tankers that Gadhafi had converted into battleships and sank two of them . However , the spokesman said the opposition 's ability to mount an air defensive was limited and said the imposition of a no-fly zone was paramount . Without implementation of a no-fly zone , rebels fear that it is only a matter of time before there is a bloodbath in Benghazi . Lebanon 's U.N. representative distributed a draft resolution Tuesday calling for the imposition of a no-fly zone on Libya to members of the U.N. Security Council . The council is scheduled to take up the matter Wednesday morning . Meanwhile , pro-Gadhafi forces wrested control of the town of Zuwara from rebels , an opposition spokesman and a witness said . Pro-Gadhafi forces with tanks and heavy artillery forcibly entered Zuwara on Monday , clashing with rebels for several hours before subduing the town , the sources said . Troops entered the town about 9 p.m. and began shooting randomly into buildings , the opposition spokesman said , declining to be named for his safety . He is in Zuwara . Tuesday morning troops announced they were in control , the spokesman said . The town was relatively quiet Tuesday , with locals afraid to leave their homes , he and the witness said . Gadhafi is fighting to regain his dominance over the entire country after some towns and cities came under control of the armed opposition . Zuwara is west of the capital , Tripoli , which Gadhafi controls . The rebels ' stronghold of Benghazi is to the east of Tripoli . Rebels had appeared Monday to have slowed the eastward advance of government forces toward Benghazi at the town of al-Brega . But it was not clear late in the day who controlled al-Brega , which contains a large oil refinery and natural gas plant , said CNN 's Ben Wedeman , reporting from Benghazi , which is about two hours further east . For the first time since violence erupted last month , forces opposed to Gadhafi did not allow members of the news media to go forward . They expressed concern that coverage from the rebel side of the lines could provide intelligence to government forces about the ragtag rebel forces ' tactics , or lack thereof . Life in Benghazi appeared calm on the surface Monday . Stores were open , and people went about their business . But some residents expressed an underlying fear that Gadhafi appeared to have gained the upper hand and was advancing his military forward as much of the rest of the world focused on the catastrophe in Japan . Some expressed fear that Gadhafi may seek to block roads leading to Benghazi and other coastal cities , then lay siege to them . Some worried that , if Gadhafi reasserts control of those cities in eastern Libya that led the revolt against his rule , he might carry out bloody reprisals . Forces loyal to Gadhafi have been fighting to recapture towns from the rebels since the uprising began last month . En route to Washington after a weekend trip to Bahrain , U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Monday that the logistical challenges of enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya could be overcome . `` If we are directed to impose a no-fly zone , we have the resources to do it , '' he said . `` The question is whether it 's a wise thing to do . And that 's the discussion that 's going at a political level . '' However , the chances that the U.N.

The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said late Wednesday that envoys were considering a variety of options to protect civilians in Libya , not just a no-fly zone or a cease fire . Susan Rice said a `` range of actions '' were up for serious discussion , including but not limited to a no-fly zone , which has `` inherent limitations in terms of protection of civilians . '' A diplomatic source told CNN that air strikes are among options being discussed as diplomats focus on what should be in a U.N. Security Council resolution . The international community is keenly aware of the urgency and gravity of the situation on ground , Rice continued . She said she hopes to see a serious resolution as early as Thursday . The French Ambassador had earlier confirmed that text for a new draft resolution on Libya had been submitted to diplomats . He also told reporters that he expected a vote on the resolution within 24 hours . Lebanon 's U.N. ambassador , Nawaf Salam , said Arab countries are committed to participating in a no-fly zone . That has been an apparent prerequisite for U.S. support of such a zone . The Lebanese diplomat would n't detail the level of potential Arab participation but said it would be `` significant '' and said it has `` been confirmed by the highest political authorities . '' The French foreign minister said on his blog Wednesday that several Arab countries would be willing to participate in a targeted attack on Gadhafi 's air assets . The minister , Alain Juppe , did not specify which countries or how they would participate . Without implementation of a no-fly zone , rebels fear that it is only a matter of time before there is a bloodbath in Benghazi . Libya 's deputy ambassador to the U.N. expressed this fear Wednesday . Gadhafi `` has given instructions for ethnic cleansing , '' Ibrahim Dabbashi said , adding that the Libyan leader would commit genocide against rebels if he was not stopped by the international community . Dabbashi said he expects the Security Council to produce a draft resolution soon . `` International consensus is in the process of building , '' Dabbashi said in the Security Council 's briefing room . Dabbashi made headlines in February when he joined with Libyan Ambassador to the U.N. Mohamed Shalgham to condemn Gadhafi and request that he step down as Libya 's leader . Libya 's government has subsequently requested that Dabbashi and Shalgham be denied the right to speak for Libya at the United Nations . Women marched in Benghazi on Wednesday , carrying banners reading , `` how many Libyans must die to get the Security Council to move on . '' U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters Wednesday that opinions in a number of countries initially opposed to the imposition of a no-fly zone shifted after the Arab League announced its support for such a step . `` Intense negotiations '' are underway at the Security Council , she said . `` We are moving as rapidly as we can to get additional authorization . '' A council diplomat said Washington was engaged in negotiations on the text . Germany 's U.N. ambassador said his country has still questions about such a zone . India 's U.N. ambassador asked , `` Who will implement the no-fly zone ? Who would provide assets for it ? '' China 's U.N. ambassador said his country is concerned about deteriorating conditions in Libya but did n't say whether Beijing backs a no-fly measure . Ali , the opposition leader in Misrata , urged China and Russia to `` look in the mirror '' and understand that `` they are hindering the international effort to put this war criminal in his place . '' While the Arab League recommendation of a no-fly zone carried some weight with reluctant council nations , another declaration from the league that there should be `` no foreign intervention '' has perplexed delegates . En route to Washington after a weekend trip to Bahrain , U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Monday that the logistical challenges of enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya could be overcome . `` If we are directed to impose a no-fly zone , we have the resources to do it , '' he said . `` The question is whether it 's a wise thing to do . And that 's the discussion that 's going at a political level .

Correspondent Libya says its troops will protect civilians The Security Council approves measures against Libya Read the resolution approved by the U.N. Security Council -LRB- PDF -RRB- United Nations -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jubilant Libyan rebels in Benghazi erupted with fireworks and gunfire after the U.N. Security Council voted Thursday evening to impose a no-fly zone and permit `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians . The opposition , with devoted but largely untrained and under-equipped units , has suffered military setbacks this week . It has said such international action was necessary for it to have any chance of thwarting Moammar Gadhafi 's imminent assault on the rebel stronghold . `` We 're hoping and praying that the United Nations will come up with a very firm and very fast resolution and they will enforce it immediately , '' said Ahmed El-Gallal , a senior opposition coordinator , before the vote . `` We should not arrive too late , '' French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said at the U.N. . The resolution was approved with 10 votes , including those of the United States and the United Kingdom . There were no opposing votes on the 15-member council , but China , Russia , Germany , India and Brazil abstained . Germany said it was concerned about a protracted military conflict . U.N. member states can `` take all necessary measures ... to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , including Benghazi , while excluding a foreign occupation force , '' according to the resolution . Moments after the vote , anti-Gadhafi forces in Benghazi broke into cheers , waving flags and chanting . Antiaircraft tracer fire lit up the sky at one rally . UN approves no-fly zone in Libya Libyan amb . still hopeful for airstrikes UN okays no-fly zone in Libya It was not immediately clear just how an international military operation and possible strikes against the Libyan military might unfold . The no-fly zone prohibits Libya 's air forces from entering certain zones within the country . The United States and NATO partners have contingencies in place to act within hours , according to an administration official familiar with planning . President Barack Obama will insist on a major Arab role in any no-fly zone , the official said . The contingencies include air strikes and cruise missile attacks designed to cripple Libyan air defenses and punish military units leading Gadhafi 's push on opposition strongholds in the east , the official said . Obama called British Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Nicolas Sarkozy after the vote . The three `` agreed that Libya must immediately comply with all terms of the resolution and that violence against the civilian population of Libya must cease , '' the White House said in a statement . Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim , speaking in Tripoli , told reporters after the vote that the country will safeguard civilians and its territorial integrity . He called on the international community to send a fact-finding mission to the African nation but not lend material support to rebels . A few dozen pro-Gadhafi supporters chanted , `` Down with the U.N. ! Down with the United States ! '' Frustration and anger in Benghazi Libyan rebel : We 've seen heavy gunfire Friedman predicts more unrest in Mideast Gadhafi forces move in on opposition The U.S. military does not view a no-fly zone alone as sufficient to stop Gadhafi . Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Thursday that establishing a zone would take `` upwards of a week . '' U.S. military officials have said that a no-fly zone would not halt the heavy artillery the regime is using on the ground . Gadhafi 's son Saadi told CNN Thursday evening that troops will change their tactics and take up positions around Benghazi Saturday or Sunday and assist people fleeing from the city . The younger Gadhafi said there will be no large-scale assault . Instead police and anti-terrorism units will be sent into the rebel stronghold to disarm the opposition . Unspecified humanitarian groups can help with the exodus of civilians from Benghazi , Saadi Gadhafi said . In a radio address aired on Libyan state TV , Gadhafi criticized residents of Benghazi and called them `` traitors '' for seeking help from outsiders . The Security Council resolution condemns the `` gross and systematic violation of human rights , including arbitrary detentions , enforced disappearances , torture and summary executions . '' It details enforcement of an arms embargo against Libya , the freezing of assets and a ban on most flights . `` The United States stands with the Libyan people in support of their universal rights , '' said U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice . The resolution deplores the use of mercenaries by Libyan authorities , expresses concern about the safety of foreign nationals and demands an immediate cease-fire . Kaim said the Gadhafi government supports a cease-fire , but is working out certain details . The Arab League 's U.N. ambassador , Yahya Mahmassani , said two Arab countries would take part in a no-fly zone operation , but he was not sure which two . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the Arab League will be critical to the response to Gadhafi , and that he will travel to the region `` to advance our common efforts in this critical hour . '' British Foreign Secretary William Hague said the U.N. vote shows the need for Libyan citizens `` to have a more representative government . '' Earlier Thursday , Libyan state TV said Benghazi would soon come under attack . Gadhafi said that his forces would enter the city to rid it of those `` traitors '' and that his forces will search everyone for weapons . He added that his forces gave amnesty to those who gave up their weapons in the city of Ajdabiya . `` We will not allow further bloodshed among Libyans , '' Gadhafi said . `` Search for the traitors , for the fanatics . Show them no mercy . We will look for them behind every wall , '' Gadhafi said . `` This farce can not go on . '' There were air strikes on Benghazi 's airport Thursday , with three blasts hitting the site about 30 kilometers -LRB- about 18 miles -RRB- outside the city . The opposition has been using the airport to launch its own air strikes , using a handful of jets that rebels have managed to get off the ground , opposition leaders said . It is not clear that Gadhafi 's ground forces are actually within striking range of Benghazi , but they have been fighting their way in that direction for several days . State TV claimed Thursday that Gadhafi 's forces were in control of Ajdabiya , on the road to Benghazi , a claim disputed by opposition leaders . El-Gallal , speaking from eastern Libya , said `` morale is high '' and people do not want to leave strongholds because Gadhafi `` is willing to kill everybody here . '' The government forces have taken control of the eastern and western gates to Ajdabiya and are trying to breach the inside , opposition leaders said . The opposition says it controls the southern entrance . The opposition says it has a handful of jets that are no match with Gadhafi 's superior air power and a pair of Russian-made `` Hind '' attack helicopters . Ajdabiya is the last major point between pro-government forces and Benghazi . If it is retaken by pro-Gadhafi forces , it would give access to roads leading to the heart of the opposition 's base . In remarks to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee , William Burns , the under secretary for political affairs at the State Department , said Gadhafi 's forces are only about 160 kilometers outside Benghazi . `` They 've made advances , taking full advantage of their overwhelming military superiority in military firepower , '' Burns said . He expressed fear that Gadhafi , now isolated by the world community , could turn to terrorism again . `` I think there is also a very real danger that if Gadhafi is successful on the ground , that you will also face a number of other considerable risks as well : The danger of him returning to terrorism and violent extremism himself , the dangers of the turmoil that he could help create at a critical moment elsewhere in the region , '' Burns told the committee .

Editors at the paper said they had last been in touch with the journalists Tuesday morning , U.S. Eastern time , according to the report . It said the newspaper received secondhand information that `` members of its reporting team on the ground in the port city of Ajdabiya had been swept up by Libyan government forces . '' However , the newspaper has been unable to confirm those reports , Executive Editor Bill Keller said on the newspaper 's website . `` We have talked with officials of the Libyan government in Tripoli , and they tell us they are attempting to ascertain the whereabouts of our journalists , '' Keller said . `` We are grateful to the Libyan government for their assurance that if our journalists were captured they would be released promptly and unharmed . '' Libyan rebel : We 've seen heavy gunfire A battle raged Wednesday in Ajdabiya between government troops and rebels . Bob Christie , senior vice president for corporate communications at The New York Times Co. , said Wednesday that the Libyan government told the newspaper it was unaware of the journalists ' whereabouts . `` They 've told us they have a lot of prisoners and that they 're processing them '' and suggested that the four could turn up in that process , Christie said . Libyan government forces said Wednesday that they have no information about where the journalists may be and that , if they were picked up by the Libyan military , they would be returned to Tripoli . The newspaper identified the journalists as Shadid , its bureau chief in Beirut , Lebanon , and two-time Pulitzer winner for foreign reporting ; Stephen Farrell , a reporter and videographer who was kidnapped by the Taliban and rescued by British commandos in 2009 ; and Tyler Hicks and Addario , photographers who have covered the Middle East and Africa . `` Their families and their colleagues at The Times are anxiously seeking information about their situation , and praying that they are safe , '' Keller said . Addario , a freelancer based in India , recently won a MacArthur Fellowship -- known as a `` genius grant '' -- for her photography around the world . In an e-mail Monday to CNN correspondent Ivan Watson , Addario called the Libya story `` one of the most dangerous '' of her career . The e-mail said , `` qaddafi 's forces heading back east , and the rebels are surrendering along the way ... so exhausted . this story has been one of the most dangerous i have ever covered . getting bombed from the air and by land .

We 're here , we 're waiting . I want my wife back , '' said de Bendern , who is bureau chief in New Delhi , India , for Reuters . `` Lynsey is a very smart woman , funny and brave , '' he added . `` She 's very passionate about what she 's doing . ... She tells the world of these important things with the beauty of her photography . '' While working as a foreign correspondent , Shadid was shot in the shoulder by the Israeli Army in Ramallah in spring 2002 . Farrell routinely reports from Pakistan , Afghanistan and Iraq . Before joining The New York Times in 2007 , he worked for the Times of London . In April 2004 , he was kidnapped while on assignment in Iraq . Hicks , a staffer for the paper , is based in Istanbul and has served as an embed in Afghanistan . In a 2004 interview with the StarNews of Wilmington , North Carolina , Hicks described how he felt about his job : `` Covering conflicts is a very rewarding experience because you can bring attention to global issues . When I 'm working and a photograph appears in The New York Times , I always remind myself of who is seeing that photograph '' and the number of people it may have reached , he said . `` That is when I can go to bed at night and feel good about what I have done that day .

Diplomats warned that action was needed to halt Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's rapid advances against rebel positions in his country . The broadly worded resolution would seem to leave open the possibility that air forces implementing the no-fly zone may not only prevent Libyan military aircraft from flying , but also target Gadhafi s wider ability to wage war . We ve been told by diplomats this could certainly indeed move the door so that you have a more of a robust military approach by the West , by Arab countries to help the rebels and stop Col. Gadhafi from reaching Benghazi , said CNN s senior U.N. correspondent , Richard Roth . The authorization establishes a ban on all flights in Libyan airspace to help protect civilians .

The other nations that abstained from Thursday 's vote were Russia , China , Brazil and India . China and Russia are the usual suspects among the abstainers , but the presence of democratic nations like Germany , India and Brazil in that group somehow bothers me . $ 300 million per week just for no fly zone .

Such wasted resources to make a point against someone we dislike has become history revisited . Change regime doctrine is still stuck with US troops in Iraq and the millions of death and destruction . But this time will be different . Watch what will happen to Paris and London next . Do n't blame the Colonel . He will be gone likely but his ghost will freeze EU capitals for decades . Libyans are tribal and will sort their stuff out amongst themselves but the ` culprits ' who set them up against each other will pay . Well put , Marinari . This country 's being run by a bunch of guys who were bullies in their high school days ! That seems to be all they know . We 'll let Egypt and Saudi handle it . But , I DO find it interesting how you threatened EUROPE , when it is pretty much certain that the US would handle it . Cute , but anyone with more than a week 's experience in the REAL world of military action and diplomacy KNOWS who you are . So , I 'll give you a hint , say hello to Iblis for us . I 'm in agreement with Cesar on Personny . I ` lm gonna go hug my toilet and regurgitate what you wrote and I read . Your ignorance is all too telling . You do n't have a clue about anything . What are you ... 12 ? Yes I think this will be the last time France intervenes for a LONG time . Their president had better start packing his bags now , because he 's headed the way of Tony Blair . Barba , so you want Gadaffi to kill all his people so as to be able to hang on to power , and you want the whole world to turn their head away . What has he being doing in his 40 + years of ruling . He has nothing more to offer , if he had ever had any . Point Godwin reached immediately by you ... And the point is certainly not there . If this was just for oil , those nations would have treated with Khadaffi regime , like before , because they already have commercial contracts wih Libya -LRB- those commercial contracts will be honored , there 's not been any seizure of equipement or oil , only a freeze on assets that will return to Libyan people as soon as possible -RRB- . The faxt is that Khaddafi has not only threatened his own people , but also renewed his terrorist threats . And that can not be tolerated . What happens in Libya was initially a street protest , it is Khadaffi that has forced the evolution into civil war by buying the services of lots of foreign terrorists to attack its opposition . And that 's why there 's not just a no-fly zone , but more importantly a decision to close the borders of Lybia to avoid invasions of mercenaries paid by Khadaffi , notably in Chad . The most important decision will be to enforce the absence of troup movements from the Southern borders of Libya . , and stopping the planes coming from there to South Libya where they are given firearms and heavy equipments to attack the North where most Libyan population lives . Those mercenaries must be arrested . They are since the begining the ONLY invaders and foreign forces that have occupied the Libyan territory . In other words , Khaddafi is the main treator of his own country , deliberately acting to threaten his own population that he is normally deemed to protect . For this reason , The no-fly zone will be implemented not just from Mediterranean sea , but also from the South . We can hope the collaboration by Egypt to offer its airports in Southern Egypt to control the Chadian border . And now the resolution can also help the poor Chadian country to get involved in the alliance and receive help to avoid the damaging action there by current Lybian leaders -LRB- and notably by the Libyan `` ambassador '' in Chad that is no longer acting as a diplomat but as an recruiter -RRB- . And the money for the Libyan oil or gas must not be used by Khadaffi to pay foreign mercenaries against its people . In fact Khadaffi has lost the opposition to the resolution as soon as he has renewed its terrorist threats , and directly threatened European countries -LRB- including civils -RRB- . It 's clearly unacceptable . And you 'll immediately note that , in France , despite of the strong political opposition to Sarkhozy -LRB- and the ongoing local elections currently occuring this week -RRB- , even the opposition has supported the no-fly zone and immediate implementation of it . There 's a consensus that the Libyan democratic spring must not be stopped and that the terrorist threats of Khadaffi are completely unacceptable . We have learned from Tunisia and Egypt . And we already know that we have support from most Arabic populations of the Middle-East . Clearly the Libyan spring is definitely not a threat for us . And the Libyan people was the first demander of the no-fly zone . If only Khadaffi had spent its money to help develop Chad instead of buying mercenaries against its own people , the situation would have been radically different . Khadaffi resists only to keep power by force . No legitimate country can reject the opinion of its people . When the situation is so critical that thrre are protests and a new opposition forming , the only legitimate thing that can be done is to organize elections , not war against his oppponents . And accept to resign and loose . But before this happens , the country leader must still protect his people . Khadaffi , by sending mercenaries against his people has clearly acted as a war criminal . He is no longer trustable : he lied in the past , we have given him a limited trust that he woruld fight terrorism and act reasonnably . We can not given him a second chance . And that 's why France decided to recognize the Parliament of Benghazzi -LRB- even if its still very informal , and still needs to organize itself and prepare its move to organize a new civilian society and regime , with elections -RRB- as the only legitimate representant of the Libyan people because it is the only one that has not threatened any one , inside or outside the country , and offered assistance to help protect humanitarian assistance , or to protect hospitals . You really need to study your history better . It is quite easy to play war if the war zone is away from yr . , country !!!! UK ; France , USA , if the playyard would be closer to yr home , you would think twice before entering into a war game .

'' The purpose of the no-fly zone , the administration official said , is to prevent Gadhafi from attacking his own people . `` It 's not designed to have him go . That 's not the purpose , '' the official said . `` The purpose of the military action is to prevent massive humanitarian loss of life , to stop the violence . If the violence stops , then you should n't leap to say then the military action will continue until he leaves . '' No-fly zones : Do they work ? Obama : Libya terms ` not negotiable ' Libya opposition : Civilian areas shelled Libya reacts to no-fly zone The ultimate aim of U.S. policy , the administration official said , remains to force Gadhafi step down . But to accomplish that , the administration 's strategy hinges on `` sequencing . '' `` There are a lot of different measures , '' the official said . `` If you have a cease-fire in place that is verifiable , then you can continue turning the noose without taking necessarily further action . What we 're trying to do is freeze his advance . And then work from there to what was the original call , which was that he has lost legitimacy and he needs to go . But you have to sequence it . '' The official conceded that there are many scenarios that could unfold : Gadhafi could remove his forces , or he could temporarily cease attacking , only to later resume fighting . A standoff could ensue . `` That is exactly the crux of the matter . No one can define that . '' But , this official says , the administration 's main approach now is : `` Keep the international community focused on this , and the result will be that he leaves , but that may take some time . '' A top State Department official raised the concern that Gadhafi could return to underwriting terror plots . `` I think there is also a very real danger that if Gadhafi is successful on the ground , that you will also face a number of other considerable risks as well , '' Undersecretary Nicholas Burns said Thursday . `` The danger of him returning to terrorism , and violent extremism himself , the dangers of the turmoil that he could help create at a critical moment elsewhere in the region . '' But a second U.S. official said the intelligence community has been assessing the Libyan leader 's capabilities and intentions . There is no indication that Gadhafi will respond with a terrorist attack ; he is `` distracted by events in his country , '' but the official said `` no one is discounting his brutality . '' The official said it is unlikely Gadhafi could orchestra a `` sophisticated plot '' such as the Pan Am Flight 103 or Berlin disco bombings , but there is always the possibility of smaller-scale attacks . President Barack Obama met Friday with security officials and leaders of Congress , including Rep. Mike Rogers , chairman of the House Intelligence Committee . The Michigan Republican said there was a consensus against putting American troops on Libyan soil . `` I think that is a terrible idea . It would be a terrible option , '' said Rogers , who supports the no-fly zone . `` I ca n't foresee a circumstance that would require U.S. soldiers on the ground in Libya . '' Rogers said that protecting civilians and chemical weapon stockpiles are the top priorities . `` This buffer zone is incredibly important to protect those people and other Libyans who have stood up to Gadhafi and said ` no more , we want freedom and self-rule , ' '' the congressman said .

The Times cited an interview given by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's son , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , to ABC 's Christiane Amanpour late Thursday , a transcript of which was posted on ABC 's website . In it , the younger Gadhafi says photographer Lynsey Addario will be released . He tells Amanpour that security forces arrested her because she had entered the country illegally , `` but then they were happy because they found out she is American , not European . And thanks to that , she will be free tomorrow . '' Husband of missing journalist speaks out While Gadhafi did not mention the other three missing journalists , the Times said Libyan government officials told the U.S. State Department on Thursday evening that all four would be released . The paper also said the Libyan government allowed the journalists to call their families Thursday evening . `` We 're all , families and friends , overjoyed to know they are safe , '' the paper quoted its executive editor , Bill Keller , as saying . `` We are eager to have them free and back home . '' CNN could not independently confirm promises to release the journalists . Saif al-Islam Gadhafi does not speak for all parts of the Libyan government . The newspaper identified the journalists as Anthony Shadid , its bureau chief in Beirut , Lebanon , and a two-time Pulitzer winner for foreign reporting ; Stephen Farrell , a reporter and videographer who was kidnapped by the Taliban and rescued by British commandos in 2009 ; and Tyler Hicks and Addario , photographers who have covered the Middle East and Africa . Addario is an experienced war photographer based in India who recently won a MacArthur Fellowship -- known as a `` genius grant '' -- for her photography around the world . Hicks , a staffer for the paper , is based in Istanbul and has served as an embedded journalist in Afghanistan . The four journalists entered the rebel-controlled eastern region of Libya via the Egyptian border without visas to cover the civil war in the country , the Times said . Editors at the paper said they had last been in touch with the journalists Tuesday morning . The paper said that after it reported losing contact , the Gadhafi government pledged that if the four had been detained by the government 's military forces , they would be located and released unharmed .

This celestial event is far rarer than the famed blue moon , which happens once about every two-and-a-half years . `` The last full moon so big and close to Earth occurred in March of 1993 , '' said Geoff Chester with the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington . ` I 'd say it 's worth a look . ' '' Snap a great photo this weekend ? Submit it to ireport . You should have asked the tough question , that why did he send mecenaries to help out in Libia . Or why Sharon was poisoned . Better yet you should get INFORMED by the real news in occupied Palestine through a great Jewish person Phil Weiss , of Mondoweiss , very educated & informative . I was disappointed in Piers Morgan 's interview with Netanyahu primarily because several times he did not give Mr Netanyahu time to answer his questions before he asked another one . I was very impressed with Mr Netanyahu 's presence , patience and concentration during the interview which in my personal opinion allowed Mr Morgan to proceed with his agenda . I also felt that he was trying to create an impression that Mr Netanyahu would be a failure as the Israeli Prime Minister if he did not achieve peace with the Palestinians . I was looking forward to hearing what Mr Netanyahu was thinking on several of the matters rather than what Mr Morgan wanted him to think . Not the best performance for an excellent journalist whom I regularly watch . I 'm trying to find a tactful way of saying what I want to say , because I generally do n't like to be critical unless I can think up a better alternative . But I 'm really not digging that guy from the NYT who 's been brought on as the ` nuclear expert ' . It just sounds like he 's reporting stuff he 's picked up on the internet that the rest of us have already read , rather than having any additional insight or knowledge to report . In his defense though , with so little information known about what 's happening at the reactors , and with there being such a small body of knowledge in existence for how to deal with a nuclear crisis , even the people in charge seem to be having to rely on trial and error to problem solve . I wish I could think up a better alternative ... March 18 , 2011 at 12:01 pm | Report abuse | Reply I was incredibly upset over the interview with Mr. Netanyahu . Mr. Morgan interrupted him so many times , rarely gave him a chance to finish his answers , did not hear a word the Primie Minister said and implied that it is up to Israel to give in to all of the demands made by the world . What a horrible interviewer . No wonder I never listen to CNN . You are spot on . It was the first time i saw Mr. Morgan give an interview and it was very dissapointing . Mr. Morgan should have handed Mr Netanyahu the questions so Mr. Morgan could have touted even more of his views . It was borderline disrespectful . I believe the moon is this close and full every 2 or 3 years not 20 . It 's the blue moon that occurs every two-three years . The full , close moon that 's coming up is the perigee moon . And as for Lybia , put a smart bomb in his hooka or pipe . I mean Gadafi 's !! The dude is smoke'in some good sh-t . . The moon is coming right for us ! \\* jumps out window \\* I 'm trying to watch the reporting coming in from Tripoli , but the CNN newscasters wo n't keep their pie-holes shut long enough so that the viewer 's can hear and the see anything including the reporters on the ground . The state-side staffers need to `` SHUT THEIR MOUTHS '' so we can watch the action !!! 3\\/19\\/11 . Libya -- not pleasant to watch , but why does America , UK & the rest feel they need to get involved . THREE LETTERS -- OIL . History repeats itself again . Big brother will send their young men & woman to slaughter again . UK sold arms weeks before , earlier media reports said they had no money for social necessities , but quickly found money for bombs . How do you sell you people this nonsense ? America relies again on their terrible intelligence from Bengaz your own CIA as per media reports ? . Now you wonder why the Arab world distrusts you people . I am Christian South African , and I wonder seriously what your real intention could be . Obama -- you are no better than your predecessor . As for the Lybian gov-military I say they ca n't be trusted , no more than you can trust the word of our gov. This whole thing in all the middle-east is about `` OIL '' and you have to know it !!! Our gov is killing our men , women , boys and gifls all for OIL , it 's a sad , sad time in the US and the world . . Obama 's strategy is clear . . require the EU and Arab League to take ownership of the problem .

Kadhafi is a pain to Arab league who want their kindoms etc. to maintain a low profile . . Once committed however , the only way out is his military ousts him , someone invades , or Kadahafi 's killed .

Members of both political parties are prone to support humanitarian intervention to stop war crimes and given Gadhafi 's past , it seems a strong case could be made that an alternative to him would be in the U.S. interest . But it is somewhat shocking that the U.S. is preparing to take military action against Libya and neither of those arguments have been convincingly made .

Security Council to impose no-fly zone in Libya Member states authorized `` to take all necessary measures '' to protect civilians U.S. , France , Britain lead countries offering to contribute military assets -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libya 's embattled regime declared a cease-fire Friday as an international coalition was preparing to enforce a United Nations-backed no-fly zone to protect civilians in the war-torn country . The U.N. Security Council vote followed recent successes by heavily-armed government forces loyal to leader Moammar Gadhafi against the largely untrained and under-equipped rebels . Pro-government forces were thought to be on the brink of an assault on Benghazi -- a city of one million people seized by the opposition during the uprising -- and had reportedly launched air attacks . Despite the announcement of a cease-fire , there were reports of fighting Friday in western and eastern Libya . Acting under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter , which provides for the use of force if needed , the Council adopted Resolution 1973 by 10 votes to zero , with five abstentions , authorizing member states `` to take all necessary measures '' to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack ... while excluding an occupation force . '' Libya reacts to no-fly zone U.N. okays no-fly zone over Libya The resolution follows an arms embargo that the Council imposed last month when it unanimously approved sanctions against Libya , freezing the assets of its leaders and referring the ongoing violence against civilian demonstrators to the International Criminal Court -LRB- ICC -RRB- . What does the resolution mean ? An U.N.-backed international force will enforce a no-fly zone over Libya which will effectively ground Libya 's military aircraft . All flights -- except those for humanitarian purposes -- will be banned from Libyan airspace . This force will also have the power to launch air strikes against Libyan ground forces -- from tanks , artillery and missiles to their communications and command and control infrastructure -- if they are considered to be a threat against the civilian population . According to Barak Seener , Research Fellow in Middle Eastern Studies at the Royal United Services Institute -LRB- RUSI -RRB- in London , the wording in the resolution permitting member states to use `` all necessary means '' also makes pre-emptive strikes from the air at the regime 's forces legitimate . `` It 's intended to force Gadhafi back and tilt the balance in the rebel 's favor , '' he told CNN . `` I think it will embolden protesters across the Arab world as it is a precedent to oppressive regimes . The resolution is saying human rights violations will not go unabated and there will be a response . '' Who backed the Security Council vote ? Ten of the 15 council members , led by the U.S. and Britain and France , voted in favor of the no-fly zone . Who voted for no-fly zone ? `` Any decision to put the men and women of our armed services into harms ' way should only ever be taken when it 's absolutely necessary , '' British Prime Minister David Cameron said in a statement to the country 's parliament after the vote . `` But we simply can not stand back and let a dictator whose people have rejected him , kill his people indiscriminately . '' China , Russia , Germany , India and Brazil abstained from the Security Council vote citing concerns about a protracted conflict in Libya . `` We oppose the use of armed force in international relations and we have serious reservations about some of the content of the resolution , '' said Jiang Yu , a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . `` We support the U.N. Secretary-General 's Special Envoy to Libya , African Union and Arab League to resolve this crisis peacefully , '' she said . `` We hope that the situation in Libya will return to stability as soon as possible to avoid more serious escalation of armed conflict and humanitarian crisis . '' Who will police the no-fly zone ? The U.S. and NATO partners have contingencies in place to act within hours , according to an administration official familiar with planning . President Barack Obama will insist on a major Arab role in any no-fly zone , the official said . Cameron said Britain had started preparations to deploy aircraft , and `` in the coming hours '' they will move to air bases where they will be positioned for any `` necessary action . '' French government spokesman Francois Baroin said France plans to participate in what he described as `` swift '' efforts . Meanwhile all 39 member states of European Air Traffic organization Eurocontrol , which includes the European Union 's 27 nations as well as Russia , asked the agency to `` ban all flights '' flying over and heading to Libya , a spokeswoman said , in quotes carried by Agence France-Presse . We simply can not stand back and let a dictator whose people have rejected him , kill his people indiscriminately . Will other Arab countries be involved ? The Arab League 's U.N. ambassador , Yahya Mahmassani , said two Arab countries would take part in a no-fly zone operation , but he was not sure which two . The Arab League last week called for a no-fly zone following reports of Libyan air attacks on urban areas . `` Their involvement will be largely symbolic but extremely important , '' said Seener . `` We 're probably looking at involvement from Qatar , UAE and perhaps Saudi Arabia and Egypt . `` Autocrats and Islamists can not create a false narrative of western colonialism . Rather Gadhafi is deeply unpopular in the Arab world , and the West is fostering a human rights narrative for opposition movements around the Arab world to advance more forcefully . It is also ensuring that the trajectory of opposition will go down a human rights path rather than one of resistance in the form of Islamism or radical nationalism . `` This also serves as a declaration to authoritarian regimes throughout the region that the West is not an ineffectual foe or paper tiger and will not overlook human rights abuses for the sake of relative short-termed stability . '' Is Gadhafi bluffing with the cease-fire ? Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa , speaking to reporters Friday in Tripoli , said that in light of its membership in the United Nations , the country is `` obliged to accept the Security Council resolution that permits the use of force to protect the civilian population . '' Koussa says Libya was disappointed with the imposition of a no-fly zone , arguing that it will hurt the civilian population . He also said the use of military power violates the country 's sovereignty and goes against the U.N. charter , but he acknowledged that some countries may yet intervene . However Seener said this was simply a survival tactic by the Gadhafi regime . `` It is a tactic to blunt the western response . There is no way the regime is willing , in a constructive manner , to engage with the opposition and share power . `` They are simply geared towards maximizing their own power and coercing their own people . It would be folly to leave the rebels in a vulnerable position . '' Who will foot the bill for the fly-zone ? Participating countries will have to pay their own costs , said Seener . However he added that the U.S. would be doing most of the `` heavy lifting '' in terms its military contribution . But with the U.S. and its NATO allies such as Britain heavily involved in Afghanistan , Seener said the issue of military intervention in Libya had been heavily politicized in some countries . `` Some sections of press in the UK have said British forces are already over-committed and defense spending needs to be increased , while others say we ca n't engage in Libya because we 're stretched and need to focus on Afghanistan . '' He said the reality is Britain does have the capacity to commit to the campaign in Libya without compromising its role in Afghanistan .

An international military coalition including France , the United States and Great Britain attacked Libyan air-defense and other military targets Saturday night in an operation that eventually will include enforcing a no-fly zone . Libyan rebels had called on international action to help them stave off assaults by Libyan government forces on their positions in Benghazi and other enclaves . The coalition 's intervention in Libya 's civil war comes two days after the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution authorizing the use of force , including a no-fly zone , to `` protect civilians and civilian populated areas '' from government attack . Here is a look at how the situation got to this point , and what the major players are saying and doing . THE START OF THE CONFLICT Libya 's civil war began last month , following protests that coincided with a larger wave of demonstrations in North Africa and the Middle East against governments there . In Libya , protesters rallied against , among other things , high unemployment and a delay in a government housing project , and they eventually called for democracy and an end to Moammar Gadhafi 's almost 42-year-long rule . Clashes between protesters and security forces began in Benghazi -- Libya 's second-largest city -- on February 16 , and as violence spread to other cities , opposition forces claimed control of Benghazi and other parts of eastern Libya . In the ensuing days , the opposition and external governments accused the Libyan regime of atrocities and rights violations , including allegations of a military helicopter firing on a crowd in Benghazi , other military attacks against civilians , arbitrary detentions and summary executions . Gadhafi 's regime responded that it was attacking al Qaeda , not civilians . GADHAFI 'S FORCES GAIN GROUND AGAINST REBELS At the beginning of March , the Libyan military stepped up efforts to reclaim areas lost to rebels . Pro-Gadhafi forces marched eastward , hammering rebel positions in north-central Libya 's Ras Lanuf by the end of last week and moving on to al-Brega and Ajdabiya . By the end of this week , Gadhafi 's forces were poised to strike Benghazi . ARAB LEAGUE REQUESTS NO-FLY ZONE ; U.N. COMPLIES While the rebels pleaded for help , late last week , the Arab League voted to ask the United Nations Security Council to impose a no-fly zone over Libya to `` protect the civilian population , '' league Secretary General Amre Moussa said .

The warning , announced by French President Nicolas Sarkozy at the end of a last-minute meeting in Paris , came as Sarkozy revealed French fighter jets were already flying over rebel-held areas of Libya to protect the population . `` If there is not an immediate cease-fire and withdrawal of the forces that have been attacking civilian populations in the last few weeks , our countries will have recourse to military means , '' Sarkozy said , adding that all participants at the meeting endorsed the warning . French planes fired on a Libyan military vehicle Saturday evening , according to the French Defense Ministry . Cameron : Libya intervention is necessary Libya forces advance on main rebel base France convenes summit on Libya crisis Gadhafi , however , `` has totally ignored this warning , '' Sarkozy said . Sarkozy called it the `` murderous madness '' of a regime that has `` forfeited all its legitimacy . '' At the same time he spoke , Sarkozy said the French air force is opposing any aggression by Gadhafi 's forces against the population of rebel-held Benghazi . `` As of now , our aircraft are preventing planes from attacking the town , '' Sarkozy said . `` Other French aircraft are ready to intervene against tanks . '' Sarkozy said enforcing the U.N. no-fly zone through military action is not in order to impose a specific outcome -- such as regime change -- but is instead `` in the name of the universal conscience that will not endorse such crimes . '' U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton echoed that idea , saying the purpose of enforcing the U.N. resolution is `` to protect civilians from their own government . '' Sarkozy said Gadhafi still has a chance to `` avoid the worst '' if he complies `` immediately and unreservedly '' with the demands of the international community . `` The doors of diplomacy will open once again when the aggression stops , '' he said . Sarkozy 's comments came at the end of Saturday 's meeting , which included delegations from the United States , Canada , European Union and Britain , along with Iraq , Morocco , the United Arab Emirates and the United Nations . In a communique , leaders said they have a long-term commitment in the area . `` We assure the Libyan people of our determination to be at their side to help them realize their aspirations and build their future and institutions within a democratic framework , '' the statement said . British Prime Minister David Cameron , who was at the meeting in Paris , said participants decided to make Gadhafi face the consequences of his actions . `` Colonel Gadhafi has made this happen , '' Cameron told the BBC . `` He has lied to the international community . He has promised a cease-fire , he has broken that cease-fire , he continues to brutalize his own people , and so the time for action has come . It needs to be urgent . '' As they met , participants were `` aware of the news reports '' coming out of Libya that show Libyan government forces moving toward Benghazi , a senior U.S. State Department official told reporters . `` Time is pressing , '' Herman Van Rompuy , president of the European Council , told the meeting Saturday . `` Action is needed now to protect the population . '' Clinton said Gadhafi 's forces `` face unambiguous terms '' and that a cease-fire must be implemented immediately . `` That means all attacks against civilians must stop , '' she said after the Paris meeting . `` Troops must stop advancing on Benghazi and pull back from Ajdabiya , Misrata and Zawiya . Water , electricity , and gas supplies must be turned on to all areas . Humanitarian assistance must be allowed to reach the people of Libya .

Here is a look at how the situation got to this point , and what the major players are saying and doing . THE START OF THE CONFLICT Libya 's civil war began last month , following protests that coincided with a larger wave of demonstrations in North Africa and the Middle East against governments there . The Tomahawk cruise missiles that were launched Saturday against Libya are unmanned , single-use , programmable jet-engine missiles used only by the U.S. and British navies . They fly very close to the ground , steering around natural and man-made obstacles to hit a target that is programmed into them before launch . Newer versions can be reprogrammed in flight but in this case that was not done , at least not yet . They are different from other unmanned aerial vehicles in that they can only be used once -- they are fired , they fly to the target and blow up . A Predator and some other unmanned aerial vehicles can carry missiles , hit a target , then continue flying . Tomahawk missiles normally carry a 1,000-pound conventional warhead . They can also carry 166 combined-effects bomblets , or mini bombs that spread out over a larger area . They can also carry nuclear warheads . Tomahawks , developed in the 1970s , were first launched operationally by the United States during Operation Desert Storm in 1991 .

Explosions could also be heard in the city , which has been a stronghold for rebels opposing Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi . It was not immediately clear who the fighter jet belonged to . The development is significant , in part , because Benghazi has been considered the center of the opposition forces . The opposition has been pushed back from other cities that it used to have control of , and rebels have vowed to defend Benghazi to the death . A day earlier , the Libyan government said it was abiding by a cease-fire , but witnesses have said violence from pro-Gadhafi forces have continued . Libya late Friday called for international observers to come and verify the cease-fire . One day after the approval of a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect civilians , U.S. President Barack Obama warned Gadhafi to pull back from several besieged cities -- or face military consequences . But Obama insisted that American troops will not be deployed in Libya . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was flying to Paris for a Saturday meeting with European allies and Arab partners . At least 28 people died and hundreds were wounded as fighting raged in the cities of Misrata , Ajdabiya and Zintan on Friday , according to Khaled el-Sayeh , military spokesman for the opposition . still hopeful for airstrikes Libya 's deputy foreign minister called for observers from China , Malta , Turkey and Germany `` to come to Libya as soon as possible ... to make sure that there is a real cease-fire on the ground . '' Khaled Kaim also noted that the `` door is open for any other countries to send observers . '' Kaim said the media is distorting Libyan military actions and said the country has evidence of `` crimes against humanity conducted by the rebels . '' Government forces `` did not cause the deaths of any civilians , '' instead inflicting casualties on armed rebel militias , and will not assault Benghazi , Kaim said . Forces loyal to Gadhafi are honoring a cease-fire and are not fighting a militia group that is making advances in the eastern part of the country , according to Kaim . Rebel forces are advancing on the town of al-Migrun , south of the rebel stronghold of Benghazi , said Kaim . The French press agency AFP confirmed to CNN the movement by a militia group and said it recorded video . Witnesses in the western city of Misrata said earlier Friday that a pro-government assault is persisting and casualties are mounting as countries backing the council 's move , such as Britain and France , get their military resources into place to enforce the measure . `` What cease-fire ? '' asked a doctor in Misrata , who described hours of military poundings , casualties and dwindling resources to treat the wounded . `` We 're under the bombs . `` This morning , they are burning the city , '' the doctor said . `` There are deaths everywhere . '' `` Misrata is on fire , '' according to an opposition member , who said tanks and vehicles with heavy artillery shot their way into the city Thursday night and the assault continued Friday . He said Gadhafi 's regime announced a cease-fire to buy time for itself . `` Please help us . '' Outside Ajdabiya in eastern Libya , CNN 's Arwa Damon said she heard explosions , listened to fighters ' accounts of heavy casualties and saw ambulances . She said fighters , who do n't trust Gadhafi , believe that the declaration is a trick . `` Everybody around us is on very high alert , still expecting the worst , '' Damon said . El-Sayeh said 26 people died in Misrata , 83 were seriously wounded and hundreds were slightly wounded . In Ajdabiya , two died , three were seriously wounded and hundreds were slightly wounded . There was no immediate casualty count for Zintan , el-Sayeh said . CNN could n't independently confirm the witness accounts , and it is impossible to tell whether word of the cease-fire declaration trickled down to pro-government forces . Frustration and anger in Benghazi Libyan rebel : We 've seen heavy gunfire No-fly zone a slippery slope to more ? In remarks televised around the globe , Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa said in Tripoli that the country decided on `` an immediate cease-fire and the stoppage of all military operations . '' He noted that the country , since it is a member of the United Nations , is `` obliged to accept the Security Council resolution that permits the use of force to protect the civilian population . '' Obama said Friday that `` left unchecked , we have every reason to believe Gadhafi -LRB- will -RRB- commit atrocities against his own people '' and the surrounding region could be destabilized . Power and water must be restored to several cities , he added . `` These terms are not negotiable , '' Obama said . If Gadhafi does n't comply , the U.N. resolution will be imposed through military action , the president said . The U.N. resolution , while not authorizing such a move , does not preclude the United States from arming rebels , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said Friday . Ambassador Susan Rice told CNN 's `` Situation Room '' that the `` U.S. is ready to act '' and that Gadhafi `` should be under no illusions that if he does n't act immediately he will face swift and sure consequences , including military action . '' When asked whether the United States was planning to provide weapons to the opposition , Rice replied , `` We are focused immediately on protection of civilians , on ensuring that the march to Benghazi does not continue and that those who are most vulnerable have the rights and protections that they deserve . '' Koussasaid that Libya plans to protect civilians and provide them with humanitarian assistance and that it is obliged to protect all foreigners and their assets . He said the Libya government was disappointed in the imposition of a no-fly zone , arguing that it will hurt the civilian population . He also said the use of military power would violate the country 's sovereignty and go against the U.N. charter , but he acknowledged that some countries may yet intervene . `` There are signs this indeed might take place , '' Koussa said . Bernard Valero , a French Foreign Ministry spokesman , said the cease-fire announcement `` does not change the threat on the ground . '' `` Gadhafi is privy to folkloric declarations , and we must remain extremely vigilant with regards to these declarations , '' he said . Clinton , who called the situation `` fluid and dynamic , '' said the United States wants actions , not words . `` We will continue to work with our partners in the international community to press Gadhafi to leave and to support the legitimate aspirations of the Libyan people , '' she said . The Libyan government `` must immediately cease all hostilities against the civilian population , '' U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Friday in Madrid . Earlier Friday , talk emerged in Europe of speedy military action against Gadhafi 's regime . In an interview with RTL radio , French government spokesman Francois Baroin said France plans to participate in `` swift '' efforts . President Nicolas Sarkozy will convene a summit Saturday to look at the crisis . Invited are members of the Arab League , the president of the European Council and representatives of states that support the implementation of the U.N. resolution . British Prime Minister David Cameron said the United Kingdom has started preparations to deploy aircraft , and `` in the coming hours '' they will move to air bases where they will be positioned for any `` necessary action . '' Spain will offer NATO the use of two military bases and provide air and naval forces for use in operations involving Libya , Spanish Defense Minister Carme Chacon said Friday in Madrid , a Defense Ministry spokesman said . Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Canada is sending CF-18 fighter jets to join a Canadian warship on standby off the coast of Libya . The Pentagon , meanwhile , announced Friday that Defense Secretary Robert Gates will travel to Russia this weekend as the United States and other nations deliberate action against Libya . `` There is no consideration being given to delaying this trip , '' spokesman Geoff Morrell said at the Pentagon . He said Gates maintains constant communications links with Washington wherever he goes and can `` carry out his responsibilities no matter where he is in the world . '' Asked whether the cease-fire declaration complicates a U.N.-sanctioned intervention , Michael Rubin , a Middle East expert at the American Enterprise Institute , said , `` It is going to make it tougher without a doubt . '' `` One should credit Obama for getting the international community behind him , but it came at the price of momentum . The Libyans understand European weakness and know how to play off of it , '' Rubin said . Rubin said migration concerns come into play , with Europeans worried that more violence will generate more refugees . `` They look at change in North Africa almost exclusively through the lens of migration , '' he said . The council voted 10-0 with five abstentions Thursday night to authorize `` states to take all necessary measures to protect civilians . '' It also imposed a no-fly zone , banning all flights in Libyan airspace , with exceptions that involve humanitarian aid and evacuation of foreign nationals . The United States and its NATO partners have severalcontingencies in place to act quickly , according to an administration official familiar with planning . They include airstrikes and cruise missile attacks designed to cripple Libyan air defenses and punish the military units that are leading Gadhafi 's push on opposition strongholds in the east , the official said . The opposition , with devoted but largely untrained and under-equipped units , has suffered military setbacks this week . But their hopes were buoyed by the U.N. vote , particularly in rebel-held Benghazi , where an assault by pro-Gadhafi forces has been expected . The resolution singles out the city . It says U.N. member states can `` take all necessary measures ... to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , including Benghazi , while excluding a foreign occupation force . `` The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya '' is a formal name for the nation .

CNN 's Nic Robertson witnessed the development a few hours after nearly 1,000 people gathered at Gadhafi 's palace in the capital . The crowd chanted , waved flags and shot off fireworks in support of the government . A defiant Gadhafi said Libya will fight back against undeserved `` naked aggression . '' His military claimed nearly 50 people , including , women , children and clerics , were killed in Saturday evening 's attacks . There was no independent confirmation of that statement . American , French and British military forces , convinced that Gadhafi was not adhering to a United Nations-mandated cease-fire , hammered Libyan military positions with missiles and fighter jets in the first phase of an operation that will include enforcement of a no-fly zone . Gadhafi responds to air strikes Gallery : Civil war in Libya An eyewitness in Tripoli reported seeing signs of gunfire rising Sunday morning from the direction of nearby Mitiga Airport . The anti-Gadhafi activist said she heard `` continuous gunshots '' and at least two loud explosions . It was not clear if the airport was also being used as a military installation . The eyewitness , who was not identified for security reasons , said she did not hear the sound of flying aircraft . More than 110 Tomahawk missiles fired from American and British ships and submarines hit about 20 Libyan air and missile defense targets in western portions of the country , U.S. Vice Adm. William Gortney said at a Pentagon briefing . The U.S. will conduct a damage assessment of the sites , which include SA-5 missiles and communications facilities . A senior U.S. military official , who was not authorized to speak on the record , said the cruise missiles , which fly close to the ground or sea at about 550 miles per hour , landed near Misrata and Tripoli . The salvo , in an operation dubbed `` Odyssey Dawn , '' was meant `` to deny the Libyan regime from using force against its own people , '' said Gortney . U.S. Navy photos showed flashes of light and smoke funnels as missiles soared from a destroyer into the night sky . Earlier , French fighter jets deployed over Libya fired at a military vehicle Saturday , the first strike against Gadhafi 's military forces , which earlier attacked the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . Prime Minister David Cameron said late Saturday that British forces also are in action over Libya . `` What we are doing is necessary , it is legal and it is right , '' he said . `` I believe we should not stand aside while this dictator murders his own people . '' British Defense Secretary Liam Fox said the Royal Air Force deployed Tornado GR4 fast jets , which flew 3,000 miles from the United Kingdom and back , `` making this the longest-range bombing mission conducted by the RAF since the -LRB- 1982 -RRB- Falklands conflict . '' While there were no U.S. warplanes flying over Libya late Saturday , the coalition was softening Libyan positions before enforcing a no-fly zone , Gortney said . The Libyan military , in a statement broadcast on state TV , said , `` An enemy attacked the state on March 19th with rockets ... Those enemies killed 48 martyrs -- mostly women , children , and religious clerics . They left more than 150 injured . The majority of these attacks were on public areas , hospitals and schools . They frightened the children and women near those areas that were subject to this aggression . '' Libya forces advance on main rebel base Gadhafi , speaking early Sunday on Libyan state TV , said the U.N. charter provides for Libya 's right to defend itself in a `` war zone . '' Weapons depots will be opened , he said . `` All you people of the Islamic nations and Africa , and Latin America and Asia , stand with the Libyan people in its fight against this aggression , '' Gadhafi said . Air attacks on several locations in Tripoli and Misrata have caused `` real harm '' to civilians , a Libyan government spokesman said . An eyewitness in Misrata said Gadhafi 's forces are targeting fuel and power stations in an effort to make citizens believe the damage is being done by coalition forces . The eyewitness , who was not identified for security reasons , said people celebrated allied airstrikes on loyalist positions in the city . CNN could not verify the account . Shortly after the first missile attacks , U.S. President Barack Obama informed the American people of the efforts by a `` broad coalition . '' `` The use of force is not our first choice , '' the president said from Brasilia , Brazil . `` It is not a choice I make lightly . But we can not stand idly by when a tyrant tells his own people that there will be no mercy . '' Obama is planning for the U.S. portion of the military action in Libya to only last for a few days , according to a senior administration official , who was not authorized to speak about sensitive military matters . `` After that we 'll take more of a supporting role , '' the senior official said . Obama authorized U.S. military force from Brazil on what happened to be the eighth anniversary of the start of the war in Iraq . Coalition partners say Gadhafi has failed to adhere to a United Nations resolution that imposed the no-fly zone and ordered him to stop attacks on civilians . `` He 's clearly been on the offensive , '' the senior U.S. military official said of Gadhafi . `` He said that he was going to do a cease-fire and he continued to move his forces into Benghazi . '' Earlier Saturday , Gadhafi issued defiant messages to international powers . `` I have all the Libyan people with me and I 'm prepared to die . And they are prepared to die for me . Men , women and even children , '' Gadhafi said in a letter addressed to Obama and read to reporters by a government spokesman in Tripoli . Obama , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Gortney used the term `` unique capabilities '' to describe the U.S. part of the effort . Officials have said American military forces are meant to augment Arab , European and other Western troops . In the next few days , U.S. military officials expect to hand over control to a coalition commander . Canada and Italy also are part of the coalition . `` Our air force will oppose any aggression by Colonel Gadhafi against the population of Benghazi , '' said French President Nicolas Sarkozy , speaking after a top-level meeting in Paris over the Libyan crisis . The international meeting -- which included Western and Arab partners -- focused on how to take on a Libyan government bent on destroying the fledgling opposition movement under the U.N. resolution authorizing force to protect civilians against the Gadhafi government . Rebel forces in Benghazi used a captured army tank as a victory symbol , CNN 's Arwa Damon reported . Earlier Saturday , incoming artillery rounds landed inside Benghazi , and pro-Gadhafi tanks rolled into the town firing rounds , witnesses said . A flaming fighter jet plummeted from the sky , nose-diving to the ground . Khaled el-Sayeh , the opposition military spokesman , said the plane was an old MiG-23 that belonged to the rebels . As night fell over Benghazi on Saturday , the city became quiet and calm . While plumes of smoke could be spotted , the pro-Gadhafi tanks seen earlier were not in sight . El-Sayeh told CNN that `` tens '' had been killed in Benghazi on Saturday . He said Gadhafi forces had withdrawn from the city and that they were positioned 50 kilometers -LRB- 31 miles -RRB- outside Benghazi . CNN could not independently verify those details . Gadhafi -- in a separate letter addressed to Sarkozy , Cameron and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon -- called the U.N. moves `` invalid '' because the resolution does not permit intervention in the internal affairs of other countries . Violence has raged in Libya following protests calling for democracy and freedom and demanding an end to Gadhafi 's almost 42-year-long rule . It 's a conflict spurred by anti-government protest and resulting regime violence against civilians -- which the U.N. resolution cites as `` outrageous '' and Sarkozy calls `` murderous madness .

Mike Mullen said Sunday . The coalition forces , including U.S. , British and French aircraft , have taken out most of Libya 's air defense systems and some airfields , Mullen said in interviews on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' program and other networks . In addition , Libyan ground forces in the vicinity of Benghazi were hit in an effort to prevent attacks on lesser-armed rebel fighters and civilians , said Mullen , who called the start of the mission a success . `` I would say the no-fly zone is effectively in place , '' Mullen told CNN , adding that the strategy now is to cut off logistical support for Gadhafi 's forces that are `` pretty spread out '' from Tripoli to Benghazi . Mullen also said Gadhafi 's forces had shown little ability to take on the coalition firepower so far , and he made clear that the scope of the mission was limited , involving creation of the no-fly zone , stopping attacks on civilians and allowing humanitarian operations to proceed . He acknowledged on NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' that the military mission could be completed with Gadhafi still in power . Fighter jets hit Libyan army convoy Action taken to stop Gadhafi Obama : No ground troops in Libya `` He 's a thug , he 's a cagey guy , he 's a survivor . We know that , '' Mullen said of Gadhafi on the CBS program `` Face the Nation , '' noting that the Libyan leader has access to large quantities of mustard gas that concern the United States . `` It 's something he could do a lot of damage with , '' Mullen said , adding that coalition forces were closely monitoring the situation and , so far , `` have n't seen him move in that direction . '' U.S. President Barack Obama had been under mounting pressure from Republican critics and some Democrats to take steps against Gadhafi . On Sunday 's talk shows , all U.S. politicians interviewed welcomed the new military mission , but some worried it was too late or too limited to do the necessary job of taking out Gadhafi . `` Isolate , strangle and replace this man -- that should be our goal , '' Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told `` FOX News Sunday . '' In particular , Graham took issue with Obama 's insistence on getting a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the mission as well as Arab League endorsement as a strategy to prevent accusations of a U.S. vendetta against the Islamic world . `` I think the president ` caveated ' this way too much , it 's almost like it 's a nuisance , '' Graham said . `` This is a great opportunity to replace a tyrannical dictator who is not a legitimate leader , who is an international crook . And we should seize the moment and talk about replacing him , not talking about how limited we will be . '' However , Mullen and Democrats said gaining international consensus for the mission was crucial , and Mullen made clear that the U.S. role would be limited , telling NBC that `` we 're not going to put any boots on the ground . This is n't about occupation in any shape or form . '' Democratic Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island told reporters that the best outcome `` would be for Gadhafi and his family to recognize that they are illegitimate rulers of the country and to depart the scene , allowing the United Nations , politically , to organize a popular referendum or some democratic means to establish a new government . '' `` If Gadhafi chooses not to go , then , I think , there will be a longer period of conflict , '' Reed said . `` But I just sense that given this incredible unified opposition to him , particularly the Arab League , that the signal has to be clear that his days are numbered . '' For now , Mullen told CNN , `` we would like to see him withdraw his forces across the country back into garrison '' and stop attacking his people . When told that Gadhafi was claiming women and children had been killed in the coalition air strikes , Mullen said on CNN that the targets were selected carefully , adding : `` I 've seen no reports of significant civilian casualties . '' On other networks , he said he was unaware of any civilian casualties so far . As part of the no-fly zone , coalition combat aircraft will be patrolling over Benghazi at all times , Mullen told CNN . Coalition forces also are looking to jam communications of Gadhafi 's forces in what Mullen called the `` first phase of a multifaceted '' operation . `` While we 're leading it now , we 're looking to hand off that leadership in the next few days , '' Mullen said on NBC . On the same show , Democratic Senator Carl Levin of Michigan , the chairman of the Armed Services Committee , said Britain , France and Arab nations would assume control of the mission . Mullen said he expected Arab countries that supported the mission to begin contributing military help . On Sunday , the French Defense Ministry announced that Qatar has offered to contribute four fighter planes to the coalition effort . House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , issued a statement Sunday calling for Obama to provide more explanation on the military mission . `` Before any further military commitments are made , the administration must do a better job of communicating to the American people and to Congress about our mission in Libya and how it will be achieved , '' Boehner 's statement said . To Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona , Obama waited too long to take action in Libya . `` We need now to support him and the efforts that our military are going to make , '' McCain told CNN in an interview taped Friday and broadcast Sunday . `` And I regret that it did n't -- we did n't act much more quickly , and we could have . '' McCain , the ranking GOP member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , said if the United States had acted a few weeks ago , a no-fly zone `` would probably have been enough '' to prevent the situation in the African country from deteriorating . Even so , he said , time is now against Gadhafi . `` If he -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- does n't succeed in a relatively short period of time , he 'll be driven back and , over time , I believe , defeated , '' McCain said . `` I have great confidence in our capabilities that the most mightiest nation in the world is now matched up against a third-rate or fourth-rate power . '' Asked if the United States waited too long , Mullen answered that it was impossible to say what might have changed if there had been earlier U.S. action . He emphasized the importance of gaining international consensus and assistance for the military mission launched almost exactly on the eighth anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 , saying : `` This was n't something the United States ginned up .

It was a stark , raw tweet from Ben Wedeman with a big impact on our newsroom Saturday morning . One of our first and most-trusted sources of information on the conflict in Libya had become a victim of the very civil war he in some ways had helped to spark . In the first few days of the conflict back in February , `` Mo '' as we called him had become an inspiration , friend and `` go-to '' source as well as a regular witness on CNN 's shows . Of course , you would n't know that from watching . We blurred his face and gave him code-names like `` Benghazi Protester '' in order to protect him and his young family . It was a struggle to keep him from blurting out his name and even phone number on air , sometimes , as Mohammed said that he wanted freedom for Libya , or to be martyred trying to achieve it . `` I am not afraid to die , I am afraid to lose the battle , '' the young , western-educated software engineer would tell us when we asked him to keep his identity secret . Libya before the fighting started was one of those very few `` black holes '' on the world 's map for us : like North Korea or Syria , it was a country where the regimes iron grip on information was so strong and the secret police so brutal and pervasive that the risk of contacting people was simply not justified for putting peoples lives at risk by staying in regular communication . When that all began to crumble beginning on February 17th and Libyans in the country 's east began to rise up , we had to develop webs of witnesses from scrap . But one quickly became our most savvy source : a 27-year-old technology expert and former internet provider in Benghazi . Mohammed and other supporters had set up a kind of protest command center in the city 's courthouse after ejecting Ghadhafi 's forces in the first days of fighting . That 's where we first contacted him on February 18th - a guy who looked more Silicon Valley in a hooded sweatshirt and big headphones than a partisan in a Libyan war zone . Amazingly , Mohammed had beaten the regimes firewalls and jerry-rigged a live signal from the building . The camera showed the few hundred protesters huddled outside against the walls due to the cold and whipping winds - worried that Gadhafi 's forces could swoop in at any moment . It was our first view of the protests there , and we were worried that all this would be traced back and used to target the band of students and young people defying the Gadhafi regime . At first Mo just wanted to get that picture to us , as he felt that it provided a thin blanket of security . He thought Ghadhafi might hold back if he knew that ordering the army or his feared African mercenaries to slaughter the protesters would be seen on live television around the globe . Mohammed pushed the technical know-how limits of our engineers and desk editors such as Yousuf Basil , Jack Maddox , Ben Brumfield and myself as he came up with elaborate ways to get more and more cameras going around the courthouse . But it was n't until we started interviewing him on air that we realized how special he was . Mohammed poignantly told us about how the army had shot into the crowds , then using armored vehicles to roll over protesters after they had run out of ammunition , and how the demonstrators would not give up . After the first two days he told us with his live stream and webcasts he had become some sort of leader . `` People have been calling my mobile non-stop . I woke up today with 125 missed calls . People have been calling and checking on me to see if I am safe . One person called from Serbia just to say they are thinking of me and my struggle . '' Chillingly , the newly married man with his first baby just a month from being born told us he believed the government knew who he was and there would be a price to be paid for his boldness . `` I would love to wake up tomorrow and people not be dead . But I know 200 people will be dead , '' he told one of our desk editors , Mitra Mobasherat . `` Libyans lives to Gaddafi are very cheap . '' Our correspondents in the field eventually caught up with Mohammed as CNN teams like Ben Wedeman and Mary Rogers led the push to get into the rebel territory , with Arwa Damon featuring him in one gripping package . Later , as the rebel lines advanced toward Tripoli , we were in contact with him less often , but he expanded his presence and contact with the rest of the world . Along with his supporters he developed social media sites like Feb17 . info , set up an independent internet TV signal `` Libya al-Hurrah '' and conducted interviews with dozens of broadcasters . And as the conflict surged back toward Benghazi in recent days he began to go out into the field to interview people about the dangers and loss they were suffering from the ongoing struggle . That 's what he was doing Friday when he was fatally shot . Reports are still sketchy , but his wife and supporters say he was killed by a headshot from a sniper while going out to videotape rocket attacks on one neighborhood where he heard several children had been killed . He phoned in one last report that morning to al-Hurrah , with the sounds of heavy machine gun fire rattling and artillery exploding around him . Then , nothing else until Ben 's tweet , and the following announcement he had been killed after the fighting . info was one final favorite quote of Mohammed Nabbous : `` A Candle loses nothing by lighting another Candle .

Arab League statement `` changed the landscape '' Secretary of state pressed UAE for support Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama 's decision to undertake military action in Libya to enforce a no-fly zone was the product of an administration debate with unlikely bedfellows . Initially , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was skeptical of the U.S. joining a military coalition . But senior U.S. officials said advances last weekend made by forces loyal to Gadhafi in retaking rebel strongholds in the east , which opened up the possibility of thousands more being killed , convinced her action was necessary . Additionally , a statement by the Arab League calling for the United Nations to enforce a no-fly zone , Clinton told reporters Saturday , `` changed the diplomatic landscape . '' As Britain and France pushed for a quick U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing a no-fly zone , officials said Clinton teamed up with Susan Rice , U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , in creating the conditions for a resolution with the broadest possible authority and the largest international support . Clinton made the case that U.S. support for a no-fly zone was conditioned on Arab participation and leadership . In Paris , Clinton met with her counterparts in town for a meeting of the Group of 8 foreign ministers and with Abdullah bin Zayed , the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates . Even as she criticized the UAE for its recent decision to send forces to quell a rebellion in Bahrain , Clinton pressed him to send planes to Libya . As Clinton traveled to Cairo and Tunisia seeking Arab buy-in for the resolution , officials said Rice built support in New York for the resolution . Samantha Power , an adviser to Obama on the National Security Council and a human rights activist , was also urging the president to intervene . Clinton 's alliance with Rice and Power in pushing for intervention put her at odds with Defense Secretary Robert Gates , who had publicly argued against a no-fly zone . Sources said Vice President Joe Biden was also more cautious , arguing for the smallest possible U.S. involvement in any military action . A senior administration official said that `` like the president , the vice president wanted any action taken with a broad international coalition . '' The official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military planning , said when the vice president `` saw that was achievable , he supported the policy to seek the military intervention . '' After meeting with Amr Moussa , secretary general of the Arab League , in Cairo Tuesday night , officials said Clinton called Obama , telling him the Arabs were willing to take part in the no-fly zone . That participation , officials said , was critical for the administration , which was concerned about the perception of invading a third Arab country . `` In order for us to go along , it was important for the Arabs to have some skin in the game , '' one senior official said .

The Fox story , posted on the outlet 's website Monday , says the journalists ' presence forced a British aircraft to call off firing seven missiles at the area that already had been hit . Robertson , who was part of the CNN crew cited in the Fox story , called the rival network 's report `` outrageous and hypocritical .

The compound was targeted , the official said , because it contains capabilities to exercise command and control over Libyan forces and the coalition goal is to degrade his military capabilities . Earlier , Western journalists , including CNN 's Nic Robertson , were brought inside the compound to survey the destruction . -LRB- 10:51 p.m. Sunday ET , 4:51 a.m. Monday in Libya -RRB- An announced list of the countries participating in the military coalition : The United States , Belgium , Britain , Canada , Denmark , France , Italy , Norway , Qatar and Spain . U.S. officials have said they plan to hand over operational control of the military mission in coming days . WE need to remember it is not the UN 's job to get Ghaddafi out , they do n't have any authority to do this it is the job of the UN to keep him from killing his own people . I know everyone is up in arms about us being in conflict with another arab country but this was a unanimous vote to help keep the civilians of Libya safe from their evil leader . And if this ever happens in your country , where ever you are from , I hope the UN steps in to help you too . Because I know that the US and its allies will , because it 's their job . Civil wars happen all the time and does n't usually need interventions from other countries until unarmed civilians are getting set up to be wiped out from the govt . IF UN WANTS TO FREE LIBYAN PEOPLE FROM THE ATROCITIES AND TYRANNICAL RULE OF COL. GADHAFI , STRIKING ALLIANCE SHOULD DEVICE SUCH A PLAN THAT EITHER ONLY GADHAFI IS CAPTURED OR DIRECTLY ATTACHED . IT SOUNDS INHUMAN BUT TO MINIMIZE THE DAMAGE , CIVILIAN 'S DEATHS AND SHORTEN THE WAR PERIOD , THIS IS THE ONLY SOLUTION IN SIGHT . BUT IT SHOULD BE DONE IN SUCH A TACTICAL WAT THAT IT SHOULD SEEM TO BE A PART OF WAR AND NOT PERSONAL ATTACH . AND THEREAFTER UN SHOULD CONDUCT FREE AND FARE DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF INDIA ALSO AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE AND HAND OVER THE REIGNS OF POWER TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND ALSO TAKE BACK THE MILITARY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO WIN THE CONFIDENCE OF LIBYAN PEOPLE AS WELL AS TO AVOID ANY MISCONCEPTION OR MISINTERPRETATION BEHIND THE ATTACH BY OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES . It all about oil . Why NATO did not invade Yemen , Ivory Coast ? Bahrain got problem , America support neighbouring forces invasion . Arabs being used by super power . Arabs are not united and will not united till the END . Shame shame shame on you . Arabs are the looser . We have problem that we can not solve . Leave other people alone . We should not take side in other country 's civil war . Stop spending money that we do n't have . Rosetta Stone Spanish Latin America Help our country first . Too many problem in the world . We can not solve them all . We should not choose between two evils . High horse Congressmen criticizing Obama 's decision to participate in the `` no fly zone '' over Libya . If he were a Republican , the Republican congressmen would n't be so critical . If he were n't so decisive as a commander in chief , the democrat congressmen would n't be complaining either ! Sorry folks , but we have one commander in chief and he has been very clear about his intentions all along . At least he is n't unilaterally taking on Libya -LRB- as our former president would have done -RRB- , but is acting on a United Nations resolution . I say he 's doing it right . So step back out of the lime light congressmen , and let the man do his job ! You can whine later about not being president yourself ! Im ALL for the U.S. in Libya even if it means ground forces , we should be helping people who are fighting for their Freedoms and preventing mass slaughters ! As for the ones in congress trying to ride on the popularity of fears of War and such , they are an embarrassment and hope they are voted out !! If Yeman needs helps so be it , I for one think we need to do something about Somalia , Clinton was right going in there but this time we should wipe it off the map !! This attack on Libya was planned out well and it shows how Smart our President is , I like that ! As for Iraq and Afghanastan all were very poorly planning which prolonged our objective . When you send in ground forces , you do not go in with a limited amount . If we would have flooded Iraq with ground foreces and Tanks it would have been over fast , same goes for Afghanastan . We want a Free World and a better world for our children , then we need to do what we can to rid it of terrorist and dictators who are a world threat . Libya 's Leader was nothing but a Terrorist . Then we have Korea whose leader is so unstable he could be the one to start a Nuclear War . We have to take these kind of leaders out , hiding under a rock and playing nice and flapping our lips will not take away the Problem !! One thing President Bush was right about , he said once Freedoms in the Middle East is establishest and leaders like Sadam is taken out , Freedom will spread , well , look whats happening now , there fighting for their Freedome , whats wrong with backing that ?? Your news cover is wrong . The plane shot down is a F-15E model . I have confirmed this by the photo description that it is infect this plane . I have studied the plane and have looked on several news sights such as BBC . Please review the statement made on CNN that the plane was a F-16 . Obama is hiding while caddafi lives up to his promise searching house to house to kill domonstrators in masarata . When you look at the countries involved in the Lybian war and you compare it in the 18th century with Napolean it is north surprising . The Western world like a olt of uglyness The Western World is constantly talking about terrorist attack . Who was responsible for bombing Martin Luther 's house in the United States , for sure it was not the Lybian leader nor Saddam .

CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : Military action is underway in the skies over Libya , and the U.S. is one of several countries involved . It 's our first story in the week 's first edition of CNN Student News . AZUZ : It 's called `` Operation Odyssey Dawn , '' and the goal is to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya . The United Nations Security Council voted for that no-fly zone late last week . The coalition responsible for enforcing it is made up of forces from the U.S. , Great Britain and France , among others . After the Security Council 's vote , Libya 's government declared a cease-fire in its fighting with rebel forces . And it invited representatives from other nations to come to Libya to make sure the cease-fire was real . Coalition forces were convinced that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was not following the rules of the cease-fire . On Saturday , the coalition attacked . You can hear the sounds of gunfire in the capital city of Tripoli . A U.S. commander said missiles landed near the capital and around other cities as part of these attacks . The fighting between Colonel Gadhafi 's forces and rebels raged on in other cities , like Benghazi . Here , you can see a fighter jet that was shot down over Benghazi on Saturday . Admiral Michael Mullen , the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , said on Sunday that coalition forces had taken out most of Libya 's air defense systems . But Admiral Mullen also said the U.S. role in `` Operation Odyssey Dawn '' would be limited , saying `` we 're not going to put any boots on the ground . '' He 's harshly criticized the other countries getting involved with the civil war in Libya . He called the coalition forces `` terrorists '' and promised a `` long-drawn war . '' But Sunday , a spokesman for the Libyan military called for another cease-fire . U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : Today , we are both also delivering assistance and support to the Japanese people at their greatest hour of need . The ties that bind our nations to Japan are strong . In the United States , we forged an alliance of more than sixty years . The people of Japan are some of our closest friends , and we will pray with them , and stand with them , and rebuild with them until this crisis has passed . AZUZ : We 're starting to see some new effects of the nuclear crisis in Japan that resulted from a tsunami triggered by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake . Yesterday , the government health ministry banned the sale of spinach from the area near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant . Officials made that decision based on radiation levels that were over the government limit . There were already bans on the sale of raw milk and restrictions on produce from the area surrounding the nuclear plant . Workers inside that power plant were starting to see some signs of progress over the weekend in their efforts to cool down these nuclear reactors . But officials say `` even in the best scenario , there will be a lot of bumps ahead . '' One they came across Sunday was the possibility that they might need to release radioactive gas into the air . They would do that in order to release some of the pressure that 's building up inside one of the reactors . The tsunami knocked out the plant 's cooling systems , and getting those back online is crucial . Allan Chernoff has a household comparison that helps explain why . ALLAN CHERNOFF , CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT , NEW YORK : To get a sense of the challenge confronting the Japanese at the Daiichi nuclear plant , consider this situation in a kitchen : a pot with no water on top of a high flame . Obviously , this dangerous situation could cause a fire in here . Well , stay with me . Those spent nuclear rods can generate tremendous heat , up to 2,100 degrees . Enough to melt them , burn them and send radioactive material into the atmosphere . They have to be kept under water , just like spaghetti when we 're cooking . Now , those rods are normally kept under 30 feet of water , but according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , in at least one of the pools in Japan , the rods are exposed ; there 's virtually no water or no water at all . So , how do we resolve this situation ? Well , if we do n't take the pot off the flame , we add water . And that is exactly what the Japanese are trying to do right now ; any way they can , even dumping it from helicopters . They are trying desperately to get water into that pool to avoid a nuclear disaster . Allan Chernoff , CNN , New York . AZUZ : There was some good news on Sunday when rescue workers found an 80-year-old woman and her 16-year-old grandson . They 'd been trapped in their home for nine days . The news gave hope to other people whose loved ones are still missing . But as Gary Tuchman explains , the search efforts are not easy . GARY TUCHMAN , CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Kesennuma , Japan . The scene behind me here is one of chaos , confusion ; it is surreal . If you see the video we took , you wo n't believe it . At least , we did n't when we saw it in person . So much debris , so much rubble . It is like a canyon . When we went down there , it 's like climbing a mountain . Cars , boats , houses : pushed out of different neighborhoods , pushed out of different areas and blocking fire officials , military officials . They 're looking for survivors , the possibility of survivors , or trying to find bodies . We met a woman today who told us her father was at the second floor of his house , made the decision to stay in the second floor when the tsunami siren sounded . Well , anyway , at this point , they ca n't get to the house . It appears the house is still there , but there 's so much rubble surrounding the house , there 's no way to check if this man survived . It 's just an absolutely incredible scene . It 's hard to imagine what the people here in northeastern Japan are going through . The death toll is rising rapidly . We know it will continue to rise . We ourselves , just myself and my crew , found a body in the back of a car . This is how they 're finding bodies , the officials . There 's so much rubble down there they ca n't get to . It 's very likely that it will be weeks or months before they come anywhere close to knowing what this death toll is . And the aftershocks continue . Last night , while we were sleeping , we felt at least six or seven sizable aftershocks , and that only increases the anxiety that people feel here in northeastern Japan . This is Gary Tuchman , CNN , in Japan . AZUZ : A lot of you have been asking on our Facebook page about how you can help the victims of this crisis .

AZUZ : Haiti : a nation still struggling to recover from a devastating earthquake that hit it more than a year ago . It 's also trying to resolve a presidential election from last November . None of the candidates got enough votes for an outright victory . Yesterday , Haitians headed to the polls to vote in a runoff election . One candidate is a former law professor and first lady . The other is a Haitian entertainer . There were some problems early on at a couple polling locations : missing ballot boxes , and not enough ink to mark who had voted . But officials said those issues were resolved by later in the morning . The final results of the runoff are scheduled to be released in mid-April .

But CNN Student News returns tomorrow . You know the drill . We 'll see you then . "}, {"uid": "112", "dct": "2011-03-21", "dates": [null, null], "text": "Russia Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said the intervention reminded him of the medieval call for crusades : In Bill Clinton s times they bombed Yugoslavia and Belgrade , Bush sent troops to Afghanistan and then , under a made-up and absolutely false excuse they sent troops to Iraq , liquidated all Iraqi authorities , even children from Saddam Hussein s family were killed . Now its Libya s turn . They use protection of civilians as an excuse . But it is the civilian population who perish in air raids . So where is the logic and conscience ? There is none of both . Russian President Dmitry Medvedev broke publically with Putin on this - a very rare event -- saying of Putin s remarks , `` Under no circumstances is it acceptable to use expressions which essentially lead to a clash of civilizations . `` The blood-soaked tempests that Iraq has undergone for eight years and the unspeakable suffering of its people are a mirror and a warning . The military attacks on Libya are , following on the Afghan and Iraq wars , the third time that some countries have launched armed action against sovereign countries . It should be seen that every time military means are used to address crises , that is a blow to the United Nations Charter and the rules of international relations . In its argument , the newspaper said military actions will add to the domestic chaos in Libya and possibly strengthen Gadhafi . Furthermore , it argued that Libya may descend into anarchy as a loosely connected tribal society . The external affairs minister of India , S M Krishna , told reporters : We view with grave concern the ongoing violence , strikes and deteriorating humanitarian situation in Libya . We regret the air strikes that are taking place ... India calls upon all parties to abjure violence and the use of threat and force to resolve the differences . I think the need of the hour is cessation of armed conflict . Meanwhile , the African Union has called for an end to all military actions in Libya . Mauritania President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz , whose country is hosting the union s summit right now , added that the African Union rejects the idea of foreign military intervention in Libya , regardless of its form . The fact that we know so little about the domestic context among non-regime actors in Libya is precisely the reason that the types of external intervention currently taking place are likely to backfire . On Libyan news site Jeel-Libya , Salem Ben Ammar writes approvingly of international intervention , calling this the beginning of the countdown to the end of the cowardly tyrant Gadhafi . Also supporting the intervention is the London Evening Standard . In an editorial , it writes : The air strikes against Libyan government targets have had one good outcome : the rebel stronghold of Benghazi did not fall , as it would otherwise have done , and the inevitable massacre of rebels did not take place . France Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said : The initial success of our intervention is clear . If we had done nothing , Benghazi would be a bloodbath . We saved the civilians of Benghazi . Greg Sheridan of The Australian writes : Even if this results in a prolonged stalemate it is much better than outright victory for Gaddafi . And in fact the precedents are not too bad . For nearly a decade the U.S. and its allies enforced a no-fly zone against Saddam Hussein 's forces over the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq . The de facto state that developed there was liberal and well run by Middle Eastern standards and has been central to the democratic dialogue in post-Saddam Iraq . In the United States , Washington Post columnist David Ignatius compliments the Obama administration s handling of the intervention in Libya : President Obama is turning a page , by letting other nations take the first whacks at Moammar Gaddafi , no question about that . But that strikes me as good strategy , not a feckless blunder . What s increasingly clear watching the play of events over the past week is that Obama really does want to change the narrative about America and the Arab world even at the cost of being criticized as vacillating and weak-willed . He senses -LRB- rightly , in my view -RRB- that over the past several decades America , without really intending to , became a post-colonial power in the Middle East . The narrative of American military intervention stretches from Lebanon to Iraq to Afghanistan , with the ghastly interlude of Sept. 11 , 2001 . Obama seems determined to break with it . He really is the un-Bush . In Germany , foreign minister Guido Westerwelle said : It is the responsibility of every country to decide if they 'll support a military intervention or not . We always said we would n't send soldiers . This does not mean we are neutral , this does not mean that we have any sympathy with the dictator -LRB- Muammar -RRB- Qaddafi . -LRB- But -RRB- we calculated the risks , and when we see that three days after this intervention began , the Arab League has already criticised this intervention , I think we see we had good reasons . Germans reflect this ambivalence . A survey in the Bild am Sonntag newspaper found that 62 % of respondents supported international intervention , while 31 % were against it . Despite their support for international intervention , the majority of Germans did not want their country involved . German pundits worry that this stance will hurt Germany 's global standing . Amrit Naresh of The Local newspaper writes : Did we isolate ourselves ? In a way , yes . Did we damage our room to maneuver ? We have lost a little bit of credibility in the Security Council , I believe , with this cautiousness . Amr Moussa , secretary-general of the Arab League , stepped back from his earlier criticism of airstrikes and said the Arab League and the U.N. Security Council are united on the need to protect civilians . Another Arab League official , however , said saving Libya from Moammar Gadhafi 's forces was `` an Arab and nationalist duty '' above all , and warned that the situation in the North African state was `` very dangerous . '' Who do you agree with ? I agree with the opponents . This aggression is absolutely unacceptable . Now Gaddafis military bases are destroyed , so what 's next ? The Rebels will be armed and have the upper hand ? Those loyal to the regime ca n't fight back and have to surrender unconditionally . Will there be peace in the country ? Do we outsiders know whether we are doing the right thing , when we rule in favor or against one of the two warring parties . March 21 , 2011 at 2:20 pm | Reply Is it just ?? Were you there defending the Libyan people from murder , torture and persecution for the last 41 years ? Did n't think so . The only `` just '' solution would be if every tree in Libya was adorned with a hung Gadaffi supporter . After all the years of atrocities commited by his regime the opposition deserves a `` JUST '' revenge and I hope they get it . March 21 , 2011 at 2:44 pm | Reply If the justified premise is that we are saving innocent civilians , then we must start bombing Israel , get rid of that War Criminal Beni ' . Israel continues to terrorize Palestinians with Tomahawk 's and F15 's , tanks , and modern weapons of terror . While the Palestinians are armed with sticks and stone and absolute determination to recover some of their Nation stolen by the Euro-Jews , the Kazars . March 25 , 2011 at 4:37 am | I agree with Niclas . Let 's put it in prospective . When people are fighting for freedom and liberty from tyrants like Mr. Kaddafi , we should not be ashamed , fearful , or scared of confronting `` evil '' . Like some typical neighborhoods , if everyone accept thugs to run around rampant , doing what ever they want , and causing you to live in fear and in your home with bars , or even worse , pretend you do n't see it and agree with them -- what type of life is that ? Only dogs and animals ready to be killed live like that . When an entire neighborhood stands up for their rights , we should stand with them -LRB- and not on the sidelines waiting to see where the wind blows -RRB- . So many people are fearful of taking the right action , in standing by the right thing to do . Ask yourself , what is the right thing to do when you see a tyrant , dictator going after his own people ? You stand up like a real man , a `` human '' and go against them . If I were in Libya , I would be right across from Kaddafi 's home , ready to blast him out to kingdom come . Let the free people of Libya finally achieve their aspirations and dreams of freedom , liberty and happiness -LRB- yes the principles of the US Constitution which we in America live and die for -- not sit around and wait for others to defend us -RRB- . March 25 , 2011 at 5:01 am | At least it is named the ` evening ' standard , hopefully the sun is setting on its ` standard ' : their standard is this : the inevitable massacre of rebels did not take place . What then of the ` the inevitable massacre of Gadaffi loyalists ? ' Oh and the civilians I keep forgetting them civilians . Now trapped in the Devils Triangle formed by Gaddafi , the Allies and the rebels . All this to protect them . I am sure they are more than touched . March 21 , 2011 at 8:16 pm | Reply so we 'll just stand buy + watch this tyrant butcher his people , fill his pockets and the west support him because he has stolen his countries oil ? March 22 , 2011 at 11:33 pm | Reply March 23 , 2011 at 1:09 am | Reply Sometimes , going with `` the devil we know '' is a reasonable strategy . In this case , whoever replaces Gaddafi can not possibly be worse . March 23 , 2011 at 2:34 pm | Reply Agreed 100 % with the opponent . This is another war that disguise themselve in pretext of humanity but the end its is all about the OIL . March 24 , 2011 at 7:58 am | Reply Hey J. von , I fully agreed your comment . I think this so called UN resolution 1973 for intervention in libya is unacceptable and it is all about west hungry thirst of LIBYA OIL that 's it . USA , UK and FRANCE are hypocrat and playing double standard in libyan internal conflict because looking at IVORY COAST conflict whereby thousands and thousands of innocent civilians are being killing by the president who lost last year election but refused to cede and as many as 700000 displace people . What did USA , UK , and FRANCE do about that ? The answer is clear NO. . Because there is no OIL in Ivory Coast . Did they intervene in Darfur , Sudan ? Do n't judge me wrong i have never like Qaddafi before and i will never like him but what west is doing in his country is criminal act and they will be revenge by Qaddafi 's sympathizers around the world in coming months or years to those international countries who attack him with their bombs . Qaddafi have a lot supporter even in AMERICAN SOIL , FRANCE AND UK . March 28 , 2011 at 12:14 pm | Reply Is n't it ironic Putin is the one to criticizing the US ? The same Putin who 's invaded Georgia , stolen big chunks of it 's territory , who 's a former graduate of the most vicious terrorist organization , the KGB , who likes to kill off his opponents with plutonium , or to simply make them disappear . Those who are `` lucky '' find themselves charged with trumped up charges and thrown into a prison . Journalists who 're critical of him simply die off . Putin is a Russian thug president and the only reason he 's speaking out is because he fears a regime change in Libya might lead to lower oil prices . It wo n't , but it only shows his ignorance . March 21 , 2011 at 2:40 pm | Reply Putin ' likes to kill off his opponents with plutonium , or to simply make them disappear ' Too bad he is opposed . We could have really used him in Libya March 21 , 2011 at 8:27 pm | Reply Putin 's concern is more of a jumpin point for the upcoming election -RRB- Im sure he will be running against Medvedev March 23 , 2011 at 11:42 pm | Reply I wish and pray Putin contest against the current president so that USA can shot da hell out being world police . I hope obama lose re = election 2012 because he give an empty campiagn promises . He called mcain Bush 's third term but he is carbon copy bush policy .

Regardless of how the Libyan situation turns out , this was the right thing to do . Putin is a born again ex-KGB who would love the old days to return . He is no one to criticise the coalition . For the first time in years , a lot of people in my circle express their approval of the intervention , the US has gone up in our estimate for what it is worth and your president deserves respect for the way he has handled the situation . I ca n't believe the criticism that is being directed at him . He is doing his best to restore America 's credibility in the world and is not doing a bad job at all . I think it is incredible that the educated young people of the Arab world have finally woken up and realized that their enemy is not the west but they have home made enemies who lust for power and will do anything to cling to it . Well done to the US and international coalition including the pusillanimous Arab League ! March 26 , 2011 at 7:40 am | Reply Before getting to upset with Putin , remember that Russia is the only country in the world that can destroy the US in about one hour !

I say go for it with caution -- who will come into power in all these countries -- I also want to comment on the woman attacked in the hotel with the # $ @ ! roughly trying to cover her head and now saying she is prostitute -- Ihave thought about her on nd off the last 24 hours wondering if she is really alive or mostly faced the SAME thing she was speaking out against . Whatever happened to the 4th reporter ? One day all will lay down their arms . March 28 , 2011 at 9:36 am | Reply Will be more equatable if the same applied to Saudi , Bahrain and Yemen . March 21 , 2011 at 2:59 pm | Reply With the exception of Yemen , those countries have n't used nearly the level of violence that Gadahfi has used -LRB- yet -RRB- in suppressing the demonstrators and , while there has been government violence in Bahrain , it 's nowhere near the point where the government and people ca n't negotiate , especially since the US has so much more influence in Bahrain . As for Yemen , it looks like the president there is on his way out after all , hopefully with a minimum of chaos .

March 24 , 2011 at 8:14 am | I 'm new to this , but feel so disgusted by the British government and the rest of the so called coalitions hypocrites . The smug glee is shameful the contradictions so vulgar and the murderous intent so self righteous and so self self serving . The news channels a cross the world also seem to sensationalize , their reporters seem subjective with selective hearing and do n't let the facts get in the way of a closed mind or self fulfilling prophecy . Since when does two wrongs make a right . Is air support to the revolutionaries counter attacks establishing a cease fire or imposing a murderous will on others for ones own intent or beliefs . Why are we not protecting civilians in Bahrain , Yemen , Syria or Saudi Arabia by enforcing a cease fire . Why were we not asked to vote on this ? Who gave Cameron\\/Clegg the right to take us to war again in a self righteous crusade . Why not let the Arab Countries take responsibility for their own management and development . The Drone attacks by the US in Pakistan and Afghanistan and the so called calculated collateral damage is as bad as any genocide for ones own goals . March 21 , 2011 at 5:44 pm | Reply Drone attacks against terrorists count as genocide ? Take another hit from the crack pipe . March 23 , 2011 at 1:10 am | Reply Where was your outrage when Ghaddafi was using artillery to bombard his own civilians , and pulling wounded out of hospitals and executing them ? March 23 , 2011 at 5:41 pm | Reply Bahrain , Yemen and Saudi Arabia are our close allies . Therefore , we have to adopt a different standard , let us put it in this way , when approaching the issue . That is why we have begun airstrikes on Libya while turning a blind eye to what 's happening in Bahrain , Yeman which are also ruled by dictators . We have got our national interests to safeguard , bearing in mind . March 27 , 2011 at 11:53 pm | Reply I agree with shug . Fareed , let 's get one thing absolutely clear . Protection of civilians is not the reason for the no fly zone and the military action . If there is one thing the United Nations has proven it is that it can and will stand by when civilians are being killed . I am surprised the Arab League did not call for a no fly zone to protect their ` brothers ' in Gaza . Every person in the world , including those in remote tribal villages who has access to world news know two things : One : The United Nations will not always intervene to protect civilians Two : If there is intervention there are some other interests involved . Those so called world leaders have not learned how to lie or handle their public relations . Why should the Arab League choose to ask for protection of rebels -LRB- see Times article -RRB- -- sorry -- civilians in this country , Libya ? Are they interested in establishing a totalitarian Muslim state ? It seems to be so . And there is the oill . Black Gold it is called , perhaps I know why . More precious is `` Red Gold '' the precious blood that runs in the veins of all of us who are human . Red Gold is to be preserved at all costs , conserved at all costs , protected at all costs , and is priceless . However you can get a barrel for the price of a few cruise missiles though .

The UN can not act towards the protection of civilians in the majority of cases -- we were very lucky to get this resolution passed . You rationalization that the UN has not been able to act in previous cases nullifies the current initiative is false .

Every damn country on this planet , from America to China play politics to get their oil supply . Every American ca n't live without it -- from plastic to fuel to power our autos and power plants , every damn country needs oil . The US gets less than 2 % of it 's oil from Libya -- Europe gets more oil from Libya and China is just around the block up there . That said , times have changed gentlemen . The Arabs are in revolt against their governments . They now demand some common things we American preach : Liberty , Freedom and democracy to vote without fear . We should be happy to assist them in limited form to achieve their aspirations . And let 's get serious , any person not living in Libya who supports keeping Qaddafi around should go live in Tripoli under Qaddafi . I can guarantee you you will either be his prized trophy , his bitch , or you will be in a hole somewhere with bullets across your body . Now do you want to live like that ?

March 24 , 2011 at 8:10 am | Well ... we Americans and Europeans turn our eyes when killings occurred in Rwanda and in the former Yugoslavia in the mid-90 's under the Clinton Administration . And over 400,000 died of genocide . We lived in guilt and agreed never to sand by when such actions occur in the future . So we have decided to take a stand , and stand for humanity . A stand where hopefully in the future , we will teach the future world generation that genocide and killing innocent people as a very good reason to use military force to save a population . In fact , this is one good reason to use military force . The future benefits and learnings will carry through for generations . Finally , let it be known that the Arabs have taken head to President Obama when he travel to Egypt in 2009 and gave a speech about Freedom and Democracy . 2 years latter , that Arab population is taking the call and rightfully so . The journey is still long and hard ... however , the Arab countries , after 30-40 years of tyrants and dictatorship rule , was bound to have revolutions to overthrow their current governments , and move more towards democratic rule . As the Arab countries and world start to see the US as holding to it 's principles of protecting the Libyan people who are struggling for their right to Freedom , Liberty and democracy , they will start to appreciate America for what it is -- a true democracy which stands by it 's principles -- Freedom , Liberty , the land of the brave .

Yes , I realize we have partners in all of our various conflicts , but we are always in the lead and we are always bearing the greatest cost , and for what ? I guess we did n't learn anything from Iraq . We went in , got Saddam out , then started taking fire from people who hated and opposed him , but feared him . Why would we thing that Libya would be any different ? Yeah , yeah , Ghadaffi fired on peaceful protesters . How long did it take for those peaceful protesters to pick up weapons and fire back ? Not long at all . Makes you wonder how long it would have been before they were the ones who started shooting . Hey , next we should give them money , or weapons , or both and see how long before those weapons are fired at us .

It is just too obvious that there is an unseen hand controlling events underground in the countries where revolution has become the other of the day . Let the true Libyans rise up to resist the Cockroach Called Imperialist western Allied force ; whose missions are aimed at toppling Governments who does not dance to their tune via sponsored criminal revolution backed up by military power . The second point here is that , it becomes a crime when the citizen of any country takes up arm against its Government ; would an American , British or French citizen protest against their Government with Guns and explosive , and such group of people not be locked up forever or even shot dead by their law enforcement agencies , This is a new era crusaders where the lawless Imperialist , tend to portray their selves as the true law upholders . This is called Impunity of the modern era Never the less if these lawless imperialist thinks they want justice for the so called masses they don t give a dame about ; why do n't they go to Yemen where nerve gas has been used against armless civilians ?

We look back at what happened in Sudan and other countries where we did n't intervene , and we 're ashamed . That we did n't step in earlier in Darfur is inexcusable . Now we were given a chance to stop another insane dictator from going in and killing an entire portion of the population , and we took it . Some people are upset because we sided with the rebels by acting . But had we not , we would have passively watched a massacre on CNN , and the headline would have been , `` how many did n't have to ? '' Leaving Libya alone would be the act of siding with Qaddafi . We certainly should n't invade Libya , but I 'm proud of us for giving them a fighting chance by evening the playing field . People here have been pointing out how we have n't been intervening in other countries in exactly the same way . I do n't think we should , nor do I think that would be even possible . But this shows that we can try when given a good opportunity . And if other countries know that we can and will , that will help things so that we wo n't have to .

It was the UN that disabled Saddam and could not stop Bush to go for the jugular . Khadafi gave up his weapons and chemicals . He went down the same way . When he had these weapons , no one dared to touch him , just like when Saddam had his toys . Iran and North Korea are smarter than the world give them credit for . Iran will not be put in the same spot as the discussed two . North Korea has to hold out for some time yet until the rest of the world powers can start to use the veto in the UN . The US is not worried about using veto power . It does it many times a year , mostly to protect Israel . When will the veto wielding powers start to face their political responsibility to the less powerful of the world ? I am disappointed in the behavior of India .

Will the same allies protect the evil Ghadafi and his supporters when the tables are turned and the rebels start to kill them all ? What is the future of Libya now ?

March 24 , 2011 at 5:46 am | Reply Dr. Ali Hamdi , author of the healing bill book America has never abandoned any of its friends or allies ; to say nothing of an unarmed nation who has been mercilessly murdered by militia members and mercenaries from Cuba , Venezuela , Chad , Mali , Zimbabwe , and other parts of Africa . It is therefore unfair to criticize the very nations that freed Kuwait , Afghanistan , Iraq , Kosovo , and Bosnia & Herzegovina for helping a tormented nation . I am very much aware that for the Chinese regime which like the Libyan one has massacred its own people in Tiananmen square and Tibet and the Russian government which killed thousands of innocent people in Chechnya and elsewhere deem the Libyan blood to be cheaper than a drop of oil and it is perhaps colorless . March 24 , 2011 at 9:23 am | Reply Dr. Ali Hamdi , author of the healing bill book The Security Council must regard corruption and its related offenses as intentional crimes and treat corruption , violation of human rights and the monopolization of authority and power the same way genocides , ethnic cleansing , and hostile activities against other nations are treated . When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait , the Security Council issued many resolutions to deter him although the population of Kuwait was only three million . The Security Council is therefore requested to issue similar resolutions and arrest the Arab dictators who violated human rights and enslaved not only three million but hundreds of millions of their fellow citizens . Because of the stronghold that many Arab dictators have firmed up and the ineffectiveness of coups , the reform in countries of atrocity necessitates the intervention of the United States , the Security Council , Human Rights Organizations , the Civilized World and the International Community as a whole . There are many grounds to support such intervention ; terrorism has begun in such countries as a result of the dictators violation of Human Rights and then spread like a cancer into the whole planet from such corrupt countries . Our dictators should solely be liable to the International Community for the pandemic-like diffusion of the ethical disease that destabilized the world and weakened the developed countries economy . It is a horrible mistake to believe that Saddam Hussein was the only one who raised money for terrorist organizations or harbored terrorists ; most of the Arab dictators have been doing the same thing in three ways : while some of them supported the terrorists to shake the Israeli security , others have either harbored them with a view to destabilizing their neighbors or just to repel their chanceful hoax . Our dictators have been propagating hate ideas that threaten the convergence that is realized in respect of the dialogue of civilizations , not to mention their continuous violation of human rights and the inhuman practices a lot of people have unnecessarily undergone on part of such despotic dictators and their militias ; this situation pushed a lot of desperate people to join the terrorist groups in quest of getting rid of their lives . The Security Council , which is supposed to reconcile between countries , must enact laws that enable the International Community 's interference in respect of the sought after reform in any country and issue resolutions with regard to dictators and officials who oppress their fellow citizens . Oppressed citizens mustn t only be regarded as refugees and incarcerated like kettle in refugee camps , but must be treated with respect and great concern ; as for their claims , they must be given the same dimensions and level of concern that is usually given to cases filed against war criminals . Arab dictators must be summoned to Amsterdam , New York , Geneva , or any foreign country and prosecuted and punished for the crimes they committed as in Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic 's cases . If they are found guilty , they must be arrested , toppled , and punished . Their victims must be well represented and allowed to talk the way we witnessed during Saddam s trial ; further more , such victims must be accommodated in five star hotels and enjoy the same services and respect their foes may enjoy all throughout the time of their trials . Because a country is according to the United Nations Organization composed of its inhabitants and its land , sea and air , violating the inhabitants rights must impose the interference of the International Community and the Security Council whether the offender is a foreign country or from amongst the same country . Justice can not be fully established if partiality finds its way to the United Nations Judiciary System or the Security Council s offices . It is the responsibility of superpowers like the USA , Great Britain , France , Germany , Australia , and other peace-loving countries to launch this initiative to clean the world from injustice and dictatorial regimes . Being named The United Nations Organization and not The United Countries Organization clearly indicates that the nations are the most important factor in the said Organization as the name suggests . The United Nations Secretary General and his staff know that a lot of people throughout the world have been going through injustice and deprivation on part of their dictators ; even though , no measures have been taken to diminish their sufferance , yet . Every time a Secretary General is elected we rejoice and expect to see him issuing deterring resolutions , but apparently justice has not been amongst the United Nations ' concerns as far as the red carpets are laid to the Secretary General by such dictators . Are the leaders more important to the United Nations Organization than the millions of people the dictators have enslaved ? If the answer is yes then the International Organization must change its name to read : the United Leaders Organization . Since the answer is no , this Organization must assume its full responsibilities and free the millions of oppressed people around the world and establish justice in their countries . The inhabitants of this planet who are the basis of the foundation of the United Nations Organization rely on their Organization , the United States of America , the Civilized World and all countries that love peace and justice to topple the last dictators and free the world . We can not wait anymore to see the world completely free of evil and injustice . The United Nations is therefore requested to establish courts where ordinary citizens can complain against their leaders and sue them whenever they violate human rights , transgress or monopolize the dominion . The United Stated of America has taken a vital part in preaching and spreading democracy in the world and has successfully changed the destiny of many nations ; however , many oppressed nations are still waiting to see the 101st Airborne Division , the 3rd Infantry Divisions , and other American brigades and battalions dumping the dictators in hell . The dictators have always formulated trivial pretexts with a view to coating the violations of human rights in such entities with false sovereignty pretexts , and claimed that local affairs of their countries must be treated within their territories without foreign interference . Such ostensible excuses mustn t be acceptable to the International Community anymore , because they have helped envelope the despotic leaders crimes with an illegal tricky legitimacy ; they are the same pretexts that helped a lot of Arab and African dictators kill millions of their fellow citizens . The United Nations Organization is requested to enact laws that enable observers from the International Community to see and report how oppressed nations are living , because the horrible life conditions that a lot of people have been going through can not be detected by the foreign ambassadors who usually live in luxurious villas and maintain electric generators in their embassies and residences that start automatically as soon as the electric power is off to the extent that they do not even feel that the electric power was interrupted . The authorities in many corrupt countries can interrupt the electric power and deprive major parts of any city from electricity for many hours without warning . The intentional interruption of electric power can occur in the middle of a surgery , a lecture , or a long waited seminar , movie , or television series . It happened that a surgeon lit few candles to finish an appendectomy for his client due to an intentional electric power interruption that was aimed to devastate the inhabitants of that particular quarter as a punishment for their continuous reform related demands . The Security Council and all the developed countries are requested to alleviate the sufferance of oppressed people through effective means such as the enforcement of democracy in dictatorships and the legislation of laws that prohibit the dictators from their usual recourse to trivial pretexts that serve nobody except themselves . An initiative of this kind will be a great idea that serves not only justice in the world but will without doubt reduce all the terror activities that have resulted from injustice . The permanent members of the Security Council are invited to issue a resolution in this regard and propagate it all over the world to let everyone whether he is a leader or a subject know that he is not above the international laws and regulations . As a matter of fact , there are many leaders and officials like Saddam and Slobodan Milosevic who need to be overthrown and prosecuted for recorded crimes against humanity ; the American , the Australian , and European immigration offices are rife with scary stories many immigrants have endured . This resolution must clearly stipulate that presidential candidates must sign a Security Council sponsored written commitment to establish justice , fight injustice , surrender transgressors and terrorists irrespective of their ranks or positions , and undertake that nobody may be excluded from this obligation or enjoy any presidential , religious , tribal or diplomatic immunity when it comes to the violation of human rights and the failure to establish democracy ; such pledge must be signed before such presidents are allowed to start campaigning . There must be a global commitment to not considering any body in any part of the world above the law . Whether the issue is about genocides or individual cases , the Security Council must treat such cases with the same level of concern , and if necessary forms committees of inquiry and a special army to bring to justice all outlaws who refuse to appear before their judges or fail to respond to such demands . Partiality , favoritism , and interests must be completely avoided where the concerned judges , investigators , and personnel should be absolutely independent and let work freely in any country and anywhere including palaces , mosques , churches , synagogues , and temples . They mustn t be of any religious , political , geographical or ethnic predisposition . I believe that in presence of such global state of chaos and ethical degradation it will not surprise anyone of us to wake up in the morning and learn that a pro-Taliban group has regretfully toppled the Pakistani President in an overnight coup and seized the Pakistani nuclear arsenal . Although this scenario is furious in view of the brutality and hostility the group has been exhibiting , it is never farfetched . That is why the implementation of democracy in the world is as vital as the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . Establishing justice , implementing democracy , fighting terrorism , eradicating dictatorial regimes , fighting poverty and diseases , in addition to the non-proliferation of WMD must be the Civilized World Countries highest concern . If the Security Council wishes to see the world better , its members must issue a resolution that stipulates that all corrupt and dictatorial regimes must be replaced by democracies where no leaders may govern for more than two terms of four years each . The unconditional recognitions that the International Community has unfortunately granted to the kingdoms , sheikhdoms , sultanates , and dictatorships that resulted from chaotic states and gradually gained international recognition over time must be reviewed , canceled , and replaced with democratic republics . For those who think they can prove me wrong , I remind them that except for the intervention of President Bush and his brave army , the Emirate that the Taliban Group had created on 90 % of the territories of Afghanistan would have gained full international recognition as a country and many of the criminals who enslaved the Afghani people and deliberately slain his men and shot his women dead , as we saw on TV , would have gained international recognition and walked on red carpets in many parts of the world by now . Likewise , the Arab kingdoms , sultanates , sheikhdoms , states , and republics have , in fact , gained international recognition when similar chaotic conditions in the past had left no room for the international community to calculate things the right way and depend on virtues in the way they recognized states and entities . If the United Nations Organization is not able to correct such historical mistakes , the superpowers , in view of the damages they incurred as a result of the ethical mutation that was created by the dictators , must alternatively force the regimes that rule such entities to establish justice and implement democracy or give way to better regimes .

This is a giant leap forward for mankind and bravo to the U.S. , which acted with the complete support of Americans , the democratized world and the media , including Al Jazeera , save one questioning columnist . That Republicans and a few others are now jittery about an uncertain mission is understandable but there was not one word of protest before the U.S. became involved . As for red herring arguments that congress had to be consulted , I sincerely doubt it . In Canada where the political parties are so divided they have forced an early election , just days before the Prime Minister 's motion in support of Canadian forces already deployed received unanimous support in the House of Commons , whereas American post-action partisanship is disingenuous and detracts from intelligent debate . Of course the developing situation is a valid concern as is cost . Luckily with these theftocracies as all dictatorships to date have turned out to be , there seems to be ample funding available that countries such as the U. S , need only apply for once new democracies take root . Also , the U.S. , which has been so dominated by a recession of late , would do well to recognize the depth and breadth of economic activity that will take place and benefit all nations when more of the world is demoncratized to enable healthy economies to grow .

March 27 , 2011 at 1:07 pm | Reply Understanding the protests in Libya , Tunisia , and Egypt In light of the instability in Libya , recent decisions to enact a no-fly zone , and the heated debate that has ensued as a result of that decision , it seems the world has turned to reactionary measures , forgetting all too well that the instability seen in Libya , Egypt , and Tunisia can be easily repeated in other developing countries . Many have attributed the motivations of the protests across Middle East and North Africa -LRB- MENA -RRB- to economic hardship -LRB- exacerbated by the global recession -RRB- and government oppression , chalking up the viral nature of the protests to social media . This view is shortsighted and ignores the drastic impact demographic changes , shaped over decades , can have on political and social stability . The answer comes down to demographics : in the last 30 years , these countries have developed large educated youth populations . As these populations came to age , these countries were primed for change . What Led Up to the Protests ? Demographers have at times been admired for their ability to tell the future . Thirty years ago , a demographer could have told you the demographics of the Egypt , Libya , and Tunisia would be drastically different 2010 and as such , so would the political and social environments . Let s look at two factors that primed these countries for protests . Increased Fertility Rates 30 Years Ago . In the late 1970s and into the 1980s , Egypt , Libya , and Tunisia countries experienced increased fertility rates . Fertility rates have since declined , but increased fertility rates 30 years ago have created today s reality : the majority of people in Egypt , Libya , and Tunisia are under the age of 35 , resulting in increased demands for resources and jobs . Increased Access to Education . In the 1980s , priorities and public spending turned to building human capital . In the last 30 years , life expectancy in Egypt , Libya , and Tunisia has risen by about 3 years and infant and child mortality rates have declined -LRB- Egypt cut theirs in half -RRB- . A particular factor in priming North African countries for social change , however , was an increase in literacy and school enrollment rates , due to increased public priorities on education in the 1980s . Currently , 99 % of Libyan youth between the ages of 15 and 24 are literate ; the numbers are similar in Tunisia and Egypt . Tertiary -LRB- post-secondary -RRB- school enrollment rates in Libya , for example , are about 50 % . Compare that to 2.8 % in Kenya . What makes Egypt , Libya , and Tunisia -LRB- and many other MENA countries -RRB- unique from other developing countries ? In short , a relatively healthy and educated youth population . Why does this demographic make a difference ? Youth Are More Likely To Protest . Numerous studies have shown that marriage and increased age reduce the likelihood of protest participation . Youth who lack spousal and parental responsibilities are more likely to protest . Access to higher learning opportunities increases information access and are often associated with increased expectation of government accountability , civil participation , and accessing formal employment opportunities . Many other African countries have large youth populations , but often access to secondary and tertiary school education for these populations is extremely limited . High Unemployment for Unemployment Leads to Instability . Looking at the specific case of Tunisia , 97.1 % of children attend primary school and 71 % of youth attend secondary schools - impressive numbers by many accounts . Now of those in the country who are unemployed , 41.7 % have a primary education , 37.7 % have a secondary education , and 13.6 % have a tertiary education -LRB- note that only 27.2 % of the population has a tertiary education -RRB- . That means that more than half of the unemployed Tunisian population has accessed some kind of higher learning and while many of the unemployed in Africa can fall back on income-generating activities in agriculture , those in Egypt , Tunisia , and Libya are a bit more limited as non-agrarian industries dominate their economies . Why is it Important to Understand the Impact of Demographics on Social Stability ? The majority of African countries have large and growing youth populations , but higher education access has lagged behind . However , if education rates accelerated to match population growth , protests , as seen in MENA countries , could be mimicked all across Africa . Does this mean that countries should stop investing in education to prevent instability ? Educated societies are critical to economic and social growth and well-being . There is substantial evidence to support that East Asian investments in human capital and social programs , particularly education , were not only critical to economic growth , but also critical to social and political stability . Social investments actually avoided political breakdown in several East Asian countries as governments responded , at least in part , population demands for public services . However , an educated population , particularly a youth population will demand change and accountability from governments . Developing countries , particularly African countries , can avoid substantial political and social breakdowns by identifying , including , and responding to the voices of their changing populations , particularly their growing youth demographics .

Wesley Clark : No-fly zone is established , some military objectives achieved He says the more difficult questions are the diplomatic ones Clark asks : Will Libya be split by the civil war ? Clark : Will Moammar Gadhafi be held to account for violence against civilians Editor 's note : CNN Contributor Wesley Clark , a senior fellow at the UCLA Burkle Center for International Relations , is a retired general and former Supreme Allied Commander in Europe . Little Rock , Arkansas -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The coalition is concluding its second day of air operations . The no-fly zone is established . A column of Libyan military vehicles , driving on a road toward Benghazi , has been attacked and destroyed . This is what much of the world had been crying out for . Yet the major questions have always been less about the military feasibility of the operation and more about its political goals ands how to achieve them . Although several world leaders have called for Col. Moammar Gadhafi to give up power in Libya , the authorizing U.N. Security Council resolution did not call for this . No-fly zone a slippery slope to more ? -- Assuming the opposition forces are safe in Benghazi , then what must be done to protect civilians in those towns previously held by the opposition but have now been retaken by Gadhafi 's forces ? Presumably some U.N. presence must enter these areas and work to identify and protect civilians . This will likely be resisted by Gadhafi and could spur further conflict . -- Will the U.N. and the coalition be satisfied with a political stalemate on the ground , in which the eastern portion of the country achieves de facto and de jure independence ? The cease-fire called for in the resolution would seem to rule out any renewed offensive activity by the opposition . So unless there is some means to apply additional leverage , there may be two Libyas : one a vengeful dictatorship , the other a fledgling democracy needing long-term international protection . -- Will Gadhafi be held legally accountable for the excessive violence already exercised against innocent civilians ? This will require an investigation on the ground in Tripoli and other cities now under Gadhafi 's control . He is not likely to accept this . Meanwhile , Gadhafi is doing his best to characterize the action as one of `` Crusaders attacking Muslims , '' and claiming excessive collateral damages , including civilian casualties , from the coalition 's initial air strikes . One of the basic rules of intervention is to get it over with quickly . From the military standpoint , this has been done . But how these initial military actions will relate to the stated -- and unstated -- goals of the operation remains the major challenge for the coalition . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Wesley Clark .

He is the author of the new book , '' The Longest War : The Enduring Conflict between America and Al-Qaeda . '' -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A critique of the U.S. involvement in the military intervention in Libya that will no doubt be common in coming days is that the Obama administration is making a large error by embarking on a war with a third Muslim country , as if reversing Moammar Gadhafi 's momentum against the rebels will be a rerun of the debacle of the war against Saddam Hussein . A further element of this view is that -- whatever the outcome of the Libyan intervention -- the United States ' standing in the Islamic world will once again be severely damaged by an attack on a Muslim nation . There are , of course , some real similarities between Hussein and Gadhafi -- both ruthless and erratic dictators of oil-rich regimes who fought bloody wars with their neighbors , brutalized their own populations , sought weapons of mass destruction , and sired some equally unattractive sons and heirs . The dj vu quality of the Libyan situation may help account for recent polls taken before the intervention which found that while Americans were either split or slightly in favor of imposing a no-fly zone over Libya , most were opposed to stronger U.S. military action . The military intervention that President Obama authorized against Libya on Saturday ... is a quite different operation than the 2003 invasion of Iraq . But the military intervention that President Obama authorized against Libya on Saturday -- eight years to the day after President George W. Bush announced the commencement of `` Operation Iraqi Freedom '' -- is a quite different operation than the 2003 invasion of Iraq . Beyond the obvious difference that Obama has not authorized the use of U.S. ground forces in Libya , there are several other differences to consider : First , the Obama administration was handed a gift by the Arab League , which in its more than six-decade history has garnered a well-earned reputation as a feckless talking shop , but unusually took a stand one week ago by endorsing a no-fly zone over Libya . That endorsement put the Arab League way out in front of the Obama administration , which was then dithering about whether to do anything of substance to help the rebels fighting Gadhafi . The unexpected action by the Arab League gave the administration the impetus and diplomatic cover to then go to the United Nations Security Council to secure a broad resolution endorsing not only a no-fly zone , but also allowing member states to `` take all necessary measures '' to protect civilians in Libya . This U.N. resolution is reminiscent of the one that President George H.W. Bush secured in November 1990 , which gave Iraq six weeks to withdraw from Kuwait following Hussein 's invasion of that country . The U.N. resolution in 1990 similarly empowered states to use `` all necessary means '' to force Iraq out of Kuwait if Hussein ignored the deadline . The similarities do not end there . The coalition that massed to drive Hussein out of Kuwait involved significant forces from major Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan . So too the Libyan no-fly zone will be enforced by Qatar , along with western powers such as France and the U.K. . This is all quite in contrast to George W. Bush 's ineffectual attempts to gather international support for the invasion of Iraq in 2003 . There was no U.N. resolution explicitly authorizing the use of military force against Hussein , and no Muslim countries participated in the American invasion and occupation of Iraq . Indeed , before the March 2003 invasion of Iraq , the Turkish parliament voted against allowing American troops passage across Turkey to invade northern Iraq , which put a wrench in U.S. military planning . Underlining the fact that the Iraq War was widely viewed as illegitimate by Muslim countries , the same year that Turkey voted against allowing American soldiers to use its soil to attack Iraq , Turkish soldiers were also leading the International Security Assistance Force helping to keep the peace in post-Taliban Afghanistan , a military operation that was also authorized by the United Nations and was not seen as illegitimate by much of the Muslim world . The Bush administration 's largely unilateral decision to go to war in Iraq -LRB- the U.K. and a few other nations provided troops -RRB- undermined America 's standing in Islamic countries . A poll taken a few months after the 2003 invasion found that Indonesians , Jordanians , Turks , and Moroccans all expressed more `` confidence '' that Osama bin Laden would `` do the right thing '' than that Bush would . According to a poll four years later , America 's favorability rating stood at 9 % in Turkey -LRB- down from 52 % before September 11 , 2001 -RRB- and 29 % in Indonesia -LRB- down from 75 % before September 11 -RRB- . Finally , another key difference between the Iraq war and the Libyan operation is that the casus belli for Iraq was based on highly classified intelligence accessible to few people -- later proved to be wrong -- that Saddam Hussein continued to maintain a weapons of mass destruction program . By contrast , the Libyan intervention was caused by the real time evidence provided by the world 's leading media organizations -- including , of course , Al Jazeera -- that Gadhafi is massacring his own people . The high level of anti-Americanism in the Muslim world that was generated by the Iraq War is unlikely to be replicated by U.S. military action against Libya , because Gadhafi is widely reviled in the Arab world . His antics on the world stage have earned him the enmity of even his fellow autocrats -- who will not be welcoming him if he chooses to `` retire '' to Saudi Arabia as other murderous dictators of his ilk have in the past -LRB- think Idi Amin -RRB- . And the fact that both the Arab League and the United Nations have endorsed a military action against Gadhafi strongly suggests that the Libyan intervention will not generate a renewed wave of anti-Americanism in the Muslim world . Instead , it underlines a striking feature of the protests that have roiled the Middle East in the past several weeks : Strikingly absent from those protests has been the ritualized burning of American flags , something that hitherto was largely pro forma in that part of the world . That 's because Arabs have finally been able to express publicly that their biggest enemy is not the United States , but their own rulers .

As coalition forces continue to attack Libya and impose a no-fly zone , Moammar Gadhafi 's regime is under the greatest pressure it has faced in its 42-year reign . But questions are being asked as to what will emerge from the bombardment . Will Gadhafi survive and if so what will his next move be ? What happens if he is toppled or even killed and who would run the country ? Can Libya ever enjoy peace and prosperity or is it set to be ravaged by a long and bloody civil war ? CNN spoke to some experts to hear what they think the endgame could be . What follows are some of their thoughts . Fawaz Gerges , professor of Middle Eastern Politics and International Relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science , said he expected the conflict to drag on . `` Libya 's political landscape is uncertain but I think that Gadhafi will fight on and on and this could be very prolonged . `` It could also see Libya become extremely divided with maybe Gadhafi continuing to rule one half of the country and the other half being ruled separately . `` This would likely create a prolonged civil war . I think Gadhafi will hang on -- he has very little choice anyway as there is nowhere for him to go , he has been backed into a corner by the coalition . We must remember that there were no-fly zones imposed on Iraq in 1991 and 1993 and still Saddam Hussein remained in power . `` I think the result of military action will be a very fractious Libya . Military action could also turn public opinion within Libya once they begin to see casualties from air strikes . This could strengthen Gadhafi rather than weaken him . `` Even if we were to see Gadhafi killed , this would create a political vacuum which could see a long civil war which the West would have to take sides on . `` We do n't know how divided Libya is ; we do n't know the strength of feeling for regime change . There is also a sense of increasing anxiety in the Arab League . `` I think Gadhafi will hold on for a long time . We also have to consider the wider implications for the whole of the Middle East . This could cause further instability throughout the Middle East and not just Libya . '' Libya could have great future ... Marco Vicenzino , chief strategy adviser at the Afghanistan World Foundation , said the future for Libya could be bright if its wealth was fairly distributed . `` What happens next very much depends on whether Gadhafi survives or how long he fights to survive and that could be a long time .

March 21 , 2011 at 9:14 am | I am confused by our involvement . Last week , Obama stated `` the U.S. wILL NOT take the lead in ANY military action '' .

If so then who cares whether he was targeted or not ? Cut off the head of the snake and they will have accomplished what all the countries set out to do ... If Kadhafi was dead then civilian deaths would stop ... No Kadhafi ... No countless deaths of Liabya 's people . March 21 , 2011 at 12:04 pm | Libya is revolting against Gadhafi , this clearly is a strife between people of that country . The rebels asked for help and assistance to the West , and the west very much obliged . Now , Obama said we will not be heading the alliance , and yet the cruise missiles that rained in Libya were fired from US warships . How much money did the US have to spend once more for those missiles ? One more reason this country is going broke each day . Plus Libya is no friend of the US , now the rebels need help and they are friendly , once this civil war is over , it will be back to the old ways . Clearly , these countries are bunch of ingrates and back stabbers . March 21 , 2011 at 12:10 pm | Germans scooped photos of our military men in Afghanistan posing with mutilated corpses . How is it possible that our US news media was scooped , or are they just not allowed to report misdeeds of our troops ? I think our men have been in combat too long to be so inhumane . I dont blame Afghanistan for wanting the US troops to leave . Is this what is planned in Libya ? March 21 , 2011 at 12:10 pm | So who will be next ? Will it be Yemen , Syria , Tunisia that the US will be raining down cruise missiles ? And who will be paying for those missiles ? March 21 , 2011 at 12:14 pm | What are they going to impeach him for ? He is not declaring war . He is actually not even doing anything as bad as Bush did in Iraq . Obama is agreeing with the rest of the world that something needs to be done to stop the slaughter in Libya . Bush laughed at the rest of the world and said `` screw you , i am going to do what i want anyway ! '' They never declared war then either . It was just called a military operation . My husband is in the army and got to fight in that `` operation . '' March 21 , 2011 at 12:20 pm | . If these countries are in the middle of a revolution , more power to them . But it is not any of our business . Then you can argue that if we do not help then it could become another world war before we decide to intervene . Hard to decide what to do . Help other human beings or just sit back and watch them get slaughtered ? The people of Libya have asked the world for help . The people in Iraq did not want us anywhere near them . March 21 , 2011 at 12:28 pm | I see no conflict in President Obama 's comments : He says the official US position is that Gaddafi must step down as Libya 's leader , but it will not use military force to achieve that end . He say the US WILL use military force to protect Libyan civilians from Gadaffi 's military attacks . Be that as it may , I feel the US needs to step back from it 's self-appointed role as the world 's police agency . I hate the idea of ANY government subjugating people , but neither do I feel responsible to prevent it . March 21 , 2011 at 12:35 pm | Please Tell me Why this country did NOT go into Libyia Sooner . How many Years has The leader been a Sore in the US side ? Wish the Arab League would make up their minds what they are going to do . The Arab League has Always been Flakely . The Leader needs to Disappear . I Approve of this very much . How much information does the Public really need ? I believe while there they should also take out Iran . Especially after holding Hostages for about 444 days . March 21 , 2011 at 12:50 pm | Yes we should be there , I just wish the UN could have been there earlier . Everyone talked and talked and dragged their feet for a month and now people , politicians and the News media are all acting confused as to what is going on . To me it is pretty obvious what is going on so I do not understand others acting so confused and critical . The UN should have been in there earlier when it would have been easier to achieve their goal and hundreds if not thousands would not have had to die . Everyone is demanding too much information and wanting Psychic knowledge of how and when it will end . Common sense says you do n't tell the enemy where you will be and what you are going to do ahead of time which is what people are demanding to know . Grow Up and pay attention and you will know what is going on . Be happy we live in a country that will not sit back and watch while people are being slaughtered for asking for what you already have . March 21 , 2011 at 12:51 pm | how come we are so worried bout libya killing themselves . I mean look at the USA we kill each other for a dollar . how bout we start worring bout ourselves and not wat going on over seas and how come its the USA and UK that always step in ? the U.N needs to step up and deal with it USA has enough probs of our own . we dont need to worry bout out them we should worry bout makein jobs for ppl who dont have jobs . March 21 , 2011 at 12:56 pm | do people not know if we go to war oil will go up gas will go up i say we worry bout the USA and the USA only March 21 , 2011 at 1:10 pm | I think we have WAY too irons in fire right now and are spreading our already stressed military too thin !!!! I feel for the people in Libya ... but this type of action should have happened many , many years ago ... and I do not trust our governments motives behind this decision ! March 21 , 2011 at 1:11 pm | America has no business in Libya just like they have no business in the Middle East . I 'm sick of America being the world police . The worst part about it is that Libyans EXPECTED the U.S. to come do something . March 21 , 2011 at 1:11 pm | We should be involved to a certain extent . what we have done so far I believe is good enough . We can not continue spending money on the military when we have still millions of people out of work who may beed federal extensions on their unemployment . In addition , we are already dealing with a deficit in our economy . This is no time to make it worse . March 21 , 2011 at 1:12 pm | we are not the policemen of the world . arabs took responsibility and are involved in protecting the people of libya from being slaughtered . too bad the world waited too long to do away with hilter to take down hilter . the arabs should be commended for their involvement . March 21 , 2011 at 1:13 pm | I think America must not get involve in Libya on a military level but perform the sergical operation or covert operation and take the Qadhafi and his son out of the equasion . We do n't need to spend a dime because we are already in lots of debt . Also we do not want to destroy any infrastructer of Libya that will impact on world economy . I feel sorry for the people of libya , but the U.S. has enoough of it 's own problems , We ca n't police the world , till we police America . March 21 , 2011 at 1:15 pm | I am an active support of President Obama but his action in the Libyan theater is wrong . The united States always seem to pray on weaker nations with oil under pretexts . President Obama , like former President Bush is killing Arab . President Obama is killing Libyan and destroying their country in the name of human right when we all know it is to militarily overthrow the Libyan government . I do not like Gadhafi because he was instrumental in destroying Liberia and killing over 250 Liberian but going after him with superior military might is wrong . The U.S. could easily assassinate him instead . If president Obama is serious about stopping foreign leaders from massacring their own people , why his administration is not in the Ivory Coast , Bahrain , and Yemen ? Why the United States is not enforcing the countless United Nations Resolutions against Israel for it long atrocities against the Palestinians ? As an independent voter Obama lost my vote for any attempts on his part for the presidency in 2012 . March 21 , 2011 at 1:16 pm | The USA is broke and ca n't even support itself ... But it tries to make the public seem like the entity of the USA actually cares about people ... PLEASE . The USA is a corporation that ca n't manage to sustain itself , it ` es going down under and is leaning off of the fed for perpetual debt ... it does n't take a genius to see where this is going . The USA is in the exact financial situation that post WW2 German was in ... and now it seems they are going the EXACT same path to fix it . They even have `` FEMA '' camps ... I do n't believe they will be able to suppress the civilian militia though should be interesting to watch . March 21 , 2011 at 1:16 pm | I want us to help anyone\\/any nation in trouble and I do n't want this to come down to money . However , what about the need at home for education , housing , health care , etc. . If we are going to continue to go into other countries to help them , let 's cut the military budget to the core in order to help those at home ! March 21 , 2011 at 1:16 pm | The situation concerning our involvement in Libya is ridiculous . First of all we are 2 weeks late in help the freedom fighters . Now we are trying to be so polically correct -LRB- the way our adminstration has been all year -RRB- , that it boggles the mind . Either we are in the war and want Kadafi gone or we should n't have started . We now have the upper hand and instead of saying we are now backing off , -LRB- so dumb -RRB- , we should pursue Kadafi and his thugs until they give up or are blown up . As far as the UN is concerned , they are worthless . Its time to stop worrying about what the world and every one thinks and get on with ending this revolt by really helping the opposition . March 21 , 2011 at 1:16 pm | Playing a supportive role is the right thing to do . We have to worry about Iraq and Afghanistan . Last time I checked Gaddafi is a horrible person , he is a dictator and like all dictators has killed thousands of his people for their beliefs and if he had put down this revolt , you could guarantee he would kill ten of thousands more . Also in regards to the price , I was unaware that America 's foreign policy is `` we will help you , depending on how much it costs '' . March 21 , 2011 at 1:17 pm | The president did it the right way . unlike George Bush he received the blessings of the UN . Obama used his head and weighed all options . he also made it clear there would be a limited offense with no boots on the ground . I ca n't believe all the criticism from the right when all they did was complain about the president doing nothing . Fox news posted that Obama was suckered into the Libyan fight . If anybody was suckered in it was George Bush with believing his own information he received on weapons of mass destruction . We have no business in Libya . Our military industrial complex is an imperialist demon that is sucking this country dry . It controls our congress and our president . We have 1000 military bases in over 130 countries . This is an imperialist takeover of the world to establish a one world government . The American people are paying the price . We finally have a President that has the forsight to look into the future before taking matters into his own hands . Going through the U.N. and having a collective joint effort to stop the massacre in Libya was very smart and the best course of action for our country . Yes , we should be there . . I also agree , the United States should not be the only country to absorb the cost or involvement . However , the process is too slow ... but diplomacy always is . March 21 , 2011 at 1:20 pm | I believe the US should support the UN in handling these little wars . The US has many internal problems . I fully support the way the Libyan problem is being handled . The US is not the world 's policeman . March 21 , 2011 at 1:20 pm | I think that everyone agrees that Gaddafi is a dictator and that he should go , but the UN should not be involved in internal affairs in this country . The war at Lybia and the US leading the strikes is really confusing for any arab . On the other hand , there are too many messages against arabs and muslims these days especially in CNN . CNN is watched in some Arab countries , so information about the strikes at Lybia and other programs like the '' unwelcome muslim next door '' may bring anger in the arab nations populations against US . March 21 , 2011 at 1:23 pm | Please stop calling it a `` war against Libya '' or `` Libya War . '' It 's a conflict . And it 's not USA battles Libya . It 's UN resolution 1973 enforcement . Perception is reality to the audience that does not completely understand the nuances of the American language . The foreign audience is watching as CNN presents the news to the world and in rural provinces that some people think CNN is the voice of the American government . March 21 , 2011 at 1:23 pm | Seeing as how the rest of the world 's economy is directly or indirectly attached to our economy ... why do n't we concentrate on fixing OURS first . Let 's stop spreading our money around the world and take care of OUR problems now , and after that we can concentrate on helping others . Our priorities seemed to have been shuffeled around a bit . . do n't you think . Is n't it about time the rest of the world take a more active part in their own economy instead of holding their hands out to us for help when we ca n't even take care of our own problems ? It 's about time for us to handle our money more responsibly . I think the U.S. involvement in Libya is a noble thing . For weeks you showed us how the Libian people rose up for in an effort to gain freedom from the tyriany in their homeland . You planted journalists there and gave us reason to empathize with them and yearn for their freedom and a chance for democracy and to determine their own future . Finally , Obama and the U.N. coalition agree to go in and protect the opposition in Libya . Now all I hear from you on CNN is , `` How do the people in the U.S. feel about our participation in the military action in Libya ? '' Well , I think that most of us feel like we did before the action started , we want to help the Libyans . Your questions and the manner in which you ask them do not appear to be supportive . Before the action began , you questioned why Obama was taking so long , now you 're questioning our actions . We need to support our actions . And guess what - I 'm a Republican , but I think Obama has done a good job in handling this matter , along with Secretary of Defense Gates and Secretary of State Clinton . I have switched from watching Fox to CNN because of the fantastic coverage of the Egyptian situation , and I 've stayed here since . Wolf Blitzer has far outdone the other channels with his Situation Room coverage on everything going on in the last two months . March 21 , 2011 at 1:25 pm | We should provide backup support with our missiles and drones . Being totally involve is another fiasco just like Iraq and Afghanistan . We can not afford another war financially and in human terms . Unless the oppositions to Gadhafi on the ground request us and our Nato allies and the Arab league nations . Remember that we and our Nato allies are Infidels and another Infidel invasion of an Islamic nation does n't sit well with the Arabs . It 's interesting that the Middle East conflicts are the result of fundamentalist -LRB- trouble makers -RRB- Muslims and always it 's the Infidels that has to come in and take care of the mess . Why ca n't the peace loving Muslim band together and take care of the problems ? March 21 , 2011 at 1:30 pm | Ali Myself and members of my family voted for President Obama because we thought he was not going to follow in the footsteps of the previous administrarion . Needless to say we are very disappointed that he has become a warmonger just like the man he replaced . It is very strange that all black leaders are called dictators and efforts are made to remove them by the USA . The USA just can not go around the world forcing governments to govern in a manner which the USA choses . In addition why does this double standard in the middleeast continues . The USA never support any UN resolutions that decree Israel for killing innocent Palestinians . Ali we are very disgusted with the manner in which Obama has allowed the likes of Sen McCain and Liberman to dictate how he runs this country . He definately will not get our vote and support when he mounts his campaign for reelection . I do hope Obama hear this message . March 21 , 2011 at 1:36 pm | We should have been there weeks earlier ... but plowing through excruciating U.N. rules and getting a US and EU coalition to include Arab League participation was finally accomplished ... in the nick of time or ... too late ? Our obvious objective was to prevent the slaughter of anti-Gaddafi protesters . These mostly young and idealistic Arabs were , perhaps , only hours away a Gaddafi promise of `` no mercy '' facing his army equiipped with overwhelming forces of tanks and heavy artillary , and a willingness to kill all protestors `` like rats . Under the pressing need to stop a genocide , while trying to act legally , under U.N. rules , it looks like the good guys do n't have a tidy story , even as the three day war has been executed almost perfectly . So now , the naysayers and Monday morning Q.B. 's seem to overlook the fact that we stopped a horrible slaughter of innocent protesters ... calling now for a `` full review '' and a `` definite end game '' . I wish we could call on the young Arab , Mohammed Nabburs , along with his two buddies -LRB- all slain by Gaddafi snipers -RRB- , , , to articulate the `` end game '' . All they wanted was the freedom to live and work in a free country . Is that worth protecting ? Is that worth breaking a few asnine rules of engagement ? March 21 , 2011 at 1:42 pm | We are a leader in the world which espouses certain freedom as inherent rights of people and could not absolve ourselves from not supporting their effort of realizing same . It would be unconscionable and an utter disgrace . we should not be there , we didnt get into eghypt business why is it more important to play in lybia , i thought president obama was n't going to risk american lives when it is unneccessary , besides if the us really wanted him out we would have done it when we crossed his line of death back in the 80 's March 21 , 2011 at 1:53 pm | We still have n't learn to get along in this country . What if other countries stuck there nose in our business . Who is going to pay for all this . We have thousands out of work . Local governments are piling on taxes on property taxes for schools , state taxes to up . Government charged us for Social Security that some may never get and Federal Taxes ... who is going to pay for all of this . We have the Democaates against the Repulicans and the Repulican agaisnt the Democrates and nothing here gets resolved . We have children here going to be hungry , homeless people by the thousands and we ca n't resolve our own problems . Why then do we think that we can resolve others . March 21 , 2011 at 1:55 pm | I did not know my message was not appropriate ! If so , please , do not publish it ! I was honest because I love the United States and I do n't like to see unintentional actions that may bring hatred against it . March 21 , 2011 at 2:01 pm | From Canada : Having studied at college years ago with Libyan students , the day Ghadafi took over control of their country was still fresh in their minds . He immediately declared all privately owned property belonging to the state and took over these properties and assets . The people , relatively well off , were forced to give up everything and Ghadafi then doled minimal offerings out amongst the general population , limiting each family to one home , one servant , one car , etc. . Millions of dollars -LRB- at least -RRB- were taken from these people , and to this day many of them now live in squalor , any form of opulance doled out to Ghadafi 's personal circle of friends . I am pleased that Canada is helping to free these people , along with the other countries who have generously given in the name of humanity . Let 's hope this tyrant does n't get away with the monies taken from these people . I feel the involvement in another country is ridiculous and as a 20 year old college student fear there may be a draft at this pace in a few years . We are just getting to involved these days . March 21 , 2011 at 2:13 pm | This is an undeclared war . Our Constitution is the law of the land and requires a Congressional Declaration of War or at least the invocation of the War Powers Act . Precedent save for Bush II and now Obama requires that we respond to attacks rather than initiate them and that we initiate only when there is a military threat to the US . Libya presents us with no justification for this attack . The UN is acting like a bully and we are going along with it . Gadhafi is doing exactly what any government would do if trying to put down a revolt within the borders of a soverign country . The US and the UN have no legitimate interest in a Libyan civil war We should get out and apologize . March 21 , 2011 at 2:15 pm | Our involvement inte no-fly zone is a huge waste of taxpayer money . We have a humanitarian crisis in the US -- it 's called near 10 % unemployment and nationwide cuts in education . Let 's let France , the UK and the Arab League take care of this issue in their own back yard . March 21 , 2011 at 2:16 pm | Yes , be involved . If Misrata still exists , if any opposition Libyans are still alive can coalition forces do anything to protect them from pro-Gadhafi murder ? The UN resolution clearly mandates protecting opposition Libyans from Gadhafi forces . I know Arab League nations are having problems with protest in their countries . Even so , Arab soldiers need to be sent to help Libyan protesters . Most Arab League nations very reasonably offerred dialogue to protesters . You could offer mediation by an international panel of neutral countries as a next step in dialogue . A board of mediators might be Morocco , Uruguay , Indonesia , Switzerland , Madagascar , Iceland and , South Africa . This way you responsibly address your people 's problems and Libya 's humanitarian need . -LRB- Gadhafi is killing Arabs . -RRB- You win and win , at home and globally . March 21 , 2011 at 2:16 pm | The coalition should go in , arrest Ghadafi and take him to the Hague for trial , period . I am a retired law professor and have taught Int ' l Law . It would be legal-he is violating human rights . March 21 , 2011 at 2:16 pm | What would the USA do if Libya decided it did not like how things in the USA were going ? Do all nations have the option to invade USA if they disapprove ? Middle Eastern countries did not invade the USA during its civil war ? As long as the Arabic world did not do anything -- why does the west interfere ? We continue to look like agressors in the middle east . Where is China & Russia . What are we doing ? March 21 , 2011 at 2:17 pm | Why are we now going into Libya ? -LRB- The same word that got us involved in every other Middle East operation -RRB- : OIL . Libya has one of the largest oil reserves in the world . March 21 , 2011 at 2:17 pm | I am proud of the way the President handled this situation . The Lybian people were begging for help . The President managed to get NATO on board as well as the Arab League which is a major accomplishment . First the President was being critized for not going in soon enough , then he gets critized for going in at all . I am thankful that he is our President in the present state of the world . He is someone who acts calmly and thinks before he acts . I shudder to think how a president McCain would have handled all that this President has had on his plate . March 21 , 2011 at 2:17 pm | We should n't be helping ANY Libyans . These are the same Libyans who welcomed home , as a hero , the Pan Am bomber . Pick a side , any side , one 's as bad as another . March 21 , 2011 at 2:17 pm | Yes I do believe we should be involved since UN regulations are not being followed and there strong evidence to suggest Human Rights violations . However I do not believe we should be there long term . While the president has not been as forth coming about the strategy for going to Librya . I believe members of congress , government officals need to stop bickering and get behind and support the soldiers . Bad mouthing the presidents decisions and not offering constructive criticism is a waste of time . March 21 , 2011 at 2:18 pm | This is completely ridiculous ! There was no real need for America to get involved in this dispute in the Middle East . Obama moved in too quickly and I feel this is a true disgrace to America . I think Obama should step down ... quite honestly ! March 21 , 2011 at 2:18 pm | France and Britain have interests in Libya , America does not . Let France and Britain take care of their own business without America 's help . March 21 , 2011 at 2:18 pm | I 'm glad we 're involved in Libya . It took a while , but our military capabilities will help in a way most other nations ca n't . I 'm proud that we 're there , but more than that , I 'm glad we do n't have to put boots on the ground . In that way , we 're really appealing to both sides of the argument . By sending planes and missiles , we help the U.N. and the resistance , and by only sending planes , we refrain from occupying another Mid-eastern country . I 'd rather we intervene than not . March 21 , 2011 at 2:18 pm | It is the Constitutional responsibility of the US Congress to declar war on a sovereign nation . It is not the domain of the President , and certainly not the domain of the UN . However there is some precedence for mischief . For example , Harry Truman called the Korean war a `` police action . '' Ghadafi appears to be criminally insane . He must be removed . However , his enforcer is doing the damage while Ghadafi plays dress-up . March 21 , 2011 at 2:19 pm | I feel now the America and the rest in the coalition need to remove Khadifi from power and if that results in his death , well so be it . If he remains in power or is able to regain his power those that wish to be free in Libya will not have a chance . Also , I feel Khadifi is capable of retaliation directed at any nation in the coalition . March 21 , 2011 at 2:19 pm | Ali ; no mattr how you cut it US is leading to protect oil and Isreal March 21 , 2011 at 2:20 pm | This from a retired Army CSM : So are we going to attack Yemen Next ? Is Iran also in our lines of sight ? May I ask who is oppressing the American people ? I say this administration . We do n't get beat with a stick but we do get beat with higher and higher taxes to fund all these expeditions into the Arab world . When are American going to say , `` Enough ! '' We have a responsibility to assist others as a good neighbors , but we are not the world 's police force nor are we funded to perform that task . . March 21 , 2011 at 2:22 pm | We need to stay out of all of these other countries messes and focus on all of the problems that we have to deal with in the UNITED STATES ! If we are going to get involved with every country that is having problems we will not be able to sustain ourselves . If the Arabs want to go after Libya-let them ! Then they can quit their Monday morning quarter backing when they say they want something done but when it is done , oh not that much ! Let them invade Libya with their camels !! March 21 , 2011 at 2:22 pm | I am upset with the press ' coverage of the Middle East issues . Two weeks ago CNN moderators implied the US\\/Obama was too slow to act in Libya . Now moderators question the wisdom of going in . The discussion needs to be multi-dimensional before decisions are reached by government officials . Once the decision is made , media should report on what is happening and stop second guessing . It is too late now . We are bombing another country in response to pressure to do so , and for reasons that are not clear ; unless we now have Bush two remaining in office to promote democracy through war . Also , I note the Arab nations are not acting , only voicing support for the western nations that in time will be held accountable for all the problems in the region . March 21 , 2011 at 2:23 pm | i dont think we should be in lybia or in iraq . my stand point is that we are invovling ourselves in a well thought out stratigic plan to iraticate the middle east as well as our own country . we dont need oil for everything around the world . we can use other means of fuel that are less harmful and yet more efficient to our needs and will last longer than oil and is less expensive . the UN should step in and say enough is enough and pull the troops out . haveing the U.S. troops over in lybia is more damageing than effective . this whole situation is like putting a sunroof in an out house . it doesnt make any sense nor does it belong . March 21 , 2011 at 2:23 pm | Big mistake going to War with Libya . Absolutely no justification for it . We need to vote out these trigger happy politicians . Has America become a WAR Culture . March 21 , 2011 at 2:26 pm | We hear these enormous costs reported for military actions -LRB- i.e. Libya , Afghanistan , Iraq , etc. -RRB- however , what is the real additional budget impact cost for such deployments ? I think costs reported are inflated and misleading . I m not saying there are not additional costs , but the military costs reported seem to be the total cost of the forces involved , directly and indirectly and I d just like to hear some real numbers and not sensationalized figures used to hype news reporting . To my logic , the only major additional costs would be some percentage of spent ordinance and some cost for relocation of ground and maybe air forces . Salaries , housing , food , medical costs , fuel , etc. would be incurred even without such events . These troops constantly train -LRB- sometimes with live ordinance -RRB- so most of the cost is already in the budgets of our military . Of course , ordinance cost would go up some percentage , cost of additional transportation of troops , equipment , etc. to the deployment locations , and probably some percentage increase fuel expenditures . I also understand that some percentage of housing vacated , including energy cost would still be incurred , but should be reduced . As a Viet Nam veteran , I m certainly not disregarding , disrepecting or minimizing the human cost in any way . Loss of life , injuries and certainly the mental impact on family members are terrible costs indeed and my heart goes out to those involved . However , it is very difficult to directly calculate these factors as a cost of a military deployment and are totally different discussions . March 21 , 2011 at 2:27 pm | Nature wreaks such havoc on humanity , how dare we wreak havoc on each other ... period . March 21 , 2011 at 2:31 pm | US has been very cautious this time around before taking any military action . Obama wanted the UN and NATO allies also to have a more role in the decision making . I think he is being very prudent given the country 's economy and perception by the outside world . But this whole excersice could have been expedited so that we could have saved many innocent lives . March 21 , 2011 at 2:31 pm | I 'm all for helping other countries , But what about the US Why in return for the help are we not getting Binladin handed to us on a silver plater ! March 21 , 2011 at 2:32 pm | I believe that there should be no more involvement by the United States in Libya . As was said by one in the Quaker Church many years ago , `` There is NO way to peace . Peace IS THE WAY ! '' This threatens to be another Iraq or Afghanistan . We were told in the beginning of either war that it would last only as long as necessary and that it would be a short war . But here we are , nearly a decade after , with American troops still there . President Obama said in his speech from Chile that Libyan people deserved no more violence , yet he is authorizing the exercise of violence in Libya ? March 21 , 2011 at 2:36 pm | I guess finally a U.S. Administration realizes that a democratic Middle East better and safer for America and the whole world , than a Middle East run by dictatorships and monarchies , that oppress their people . A democratic Middle East better for the future everybody . You can not recruit and radicalize people if they are doing well economically . I hope that I will see this happening in my life time . There is an old saying : A rose by any other name , etc. . Similarly , regime change by any other name is still regime change . Like it or not , Gadhafi is the established leader of Libya as evidenced by his control of the military and the support he enjoys from all those Libyans that are not in the street protesting or rebelling . The US and its coalition are taking military action in another sovereign Mid East country on the pretext that they are protecting innocent civilians . I d like to point out that the people the coalition is protecting have commandeered tanks , artillery , anti-aircraft guns , thousands of automatic weapons , anti-tank weapons , explosives , and troop carriers , and are using those weapons to attack the established government . These are not the actions of civilians . The instant you pick up a weapon and take violent action against your government you are no longer a civilian ; you are an armed rebel and the government has every right to fight back . The Security Council s resolution authorizing a no-fly zone ultimately prevents the legitimate government of Libya from defending itself against violent , militarized rebel forces . Libyan forces can not advance against the rebels without coalition military forces attacking . No such restriction has been placed on the rebels . In essence , the coalition has taken sides by backing armed rebels and creating a situation where the established Libyan leadership can do nothing except sit and wait to be overrun . Throwing the military weight of the coalition nations behind the rebels while at the same time hamstringing the ability of the legitimate government to resist the rebellion , IS regime change . Since that is obviously the goal , at least have the courage to say it and let the people of the coalition nations involved hold their own governments accountable for the decision . March 21 , 2011 at 2:45 pm | As a libyan , i think that what the us is doing or is trying to do is very helpful at this moment . If i wasnt libyan i might say oh america is playing iraq2 again or there only there for the oil . But as a libyan seeing what happens to my country from day to day , seeing my family and friends die ever so simply , i say we need al the help we can get , for me at the moment i dont care about the oil or the supplies my country gives i care about the people in my country . I think now we sould forget all the statistics and think as humans , , , when people are being massacerd they do need help ... . In total i appreciate what the un is doing for us and its a favor we wont forget March 21 , 2011 at 2:47 pm | Against any involvement . Mideast will rule as they choose before & after our intervention . US has to focus on our needs ; cities & states are going broke . People here need jobs and food to feed their families . We ca n't continue to police the world . When are our leaders going to understand that . March 21 , 2011 at 2:48 pm | Okay now I 'm just venting . NO , I do n't think we should be there . I think we should stop being dependent on oil from the Middle East . March 21 , 2011 at 2:50 pm | According to CNN Benghazi residents are getting threatening phone calls naming family members as targets unless they support Gadhafi and company . Along with the tank attacks , this is a cease-fire breach . To bring an end to such activity , use a non-atomic super bomb to end Gadhafi 's killing fellow Arabs . The Saudi royal family was targeted the same way . The UN forces -LRB- It is a US bomb . -RRB- could set one off in the water near Tripoli so Gadhafi 's generals can see it . Tell them this is an option they now face . They must comply with the UN resolution or a pro-Gadhafi area will be next . They must show this by moving tanks , all military and all agents away from opposition areas . They could also arrest Colonel Gadhafi and sons for crimes against humanity . This approach minimalized deaths and stopped WW II being longer . March 21 , 2011 at 3:00 pm | Misrata is under attack by Pro-Gadhafi forces ? The U.S. is ramping DOWN operations ? We always seem to get involved then leave people hanging -LRB- KURDS in First Gulf War -RRB- et . Let 's Finish this with coalition help . Help and Security must be given to all in Libya , not just Benghazi ! March 21 , 2011 at 3:52 pm | i am sitting here sad and confused . Ido n't mind helping people any way we can and i know alot of americans feel the same way . when will the goverment top brass in the house and senate and even the white house oval office going to help the poor and hungry here in our the u.s. our goverment says we are broke when it comes to affairs in our own back yard but , always the first in line to send funds and supplies to other countrys who probably would n't be able to help us in times of need . do n't get me wrong i am truely sorry for what is going on in these 's other places but , charity begins at home . March 21 , 2011 at 4:15 pm | Just a quick word regarding Arwa Damon 's report on the damage sustained by Gadhaffi 's forces on the outskirts of Benghazi -- Arwa highlights the antiquated machinery of the Libyan War and singles out what she calls a `` World War Two Willys Jeep '' . The vehicle is in fact a Ford Mutt , which does look vaguely like an old Jeep but much bigger and more angular with horizontal slats in the front grille -- and which was produced right up until the 1980 's -- which is still kinda current technology when you consider that Blackhawk Helicopters , Hummvees and Abrams Tanks are all of the same vintage . A trifling detail in the grand scheme of things I know - but the article in which Arwa makes the error is on heavy rotation on CNN right now and I guess it weakens the accuracy of her entire reportage for me -- perhaps in large part because Arwa does really seem to make a point of highlighting this `` old '' machine to make a coloring point to her report . I support wat the U.N. is doin gadhafi needs to be out of power people are going to lose their lives either way but hopefully if we get involved not as many people will have to suffer that fate . March 21 , 2011 at 4:59 pm | The issue does not seem to be as complicated as is it has been made to seem . Every human has the right to live . The current action is just to stop a dictator from slaughtering his own people and let them decided what they want for their country . Gaddafi is only loved by his people as long as he holds the stick over their head . Allow the people the people the security and safety to freely chose their leader and the removal of Gaddafi becomes a mute point . It is also interesting how all the politicians are so upset about Obama taking action without allowing to endlessly debate and take polls while people were dying . Action was taken without their input , approval or even an explanation . They need to take stock of the anger , frustration and helplessness that they feel because now they know what it is like to be part of the shrinking middle class in this country . The democrats give to the ones at the bottom , the republicans give to the ones at the top and the middle class is left with the bill . So who is going to rescue us from them ? March 21 , 2011 at 5:17 pm | Yes , our involvement is correct . And for all the nay sayers claiming we are more involved than the president indicated we would be , I would suggest they rerun Defense Secretary Gates comments that it would be more involved than people think . Preventing fly overs requires destroying the ability of the enemy to fly and kill so we must destroy those abilities . March 21 , 2011 at 8:06 pm | I think , or at least I believe , that many , including members of Congress , forget what principles this country was founded on and what we are all about . Crying foul now because they were n't properly consulted before hand seems ludicrous at best . This situation has been brewing for some time and delaying action any longer would have led to the loss of countless lives in Benghazi . Congress had ample time to discuss the developing situation and choose a course for the American people . The fact that it came to the point where the President was forced , although reluctantly , to take action in order to save human lives is something he should not have had to deal with , but he did . I believe that the Obama Administration not only took the correct action but should be applauded for having the courage to do so . I am a former service member and it concerns me a great deal anytime our men and woman in the armed forces are put in harms way in any way , shape or form , but I am a realist . I am an American , often hated , or at least scorned , around the world by many , but still recognized as a global champion for human rights and the oppressed . It is our destiny , wanted or not . It is who we are and a great part of not only our history , but of our character . Our country was founded by those seeking the freedom of pursuing their own destiny , limited by only their dreams and level of commitment and we believe that is the right of all people We are Americans and we will always answer the call of those oppressed that ask for help and want to exercise their natural right to pursue a rewarding life and control their own destiny . We may be hated by many , misunderstood by most , but when all is said and done , the free world and anyone that has a dream of that freedom , sleep better at night and find the courage and strength to face each new day with continued hope , because we are who we are . Thank you for providing the medium for me to express my views and sincerest gratitude to all at CNN and other agencies that put themselves in danger to keep us informed . Be safe and continue to make a difference . March 21 , 2011 at 8:20 pm | My husband asked me to post this quote : No man is an Island , entire of itself ; every man is a piece of the Continent , a part of the main ; if a clod be washed away by the sea , Europe is the less , as well as if a promontory were , as well as if a manor of thy friends or of thine own were ; any man 's death diminishes me , because I am involved in Mankind ; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls ; It tolls for thee . March 21 , 2011 at 10:37 pm | Has anyone read `` The war powers act of 1973 '' ? If so , you must know that Obama is saying `` Oops '' . Like his own healthcare bill he forgot to read this , too . If taken up by Congress this could be an impeachable offense only if we are in Libya for more than 90 days . I think Obama forgot to consult Congress prior to his acting on this one . The President MUST consult Congress so that they can DEBATE it prior to sending our troops overseas -LRB- for more than 90 days -RRB- . I welcome your ideas and thoughts on this subject with facts only not with emotions . March 22 , 2011 at 7:34 am | Under the war powers act of 1973 George W. did have a right to go into Afganistan since we were acted on U.S. soil on 9\\/11 without consulting the Congress . It was later concluded that Iraq was a legal action as well . March 22 , 2011 at 7:43 am | First off , CNN 's coverage has been exceptional . I 'm thinking AC is responsible for keeping both Egypt and Libya a news story when no other mainstream outlet was covering it . His reaction to the unfolding events was visceral and powerful . Yes , it is true other genocides have occurred with no one noticing . That does n't mean we should n't stop this one . It means we should be noticing the others . Governments that kill and terrorize their own people hurt us all . I 'm already getting tired of all the political second guessing that is starting up . I pretty much put John Boehner and Dennis Kucinich on mute or realize it 's time to turn off the set . March 22 , 2011 at 8:09 am | Any chance that Russia and China might try to take us out for being the bully of the Middle East ? Since we owe China , this action against us MIGHT make us reconsider the amount of money we spend on defense instead of paying down our bills . March 22 , 2011 at 8:13 am | Whatever the case concerning charges that journalists at the Gadhafi compound are being used as human shields , it would be prudent for CNN management to take its journalists OUT of there ASAP . First , it 's UNSEEMLY for them to be seen in-situ commenting on US air strikes while government die-hards wave fragments of missiles . Second -LRB- and far more important -RRB- , it 's best they not be conveniently at hand when\\/should Gadhafi supporters feel they have nothing to lose by taking Western journalists down with them . Nic Robertson and his family deserve better treatment than this . March 22 , 2011 at 11:00 am | I question the honesty of the Administration regarding Libya . While Obama said there will be no American boots on the ground , I have a friend who is a mechanic on track vehicles who has orders for Libya . Why are Marines ordered to Libya if there is no intention of having ground troops ? March 22 , 2011 at 11:39 am | Now that we 're semi-officially involved and our alliance with the others are falling apart ... we need to clearly state our intentions : we will help the opposition forces to remove Gadhafi-dead\\/alive as well his sons , help the opposition forces get their acts together to form a united front with a credible leader so that once Gadhafi is out there is some sort of a new government so that the transition is smooth . Once we establish a credible opposition shadow government make sure that we and the European Infidels has no intentions of occupying Libya until the oil runs dry . Being wishy-washy like the Obama administration will make our Nato alliance a laughing stock similar to the United Nothing -LRB- United Nation -RRB- . If Prez O does n't know the next step , check with Billary Clinton for advice . We need a strong leader like Billary when he pulled out of Somalia when G.H. Bush was wishy-washy when our brave soldiers was captured and dragged through the streets of Mogidishu ! Also Billary tried not to get totally involved in the Balkan mess . March 22 , 2011 at 12:10 pm | last week all -LRB- Arab League , French , Libyan rebels , GOP etc. etc. -RRB- were calling for the President to move on Libya . Now the same voices are calling foul . GOP hopefuls especially are trying to get the most milage out of this . Though she never really said you could n't , maybe they can have their cake and eat it too . March 22 , 2011 at 12:13 pm | The world has been watching the developments in Libya for weeks and the fact that we are now just responding to all the slaughters is sickening . The U.S. stands for freedom and justice ; we must help those in need and not become another passive nation . March 22 , 2011 at 12:18 pm | I see no reason for confusion on the UN mission . The military commanders for the intervention are clear on their mission , which does not include regime change . President Obama does not say that it does , but he does say that regime change is in Libya is a priority of his administration . See how that works ? US policy is not dictated by the UN , and the US does not dictate the policies of the UN . March 22 , 2011 at 1:09 pm | We should n't even be there , it 's the UN 's problem . Let them step up to the plate before we start policing the world . Same goes for Afghanistan and other neighboring Arab countries . March 22 , 2011 at 1:13 pm | I have been following the story closely since the `` rebels '' first started to protest in Benghazzi . They were shot at and the army defected . If we did not intervene may of thousands would have been slaughtered , perhaps 100 's of thousands . We did the right thing . It makes me prouder to be American . March 22 , 2011 at 1:16 pm | I support our effort in Libya , the end game should be the removal of the current regime . We as Americans have a moral obligaation to people living in fear of their lives everyday . I believe also that the Congress should back the decision to rescue the Libyan people , with no reservations and hinesite quarterbacking . March 22 , 2011 at 1:25 pm | US has no business invading Lybia or any other country . In his own words : The President does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation , Barack Obama , the constitutional scholar gave us assurance these were NOT within the powers of the presidency . Barack Obama the president seems to have changed his mind . If we want to take our financial situation seriously , we need to at least account for the overextended military empire we continuously expand . The best immediate solution would be to bring all of the troops home . From Lybia , Iraq , Afghanistan , Korea , Germany , and the other 190 or so countries we occupy . Only when we stop spending endless trillions of dollars on our military imperialism can we start on the path to getting our financial house in order . Throughout history , all empires have fallen by overreaching militarily and overprinting the money . Let us hope the US learns from this example , and does not go the way of past empires . March 22 , 2011 at 1:39 pm | I think it 's great , America should be fighting for freedom . If Ronald Reagan had taken care of this before we would n't have to do it again . March 22 , 2011 at 2:13 pm | What gives this country the right to attack Libya ? In what I think is a internal affair . Was n't going into Irag without a good reason enough . March 22 , 2011 at 2:15 pm | Before the President acted on Qadaffi most everyone was calling him too slow to act . Now that he has acted many opportunist are up in arm against him . As American we must be consistant in standing up for what is right . We sometimes worry too much about the cosequenses and fail to finish the job . That is when the consequences turn out negative . Although late , but President Obama acted properly and I am with him all the way till Qadaffi is out . After all he is a monster who destroyed a passenger airliner killing many innocent people and litterally got away with it . It is time to make him pay for his crimes against humanity . A job that the paper-tiger UN should do . March 22 , 2011 at 2:15 pm | We should have intervened sooner . The fact that Obama waited as long as he did signifies to me that he wavered in his decision making . It makes me , as a veteran of the armed forces , question his ability to lead our military . The people of Libya cried out for our help and we had ample time to bring it before our politicians . Pres. Obama would have been able to consult with those military leaders to develop a plan that identified specific details . March 22 , 2011 at 2:17 pm | Are you kidding me ? when Ronald Regan bombed Libya he was considered a hero and rightfully so , let 's ALL act like American 's for a change and support our president . March 22 , 2011 at 2:17 pm | In considering this matter of intervention in Libya , which is in fact beyond what might be done in an ideal situation , there may be a feeling that we have to maintain involvement in order to protect ourselves and our allies in that part of the world , including Israel\\/Palestine . If some group overpowers Gadhafi , we can t be standing at a distance , watching , we have to be right there in the thick of it . It would be wonderful if we could follow legal and what would seem to be moral values , and allow some victor , whoever it might be to control Libya , and the Mediterranean region , and of course the oil . At this point is looks as though Gadhafi is incapable of continuing to rule . He has an army of enemies seeking to overthrow him . His speech is incoherent ; when he punishes people under his authority , he is irrational , saying they are using hallucinogenic drugs , or are spreading aids , and moral turpitude . His officers do the most unthinkable things that are ever done in the torture of prisoners . If as I liberal I find myself surprised by American President Obama s actions , it is because I don t see the entire picture . We have to protect our allies , our interests , and it is good that we can support democracy in Libya . When the smoke clears , we will be there in the forefront to do just that . March 22 , 2011 at 2:19 pm | As an Azerbaijani - American muslim , I fully support Libya no no fly zone . It has already saved hundreds of lives in BeGhazi , I hope other cities like Misurata , Abdjadiya can be freed as well . I do not understand those who oppose our involvement . Is it better to stay back and watch innocent Libyans butchered ? I hope we can help the opposition to get Ghaddafi out of Libya , otherwise it is going to be an unfinished job . Long live freedom and democracy . March 22 , 2011 at 2:20 pm | I believe the US should be there . The Leader of Libya should be in Prison or hung . That is what we do with killers in this country . The elected officials should support the troops and this engagement . I believe the UN Over rides everything . March 22 , 2011 at 2:20 pm | I am glad we are helping the Libyan people . The U.S. does stand for freedom and we must help to keep the people from being slaughtered . Some congress members are upset because they could n't vote on it . But I 'm afraid if we had waited for them to vote more slathers would 've have occured . March 22 , 2011 at 2:23 pm | Anyone can second guess . . Let 's applaud the fact that American is helping as PART of an international coalition . It would behoove members of Congress , many of whom have not served in the armed forces and have no experience in running even a modest operation , to simply support the President 's decision or shut up . After all , this is the Congress who ca n't even find a reasonable solution to our budget challenges . Why would anyone , including the American public , consult Congress on any serious topic . Only history will tell whether the President 's decision was a good one . But at least it was thoughtful and considered . especially given the circumstances . March 22 , 2011 at 2:27 pm | Wow you folks have a lot of emails to sift thru . I 'll make mine brief . I worked in Libya for 5 years and made some friends there that I often think about these days . When talking about the costs incurred by the U.S. and its allies , all I think about is the colonels frozen U.S. , and I 'm sure there is more elsewhere , assets . Why ca n't these be funneled into the price of saving his people ? After all , its money that should have been used , or given to them in the first place , right ? The same goes for the money he is sitting on in Libya !!! I 'm sure the people would n't mind because with him in power they would never see it anyways !!! Hell I 'd let Obama cut himself a cheque right now if it meant saving the lives of my family !! It 's not a perfect world . I think President Obama is doing the best he can for the people of Libya . We wanted the world community to get together to save the people of Gadhafi from massacring his own people . This took time which is unfortunate . The reason we are not attacking other governments such as Bahrain is that we have some influence there and are trying to help the situation diplomatically . I see no inconsistency in U.S. policy . Whatever happens in those countries we can say that we did our best . We prefer peace and diplomacy but will stand up for right . We seek to be apart of this earth and not to dominate it . Let 's get behind our President and pray that he leads us with wisdom and humility . March 22 , 2011 at 2:30 pm | Its a crying shame , such a dissapointement that again , WE -LRB- US -RRB- , appoint ourself as the `` world police '' . Dissapointed indeed that our president on top of ignoring and abandoning most if not all of his campaing promises , gets us in another war . Yes , ANOTHER WAR !! Dropping bombs on foreign soil is an act of war no matter how one chooses to sugar coat it ! More appalling to many , is the apathy of the americans in general . Gone the era of activism when we utilized freedom of speech and assembly to demonstrate our dissapointment and discontent with our government motives and actions . President Obama is gradually becoming another `` Bush '' clone , another corporation muppet . When our government will understand that ONLY the middle east can and should help and support itself . Shame on me , mostly , for just posting a few words , , , , March 22 , 2011 at 2:35 pm | Well I uess I must have it wrong . I thought that Nato said they could use any means available to them to stop Gadhafi from kill his own people . So why is that some people are having a problem with the way they are taking out his tanks , troops and anything else he has to use to kill the Libyian people just because he do n't want to give up power over them . Get it straight either people want democracy or you do n't ca n't have it both ways . So leave the coalition alone and let them do the right thing for a change and not go just for oil . I sure do n't agree with going anywhere and fight for the wrong reason , but this is for the right reason . March 23 , 2011 at 7:41 pm | It is my opinion that the leader in the case of Libya is not the US but a combination of France and The UK . The US as a member helped out by firing missiles into that country . To get Kadhaffi out of Libya is a matter for the UN to decide and NOT the US . We have too many other problems to deal with rather than at this time to focus on Libya . March 23 , 2011 at 8:26 pm | We can not sit back and watch slaughter being committed . There is no time to wait for NATO or The Arab League to make up their mind to make a commitment . The Europeans have difficulty reaching a decision after the EU was formed -- it 's like waiting for Congress to reach a decision -LRB- eternity -RRB- . The members of the Arab League are inundated in problems of their own and we ca n't expect much support from that front . We will have to solve this , as we go along , with no clear cut theories other than our humanitarian concern and trust in our abilities . We should be proud of such an ability . How many of these `` rebels ' are returning fighters whom entered via Syria to fight US forces in Iraq ? Is the muslim brotherhood involved in this conflict ? The tribal system of Libya should be explained in far more detail ? Hidden agenda among returning fighters whom fought in Iraq to return home and radicalize their home countries upon return ? March 24 , 2011 at 9:54 am | Obama has handled the Libyan situation very well , accomplishing the most critical goal , preventing the imminent slaughter of civilian opposition as promised by MG . The quick switch of positions -LRB- from pro- intervention to con -RRB- by the GOP simply reflects the fact that the GOP are more focused upon the political advantage they can gain from this than on the long-term interests of the USA . March 24 , 2011 at 11:43 am | It is interesting to speculate re : what the news opinions would have been if the USA and other countries had not urgently intervened - the video showing bodies of slaughtered civilians would dominate our conversations and Obama would be condemned for being heartless and ineffectual and timid . As for having the decision made in Congress - you have to be kidding ! Congress is just the Super Bowl of politics , from which an occasional legislative decision may escape . March 24 , 2011 at 11:52 am | Yes we should be involving ourselves with the Libyan peoples struggle for freedom . What if we had n't gotten involved during either World War ? Alot of people would n't be here and those that were would be speaking German , Italian or Japanese . The right thing to do is the right thing to do . He kills his own people and thinks he can get away with it . Those people that say we should n't be involved need to read their history before they open their mouths . Appeasement and isolationism only further the problem . The US tried that early in the last century , did n't work so well , and cost many more lives than it would have if we had been helping the world instead of hiding behind the oceans and had a stronger military . Neville Chamberlain and the League of Nations tried appeasement with Hitler , then when he was too strong for them to stop they said `` No ! You ca n't do that ! '' He did it anyway and five years later we were klucky enough that he offed himself . We were n't prepared then as we are now . Oh and another difference of course is people back in the early twentieth century were apparently a whole helluvalot more patriotic than they are today . I 'm trying to re-enlist in the service because it 's the right thing to do , how many people today would have to be drafted before they 'd put on a uniform ? March 24 , 2011 at 2:29 pm | Yes let 's bring the troops back from everywhere we 're involved that 's not in America and show the world how truly idiotic we are . Yes , we spend money on the military , the alternative would be somebody stronger than us invading and then how 'd you like your idiotic opinions that are not based off of any factual basis or historical knowledge of events ? Oh , that 's right , you would n't be able to speak your mind on these websites . Stop moaning about how much we spend on the military and be glad they do n't draft all of you arm chair politicos into the Army and send you over to a war as cannon fodder . Be glad you have poor dumb shmucks like us who volunteer to do what you obviously are unwilling to . Give us the materials to do the job and be happy it is n't you . If you 'd take a look at history , oh let me just use an example : the first day of the Battle of the Sommes in 1916 the British Army lost fiffty eight thousand men killed and thousands more wounded because they were n't prepared for the fight and the civilian factory workers in munitions plants were to busy worrying about their little worlds being screwed up . Guess what , casualties suck , but war happens , people die , and be glad we have n't fought a World War in over sixty years . Cuz if we did nowadays the casualties would be measured in billions , not millions . Be glad we take part in world affairs , be glad we have those cruise missiles . Honestly I 'd much rather waste millions of dollars on sending a missile in rather than sending my infantry buddies in to get killed .

Times journalists arrive in Tunisia after being freed in Libya Stephen Farrell , from left , Tyler Hicks , Ambassador Levent Sahin Kaya , Lynsey Addario , and Anthony Shadid pose on Monday . Four New York Times journalists who were reported captured by pro-government forces in Libya last week have been released and have arrived safely in Tunisia , Executive Editor Bill Keller said Monday in an e-mail obtained by CNN . `` We 're particularly indebted to the Government of Turkey , which intervened on our behalf to oversee the release of our journalists and bring them to Tunisia , '' Keller said in the e-mail , which was sent to New York Times staff . `` We were also assisted throughout the week by diplomats from the United States and United Kingdom . '' Earlier Monday , Turkish Ambassador to Libya Levent Sahin Kaya said the four journalists had arrived at the Turkish Embassy in Tripoli . The newspaper identified the journalists as Anthony Shadid , its bureau chief in Beirut , Lebanon , and a two-time Pulitzer winner for foreign reporting ; Stephen Farrell , a reporter and videographer who was kidnapped by the Taliban and rescued by British commandos in 2009 ; Tyler Hicks , a staffer who is based in Istanbul and has served as an embedded journalist in Afghanistan ; and photographer Lynsey Addario , who has covered the Middle East and Africa . In a statement Monday , the newspaper said : `` We are grateful that our journalists have been released , and we are working to reunite them with their families . We have been told they are in good health and are in the process of confirming that . We thank the Turkish , British , and U.S. governments for their assistance in the release . We also appreciate the efforts of those in the Libyan government who helped secure the release this morning . '' The four journalists entered the rebel-controlled eastern region of Libya via the Egyptian border without visas to cover the civil war in the country , the Times said . They had been missing since Tuesday , according to the Times , but Keller said in his e-mail that the four `` were allowed to speak to their families by phone Thursday night '' and that the government had informed the newpaper Thursday afternoon that they would be freed . `` Because of the volatile situation in Libya , we 've kept our enthusiasm and comments in check until they were out of the country , '' Keller wrote , `` but now feels like a moment for celebration . And before long we 'll all know the details of their experience .

He says most observers feel that what Obama wants is still the big question mark in D.C. Editor 's note : David Gergen is a senior political analyst for CNN and has been an adviser to four U.S. presidents . He is a professor of public service and director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School . Cambridge , Massachusetts -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After conversations with top players in Washington last week , mostly as I accompanied a group of Zuckerman Fellows from Harvard on a field trip , here are some brief reflections on the mood there toward events in the Middle East : The head-snapping change in policy toward Libya has everyone guessing where the Mideast is heading , whether the U.S. has a good handle , and most of all , what President Obama is trying to achieve . One irony , as a female friend put it , is that for years many of us believed that if only more women could gain power , the world would surely become more peaceful . Yet , we now see that the three people who talked Obama into using force against Libya 's Moammar Gadhafi were all women -- Hillary Clinton , Susan Rice and Samantha Power . Leading male advisers were opposed . Perhaps we should be less surprised than we are . And remember , too , that both were seen as successful leaders for most of their time in office . There are divisions in Washington about the president 's actions , but most -- including me -- believe Hillary & Co. had the better argument . If anything , the U.S. delayed too long , allowing Gadhafi to gain the upper hand on the ground . The head-snapping change in policy toward Libya has everyone guessing ... what President Obama is trying to achieve . Clinton 's voice key on Libyan policy Obama : No ground troops in Libya But what is the president 's endgame in Libya ? And what is his strategy for the Middle East more generally ? Who can say for sure ? Originally , the president kept saying we want Gadhafi out -- but now that we are using force , he says we only want to stop him from killing more civilians . Is this mission creep in reverse ? And how tough would we be if , as seemed possible today , the Arab League begins to retreat from supporting force ? Meanwhile , the administration privately -- and rightly -- stresses that even as we hit Libya , we must keep a strategic focus on Egypt and Saudi Arabia , long seen as our most powerful Arab friends in the region . The preliminary returns from weekend voting in Egypt -- we are still waiting to hear from Cairo -- will bring some heartburn in Washington . How big a threat will the Muslim Brotherhood now become in elections a few months from now and what can Washington do about it ? Even bigger headaches are arising in the U.S.-Saudi relationship . Several top players from past administrations report that the Saudis are hugely angry about Obama 's treatment of Egypt 's ex-President Hosni Mubarak . `` He was your best friend in the region for more than 30 years , doing everything you asked , '' the Saudi argument goes , `` but a week after he got into trouble , you threw him under the bus rather than working out a graceful exit . How can we now trust you ? '' The Obama administration is now working to rebuild Saudi ties , but will it have sufficient leverage to help usher in more democratic reforms in the kingdom and , crucially at the moment , in nearby Bahrain and Yemen ? Or , as seems likely , will we be caught in increasing contradictions between our policy in Libya -LRB- crack down on an enemy government that kills demonstrators -RRB- vs. Bahrain and Yemen -LRB- go easy on a friendly government that kills demonstrators -RRB- ? The big question mark is the president himself . Rebounding from his electoral defeats last November , he seemed to be asserting a much firmer grasp on power , but in recent weeks , he appears to outsiders as someone who has slipped back into a haze of caution . The Economist this week is even questioning his political courage . As he sends U.S. troops into harm 's way , many in Washington are now waiting to see which Obama now emerges . Much rides on the outcome . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Gergen . "}, {"uid": "34", "dct": "2011-03-21", "dates": [null, null], "text": "The U.S. military has led the initial allied air attacks against Moammar Gadhafi 's forces in Libya , which began this weekend . Something about it reminds me of the way the war in Iraq started eight years ago . The U.S.S. Barry launches a Tomahawk missile . But President Barack Obama insisted at a news conference this afternoon that the U.S. will soon step aside and that the mission will then be controlled by NATO forces and other allies . It was the first time the president has answered questions on the topic of Libya since allied airstrikes began Saturday . Republicans have sharply criticized Obama and his administration for the way they 've communicated about the U.S. military mission in Libya . House Speaker John Boehner says he supports helping the people of Libya , but he also says : `` Before any further military commitments are made , the administration must do a better job of communicating to the American people and to Congress about our mission in Libya and how it will be achieved . '' Sen. Richard Lugar , the ranking Republican member of the Foreign Relations Committee , echoed Boehner 's concerns , telling CNN 's John King he does n't understand the mission either and believes there are no guidelines set for success . It 's not a partisan issue so far . A group of liberal House Democrats held a conference call Saturday because they 're pretty upset that Congress was n't formally consulted before the U.S. and allies attacked Gadhafi 's forces . They are concerned that involvement in the airstrikes could lead to a third war in the Middle East in which the U.S. is involved . U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D-Ohio , even raised the prospect of impeachment over the president 's actions . Here s my question to you : What is your understanding of America 's role in the Libya offensive ? Interested to know which ones made it on air ? The mission is to give aid and stop the `` genocide '' of people who want to remove a dictator of 42 years who uses military force to stay in power . The world ca n't sit by and watch one more war of attacks on innocent women and children . Obama is so slowwwwwwww . If Obama acted two weeks ago , Gadhafi would have been circled by his people and probably been taken out by his people . The result now is where we were with Saddam in Iraq . No fly zone for the next five years , while Gadhafi will be killing his own people . I just kind of figured it must have been some kind of a `` wage two wars , get a third war free '' promotion . We get to spend the most money by using our expensive munitions to blast the command and control structure to hell , and the remaining countries get to practice their flying skills when it s safe to do so . In other words , we bear the brunt of the expense , but no boots on the ground , so the President can say we are n't at war . Government by public relations campaign . My understanding is that we will take control of Libya 's oil production to help bring down the price of gas in the U.S. . After that , we 're building a `` Disney : Middle East '' theme park on top of Gadhafi 's main compound . We are there to clear the skies for England and France . Once the air defenses are obliterated , we are in support . Change the name of the country Libya to Iraq . Change the year 2011 to 1992 . Change the name Obama to Bush . The bottle might look different but the wine is still the same . President Hillary Clinton has stated our position . She is doing a great job while her subordinates travel and play golf . I think we need to quickly get all military out of all cities ... except Tripoli . Put the fear of death into all military that if they are seen in a military vehcile outside of Tripoli , then they are a target . they isolate Ghadaffi , bring freedom to all the other cities . Then , the UN moves in to setup elections . Tripoli becomes a deserted stand alone entity with no oil revenues and no other option except to get rid of Ghadaffi . March 21 , 2011 at 1:32 pm | Not under the pretext he gave , of `` drumming up business for America '' . Take the recent example from Mexico ... the end result ... Mexican truckers can now haul to every part of the US ... ... precisely what the drug cartels wanted ! Our benefit ... . . more of our citizens exposed to illegal drugs , on a daily basis . March 21 , 2011 at 1:33 pm | It looks like Obama and Clinton are doing a fine job in polishing the U.S. image in the international community . We must n't be seen as Islamo-phobe crusaders , and at the same time we must support the creation of democracy where it has never been . March 21 , 2011 at 1:36 pm | The role of the US , should have been to support the international effort ... . instead we have now been directly involved in acts of war , in spite of the intent to keep international fighters protected from anti-aircraft fire . We do n't need another major mid east war . March 21 , 2011 at 1:36 pm | Jack : The role or goal of the United States in Libya is : 1 . To be apart of a coalition that protects the Libyans ; 2 . To stop the Libyan Regime from killing its own people ; 3 . To make sure no US Military Personnel are not on the ground ; 4 . To obey the UN Resolution when dealing with the Libyan Regime . I left off the name of the leader of libya , because it is hands off by the coalition of nations . To Bad !! March 21 , 2011 at 1:39 pm | That we are taking out their military might . Then stepping back and letting others take over . Which is what I hope we do . Although the media is down playing the US military role `` We are the lead nation '' , directing everything from intelligence , to military targets and planes doing the bombing . Some in the media would have you believe that France or Britian are leading this movement . That 's not true , the US spent over 1 million dollars this weekend to carry out this bombing mission . Marlene in Michigan March 21 , 2011 at 1:46 pm | I am an active support of President Obama but his action in the Libyan theater is wrong . The united States always seem to pray on weaker nations with oil under pretexts . President Obama , like former President Bush is killing Arab . President Obama is killing Libyan and destroying their country in the name of human right when we all know it is to militarily overthrow the Libyan government . I do not like Gadhafi because he was instrumental in destroying Liberia and killing over 250 Liberian but going after him with superior military might is wrong . The U.S. could easily assassinate him instead . If president Obama is serious about stopping foreign leaders from massacring their own people , why his administration is not in the Ivory Coast , Bahrain , and Yemen ? Why the United States is not enforcing the countless United Nations Resolutions against Israel for it long atrocities against the Palestinians ? As an independent voter Obama lost my vote for any attempts on his part for the presidency in 2012 . March 21 , 2011 at 1:49 pm | The way I understand it , we will be turning over the reins to NATO and taking a back seat in enforcing the no fly zone . I think that is a good idea . We are already involved in two wars and a national debt that threatens our way of life . We can not leave ourselves be sucked into another war . There 's only so much a country can do and we have reached our limit . March 21 , 2011 at 1:50 pm | America has the most sophisticated detection , monitoring , and jamming equipment in the world . We will contribute that role and those services to the prevention of a Libyan massacre . March 21 , 2011 at 1:50 pm | Most of our enemies have been our former friends . We claim to be big on human rights and freedom , and we step-in to help others -LRB- or over-throw a government -RRB- but only when such actions do not significantly hurt our oil supplies . If we treated all opressive governemtns the same , we would have attacked Iran , Saudi Arabia ... the list will seem never ending ... but we do n't . Either our policies are short-sighted , or we are just greedy for oil . It seems like long as we can keep supplying the oil to our so called freedom loving citizens who have no morals and do n't care for human life in a distant land just as long as there is oil for them to waste -LRB- yes , waste , that is what we do in the US -RRB- . March 21 , 2011 at 1:53 pm | I have n't got a clue Jack and I seriously doubt anybody in Washington does either . On the other hand , it does provide our military with a great opportunity to try out some of our sophisticated weaponry . As we ponder whether oil or civilian safety is the real motivation , it is a good time to remember the Lincoln Brigade and the gallant Americans who got personally involved in the Spanish Civil War . March 21 , 2011 at 2:01 pm | My understanding of our role in Libya is that we have confirmed that we are not a country that follows the rule of law , particularly our own . That we will protect the special interests in securing our sources of oil , and that `` doin ' Right ai n't got no end '' . Funny how we now follow the Captain Red Legs Rule of Law under Bush\\/Obama , ai n't it ? March 21 , 2011 at 2:04 pm | My understanding is that the President declared `` Gaddafi must go '' far too quickly , then had to wait far too long for the international support he needed . I hope it 's not too late for the rebels ' sake . The upside is huge ; the downside is unthinkable . March 21 , 2011 at 2:05 pm | Absolutely . The Use is there to provide its unique capabilities in support of uN Resolution 1973 -- to protect Libyan civilians from being massacred by their own govt . The USA is helping enforce international Law , after it was asked by the UN , the Arab League and the people of Libya . This is multilateralism at its best , as promised by Candidate Obama -- now carried out by President Obama . Anyone who does not understand this has no business wasting public airwaves . March 21 , 2011 at 2:12 pm | We provide the tomahawks , carriers , logisticsand funding . We take all the blame in the eyes of the arab world . Europe get 's all the ultimate benefit . Does that sound about right to you Jack ? Have you ever noticed how the Arab League or OPEC never want 's to take care of these guys ? March 21 , 2011 at 2:19 pm | No I do n't and furthermore I think the President has been persuaded to do something his instincts told him not to . The problem with any decision politicans make is they are all tainted with the question : What does this mean for my re-elction ? I know it 's human nature to think in self promoting terms but I 'd like to see a few decisons made based on what is the right thing to do without the cloud of `` holding on to an office '' swaying the decison . March 21 , 2011 at 2:23 pm | Ken from PInon Hills , California Because there is oil under the ground in Libya . Oil makes thousands of products besides gasoline , plastics for instance . Our demand for oil is insatiable . President Carter warned us we would eventually have an energy crisis if we did n't conserve , drive slower , and make more efficient automobiles . The next President , Ronald Reagan , a friend of big business , said ridiculous , and went so for as to having the solar panels Carter had installed on the roof of White House torn down . March 21 , 2011 at 2:23 pm | Hey Jack , , your a reasonable man , , tell Wolf that the tribe in Bengazi do n't like the tribe in Tripoli , , never have and after watching regime change in egypt decided this was a good time to get rid of Kadafy Think of the countries involved with the Kadafy must go line , , Britian , France , Italy U.S. Canada , , All countries with week leaders seeking a stronger mandate from their people -LRB- hopefully -RRB- and are breaking Jimmy Carters rule No state sponsered terrorism . When you back one tribe against another , bomb Kadafy 's compound and send out the general who sayes we are not allowed to do that and I wo n't comment further on it , , with a big smile on his face . . sayes that it 's true Thats why Kadafy said to the reporter `` you do n't understand this country or this war '' because it 's true . Obama said he 's gotta go well when he goes you can take Cameron . Sarkozey , and the rest with him because they are all liars as well keep up the good work Jack March 21 , 2011 at 2:29 pm | What is your understanding of America 's role in the Libya offensive ? That in recognition that America is her brother 's keeper she is uniting with other nations who think as herself to defend them and not going alone . March 21 , 2011 at 2:34 pm | We get to spend the most money by using our expensive munitions to blast the command and control structure to hell , and the remaining countries get to practice their flying skills when its safe to do so . In other words , we bear the brunt of the expense , but no boots on the ground , so the President can say we are n't at war . Government by public relations campaign . March 21 , 2011 at 2:35 pm | Obama is so slowwwwwwww . If Obama acted 2 weeks ago Gadaffi would have been circled by his people and probably been taken out by his people . The result now is where we were with Sadam in Iraq . No fly zone for the next 5 years , while Gadafi will be killing his own people . Basically we have another Iraq turning back 10 years ago . It shows that Obama is a rookie . I think Hillarry would have done a better job as President in this case . Vote for Hillarry or Romney in 2012 . March 21 , 2011 at 2:39 pm | Our role is to not think we own the world and need to intervene to solve all the problems every nation has . We are not , nor should we be , the worlds ' police force . If the UN , in cooperation with Arab nations in the region , wants to do something , we should be just a small part of that . We should not run the show and coerce anyone to do things our way . It is n't our country or even our continent . If we had a civil war would we want other nations to establish a no-fly zone and send in ground troops to seize the capitol ? I might agree to let Canada and Mexico send in troops , but only if they brought beer , chips and salsa . March 21 , 2011 at 2:40 pm | My understanding of our Libyan offensive is that Obama feels it 's more important to fight for freedom in Libya than it is in Wisconsin , Ohio , and Michigan . He 'd rather emobroil the United States in a tribal war in North Africa than face the fact that the real war is at home against Corporatism . March 21 , 2011 at 2:44 pm | Simple -- dictate to yet another country how they should govern , force our will upon them and spend billions to destroy a third country while ignoring business at home . March 21 , 2011 at 2:50 pm | Apparently we 're preventing Qaddafi 's forces from taking Benghazi and from killing civilians in general . No regime change or nation-building . Although if a missile takes out Qaddafi himself I do n't think anybody will be too upset - his own son is licking his chops waiting to take control . March 21 , 2011 at 2:51 pm | We need to be part of a joint effort to give a dictator oppressed country a chance to chart their own course & gain some respect by not being in the lead . I do wonder why the media does n't mention the abstentions in the security council from Russia & China . we are the policeman of the world broke but china has a lot of money March 21 , 2011 at 2:56 pm | Our role in libya is to prevent ghadafi from defending his country against armed rebels who have decided to overthrow the libyian government by force . The u.s. and coalition planes can kill pro-ghadafi civilians but not anti-ghadafi armed rebels who call themselves civilians . This weekend u.s. antiwar protesters were arrested in DC for protesting against obama invading and bombing 4 countries : iraq , afghanistan , pakistan , and libya . Russia and China need to establish a no fly zone over the u.s. to protect anti-war protesters from being harassed and arrested throughout this so called democracy . If you protest in the u.s. you will be beaten with clubs , sprayed with military tear gas classified as a chemical weapon , kicked in the groin , and arrested by the police . Civil rights and anti war protesters in the 1960 's were shot and killed by police and the national guard in this country . Protesters in this country need a u.n. resolution . March 21 , 2011 at 3:05 pm | Even though this action was initiated by the French and British and approved by the U.N. Security Council our enemies will label this as a U.S. attempt to obtain Libya 's oil . If the `` No-Fly '' mission is successful and the U.S. withdraws within a week the British and the French will take the heat . World opinion has already written off Gadhafi . If the rebels do n't promptly suceed in removing the Gadhafi administration who will support the rebels in weapons and materials until they do ? Who is providing weapons and ammunition now ? More questions than answers . Dee in New Paris Ohio At this point my understanding is what `` they '' tell us . That we are not going to be sending ground troops . That we are only going to be actively involved for just a short time . But what I really think is , if the rebels are successful in overthrowing Gadhafi , and if they establish a new government that is at all favorable toward the U.S. , and if they , in return for military help to maintain the new government , offer us a sweet oil deal , well DUH ! We will be there FOREVER , just as we are seemingly in for the long haul in so many other countries ! In other words , at this point I take whatever `` they '' tell us with a grain of SAND , with a little oil dressing on the side ! March 21 , 2011 at 3:17 pm | Allow the capitalists to line the entire Mediterranean with yachts and mansions . I will be moving to European side of the Mediterranean in a few more years and the fewer missiles the better , and I imagine that a large number of Arabs have plans to return to the Middle East eventually . However , I think we are going overboard with our `` Full Scale War '' against a country that has a Military that is equivalent to our Boy Scouts , but when you attack a country like this , you know before you start that you are going to win . March 21 , 2011 at 3:18 pm | As I see it , our objective is twofold : Make more money for the oil cartels and defense contractors , and help the President kiss Republican butt . Neither bodes well for the American people . It looks like we are sticking our noses into another Middle East problem . Maybe if President Obama was in the White House Press Room explaining it to the American people , we would have a better understanding as to why we are there at all . March 21 , 2011 at 3:27 pm | Hard to ever have perfect understanding of what 's going on in today 's world ... unless you are Fareed Zakaria !!! And I am convinced that our President is very well aware of how different things are and is doing whatever he can to ensure we will continue to be its leader by earning respect ... not demanding it !! My understanding of the U.S role in the Libya civil war is to provide protection for Libya 's civilians and to provide cover for the opposition forces from air attacks from the Libyan government forces , and while it is not our primary goal , to ultimately facilitate the regime change that the world has long awaited . March 21 , 2011 at 3:31 pm | My understanding is that the U.S must do all that it can to preserve the oil supply to the U.S from the middle east to ensure the continued economic recovery of our oil dependent economy . March 21 , 2011 at 3:33 pm | Joe Ft Walton Bch Fl The offensive in Libya in the beginning was to help the rebels get the upper hands in their fight against Gaddafi , now the situation is different . The rebels are not even closer than they were a week ago to win the fight , Gaddafi forces are advancing into Benghazi and the rebels will probably lose their ground defenses . Now the goal for the NATO forces is to take down Gaddafi and his sons , and the only way to do it is to send ground troops into Libya and finish the job . March 21 , 2011 at 3:38 pm | Our role is to stop and ensure that agression is stoped . This is almost a first if not the first time we the U.S. are not pulling all the strings and footing the full bill on an action that sadly is needed . Maybe people can lay off the French for a while after all they helped us in our fight for independance . March 21 , 2011 at 3:40 pm | The United Nations and the coalition forces meaning France , United Kingdom , and the United States recognize a crazy mad man when they see and here one . And besides Gadhafi has been playing France the U.K. and the U.S. they have a bone to pick with him . We are there as part of a larger coalition of UN forces to provide support . The question is `` Why ? '' . What 's at stake for us . Obama is allowing his foreign policy to be dictated by the UN and other outside influences . His view is the US is an equal partner in global politics and believes in looking out for the collective good for the world . What he does n't seem to grasp is the American people expect him to look out for what is in the best interest of America . And most of the world feels they would be better if if the US was weak or hamstrung . Libya shows a total lack of leadership and direction in our foreign policy . It 's the only way to explain the lack of action on Iran or Egypt but military assistance for Libya . March 21 , 2011 at 3:45 pm | U have to support your alliesotherwise they wo n't support you . Who is supporting Ghadafi , the scum that support the terrorist that blew up a U S PAN AM PLANE IN THE 80 'S and PROBABLY SUPPORTED THE lie ABOUT THE bomber dying which caused the courts to release him to a cheering bloody crowd of supporters ! March 21 , 2011 at 3:50 pm | My understanding is that the U.S. and others are protecting the revolutionary Libyans , by providing no fly zones over Libya . However , I think the ultimate objective is to boot out Gadhafi , maintain optimum flow of oil , and impose our tenet over them whether they like it or not . March 21 , 2011 at 3:51 pm | Our role is to provide air and ground support to the rebels trying to overthrow this madman . The words `` take out his command and control '' is another way of saying `` we are after you Gaddafi '' . As long as the allies control the skies , the rebels have a fighting chance . March 21 , 2011 at 4:05 pm | Change the name of the country Libya to Irag . Change the year 2011 to 1992 . Change the name Obama to Bush . The bottle might look different but the wine is still the same . Now what will anyone do in 2022 if Qadhafi is still in power and still murdering his people . March 21 , 2011 at 4:05 pm | Tampa , Fl Easy one Jack , just look in your encyclopedia under Vietnam , N. Korea , Iraq -LRB- does n't matter which -RRB- and you will have your answer . We go in , against the will of the American Taxpayer , offering just advise , along with a enough firepower to level the place , Then we `` stay '' , rebuild , spend billions of dollars , and never leave . Oh , and we borrow all the money that our politicians spend on the whole thing . March 21 , 2011 at 4:12 pm | I see our role as the same as when Iraq invaded Kuwait . We are the head of an International posse-including some Arab states-who are going in to prevent inhumane acts . It is a role we have taken in the past , and , as the sole super power , one we must not shirk now . March 21 , 2011 at 4:14 pm | No. . I am a mushroom . I am kept in the dark & fed you know what . I think they are hoping to show a force in Libya hoping to knock him off but also to show the rest of the Arab world not to start at uprising cause this could happen to you . And Momar is like a rat they always scurry and hide when the heat comes on . March 21 , 2011 at 4:15 pm | The mission is to give aid and stop the `` genocide '' of people who want to remove a dictator of 42 years and uses military force to stay in power . The world ca n't sit by and watch one more war of attacks on innocent women and children . Bad enough they are taking away women 's rights here if we let em . No more tyrants OPPRESSING families and citizens . March 21 , 2011 at 4:17 pm | the reason for us to be involved in action in libya is to protect the people from a slaughter by a mad man . the press or media seem to be a shield for the mad man . Why Jack ??? March 21 , 2011 at 4:19 pm | My understanding of this mess is that we are headed for a third war ! Our military will never get to come home ! Why was congress NOT consulted ? Could we have done something else before we started throwing bombs ? What is Mr. Nobe PEACE Prize 's answer to that ??? March 21 , 2011 at 4:20 pm | Phil in Los Alamitos , California America 's role is to do the heavy lifting as always . All the talk of a ` coalition ' is nonsense . Keep in mind that the whole point of this exercise is to keep Ghadhafi in power and to keep Saudi Arabia from turning over . The world economy needs to keep the oil flowing and can not afford any potential disruption . This is about helping these countries put down the rebellions while harming as few citizens as possible in order to maintain what little stability exists . March 21 , 2011 at 4:23 pm | The US is working on shedding the image that we do whaterver we want and buffalo the world into accepting . This i mage has made us unpopular with friend anf foe alike . In Lybia we are stanging out of the limelight . Most of te air strikes have been conducted by others . It seems evident the the military effort is going beyond a no-fly zone and that substantil damage is being inflicted on Gadalfi 's forces . This has been a good start and hopefully the initative will be successful . Then we find out what the opposiion is really about . March 21 , 2011 at 4:25 pm | Good question . Why are we doing anything ? What difference will it make other than add even more wood to the Great Satan hatred held by just about every Muslim in the -LRB- at least -RRB- the Middle East for the US ? We 're damned if we do and damned if we do n't so let 's do n't for a change . Let the rest of the world worry about things . I 'm tired of it . First Afghanistan , which Bush screwed the pooch on when he decided to -LRB- second -RRB- invade Iraq . We 've lost far too many American 's for the Neo-con dream of `` democracy '' in the Middle East . Which , by the way , why is the GOP being so cautious ? Where were they in 2003 and 2001 ? March 21 , 2011 at 4:25 pm | My understanding is we 're at war , on at least a third front now -LRB- if you do n't include Pakistan -RRB- . The Military Industrial Complex must be joyous . However , the media ca n't even get the story right . I 've read two versions : NATO approved it , and France started the initial attack , or the US attacked with the backing of their allies . I guess journalism in the US these days means just making stuff up and letting us guess what the truth is . No wonder Americans are turning to the BBC , Al Jazeera , and der Spiegel for real news . March 21 , 2011 at 4:26 pm | People on the left and right kept screaming do something to help the people of Libya . Even though it seems like we entered this commitment in the dark of night and it felt a little clandestine , we are stepping up to the plate with many allies . It 's not like we could tell France and Great Britain to wait a minute while we get President Obama back from Brazil and Congress back from break to vote on this thing . We made the original committment when we took the matter to the U.N. No turning back now . March 21 , 2011 at 4:27 pm | Take the oil out of these wars and the dollar would fall flat in a week . This is about propping up the petro-dollar system so that our currency remains the reserve currency of the world . Without this action the dollar would be worthless to pay our debts , and America would slide into hyperinflation . I am not being snarky , it 's just the sad state we are in . March 21 , 2011 at 4:28 pm | Watching the news I am afraid we are much more deeply involved in this tribal civil war than we were originally told . I thought we were in a supporting role to the French -LRB- The FRENCH ?!? -RRB- who were supposed to take the lead in establishing the NFZ . Now it looks like our role is to spend millions of dollars we do n't have on fuel and munitions to piss off more Muslims in another open-ended conflict . March 21 , 2011 at 4:28 pm | I believe that our role is to assist in and support the UN resolution for a no fly zone as part of an allied coalition . Not to lead an invasion or remove a regime , but to proceed as needed to ensure that human rights are not violated as the process unfolds . And every issue that invloves Obama is partisan , Jack . Give us a break . March 21 , 2011 at 4:31 pm | james s lenon chuckey tn My understanding was that we would provide targetting information and AWAC guidance and Command\\/Control . Now we appear to be launching and dropping ordnance . The Arab League is now unhappy that we 're providing what they asked for . Someone should have told them that bombast and duplicity are not parts of our arsenal . Stand our troops down and let the Arab League create and maintain a no fly zone . That will be the day . March 21 , 2011 at 4:31 pm | My understanding is that the American mission is designed to use up as many rockets as possible in the shortest time in order to bolster the military industry back home . It must be the government 's view that nothing says domestic economic recovery so powerfully and quickly as destroying America 's supply of existing rockets now in Libya in order to make way for the next generation of military toys to roll off the assembly line . Meanwhile , in Florida , twenty percent of homes fester in vacancy , and education spending must be cut drastically in every State . Osama Bin Laden must be laughing in his cave . Libya certainly looks like another nail in America 's fiscal coffin . March 21 , 2011 at 4:34 pm | Jack to be perfectly honest I have stopped trying to understand what politicians in Washington are doing or what roll America is playing in foreign policy . Libya is going to be another Iraq and we will be stuck there in one form or another for decades to come just like Iraq and now Afghanistan . More Americas will be killed for some other countries freedom and I am getting a little sick of that fact . America is broke and any money we spend on Libya has to be borrowed from some other country that we will never be able to pay back . America has become a debtors prison for our children their children and any offspring they may ever have . March 21 , 2011 at 4:34 pm | My understanding of this war is we go in blow up and destroy the libyan army and get out . I also understand that we have now three wars in islamic nations where we have superior arms . My question to you jack is what happens when china or russia crackdown on their people for trying to change the govt ? March 21 , 2011 at 4:35 pm | Jack , I can hardly believe that the UAE , now after the resolution 1973 is passed with it 's stated intent , question and even complain that the air strikes are excessive and that they did n't know that this would be involved ! Are you kidding me ! These supposedly intelligent people did n't know that you just ca n't put planes in the air without taking out the weapons that could shoot them down ! What are they smoking ! Or , maybe it is ok to just begin flying over Libya and get shot down ! And , as far as I 've heard , everyone wants him to stop the killing & or step down . But , he 's not doing either ! Israeli PM Netanyahu called him , he 's been friendly with them for years , did n't return the call . What do you do ? Well , that 's what the UN resolution was all about ! And as much as it is not being said , him being made deceased is an option -- since he wont leave or stop is destruction of innocent civilians . As for these some of these congressmen , they must be smoking the same stuff as the Arabs -- oh we want him to leave but let 's not do anything drastic while he slaughter 's folks ! Oh my word -- to do or not to do or to backpedal ! The bottom line , since the resolution has been passed : Do the no flyover thing , monitor , and let the people decide which way and what they want to do with Gadhafi . Oh and stop putting the blame on POTUS for all the world 's ills ! Nurse Lisa in Shelton CT Not much , since their official story is n't yet out and there has been no bipartisan analysis explaining how it is either the greatest vs. worst move ever . For those worried about a lack of a stated plan -- it is probably the same as GWBs -- `` we 'll smoke 'em out ! '' March 21 , 2011 at 4:39 pm | Our role in Libya is to help the Libyan people by destroying Qaddafi 's ability to continue killing his own people . We 're enabling the people to get rid of Qaddafi themselves . There is NO comparison to Bush 's invasion of Iraq based on lies . The Libyan people are THANKING the countries helping them , which includes the U.S. . It 's 180 degrees from what Bush did , so if this reminds you of Iraq , you do n't have a very good memory . March 21 , 2011 at 4:41 pm | My understanding is this : We will do the bulk of the military action , suffer the bulk of lost lives , and we will be paying for this new fiasco forever . My understanding is the US is part of a coalition of nations taking this action in accordance with UN resolution 1973 . I do n't think it 's bad -- I hope the dictator is driven out -- that should be the objective -- or it could become a long , drawn out action . Apparently everyone 's forgotten Reagan 's attack on Libya . The dictator was slaughtering his own people . How can anyone with a conscience allow this to happen ? March 21 , 2011 at 4:47 pm | As an Arab American , i strongly oppose US involvement in Libya ; i would like to see Qadafi leave more than anyone , but not through our direct involvement , Supporting the revolutionist with Qadafi 's money that we have seized sounds like a great idea , Any military involvement does not have a success scope . There is no success for this mission , Qadafi will not leave until forced to , and that wo n't be accomplished by air strikes March 21 , 2011 at 4:50 pm | My understanding is that we will take control of Libya 's oil production to help bring down the price of gas in the U.S. . After that , we 're building a `` Disney -- Middle East '' theme park on top of Gadhafi 's main compound . March 21 , 2011 at 4:51 pm | Our role is to take a back seat and just help support our friends , France and England , do all the work ... We support by suppling the major weapons to be used as well ... Basically , we are , as usual , the major player but we do n't have the political will power to admit it ... We support the shock while others support the awe ... March 21 , 2011 at 4:51 pm | We ca n't be everything to everyone . This is a legit revolution and we need to stay out of it . Let the Arab league intervene and mediate if necessary . Too many of our good men and women are dying in the mid east and for what ??? Oil , thats what !! If Libya did n't have oil we could ' t care less about them March 21 , 2011 at 4:52 pm | What is your understanding of America 's role in the Libya offensive ? Ours is a support role . We are not in a leading role . We are not going to send ground troops and if Gadhafi and\\/or his fruitloop son end up dead , oh well . It is the will of the people . Too bad the Brits missed . The end result must be a benefit to some social program ; otherwise , Obama would n't have us involved . T. Masters , Greenville , SC March 21 , 2011 at 4:53 pm | Seems we still fail to learn from history -- even very recent history . There 's no vital national interest at stake in Libya so we should not attempt to pick a winner in a struggle internal to the people of Libya . Yes , Gaddafi is a creep , but are we so sure that the folks who take over will be our friends ? Or will the rebels -LRB- Islamic radicals -RRB- turn their hate towards us as the Taliban did ? Will we ever learn our lesson ? March 21 , 2011 at 4:54 pm | Jack , my understading of the US role in Libya is to join Countries , with the approval of the UN , the Arab League , and others to prevent genocide by Gadhafi of his own people . This is a temporary intervention , not particularly led by the US , since France sent airplanes first . The people being murdered begged for help , and now they are getting it . This is not declaration of war , and Kucinich is running scared for his next election , and Boehner , and others just want to criticize . First they say he should do this , then he waited too long , now why did n't he dicuss it with every John , Eric , and Dennis so they could waste time touting their personal importance . Impeach them for not doing their jobs . What a There was n't much understanding prior to the attacks beginning . After military action began it was to hault Libya from taking over the rebels strong holds and to save lifes . It looks like we have done that . But , what 's next . Will there be a standoff ? Is there another plan in the works ? I do n't feel very comfortable with this leadership , or the lack of ... . . March 21 , 2011 at 4:55 pm | My understanding is , that we under a UN resolution and would try to stop Gadhafi from killing civilians . , France , Britain , and other nations would help in doing so . Once that is achieved , we would patrol the area , and impose the no fly zone , until we can be sure that the indiscriminate killing of civilians could not be accomplished . And that is all that we are required to do . March 21 , 2011 at 4:56 pm | I do n't think anyone really knows what is going on . It seems clear that the French rushed through the no-fly zone resolution to stop Benghazi from being wiped off the map and save the revolution . With that now done it does n't seem that anyone has much of an idea about what will happen next . War always puts civilians in danger , no matter which side attacks . Will the coalition also strike the rebels if they commit atrocities ? are they just after Gadhafi ? Or do they just want to create a balance that will force the various sides to the negotiating table ? Too many gray areas and no clear objectives . I suspect this will be a long one . March 21 , 2011 at 4:57 pm | before I forget , I thought the Executive Branch could only go to war with the express permission of the Legislative Branch ? -LRB- Congress -RRB- When was Congress consulted and when did the vote granting the President the authority to go to war take place ? March 21 , 2011 at 4:57 pm | My take is that the stability in Libya is gone . We need to help protect the flow of oil to Europe . March 21 , 2011 at 4:58 pm | Same as it has been for many decades ; De-stabilize a Muslim country , protect Israel , take one dictator down to install another . March 21 , 2011 at 4:58 pm | This is ridiculous . I 've listened to what the President has said about the US mission in Libya ... and I understood exactly what he was saying . Maybe those who do n't want to understand whats being said need to start listening more carefully and stop inventing their own versions of what is going on based on some insane need to create alarm . And as far as political critics are concerned ; if Obama were Republican the Congress would be praising his every move , talking about his courageous action toward saving our shores from terrorists or some other worn out lie . . Maybe he needs to land on a carrier somewhere and declare ... President Obama is in a no-win situation here . He was being heavily criticized for doing nothing and permitting the slaughter of civilians . Now that he has intervened , he is being criticized for starting the 3rd war in an Arab country . As long as it is a measured response within the bounds of the UN resolution , and the US gets out fairly quickly , I believe he will have pursued the best course . From my point of view , the role of the US in Libya is to prevent more civilian casualties as well as prevent Gadhaffi 's regime from using military equipment to kill anti government protesters ; that was the consensus of the United Nations and should be respected . The decision of the US along with other Europeans nations of dismantling Gadhaffi s arsenal would allow anti-government opponents to continue focusing their efforts in implementing a more democratic government in Libya . My understanding is we wanted to quickly halt the military to prevent further harm to the citizens of Libya . By doing this , we can enable them to hold their ground and continue the liberation of their country without much outside help . The U.S. specifically delivered the brunt of the initial attacks on military targets to pave the way for the rest of the coalition which will handle the situation once control is handed over shortly . If this is indeed what happens , I 'm in full support . March 21 , 2011 at 5:02 pm | Remo , from beautiful downtown Pflugerville Texas Why Libya ? There is so much genocide going on in Africa , why are we stopping it in Libya ? Or are we just interested in oil and not humanity ? March 21 , 2011 at 5:03 pm | I have mixed emotions about this although Gadhafi is an absolute mad man bent on destroying his opposition , but at the same time Washington is saying nothing about the Saudi crackdown in Bahrain and other territories where they are killing innocent protesters . Looks like Washington has different standards for different countries depending on our friendship and alliances . March 21 , 2011 at 5:05 pm | We were very informed about the reason for Iraq war ; but if I 'm not mistaken , the information given was misleading . . We cant solve every countrys problems , even really bad ones . I hope the U.S. will get the heck out of what we have no business being in , but at the same time , the pots are calling the kettle black ... March 21 , 2011 at 5:05 pm | My and many of americans understanding is simply three prioritys of this Libya Offensive . Protect the oil feilds from being destroyed by Gadhafi 2 . Protect the people of Libya from being murdered by their leader . Finish former President Ronald Reagans offensive against Gadhafi by bombing his residence in hopes he is their at the time counting his millions This is what we signed up for after world war ll , being world police . We as Americans have the solem duty of protecting the weak throughout the world . The day we stop protecting the weak is the day we are weak ourselves . I am amazed that so few people heard Obama , on television last Saturday tell the American people that America was a part a colition that would establish -LRB- with others -RRB- a no fly zone over Libya . And , there would be NO American ground troops involved . This was after much criticism that we did n't act sooner . I for one am glad that other nations are also involved Our missle strikes seem to be necessary for the safety on pilots supporting the no-fly mandate March 21 , 2011 at 5:05 pm | Unless Gadaffi is deposed what is the point of this operation ? So either he is eliminated or this is a waste of effort March 21 , 2011 at 5:06 pm | Yeah ... too bad we could n't get George Tenet to give us a high five `` Slam Dunk '' assessment before we went in ... would that keep Lugar and Boehner happy ? Anyway you slice it , we are getting involved we where have no business getting involved ... the last few days have seen the attempts of a cover up by the administration in saying that Ghadafi is capable of terrorism so we must act . What about the gunning down of unarmed women in Cote ` de Ivoire last week or the gunning down of protesters in Bahrain ... The fact is that whether you are DEM or a REPUB ... both parties are leading us down a path to disaster and there is apparently no way out for the average citizen who wants them to focus on America 's issues and not the issues of everyone else . March 21 , 2011 at 5:06 pm | Our govenrment says we are to provide support for the other countries involved after the initial strikes aginst Libya . We are there to hopefully protect the Lybian People . I f we are not there to get rid of Gaddafi , what are we there for . We say we are there to protect the people . If the people are to be truely protected Gaddafi needs to go . Our mission in Libya is a purely humanitarian purpose and some how to remove the leader , now if by any chance a tomahawk hits him on the head that will acceptable . Once war starts it can go either way , but in this case it will be over before we know it , Libya is not Iraq sir ! we have people on the ground that have Moammar Gadhafi 's address it 's just a matter of time Sir ! March 21 , 2011 at 5:07 pm | Congress needs to get their collective heads out of their rear ends and stop questioning every move , or lack thereof , made by the President . So far what I 've seen from Obama appears to be thoughtful , deliberate , and well-prepared action . To hear it from members of Congress , either the action has been too hasty or not hasty enough . I 'm getting very tired of every member of Congress seeming to think their way is the only way . March 21 , 2011 at 5:08 pm | Here 's my concern . How much is actually known about the rebels our military forces are now protecting ? I agree the we should n't ever stand by and let dictators slaughter their own people ; yet we do it all the time when those regimes are considered our allies or friendly to the West . Why , for example , are we doing nothing to stop the killing of protesters in Bahrain ? Is it because the regime is a U.S. ally and because of oil and other financial interests ? How do we pick and choose where we will intervene in the brutal massacres of people by their own leaders , and where we will stand on the sidelines and shake our heads ? But getting back to Libya , specifically what worries me is who and what will emerge once Gaddafi is gone . We armed , aided , abetted , and actually created the Taliban in Afghanistan , believing that doing so was a way to thwart the Soviet Union . And look what we got . The rebels we 're now supporting in Libya could well turn out to be radical fundamentalist Islamists dedicated to establishing a Taliban-style Islamic state in Libya . Does anyone think such a state is going to be pro-Western or democratic ? March 21 , 2011 at 5:08 pm | So who else thinks US military action in Libya is insane ? I do n't dispute that Gadhafi is a ruthless dictator and is `` killing his people . '' But does that make it okay for us to kill Libyans ? Should the Russians have intervened when the Ohio National guard killed students at Kent State 1970 ? Want to punish the ruler ? Stop buying what he sells ... . . We would n't need what he sells if we spent 1\\/10 the money we spend on offensive weapons on research into making alternative forms of energy more efficient . I ask our leaders to stop displaying the definition of insanity , i.e. , doing the same things over and over again and thinking it will have a different outcome ... How many of these `` wars '' do we have to get involved in before we figure it out ? When the Libyans want and are ready for democracy they need to make it happen themselves . Until then , we should embody the `` prime directive , '' i.e. , do not interfere in the evolution of others . To do that we have to absolutely not need anything from those whose behaviors we abhor . Note my statements here are regarding the internal affairs of sovereign nations . If they strike outside their borders at us our our friends , we must strike back hard . But no externally pressured regime change . That is for internal evo - or revo-lution . March 21 , 2011 at 5:09 pm | Seems to me that we are the most qualified to take out Libya 's air defenses before other countries send their planes on patrol in relative safety . Remember ` Shock & Awe ' ? We 're pretty good at that . But then we really do need to back up & let everyone else do their part . We went it alone in Iraq , one of the most bone-headed decisions in modern times . I do n't really care if the President does n't inform the mealy-mouthed members of Congress -LRB- both parties -RRB- beforehand . They would just whine and complain and jockey for political advantage no matter what he did . As it is , the UN waited so long to approve this that Gadhafi was able to turn the whole situation in his favor . March 21 , 2011 at 5:10 pm | YES to spend money we do not have , Tomahawk Cruise Missile cost 569,000 each 118 the first day and 4 more yesterday , that 122 so far 69,418,000 dollars in missile alone . Raython makes these missiles they are the same company that help the U.S. Navy shoot down a Iranian passenger plane killing all on board , women and children . Then we pay off Iran they pay Libya to take down one of ours . This country has problems March 21 , 2011 at 5:10 pm | Sorry Jack , but I do n't see any similarity to Iraq at all . Iraq did n't ask us or anyone else to interfere and the administration of the time lied to -LRB- or at least deliberately mislead -RRB- the American people about why we needed to be there . The Lybians , on the other hand , have practically been begging the rest of the world to intervene . They 're dying at the hands of a half-mad dictator and need help . If anybody should have been impeached it should have been the president who illegally started the war in Iraq . We did n't start the conflict in Lybia ; the U.N. simply responded to the cry for help from the Lybian people . Not the same alt all . March 21 , 2011 at 5:11 pm | My understanding is this is a repeat of what happened when Clinton ordered US forces to join NATO in bombing Yugoslavia -- a dictator is clinging to power by going after his own people , and that 's when the UN steps in . March 21 , 2011 at 5:11 pm | As I listened this weekend to CNN it was my understanding that ... this effort was with the UN backing . Since when do we the people interfere with the heads of state , NATO and the UN to question their procedures . Does that make us thorns , in our own countries effort to help a country whose people are dying by the whim of a dictator . My understanding is we have the big guns and the missiles , another has the ground forces , while others will pick up the bill ... And who are the Republicans to speak evil when their president went to war in the wrong country . March 21 , 2011 at 5:11 pm | It 's interesting how Obama campaigned saying that he would start out his presidency with an immediate withdrawal of troops , and now we 've got more military involvement in more countries than we had under previous administrations . Aside from that , the fact that the president is taking military action without consulting Congress or clearly communicating the situation to the American people is unacceptable . This indicates his perception of the presidency as a dictatorial position rather than that of the chief executive . Even though I have been staunchly opposed to our actions in Iraq and Afghanistan , I greatly support action that stops a madman from slaughtering his own people with the help of foreign mercenaries . A repeat of the genocide in Srebrenica and Rwanda would be a tragedy . This is what is happening in Libya according to the United States . A week ago -- Obama is not doing anything , hiding under the desk , supporting his Muslim brothers etc -- Whine whine whine Two days ago -- Obama bombed Libya -- how dare he , How arrogant etc Whine whine whine Yesterday -- Obama was too late in attacking Libya -LRB- John McCain -RRB- Whine whine whine Today -- How dare Obama attack Libya -- He should have got congressional approval Whine whine whine March 21 , 2011 at 5:11 pm | My understanding is that it is similar to France 's role in our American Revolution . Help level the playing field so that the outcome of the revolution is determined more by what the majority of people in the country want than by who has the most tanks and gun ships . Unlike Iraq the Libyan people have shown that they do n't want their leader and are willing to fight for themselves to outser him . We need only give them the level tactical playing field to do so . March 21 , 2011 at 5:12 pm | The mission is to stop Gadaffi from killing his own people . We are enforcing UN resolution 1973 . If Gadaffi goes down in the process , that is all for the good . I have been paying attention closely to this Jack . I listen to the President , the Generals , and Sarkozy as well as Cameron . I go on line and read CREDIBLE news sources . I do NOT listen to pundits or politicos from either party . Their ` agenda '' seldom has anything to do with passing on truth or wisdom . March 21 , 2011 at 5:12 pm | The President was reluctant to involve the US in another military engagement , but was faced with the reality that Benghazi was about to fall and Libya would be left with a ruthless dictator who would continue to cause untold and continuing death and destruction upon his own people . I believe the limited engagement that the President has signed off on is in the best interests of the Libyan people while also beginning to restore the hope and faith that people of the world once held in the United States of America . March 21 , 2011 at 5:12 pm | Is n't this the way it is suppose to be . When the UN undertook this mission , the French , the Arab countries , other countries of Africa and southern Europe should be at the forefront . For too long , when somebody says UN action , it is the USA that is in the forefront , back front , sidefront , with token display from others . This is what George Bush should have done in Afghanistan The President ca n't start a war without the approval of Congress unless there is an immediate threat to the US . Obama graduated from Harvard Law and taught Constitutional law and he knows this . I do n't understand what he is trying to do . March 21 , 2011 at 5:14 pm | Gaddafi is long overdue to be removed from power . It is unfortunate that the strike in 1986 missed . Hopefully we can complete that mission and honor Fernando L. Ribas-Dominicci and Paul F. Lorence for their sacrifice . March 21 , 2011 at 5:14 pm | As someone that was born Muslim I 've heard your rhetoric before and its typical . Libya is messed up BECAUSE the Muslims in that country have done a poor job . That 's an Arab problem -- like the entire Arab world . Stop blaming America for all the Muslim worlds problems . March 21 , 2011 at 5:14 pm | Hey maybe we can give them our Mulism anti-American leader and get rid of Gadafi at the same time . We 'll straighten our country out and theirs at the same time . We began our 3rd war over the weekend , like it or not ... our play book , we started it . What is confusing about that ? We 're in it now ! March 21 , 2011 at 5:15 pm | I understand why we are involved with Libya ... we are doing what America has both verbally and through action always done ... we are defending those that ca n't defend themselves . We are not in Libya to fight the battle for the rebels , but are there to defend the interests of those caught in the middle . Pres. Obama has been a humanitarian from the very beginning and it is no surprise to me that he has gotten us involved here . I am glad to see that the plan is for us to step aside and let others lead the rest of this operation because everyone that is rushing in now left us with Iraq and Afghanistan on our own for the most part . I think that it is time for the world to be more involved with the task of `` policing the world '' that has tragically fallen on American shoulders for years . Also , I think that getting out of the way and letting other countries lead the charge will potentially help remove the stigma that we are only involved in places over oil . the message has not been communicated well to the American people . We may not have lost any men in assisting with this ` No Fly Zone , ' but as a country that is running low on money it is important to remember that tomahawk missiles , fuel for naval vessels , and aircraft sorties are expensive . Libya had better have been worth it . My understanding is that the Libya offensive is a joint operation approved by the Arab League and the UN with the purpose of keeping Moammar Gadhafi 's forces from massacring those citizens who had opposed his long totalitarian rule . Gadhafi 's troops were marching across the country , and he had decreed that he would search out and kill all his opponents . President Obama has made it clear that the U.S. 's role is to be limited and that France and England have taken the lead in fulfilling the mission . The verbal attacks on President Obama for either being too slow to support the opposition or too fast to do so without complete consultation demonstrate how difficult it is in the current poisoned political atmosphere to map out a middle way . Whatever decision the President makes now is roundly criticized by partisans all around . March 21 , 2011 at 5:15 pm | Jack -- It is pretty straightforward . The Europeans wanted the US to lead as usual so that they could go in as the peacemakers and enjoy the spoils of war . . The Arab League wanted the US to go in so that they could have their bogeyman for the hungry masses . . The Russians and Chinese obviously also wanted the US to go in so that they could extend their hands of friendship to these regimes . President Obama played it perfectly and forced everyone to show their hand . Now the Europeans are having to put their money where their mouth is , the Russians and Chinese had to vote for the UN resolution or face the backlash from the Arab streets . All Obama has agreed to do is help the allies by using the unique military capabilities of the US . March 21 , 2011 at 5:16 pm | My take is we have the critical equipment to do the initial phase and then turn it over to NATO or whoever and be in a supporting role , as Bob Gates has said . As for the republicans in Congress , they need to just sit down and shut up like they did when `` W '' was starting wars we did n't need . What does Monica Lewinsky have to do with Libya ? March 21 , 2011 at 5:16 pm | Well , Mark , and anyone else for that matter , we do n't need to be involved in any more `` police actions '' . I also understand what 's being `` said '' , but there are times you need to step back and analyze the entire situation . It is definitely tragic that a tyrant is killing civilians , but that does n't mean that the U.S. needs to jump in to help out . France was all gung-ho about getting in there , so let them do it . This is one time that we need to ride the bench . There are plenty of other nations who are more than willing to set up a pupet government in Libya . Oh and one other thing , since the Arab League was all for enforcing a no fly zone , why are n't Arab League jets doing the attacking ? And on top of that , we have demonstrations in the U.S. over unions , how long before that turns really ugly ? March 21 , 2011 at 5:16 pm | Theres two understandings president Obamas and the United Nations which over rules which will Gadhafi go free because the United Nations says no . March 21 , 2011 at 5:17 pm | Wait a second !? Were n't the republicans the ones crying for Obama to do something sooner ? And now their upset !? Typical if you ask me . March 21 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | This war was never America 's problem . If Arabs want democracy they have to fight for it -- plain and simple . When America does nothing -- it gets blamed for being evil and helping Israel . Now America is helping , spending $ , and I can assure you there will be no benefit in the long run . The fact that the Arab League was reconsidering its position after the bombing began was not a surprise -- and shows why leaving the Arab world to fend for itself is probably better for America . March 21 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | On Libya ... we need to stop trying to Micro Manage the events in Libya . The President in Libya knew exactly what was going to happen in is country and why . He had all the time to prevent anything that would effect his citizens . Their blood is on his hands , not anyone Else 's . In knowing this , Micro Managing this , is only a Method in which only falsely accuses others for the blame of blood being spilled , & done to others . It was n't the cause of others who caused the actions . It was n't them who insisted or caused it . So , let 's put the blame where it is deserved , not on others ! They were given their choice ! March 21 , 2011 at 5:18 pm | I understand and approve of the No-fly zone . We cant sit back and let a mad man kill his own people because they want human rights . Obama did a great job of waiting for and securing a coalition of many nations . I only wonder why he did n't have to ask congress for authorization like Bush did before Iraq . March 21 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | The same as it is in every other conflict to act as the international communities dog and meet their needs and go home . When we want to cut funding for housing for the disabled but we have money to spend on this nonsense well we have our priorities wrong . If France and England want to enforce a no fly zone that is fine but let them spend the money on it . The U.S. should do NOTHING besides put our stamp of approval on it we need to take care of America first ! March 21 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | i ca n't figure out what our role is in the world period . . if we are so supportive of the downtrodden and oppressed , why are n't we launching ait strikes on the Ivory Coast ? oh wait , no oil . . March 21 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | I believe most of the firepower , the ships are American . We are told the Brits have one ship there . There appears to be a pretense that America is n't leading it , perhaps to protect this President from responsibility . He seems very interested in distancing himself . Americans are not happy about that ! March 21 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | I am not concerned about a so called well defined mission in Libya . I am glad that we are finally taking action to stop this madman . I just hope it is not too late . As far as I am concerned the first missile strike should have targeted Gadhafi . March 21 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | Jim Campbell , St. Paul , MN The military action is designed to stop aggression against innocent civilians . After that , it will be up to the people of Libya to decide its leadership . The many sanctions imposed already should speed that process . More sanctions will likely be forthcoming . I just do n't understand the fuss -LRB- snit -RRB- that some express over this action . If we had to wait for Congress to act , we 'd likely go through months of hearings and a filibuster . In this instance , the Commander in Chief had to act quickly . March 21 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | 1 . What 's the strategic objective ? Who 's our ally in Libya ? Do we KNOW who the rebels are ? Why was Congress not consulted ? What was the direct threat to the U.S. ? Not a single answer from the vacationing 0bama . March 21 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | When George W invaded Iraq liberals called it an oil war . I wonder if calling Libya an `` oil war '' is going to depend on who you voted for . The president 's use of military force in Libya is wise and just . Hundreds of armed , bad men burned to death today while en route to Benghazi with the intent of killing innocent women , children and men . The president is right to experiment with tectonic military and diplomatic forces to mitigate civilian losses in war zones around the world . March 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | It was my understanding that our current mission in Libya was to stop Gaddafi from killing his own people . I heard that this would be accomplished with C-130s dropping ponies , unicorns , rainbows and all manner of things nice upon the good Colonel 's forces as well as those of the Opposition ; sure that would stop all of the fighting . As to why we are seemingly leading NATO and Arab states in dropping bombs and firing missiles , I do n't know . I do hope the President will clarify that for us . March 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Our role in this conflict is the acting force of the United Nations . The United Nations does not have a formal military , so countries with ably militaries have to support their decisions for the good of the world . March 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | We accomplished another no fly zone mission very well and will pass command to the coalition . You should know this fact jack so lets stick with the facts on this mission to stop another dictator slaughtering his people . March 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Its amazing , first Obama 's critics claim he is not doing enough in Libya and that he is making America seem weak . Now that the United States is part of this coalition and is actively making strikes in Libya people still are not happy . Obama can never win with some people . March 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | As I see it , our mission is to level the playing field in terms of attacks by aircraft and\\/or helicopters against the anti-Gaddafi forces . My understanding is we 're over there taking the power away from one of the worst guys in the world . Unlike most of our loser politicians , the current President understands we need to keep a low profile . Otherwise we wo n't be able to get on an airplane without some character lighting his underpants on fire or stuffing bombs in his shoes . March 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | On Libya ... we need to stop trying to Micro Manage the events in Libya . The President in Libya knew exactly what was going to happen in his country and why . He had all the time to prevent anything that would effect his citizens . Their blood is on his hands , not anyone Else 's . In knowing this , Micro Managing this , is only a Method in which only falsely accuses others for the blame of blood being spilled , & done to others . It was n't the cause of others who caused the actions . It was n't them who insisted or caused it . So , let 's put the blame where it is deserved , not on others ! They were given their choice ! March 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Tomahawk cruise missile is likely to prove a key weapon in the allied assault on Libyan military targets . March 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | For many years , the USA has been waiting for this opportunity to finally take Ghadaffi out as they did with Saddam . Ghadaffi has bullied the USA for a very long time . If you wanna bully America , America will revenge . It 's unfortunate that , we did n't have a Republican president make this happen quicker than it did . Why bother with the likes of Zimbabwe or Ivory Coast ? Saddam Hussien never killed an American citizen and we sent several hundred thousand troops , bombed his country into oblivion and set him up to be hung but we are n't going after a man who was behind a plane bombing that killed Americans . We do n't have money for a WIC program to feed underpriviledged children but we have billions for a ` no fly zone '' . And you want people to understand what is happening . How is that possible . March 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Woody from Lake Havasu , AZ Jack , Lybia 's so-called leader was killing his own people . The U.N. made their decision for a no fly zone . It was the right thing to do . They could not do it without the aid of the U.S. . As far as Congress , they can not even come up with a budget . Who cares what Congress thinks . At least I do n't . March 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | All I know is that at $ 1.4 M per cruise missile we just blew up a lot cash we can ill afford to spend . Considering that Italy imports 60 % of their oil from Libya , and is just across the Mediterranean from them , why did n't THEY lead the offensive ? March 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Our job ? Drop a few bombs , hopefully take out a crazed weasel of a dictator and then come home . Let the rest of the countries do the heavy lifting for a change . But we went in there to prevent a slaughter . Good job for Pres Obama . Good Job for Our Military Heroes . Good on ya to the Libyan people . We 've cleared the way , now go kick Gadhafi 's ass . March 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | I believe that their isnt much of a choice when it comes to something decided by the UN we are apart of the United Nations and need to stand by them should we not and begin to loose their support in the aprarently troubled times to come . March 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Jack : I think it 's clear the goal in Libya is to protect civilians . If the president had gone to the U.S. Congress before military involvement , more civilians would have been killed . It took the international community way to long to step in . I applaud the president for not delaying assistance any longer . He is not required to consult the Congress ahead of time , he has 60 days to seek Congressional approval under the War Powers Act of 1973 . Congress needs to get over it and I 'm sure the president will make his case to them when he returns from an important international trip . March 21 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Jack , we all know why we are in Libya . To get rid of a brutal dictator . Few weeks ago the same people were calling the President weak and hesitating to give a presidential directive , now ... they do n't know why we are in Libya . Coalition not just the US is involed , even the French started air strike before we did . March 21 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Jack , it means this maniac in charge of Libya has already shot down a plane with Americans on it ... he wiggled his way back into our good graces , and now he 's on the loose again ... I 'm with Obama ... Gadhafi 's gotta go ... I see the United States in his cross hairs . March 21 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Why is it that we always seem to find the billions to fight wars and enforce no fly zones in far off places but can not come up with $ 600M to build the fence on our southern border which is a bigger threat than Libya . March 21 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Put simply US participation in Libya is just an extension of our goal of world dominance . By now we all should know that it is really not about the people that get shot at , just that the people doing the shooting think like we think . March 21 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Its for the Oil , just like Bush , invasion of Iraq . We don ; t care about civilian dead , and never had or the stuff like Weapons of Mass Destruction , Same stuff here , just trying to help the civilians . Where are my Leftist , my Gobbels , my Goring and the rest of their crowd going wild about the Oil ... Because the are all lying idiots dragging this nation down . Hey Jack , where is you whine about the oil ???? March 21 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | My understanding is that we are there to protect civilians . But how does it play out ? Step one : Paralyze Gadhafi 's forces to the greatest extent possible . Step two : Secure the safety of civilians by patroling areas that are vulnerable to attacks by Gadhafi 's forces so that forces loyal to his regime are unable to strike at will or without significant resistance by equally or better armed forces . Step three : It is n't really a step at all . It 's an outcome . The chaos of battle spawns unintended consequences and we become more entrenched in the situation than we earlier envisioned in steps one and two . Step four : Now the nasty stuff kicks in as profiteers lobby for a continuos monitoring and `` always on '' presence in the country . US role in Libiya ? Far from home , a carbon copy of Iraq and Afghanistan , increase of Anti-American sentiments , a futile effort to control the world . Acts like this will win no respect or allies . Lifesaver is a cheap candy that rots your teeth . It has nothing to do with protection of innocent civilians armed to the teeth , called rebels . In addition , indiscriminate use of missiles and other military capabilities can be percived as a peace-saving acts only by hopeless imbeciles with disarmed analytical capacities of their brains . March 21 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | The role is a humanitarian action . The Gaddafi regime has violated several international laws that protect civilians . They still continue to do so . There was urgency for action or there would have been a genocide . If there was no action than what is the purpose of the UN . I thought one of the roles is to protect the civilians of the world . March 21 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | The President has shown at every turn of the Egypt and now Libya crises that his supposedly superlative understanding of foreign relations was feined ; that he can not provide the leadership that Hillary does and that the world would perhaps -LRB- unbelievably -RRB- even prefer the straightforward and predictable approach of Bush to this rambling detached approach . March 21 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | It was time to lead and Obama lead . You do n't stand by silently and do nothing while a people is killed off by their so called `` leader '' . What is the old saying , `` people get the government they deserve -LRB- earn -RRB- '' . Seems to me the Liberians are trying to earn the government they deserve . Just need a helping hand . We got it from the French during the revolutionary war . Time to give back . March 21 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | It 's pretty simple , Jack . Read the UN Resolution . We are part of a coalition of NATO and Arab Nations to protect the Libyan people who are protesting against the dictator , Gaddafi . Additionally , on its own merit , the Obama Administration has decided that Gaddafi must go . What 's so hard to understand ? It 's not a war , it is a humanitarian effort in protecting innocent people who asked for our help . We are currently leading the effort because 2 -RRB- NATO asked us to and b -RRB- we were in the region and have the means . Others needed time to step up and step in . I 'd like to ask the confused congressional members how they feel this effort differs from Bosnia or Grenada . I find their ` confusion ' to be political and offensive . Obama is after all our Commander in Chief . Makes me wonder if they 'd be this confused if Bush had calls these shots . March 21 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | Firstly , I 'm a Canadian relying on CNN to get the latest on Lybia . If that should mean anything , the world is relying on the US to get the news on foreign issues . I think the republicans need to get their heads out of their rears and start realizing the impact the US is having in the world . People are singing praise in Lybia and around the world . Military action is a method of reaction . If you see innocent deaths likely to happen , you react . Obama has been nothing but transparent on the topic . He has been vocal on his hesitance and his eagerness to pull out A.S.A.P. . You do n't ask NATO to step in to run to the grocery store . If anything , Obama needs praise for his ability to put aside his own wishes for the better of the world , not threatened to be impeached and removed from office . March 21 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | I think it was very clear from the press conference earlier that the objective is to protect Libyan civilians from random killing and senseless massacre , not to help the opposition . However , the question is ... if the opposition continues to press forward will we then attack them ? I do n't like being the world 's police force , but I like being the people who stand on the sideline and watch the bullies beat up the weak even more . March 21 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | I understand and approve of the No-fly zone and missile strikes on military targets . We cant sit back and let a mad man kill his own people because they want human rights . Obama did a great job of waiting for and securing a coalition of many nations . I only wonder why he did n't have to ask congress for authorization like Bush did before Iraq . March 21 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | The message is clear ... As part of UN declaration 1973 and at the request of the Arab League , this is a humanitarian mission to overthrow a regime that is killing its own people . The world watching another Rwanda or Bosnia is not an option . It is easy to be a Monday morning quarterback and the Arab League 's distancing themselves afterwards should not be a surprise . To politicize this is wrong -LRB- but also expected -RRB- . It is the right move and I trust will come to a swift ending . March 21 , 2011 at 5:22 pm | President Obama appears to be scripted from the same cloth as former President Bush . Under the auspices of `` human rights '' or `` humanitarian '' intervention the US and and its allies are enforcing a UN no-fly zone . I ca n't help but see the shadow of Big Oil companies peeking out from behind the curtain , and the manipulating the puppet strings . If you can believe it , this military intervention in Libya was sold even less to the American people than the Iraq War in 2003 . The 2012 elections ca n't come soon enough . I think that the whole idea of us being involved is crazy , the Arabs are using us and then will turn on us as they always have . We have more than enough problems here and can not even control the 2 wars we 're already committed to . If our country goes bankrupt who will bail us out . Stay out of foreign affairs and re-build our country . My understanding of the Libya No Fly Zone Offensive is very clear to me as President Obama publicly made the case for the institution of this operation -- the purpose for the No Fly Zone is to save the lives of Libyian civilians and to prevent genocide , the destablization of neighboring countries in the North African and Southern European region where a humanitarian crisis could ensue . I do not understand the hysteria on the part of members of Congress about not being consulted . The President has the legal authority to initiate military action without consulting Congress . However , the President did consult with some Congressional members of both political parties prior to initating any military action . I applaud President Obama for being cautious , prudent and willing to consult with members of Congress , his cabinet prior to taking any action . March 21 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | I can understand the role just fine . I wish it went a few steps farther and actually allowed us to go in there and throw Gaddhafi out rather than try to evict him from afar . We need to march on Tripoli now so we do n't need to do it again later . March 21 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | I thought it was a `` No fly Zone '' operation , now I am hearing that we are attacking ground forces ... . and his palace , guess he has AA guns in the front yard . An now the Arab Nations are not supporting combat operation ? Why dont they just call it for what it is ... WAR . March 21 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | I ca n't tell what the administration has decided . They 're being too evasive . If they want to hold their cards `` close to the chest '' to keep Gadhafi guessing , then that 's OK as long as they at least tell Congress -LRB- in secret , if necessary -RRB- what they 're thinking . But it does n't appear that they 've done that . We hear the results from Boehner and others . March 21 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | When did we become the policing force of the world ? And how is the situation in Libya so desperate that it requires such drastic action ? Is it any more dire than the situation in Japan , where we could be spending our funding toward positive humanitarian action ? I think the point is , the American public DOES N'T understand our offensive in Libya . March 21 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | I would just like to remind Congress that if the French had not assisted us with a 1700 's version of a `` no fly zone '' , with a shipping blockade against the British , there would ` nt be an America . It is profoundly hypocritical for our congress to be against the actions of peoples who are striving for ideals that we have lauded for two centuries . This goes for both sides of the house . I am deeply ashamed of those who reap the benefits of our freedom then condemn the very methods that made it possible . March 21 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Our part is to use some of our unique capabilities -LRB- bombers , missiles , satellites , etc -RRB- to stop and destroy the Libyan capability to harm civilians . Beyond that Obama has said Gadaffi must step down . I guess by magic ? I think we are just stopping a blood bath like he says and giving the rebels a fighting chance . If we do n't do it we look a lot worse than if we do do it . Some just want to slam the president over anything and care more about that than the country . We need to get rid of Quadafi , but ca n't come right out and say that . If we leave him there he will just cause terrorist attacks and with us recruiting , training , and funding so many terrorists right here at home we do n't need to be also worrying about him . March 21 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | The political rhetoric in the US and Europe sounds an awful lot like the Arab League : yes , we want intervention , then NO , we do n't , once the intervention starts . Yet another Rwanda or does the US -LRB- there is nobody else -RRB- actually do something about it ? March 21 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | I have been listening for the last 3 weeks the people of Libya asking for help did we do anything no. . Now that United Security Counsel made a decision I am glad that we are helping them . If anyone listens to what is being said you see people in Libya happy that the world is helping . No one should have to be scared to go outside and have the same rights we do . What is the Senates problem I understand what is going on . Did they want to wait until he killed everyone there first and then say oh we should have done something . If the politions ca n't even agree over things that need to be done here what makes them think that they could have said anyhting that would have changer the outcome . I AM VERY PROUD OF PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR STANDING UP TO A COUNTRY THAT IS DOING GENICIDE TO HIS OWN PEOPLE . March 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | I 'll tell you what our involvement is in Lybia is Jack . Find a new place to drop our bombs . After all we make them , we must use them . We need to keep our weapon factories rolling and save jobs . We can no longer drop them in Iraq and we are droping less and less in Afghanistan . March 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | When did we become the policing force of the world ? And how is the situation in Libya so desperate that it requires such drastic action ? Is it any more dire than the situation in Japan , where we could be spending our funding toward positive humanitarian action ? I think the point is , the American public DOES N'T understand our offensive in Libya . America must understand that those who will not hear the messengers of peace will be made to hear the messengers of war . As followers of the Gospel of Peace that was preached by the MAN OF PEACE , Jesus , the Christ , let us strive to be the instruments of peace instead of the apparatus of destruction . -- Preacher March 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | The missile attacks on Lybia were : 1 . Iniated and agreed upon by the United Nations Security Council ; 2 . The United States a 2 . The air strikes were aimed at military weapon 's sites in Lybia - not on Kadafi or innocent civilians ; I do believe we should not AND DID NOT ACT March 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | I totally support President Obama . Where were these republicans when President Bush went to war without Congress 's permission ? Silent !! At least Obama had the UN behind him and the support of the Arab League ! March 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | I was against any intervention , BUT now the attacks against Gadhaffi have been somewhat partial . I 'm wondering why Obama went to Brazil and then ordered the attacks ? Is it that there is a way to try to appease the American public since that France and Britain are involved ? Or is it a ruse to gain trust from the American people in lieu of the problems here in the US ? March 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | My understanding of the US role is one of participation only . The Congress is as usual way off target . They were informed , just a might forgetful as usual . Tell Congress to read UN mandate 1973 , it spells it all out and only idiots could not understand it . They have to live under a rock not to know the US position . They are like a bunch of bratty kids , always complaining about something . March 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | It 's time you ppl started listening to your President and stop trying to go against him . He was very clear from the beginning . He said you will not be on the ground unlike what Bush did . Bush took it upon himself . Maybe ppl should read 1973 . When it is a U.N involvement of all countries , the United States is always there . President Obama is very clear if you only listen and further more the U.N does not have to answer to the American congress , this in not just a U.S. war like the one the republications created . I understand the Presidents comments to mean that in a few days\\/weeks the US will withdraw military involvement in Libya and leave it to it 's allies . If so then the US have started the war and then backing out and leaving it to European countries to possibily get their military killed a kind of '' we 've started now you finish '' . March 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | The whole objective in Libya is a gamble that the ` rebels ' will replace Gaddafi with a pro-western government that will be less of a threat to USA interests . This help preserve the oil we get from that region and is further protection for Israel . Humanatarian needs etc is just an excuse to protect or oil\\/Israel interest . Everything else is just to try and keep the media from attacking us as they did Bush for Iraq . Vince in Atlanta March 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | The U.S. role in Libya is to take out the Libyan air defenses and prevent Libyan military aircraft and tanks from massacring civilians . Anyone who actually wants a madman to kill civilians with smiling mercenaries equiped with military hardware is entitled to their opinion but is not someone I care to debate . I generally avoid talking to heartless idiots and cowards . March 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | President Obama has ABSOLUTELY no choice but to participate in the Libyan Offensive , not to mention a UN resolution . The genocide of oppressed civilians who are fighting for freedom , as far as I 'm concerned , is the most significant and justifiable reason for a US offensive I 've ever seen . We advocate the spread of democracy in the middle east , how could we not be involved !? March 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | Prevention of genocide is the reason we are involved in this action . It is a just action . Think about what could have been prevented in Rwanda or go all the back to 1939 and think about the millions of lives that , perhaps , could have been saved . March 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | America 's role in Libya is what America 's role has always been in recent years . It is to be the whipping boy for all the countries in the United Nations Assembly when only the United States will take a stand , wrong or right , against the outrageous actions of states against fellow human beings . It 's present and future roles are to be cencured by the Arab League for doing what is necessary against the thugs that the league can not admit they need the US to do for their good . It will also be Obama 's role , in Libya , to take the hit from the hypocrites of both parties , in Washington , wherein Obama can be blamed for every action they wo n't take . Again it will be shown : No Good Deed Goes Unpunished ! March 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | My understanding is that 1 -RRB- people who demonstrated peacefully for regime change were attacked by their fearless leader 2 -RRB- these demonstators began to fight in defense 3 -RRB- a coaliton of nations moved -LRB- perhaps too slowly -RRB- to provide a no fly zone 4 -RRB- the US was one of those nations 5 -RRB- at this point , the battle is once again a fair one , and the Libyan people hope to remove Moamar G from power , but it 's up to them 6 -RRB- as usual , our wonderful representatives are reacting in every nuclear way possible , grandstanding among those reactions . Where 's the wisdom ? March 21 , 2011 at 5:24 pm | America 's role is to protect oil ... as usual . Anyone who ca n't see through this farce of `` protecting civilians '' and `` spreading democracy '' must be stupid enough to believe that we found WMDs in Iraq . Ca n't wait to see which new tyrant will replace Ghadafi ... of course , this new tyrant will be NATO-approved !!! Great job , America ! Thanks for once again meddling in the affairs of a sovereign nation . March 21 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | I 'm confused about the cease fire . Seems it only goes one way . Seems the Rebels can attack and kill , but they are not being bombed ? ` Humanitarian bombing ' ? Kind of ironic , huh ? We should NOT be involved in their civil war . March 21 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | My understanding is that the US is providing a very vital role in warfare that most countries in the UN are unable to provide , and that is command and control of the skies . They are doing this while allowing other nations to provide ground support when the time is right . It is as it should be , this strategy makes sense , because of our economic position does not allow us to fight another full scale war . March 21 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | EDIT : I think it was very clear from the press conference earlier that the objective is to protect Libyan civilians from random killing and senseless massacre , not to help the opposition . However , the question is ... if the opposition continues to press forward will we then attack them ? I do n't like being the world 's police force , but I like being the people who stand on the sideline and watch the bullies beat up the weak even less . March 21 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | Jack , US foreign policy is getting hilarious . We certainly ca n't blame Obama for his floundering . It was all started by his predecessor of showing America 's muscle everywhere . While bar fights are ok when needed , you ca n't simply go join a bar-fight because some drunks are having a go at each other . This is what it looks like . America wants to throw the bar bully Gaddafi out dead or alive . But listen to the silly stories they are making to mask the objective . Forget Bush , call a spade a spade ! Our role is to support the UN Resolution for a `` NO Flight Zone '' over Libya , in order to stop Ghadafi 's forces from killing other Libyans . It 's interesting ... the president was at first criticized for not acting quickly enough , and now he 's being criticized for acting too quickly . . Poor man , he 's damned if he does , and damned it he does n't . !! March 21 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | my understanding is that our role in this is to simply to prevent a madman from killing his own civilians . i wonder if the people criticizing the president would sing the same tune if their families were in the areas in danger of being slaughtered . we are in a time of war , we are acting under authorization of the u.n. and have support from many nations on a mission that saves countless lives . congress needs to suck it up and get over the feeling of being left out . this is the time to support our armed forces and our president , not to bicker amongst ouselves . March 21 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | Jack , I believe that the U.S. role in the Libya offensive is exactly as President Obama describe and as laid out in U.N Resolution 1973 . I wish you folks at CNN will make up your minds -- you ca n't have it both way . Last week , it was said that President Obama was slow getting involved , slow taking action , he needed to move , now that he has , there is more rubbish . Where were you when Bush took us to war ? March 21 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | He 's dirthering AND rushing to judgement . He 's ignoring Congress AND not being a bold , Executive Branch leader . He 's launching a Christian Crusade AND protecting his cherished Arab\\/Islamic brothers . He 's fighting Israel 's war AND opening the door for an Jew-hating , Islamic Republic . Obama-Haters , did I miss anything ? March 21 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | I think the President was clear that the US military action is strictly to support the UN Resolution , which is narrower than what Obama 's says his desire is with respect to Qaddafi 's tenure - i.e. , that it ends now . That there is bipartisan questioning of the Administration 's position on Libya speaks more to the desire of Congress to carry out US military and diplomatic policy from Capitol Hill , than concern over what we 're doing there . Personally , I like the separation of powers concept ... March 21 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | Well Jack , it 's very difficult to understand what is going on . How you can bomb a country without going to war ? How the leader of that country needs to step down but we are not going to harm him ? Who makes these rules when the UN and the USA are NOT even thinking the same on what is going on . Endgame unclear frazzles my mind as there certainly should be an endgame policy . Rules being made up as you go along , looks like American citizens are paying for more military ventures . March 21 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | Barbara Teixeira - Las Vegas , NV My understanding is that we were going to be in a support role . Now we are bombing sites ? Then the President says we will step back from a leading role in a matter of days ? I have heard so may conflicting stories , I am thoroughly confused . What I am not confused about though , is that our President got us into this without consulting Congress . I find that very upsetting . While I believe that we should join forces with other nations to assist the Libyan people , I do not think the President should have made that decision on his own and dragged us into a leading role . He is the President , not an dictator . If he can do this without consulting Congress , what will he decide to do in the future without consulting them . I find that very frightening . March 21 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | I do n't understand our role in Libya . We should n't be there at all . The people in that region say we are Infidels . Why are there no Arabic people who want to protect innocent people from mass murder ? I am all for helping people in danger , but their people should want to help themselves with us . March 21 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | For once -LRB- probably for the best -RRB- we are in a support role , rather than bearing the brunt . In this position , we can offer the coalition our military expertise which surpasses the rest of the coalition put together . As far as Obama is concerned , there will be the group of people who will criticize him , no matter what he does . The impromptu targets taken will result in a an Accidental Regime Change . March 21 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | 1 . US will pay with resources & people . Eurpoeans may stand in the sidelines . Liberals will cry foul -LRB- it is a war about Oil -RRB- . US hater 's cry will be heard loud and clear . Republicans may call it Obama 's war . Al Queida may muster , more support in Libya . Few , may understand that there is country name Libya . March 21 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | Anyone who claims they do n't know what our mission is , probably is n't listening , I think the President has made it perfectly clear and made sure it was not a unilateral effort . As for all the cry babies who claim they do n't know what 's going on , that 's just politics as usual it always coming from the same people . I do not understand America 's role in the Libya 's offensive . However , when the Sri Lankan government massacred more 40,000 innocent civilians , America did not step in at all . The events occurring in Libya are a result in the want for oil , not as an action to better the people . March 21 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | These are the same members of congress that were complaing that the president was too slow in reacting to the Libyan problem ? The same mebers of congress who are not in DC at this time ? Another vacation for our -LRB- respected ? -RRB- As has been stated before , our role as well as our allies is to protect the Libyan peoples from Ghadafi 's genocide of his own peoples . He is a despot who has shown his disregard for his own people by even using them as a shield against the bombing of his assets . The U.N. was correct in its wording of resolution 1973 . As for congress , stay at home . The american people are fed up with their antics in the name of politics . March 21 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | My understanding of the Libya No Fly Zone Offensive is very clear to me as President Obama publicly made the case for the institution of this operation the purpose for the No Fly Zone is to save the lives of Libyian civilians and to prevent genocide , the destablization of neighboring countries in the North African and Southern European region where a humanitarian crisis could ensue . This would be a limited operation that the U.S play a nonleading roll . No U.S. ground forces would be deployed . do not understand the hysteria on the part of members of Congress about not being consulted . The President has the legal authority to initiate military action without consulting Congress . However , the President did consult with some Congressional members of both political parties prior to initating any military action . I applaud President Obama for being cautious , prudent and willing to consult with members of Congress , his cabinet prior to taking any action . March 21 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | My understanding of the US role is as follows : In support of the U.N. Resolution 1973 , the United States is offering its military services temporarily to the ` coalition ' in order to protect Libyan citizens from government abuses at the hands of Gaddafi as stated in the resolution . The Libyan people should have the ability to make the choice on whether or not they want a Gaddafi government . Gaddafi 's military has prevented them from having this option . That is the purpose of the mission , to allow citizens to exercise their human rights to decide their government . The U.S. policy , however , is in regard to the dictator itself because simply you can not call a mission a success without solving the problem . Gaddafi is the problem . Planes and guns did not fire themselves upon the Libyan people , Gaddafi did . In order to make sure that such a crisis does not happen again , Gaddafi will have to be removed from power . This can be done by allowing the Libyan people to hunt him down and decide his fate -LRB- believe me , they deserve at least this much -RRB- . This can also be done by economic sanctions , international arrest warrants , account freezes , etc. and does not require military intervention . This is n't the U.S. vs. Gaddafi , it is the world saying we have had enough and together we are enacting Resolution 1973 . America is just a team player , not a leader . March 21 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | Carol from South Plainfield , NJ I would like to tell those Congressmen to get over themselves . The United States is assisting in the preservation of life for those countless Libyans that Ghadhafi has no compunction about annihilating . We are assisting others from the UN in creating a no-fly zone and stopping the Libyan military and mercenaries from destroying innocent lives . I do n't believe we will put a single American military foot on the ground , I think we are doing the right thing with the no-fly . March 21 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | The initial reason for the no fly zone is to stop any Libyan offensive against their citizens . Now we hear that we may want `` regime change '' and the complete ouster of Gadhafi . Right now , we do need more clarification ... yesterday Obama said `` No ground troops '' but if we really want regime change , can we avoid it ? Why is it in our best interest to go into ANOTHER war while we have two others currently ongoing ? The biggest problem Obama faces now , is the same one that Bush faced in Iraq ... what does `` winning '' look like ? An address to the American people is needed , clarify to the citizens and to congress what we are doing . March 21 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | I blieve our role in libya is soften up the Gaddafi military machine enough so that the rebel forces are able to take over the government . Gaddafi will likely be executed in the process , Whether that happens as a casualty of the US assault , or those of our allies , or capture by the Libyan people and subsequent trial is largely irrelevant . Freedom for Libya is the bbjective and Gadaffi the person has no price on his head for America any more . March 21 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | My understanding of America 's role in Libya is what I believe the President wants it to be : subject to his personal interpretation of the UN resolution . March 21 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | John Boehner and I 'm sure others in congress are butthurt because they were left in the dark . I commend Obama in his decision to disable Muammar Gaddafi . This also shows the rest of the world such as Iran and North Korea what could happen if they do n't keep in line . It 's about time we fought a war using our high tech capabilities . March 21 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | My understanding of our involvement in Libya is to be part of an international gang trying to hijack Mr. Kadaffy and get him out of power under the guise of `` helping the people '' . To be sure , this is an oversimplification and may be offensive to some , but is n't that what we are really doing ? The biggest trouble I see at that -LRB- 1 -RRB- Obama is hijacking the Constitutional provisions of our government by going over Congress ' heads and unilaterally making his own decision to enter this war -- and it IS a war . When you bomb a foreign territory , it is WAR ! His lack of knowledge of how the real world work and his inexperience in governing is coming home to roost on those who thought that hope-y , change-y thing was going to happen under his leadership . I am with those who would impeach this man for sprouting into a dictator himself . I am a WWII daughter of 73 y\\/o so have been around the political block a few times . March 21 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | Gadhafi vowed to eradicate all men , women and children not loyal to him . The only way to protect the Libyan people is to eradicate Gadhafi . March 21 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | Humanitarian , I pray . However , that is probably wishful thinking . Either way , it is not going to achieve anything for its people or the U.S. if we and the supportive allies play more politics the likes of Iraq and Afghanistan . Gadhafi is the problem of Libya . He must be ousted or killed before escalation occurs . We can not proceed halfheartedly or without the open resolve of ridding the world of Gadhafi ... and son . He is a narcissistic sociopath that can neither be tolerated or trusted . To not make him a target is to betray any valid purpose or intent to justify our being there . Our presence , along with others , in Libya , must be first and foremost to rid its people of Gadhafi . Obama and the Congress must tell the world this and do it swiftly and precisely . Where have the republicans been hiding Jack ? I 'm certain that they all know that the US 's role and stratagy in Libya is precicely the same as it is in Iraq and Afghanistan . Maybe someday they will tell the American people what that is . March 21 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | It 's pretty clear to me that the US & Canada have joined other nations who agreed to enforce the security council ruling . The difference is that your not really attacking another country , you 're wearing your world police hat . We did n't get much consultation here in Canada either . And these enforcements can go on for years . Often with the US footing a bulk of the bill . It is dis-ingeniousness for Republicans to criticize the US involvement in Libya when they rushed us off to war in Iraq with no road-map of what we were doing there or how to get out . That was a systematic takeover of the country . In addition , this is not Iraqi deja vu either . This action is more akin to NATO 's past involvement in Serbia 's repression and genocide of its own citizens . We should have let it play out with no US intervention . We need to demonstrate that important world problems can be solved without us in a leadership role . The Arab states should be able to handle it , and if not alone then with European help . We are overextended as it is . No one believes the limp explanation re human rights . Since when have we been concerned with human rights ? Not in Dafur , not the Congo , not the Ivory Coast , not Syria , and certaionly not Zimbabwe , where people were better off when it was Rhodesia . No we should have sat it out . Now we must ready ourselves for Libyan terrorist retaliation . Ask James Baker , ask Zbig . Ask Colin , `` I got us into Iraq because Bush ordered me '' Powell . Now that he is independent he can speak his mind . March 21 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | Jack , I 'm proud of President Obama 's decisiveness . Has it been that long ago that we watched while innocent people were being killed for no good reason ? We need to help these people before more blood is shed . Seems to me that too many of us are only concerned about ourselves these days . Those complaining will never be satisfied so lets do the decent thing . March 21 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | We created a war of attrition between two groups , we sell arms to both sides , they will kill each other for years , and we make sure neither side wins , we steal their oil . Win win situation for the elites . A classical scenario , written and orchestrated by CIA March 21 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | Probably the best allegory would be our involvement in the Balkans in the 1990s . We were there to protect a group of people from being attacked and wiped out . Most of the action was in the air , with a wide ranging coalition . We lost 1 soldier during that campaign - to an accident . The President says we 'll soon take a back seat . Difference between him and the last President is that I believe that 's what will happen . No expectation of `` flowers on the tanks here . '' Not like Iraq - where it was a war of opportunity with a coalition consisting of Britain , humanitarian aid from other major countries , and combat troops from every third-world country in eastern Europe . We 've lost thousands of soldiers there . Republicans have demanded action for the last week , and now they 're skirts are all blown up because he did something ? Seems like being informed by Congress was no big deal when `` their man '' was in the White House . March 21 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | Mr Boehner , others need to make up their minds ! First the President was n't acting quick enough , now he 's doing what he can with minimum involvement and you want to impeach him ? He is not the first president to help out in these situations . Should he let all these men , women and kids get slaughtered because you feel the way you do ? I hope you do n't ever get in a situation where you need help , of any kind , and nobodys there for you . If you have questions about the Rebels , go to Libya , find out for yourselves if you are really that concerned . Congress spoke with the President and knew what he was doing . They 've had a month , heard what was being considered and NOW wants to act concerned that it 's the wrong thing to do !!!! No wonder the government ca n't get anything done . They 're too busy trying to find fault in what someone is doing . March 21 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | My understanding is that the US is providing a very vital role in warfare that most countries in the UN are unable to provide , and that is command and control of the skies in order to effectively enforce the no fly zone , we are doing what we do best in that respect . They are doing this while allowing other nations to provide ground support when the time is right . It is as it should be , this strategy makes sense , because our economic position does not allow us to fight another full scale war at this time . March 21 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | Like the other presidents before , he did not learn from their misstakes , yes America likes being bitten by the same dog twice , whatever happened with the old saying `` once bitten twice shy ? '' You are not a fool if you do something foolish , only if the folly of it escapes you . March 21 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | I do n't see the confusion that you and the Republicans seem to be having with `` understanding '' . After weeks of UN negotiations and dialog , the mission is nothing more and nothing less than to remove Moammar Gadhafi to prevent continued genocide of civilians . After 8 years of the Great Decider and falsified documentation of WMD , without a single question from Republicans , it strikes me a ludicrous to even ask the question . This is reasonably straight forward and simple . March 21 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | I fully understand and approve Pres Obama 's decision . As the Pres mentioned , the only reason they took the lead was because of the technologies the US possess . The INTL community can not just stand by . Also the rebels asked for this as the Arab League . Of course the Arab League is in a bit of a twine , because some have problems in their country . If the peoplein Wisconsin went to the streets with guns , tanks and planes what would our government officials do . Jjust how would we tolerate Libya , France and Great Britian getting involved in our internal affairs . March 21 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | As far as I 'm concerned , our goals in Libya are about as vague as our goals in Vietnam were . We have been electing these morons for years who will put our troops in harms way without a practical reason . We need to put an end to it now . March 21 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | Jack , most of us can read and comprehend simple english , but U.N. resolutions are seldom simple . Take all necessary action to protect civilian casualties seems a worthless statement when it 's armed civilians that are raising a rebellion . In the end , I ca n't see where the U.S. or the U.N. has the moral or legal authority to determine who should rule in Libya . I also fail to see how our bombing air defense sites in Libya meets the U.N. criteria unless Libyan forces are using them to shoot at the protesters . -LRB- Which there have no reports of as yet -RRB- . This seems nothing more than a method to replace one leader the U.S. does n't like with someone that may be more pliable to U.S. interests . -LRB- i.e. selling us their oil ! -RRB- March 21 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | The people of Lybia want the coalitions help in destroying the Charlie Sheen of Lybia . Gadahfy is insane , out of control and appears to be on drugs himself . The innocent people are being killed and terrorized because they want the freedom that we all want . The freedom to speak and live without the fear of death . Stay until the job is done . Do not get out until !!!!!! March 21 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | From my understanding we are offering Air and Naval support to a group of people that attempted a predominantly peaceful uprising , were met with aggression , and then responded in kind . I do n't think we should commit large ground forces , but we do need to demonstrate that if you do not listen to the peaceful protest of your people and you meet them with militant aggression , we will support them and attempt to level the playing field for them . March 21 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | My understanding of our involvement is to provide a little cover so the Libyan people can form some sort of representative government ... . . and get rid of yet another madman who treats his people with utter disdain ... ... I would venture to say that if President Obama was a republican , they would be falling all over themselves , trying to out gush each other on the merits of such action . March 21 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | US role is to partition Libya . One half will be Gaddafi 's and the other will be the rebels ' who we will have saved , and be in good relations with . The rebel half will control all the oil in Libya , and they will have to pay us back for our help -- in cheap oil -- and buy lots of weapons from us , UK , and France to protect themsleves from the Gaddafi side . March 21 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | My understanding of our part in the UN 1973 is as follows : # 1 . . We have the necessary missals needed to take out the radar and other items that would cause problems for the pilots and we do not want to share that information with other nations . The President said that we are there doing what we can to help the coalition forces and that within days we will no longer be leading the fight . I think the congress , both Dems & Republicans should not be second guessing the President or questioning our roll in the battle to enforce UN 1973 , but rather listen to his Press conferences and let what he says sink in rather than go around trying to make themselves look better . . We know it is an election year , but we only have one President at a time . March 21 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | President Obama has been very clear to the American people about our role in Libya . He has my trust in our limited participation in protecting the Libyan people . The Republican focus is to lie and criticize everything the current administration does . You have to live under a rock not to have heard President Obama 's explanation of our involvement . March 21 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | There is no `` Mission '' , we 're just leveling the playing field , at the people of Libya 's request . Hopefully it does n't turn into a mission ... In this case we 're just the helpful birds in the sky , keeping a watchful eye on our friends of freedom . But be careful , there is unrest in the nest at home ... I think , with the other conflicts in the Middle East and Afghanistan , our forces might be spread too thin . However , Gadhafi should be dealt with . We may have to take on a more supervisory role in relationship to the forces of all the other countries . At least until our other problems are sorted out . Otherwise we may end up unprotected at home . I kind of like that we try to resolve conflicts and promote peace but we do have limits . March 21 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | What is my understanding of America 's role in the Libya offensive ? To get rid of Col. Gonedaffy and his ilk , once and for all . March 21 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | wow , that was some awful typing by me , but , you get the jist . The left only whines when it is a Republican fighting some injustice . When it is Obama , why , he is the `` ONE '' and , who can question his moral authority to decide right from wrong . Where is the declaration of war or at least a congressional review ? Does the constitution allow for the use of force without at least an intent of congress ? Does the President have the authority to take orders from the United Nations ? Does he only act on their authority ? If the security council told him to invade Lichenstein , whould be bomb in 24 hours ? I guess it was Shrillary whining in his ear that he could no longer take and said , Shrill , go ahead , I ca n't take it , I am out of hee . Use the army as you wish . This ai n't no Bosnia , Shrill . You have no end game . Just kicked the hornet nest . March 21 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | My understanding is that we are there to protect the people , not to kill Gaddafi and his sons . This is a civil war and we need to be fair . This is not new to this region of the world . We can not control the world . It is interesting that there is little knowledge about who the opposition is . It appears a good number of Libyans love their leader and are willing to stand up for him . I pray that the U.S. will not engage in a war that will cause the deaths of thousands of innocents . Obama promised to be different . He needs to remember this . March 21 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | He starts a third war and goes off on vacation . He should be in the war room with the military brass from the Pentagon monitoring this war . But as expected the President is off on vacation like he was when the oil rig blew up in the Gulf . I do n't know if it 's bad timing on his part or stupidy . I think it 's the latter . Here is my question ... We have only four days to be involved in this war , and we are not going to kill Gadhafi even thought he is spewing he will retailiate on anyone involved in this war . Then what the heck are we doing there ??????? March 21 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | Yes I totally understand want the mission is . This mission is to protect the the civilians so they can over throw their regime . It is funny how we do n't talk about how good the President is doing in this crisis by not rushing in like Iraq . John McCain and Joe Lieberman , said he was moving too slow and others are saying he is going to fast , it is a lose lose for the President . March 21 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | This whole Libya things smacks of colonialism . France , the United States , and Britian . Where are the Arab states ? What about Qatar 's four planes ? I want one politican to truthfully explain how come not one Arab nation is involved in this affair . I am deeply disappointed in President Obama . Is he afraid someone will call him chicken ? March 21 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | The US Involvement is led by the UN 's Involvement . This simply is protecting the Libyan civilian 's who are being slaughtered by its dictator . Remember , the US is acting at the behest of the Arab League , the Libyan Council and the Libyan people . This involvement , thanks to the Obama Administration 's has been focused on a limited involvement resulting by creating a `` no-fly zone '' . The President has been very clear that no US troops will be sent to Libya . I do n't understand all of the fuss being generated in Washington . We have heard of the repeated claims that `` this is too little to late '' , and now we are hearing claims that there is no end to our involvement . Why do n't we just give the no fly zone a chance to be completed , rather than constantly being critical . Give the President a break ! March 21 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | It is very simple , they are part of the UN , the UNs role is to fight for humanitarian causes which Libya obviously has an issue with at the moment . A mass genocide has been taking place , and so far people have been doing Squat . This should have been handled a month ago ! Now over 12 000 people have allegedly been killed . The real question is , why have we waited for another Hitler to rise to power ? March 21 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | We are basically the can opener for the world . This is not our fight but we were dragged into it by our close allies . Essentially our role is to evicerate any offensive capabilites the Loyalist have using our multi-billion dollar equipment , then step aside and let our allies take the credit when Kadaffi falls . Correct me if I am wrong but 124 Cruie missles launched the 1st night . 122 from US assets , 2 from British assets , none from French . I do n't know but if you are going to push for war the least you can do is commit more to it . March 21 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | Pres. Obama knows exactly what he is doing . The U.S. needs to stay out of the mix as much as possible right now when it comes to Libya . If we get too involved with the matters of a revolution of another country we can too easily be blamed for all their problems . We all know Gadhafi is n't mentally stable . Obama 's actions are going to put him in the position to help the people of Libya claim checkmate on Gadhafi and finally see the freedom every human being deserves . March 21 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | President Obama is not a kind of president who shout about everything in the open air . He has a better understanding of the world than his fellow congress men and women . These people need to ask Obama how he gets the Arab League support while all Arab countries themselves are in the same kind of trouble . But always what ever the president does , criticism will stay there forever that is the beauty of Washington . March 21 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | We opened the door to let everyone in so that France and Britain etc. can do the heavy lifting while we do air to air refueling and jamming of Khadafy 's communications etc. . What would people be saying if , after world wide demand for action , we stood by and watched as Khadafy massacred the opposition ? What message would that send to the leaders of other Arab countries that are experiencing a revolt ? Damned if you do , damned if you do n't , I suppose . I 'd rather be on the side that stands up against Khadafy than sits on the side . March 21 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | I understand that Gadhafi is a genocidal maniac , and America is protecting the Libyan people from genocide . March 21 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | It is a sad day when the 2 year olds we have in public office would rather see a blood bath in Libya than have their ego 's bruised . In accordance with the UN mandate , we are there to protect the citizens of Libya from a mentally imbalanced leader who would rather see dead citizens rather than anyone who might oppose him . If at the conclusion of the UN mandate , Gadhafi is still the Libyan leader , then the US will take non military actions to try and remove him . If that does not work , I have no doubt Obama will then go to the children in Congress to develop a specifically US response . This is not need right now this minute , we are not at that point yet . March 21 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | What 's to understand ? Qaddafi was using heavy artillery to bomb the Libyan equivalent of the Million Man march ! It does n't surprise me that the GOP is crying foul . I supported the UNSC resolution long before there was one . If Qaddafi was to remain in power , do n't you think he would return to terrorism and violent political oppression . We need that like a hole in the head . The president has the constitutional authority to do so . Everyone of his critics would have done the same thing , and if they did n't , they would n't deserve the job in the first place . When will people stop the partisanship , and recognize our president as doing , at the very least , a decent job ; I 'd go as far as to say , President Obama is doing a great job ! He does n't deserve the constant animosity he 's receiving from the right , and the ill-conceived , dubious political opposition coming from the left . March 21 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | Is there nothing the Pres. can say or do that you can understand . After four days of speeches and press conferences , how is it you still do n't understand nothing . You did not see the people of Lybia protesting after the changes in Egypt . If the Pres. does nothing he should have acted , then when he acted , it was too slow , now that he has acted he should not have acted . People respect the press because you are supposed to be educated and experienced , but all you do is confuse the ignorant masses . Where were the voices of dissent going into Iraq and Afghanistan . March 21 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | Generating a sudden demand for Tomahawk missiles ; - corporate welfare for the military-industrial complex . . March 21 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | The role is very clear , protect civilians . Its been emphasized that there will be no US boots on the soil and that the transition of power will be passed . The fact the president has not made an official statement until today and still its a little unclear to some people is irrelevant since the average american thinks we 're already engaged in a 3rd war and has n't been paying attention . The news keep on asking and speculating what the role of the US military will be if the rebels become offensive , and the role will be to continue to protect civilians . I 'm not sure how many times it needs to said and regurgitated . Also with the comparison to the Iraq no fly zone , I feel this is drastically different . March 21 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | I understand what is going on in Libya from watching CNN . CNN has done a remarkable job at telling the entire story by interviewing the military leaders , the courageous reporters that are witnessing and in the midst of this event , and the innocent civilians that are suffering from their EVIL leader . Obama is trying something new . We will see if it works . I feel sorry for our leader . Damned if they do and damned if they do n't . Where is our national pride ? March 21 , 2011 at 5:32 pm | What we have here is Failure to Listen . Wanting Gadhafi to step down -LRB- `` out '' -RRB- does not directly translate to war . And yet McCain was fully prepared to rock 'n roll early on . I have had no problem understanding what our President 's mission is all about . It is definitely rooted in diplomacy backed by the military in concert with the United Nations as warranted -LRB- no-fly zone -RRB- -- not a unilateral measure . All this frenzy about what is the US going to do to get Gadhafi out . This is how we have gotten into trouble in the past . The US is not the ruler of the world -- not its police force . And as far as the Congress claiming they were not adequately consulted ; the US did not declare WAR . Let 's revisit Reagan & Libya . Lastly , does any reasonable person think the US is going to lay all the cards on the table -- not so much . March 21 , 2011 at 5:32 pm | US role is very clear -- No-fly zone to allow the people of Libya to assert their well -- and provide humanitarian relief . Patience people , patience -- we are only in day 3 . Those who do not understand simply are posturing for elections , to have a spot in the news , and to be different . If one needs to be different at the expense of our national security , one need to examine their priorities . If Libya leader remains in power , the future will be bleak as he will certainly feel invincible and launched a renewed set of threats . We understand , trust the American People understand . March 21 , 2011 at 5:32 pm | President Obama has made very clear statements regarding the US role in the Libyan situation . We are acting with UN approval and joining a team response from both Europe and the Arab League to protect civilians who were being slaughtered . The international community took too long to act , but finally is coming to the rescue of Libyans . We should support this action . March 21 , 2011 at 5:32 pm | Libya was n't going to go back to the way it was before some of their people revolted , so we went to the UN , got some tenative backing to intervene , and are now leveling the playing field for the Libyan resistence . Perhaps more of their military leaders will defect to the resistence like they did in Yemen . They 'd only risk doing so if they had a better chance of winning . That was n't going to happen against Qaddafi 's formerly superior forces . March 21 , 2011 at 5:32 pm | To me the role of US is to sacrifice again to help the kind of the people who are so forgetful and soon chant against USA and burn the flag ! Having said that I still support the president 's decision specially knowing this fact that the mad man would level the opposition cities to ground as soon as he gets there and by opposition I refer to very ordinary people who demand nothing but a sliver of the freedom that is so basic to us we do n't even appreciate . Coming from Middle East myself , I can very well relate to them . And for those who say US should step away and let the opposition take over on their own I refer them to the happy and grateful reactions of the people of Benghazi who were hopelessly waiting for Qaddafi forces to conquer the city and introduce them to their dark destiny . Why do some of us say we should n't have stopped the genocide when the direct help is what the poor people themselves demand ? March 21 , 2011 at 5:32 pm | Our role could not be more obvious nor , for that matter , more clearly explained by the President . We are involved in a United Nations effort to protect civilians who are extremely vulnerable but who have nonetheless joined together to rid themselves of a long time dictator . If they could vote they would do this differently , but they ca n't vote . This uprising is the only means available to them . We are acting in a supportive role to the UN effort . We have capabilities in the region which are not duplicated by anyone else and we would shamefully remiss were we not to make them available . March 21 , 2011 at 5:33 pm | He has proved once again that his policies do n't defer from Pres. Bush 's We have no business in the Libyan civil war . I do n't think we have the moral authority to judge anybod . How about regime change right here at home . I voted for Obama now I can not wait for him to go . I understand the role of the US , Allies , and the 22 Arab Nations is to protect `` those Lybians '' who are under attack from Kadafi . To all the critic 's who are COMFORTABLY and cowardly sitting and complaining , I can only say to them `` Action speaks louder than words '' I applaud our President 's actions and involvement to protect the rights of the people of Lybia to get rid of Kadafi and choose their own Government . WARS !! what is to understand . now we are in 3 . japan 's nuclear reactors are trashed . We ca n't get straight answers anywhere . People are asked to give and give ... Countries promised to help haiti and renigged on their promise . But we are asked to give . US ranked 22 in the corruption index -LRB- canada was 6th -RRB- . we are paying more taxes so the government can go to war . What about my job ? What about my health ? How about a living wage for me ? The laws are made and the loopholes are found ! The US needs to take care of the US ? How many years since we heard of an honest politician ? Then maybe it needs to be fixed . WAR , like I care . I want to know what is in my water , food and air . And whether I am going to die tomorrow because of some stupid company 's greed . March 21 , 2011 at 5:33 pm | I am just amazed about how selective is America in chosen which country to attack in this Middle East and North African Crisis . For God sake , Iran did the same to its People , Bahrain , Yemen , you name them . But it seems that we select the weaker and who we do n't like . What if Saudi Arabia or France does the same ? March 21 , 2011 at 5:33 pm | America ca n't continue to say we stand with those who are fighting for freedom and democracy and when they ask for our help we do nothing . I think this mission is putting Iran on notice . March 21 , 2011 at 5:33 pm | President Obama did the right thing , with what we knew and what time there was to act . If he had waited for the congress to get their act together , the city of Benghazi would have been leveled already . This was a no-brainer , with the backing from countries all around the globe ! March 21 , 2011 at 5:33 pm | I am under the impression that USA did not initiate the attack on Lybia . I heard President Sarkosy on Saturday ; he sent France 's planes , the first to attack Lybian military vehicles on that day . Most of the United nations members are involved including America . I felt that President Obama had reluctantly agreed to participate on a humanitarian principle , stating that no American troops would be on the Lybian soil . This said , I personally disagree with these attacks . I doubt the rest of the Arab countries approve them . Who knows how they are goint to react . This is grave and regrettable . Nothing in politics happens by accident . All the preamble was a cover to allow the USA to put their exact plan in place and all is going according to that plan . Libya will be seen as a International assisted effort by the White House and Libya will have a new leader and it will not be Gadhafi and the new one will sing praises for the support from the America who will in turn thank the coalition . March 21 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | The US and allied role in Libya is to provide stability to the world markets . The Tsunami in Japan and the impending nuclear issue there is already affecting the markets and the worldwide recovery . If the oil prices are allowed to increase over speculation , the US economic recovery will come to a halt and this can not be allowed . one other thing , we do care about the libyan people being slaughtered and want that to stop too . March 21 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | Where are all the `` death to America '' chants that come out of the Middle East whenever we do anything ? For once , the Arab street is happy with us . Whatever the leaders of the Arab countries say is immaterial , as they are all in trouble internally . It 's funny watching these repressive regimes support the rebellion . March 21 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | First of all this is nothing like Iraq . 1 - George bush took us into a war based upon lies of weapons of mass disctuction . 2 - 1973 says we are there to protect the civilian population . Cadafi has used his military , his police , and his spies to attack civilians . Getting rid of Cadafi , and protecting civilians , is one in the same . If Cadafi stays in power then the population of Libya suffers , he must go . The President did inform the congress that if the UN resolution passed that there would be swift action , as it should be . 2 - We did not lead the attack against Cadafi , the French did . 3 - The military operates under the control of the commander in chief . March 21 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | President Obama acted too slowly up until he acted too fast ? Give him a break here . I personally do not find it hard to understand that the airways above Libya are being controlled so that the Libyan people do not have get killed wholesale . Talking heads are making this far too complicated . March 21 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | It 's very simple . Our role is to inforce resolution 1973 . To allow the Libian people a level planning field to determine their own future . They want their dictaor out and a new government in . The president also said it is `` US policy '' that Gadafi must go ! Is that really a surprise for anyone ?? With all he has done , does anyone really think he should stay ? The Libian people will be able to accomplish this with the resolution being sucessful . But please , it has only been two days why are we talking end game ... it just started ! Do we really think the President or Military leaders should come on programs to outline exactly what they intend to do ?? Let them do the job you elected them to do and just report what HAS happened ... do n't speculate or make the news . March 21 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | I believe the United States role in the Libya offensive is what Barack Obama says , `` protect the Innocent people of Libya '' . How are we doing it ? By air force and and Navy , what ever they can do there going to do it along with the other countries involved with `` Operation Odyssey Dawn '' organized by the U.N. . It is good that the U.S is involved , we look to help seek the peace and democracy in the countries that want it . We have already helped in 6 other Arab countries , why not go on if they let us ? Which is what the oppositional force is wanting , but not just with the U.S but the U.N. . As for taking out Moammar Gadhafi , we shouldnt because its not apart of `` Operation Odyssey Dawn '' , we should let the people of Libya decide that them selves . March 21 , 2011 at 5:35 pm | The US is holding up oil prices at the expense of Libya . The oil supplies are being supported by speculators that are supported by the government , with the event in Japan , oil price were in the processes of retreating into the 80 dollar range . Buy attacking Libya , they are supporting the prices of oil . Libya is an African country , not the middle east countr , the African congress did not support this intervention . The Arab countries and European countries will make gains if they can take the libyan oil off the market and Europe will benifit if they can gain control and sell the oil from Libya . Same as they did in Iraq , all these military actions cost the taxpayer in higher oil prices and more debt ! This may not be about politics but it is about politics . Following the U.N. resolution on Libya puts Pres. Obama in the usual unenvable `` damned if you do and damed if you do n't '' situation . Those not in the decision-making situation can take pot shots . Later they can say nothing if things go right or `` see , I told you '' if a perception arises that the situation has gone awry . In my way of thinking one supports the decisions of those you asked for a decision in the first place , i.e. , the UN and Pres. Obama . No one gets guarantees . March 21 , 2011 at 5:35 pm | Libya is an European problem . Nothing to do with the USA . If there were problems in Mexico or Cuba , would the world expect Europe to come and do something about it ? Are we the policemen of the world ? Can we afford it ? If the UN is so impotent , get rid of it ASAP ! March 21 , 2011 at 5:35 pm | My understanding is that we have the largest military in the world and we love to show it off . I also understand that the president is less interested in civil rights for Americans and much more interested in civil rights of citizens of another nation . There must be a billionaire in the U.S. getting rich from manufacturing bombs . March 21 , 2011 at 5:36 pm | Jack it is just simply a stupide moved from the Obama administration it seem like we hav n't learned from Iraq or we just do n't learn . Let the french deal with it . Dee from New Mexico March 21 , 2011 at 5:36 pm | What is the nature of the Arab League 's opposition to Khadaffi and why are we so willing to jump through their hoop ? Surely there are no great supporters of democracy to be found in the league , and in truth we have seemed more interested in exporting McKinley era capitalism to the 3rd World than in exporting democracy , which as we can all attest can be troublesome . Farrakhan 's comments the other day raised at least one interesting point : What is the nature of the unrest and whose interests does it serve ? March 21 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | I am a staunch conservative and I 'm as eager to help the cause of freedom and liberty as anyone . However , I 'm also a hearty cynic and firmly believe in the law of unintended consequences , which always seems to bite the USA in the butt . We may not like the guy or his policies , but the fact remains , Gadhafi is the sitting ruler of a sovereign state . The UN , with our full cooperation , has set the precedent of assisting an armed mob rebelling against their own government . While I tentatively support these unknown rebels in this case , are nations now to be punished for attempting to defeat armed civilian protesters attempting to overthrow their government ? What happens when this occurs in a nation we DO N'T despise ? How can we protest something we have already supported ? What if it 's one of our allies ? God forbid , what if it 's us ? March 21 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | I am confused as to why everyone is ` confused ' , -- do you people not listen to your own reports ??? Do you not listen to President Obama 's speeches , which you carry -- he has outlined & explained it all thoroughly a ` number ' of times now ? If you ca n't understand it , perhaps you should all play them over & over again until you do . As far as properly informing the Congress , -- he did that too , remember the meeting at the White House ??? What did Congress expect -- that he should refer it to ` them ' to decide , by striking a few ` bi-partisan committees ' , to discuss it until after the next election ??? Get Real ! They ca n't even decide on ` last year 's budget ' . March 21 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | My understanding is that we are going to break the back of Libyan military by bombing their convoys and destroying their CnC capabilities . After that , the Europeans take over the patrolling of Libyan airspace , denying Gadaffi any chance to regroup . In the meantime , we release the frozen $ 30 billion in Libyan assets and let the rebels buy European\\/American weaponry to take Gadaffi out on their own . The end game is Gadaffi and his sons either dead or in autocrat central in Saudi Arabia , a fractious but inward looking Libyan government in power and oil supply resumed . March 21 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | The height of hypocrisy in the West is Libya . No point in stating the obvious -LRB- oil -RRB- but it sure would be nice if there was a little equity and transparency with regards to the West 's policies on the continent of Africa . Anyone remember Ivory Coast , Gabon , Djibouti ... is there interest in helping the good people of these countries achieve the same goals that the Egyptians , Tunisians , and Libyans have ? March 21 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | Your comment is awaiting moderation . The missile attacks on Lybia were : 1 . Iniated and agreed upon by the United Nations Security Council ; 2 . The United States did not act alone . Obama acted as part of a united coalition of allies including Arab nations , England , France , etc. 3 . The air strikes were aimed at military weapon 's sites in Lybia -- not on Kadafi or innocent civilians ; I do believe the United States should not conduct a war by itself !! I feel strongly that participation in a United Nations `` peace-keeping '' response to the subversive indiscriminate violence against innocent civilians and protesters MUST BE ADDRESSED . Seems pretty clear to me . Freeze assets , get a coalition together , sanction the hell of of Libya , diminish Gadahfi 's ability to get the upper hand , and let the opposition rise up while also providing humanitarian aid . Do people not listen at all ?? I really do n't understand the confusion . The President has been very clear on his position from the start . March 21 , 2011 at 5:38 pm | Our strategic role is clear and obvious . To stop the mass killing of civilians . I believe the part about not wanting to remove Kadafi is for press releases . Of course it is to remove Kadafi . Beyond that wise men do not go . First because paraphrasing Eisenhower , Plans do not survive the first day . After that is is dictated by facts on the ground . So Obama can not box himself in by declaring we will do such and such exactly . Even if he could , he should not . It is wise not to telegraph your punches and leave the enemy guessing . My guess is the Republican noise machine knows all this and are just trying to stay relevant . I also expected and have seen that NO FLY means NO HEAVY ARMS . We will destroy all tanks , heavy artillery , etc , in the field . We will destroy all means of antiaircraft . We will destroy Command and Control infrastructure . And I suspect we are doing more than a share of Cyber War as well to screw up his planning and control . All these things must be included if you are to convince Kadafi that the jig is up . March 21 , 2011 at 5:38 pm | We can not afford , no matter the reason , to fire off over 100 Tomahawk missles all in the name of liberty . Although I am siding with the rebels , they have to do this on their own . Our military might has been stretched to the limit and is reaching its breaking point . We need to put an end to these mindless politicians in washington who want to flex our muscles at any sign of trouble . I say at this point that for every single bullet we fire in Libya , the politicians in Washington should take one dollar off of their pay and stop making us pay for something that we had absolutely no say in . March 21 , 2011 at 5:38 pm | U.S. or U.N. should not take the action such as bombing any nation without provocation . The socalled opposition in Libya were never protesting peacefully and how do you deal with armed rebels who went on , attacking , burning and destroying police and army headquarters . They are no more considered harmless civilians when they are armed and destructive . I am not in anyway condoning any tyranic ruler but you should make any bad situation worse for your own selfish interest . The money US is wasting in this offensive action could be used to house millions of homeless Americans . Obama should remember his promise of constructive dialogue with people that we disagree with . March 21 , 2011 at 5:39 pm | I understand and approve of the No-fly zone and missile attacks on military targets . We cant sit back and let a mad man kill his own people because they want human rights . Obama did a great job of waiting for and securing a coalition of many nations . And it is brilliant to hand over command to a coalition commander so as not to seem as the US attacking alone another muslin nation . I only wonder why he did n't have to ask congress for authorization like Bush did before Iraq . March 21 , 2011 at 5:39 pm | My understanding is that France and the UK have been itching for an opportunity to try out their Eurofighter in a live fire training mission . I feel Obama was pressured into this . There is no real goal here , only doing `` something '' for the sake of training . Quite an expensive fireworks show - each of those 120 + tomahawks cost 3.5 mil . March 21 , 2011 at 5:40 pm | We went in Libya for the same reason we should 've gone into Sudan long ago . Is n't it interesting that America is only obsessed with overthrowing dictators in countries that are rich in oil ? March 21 , 2011 at 5:40 pm | Jack this is a civil war , we should let them work out their own problems , who do we think we are , we are not responsible for the world , leave them alone , we should work on diplomacy with the leaders of other countries after they decide who they should be . Japan needs our help , I do n't want my tax dollars going to another Arab country , when they hate us . They want our help tell them to pay us back in oil . March 21 , 2011 at 5:41 pm | The more I watch this play out the more I think Obama is simply trying to prevent the Europeans from making matters worse . The Europeans have made it clear in certain circles that they are terrified of a massive refugee crisis engulfing Europe in general and France in particular . Add to that the fact that Sarkozy made a fool of himself during the Tunisia\\/Egypt affairs and is looking for a way to recover from that and it was almost assured that France and other like-minded European countries were going to act whether the US cared to or not . It s important to remind ourselves that North Africans in Europe are like Latinos in America : A powerful minority . Seeing as how Gadhfi would see an attack from Europe as an attack from America anyways Obama likely concluded that the lesser of two evils was to make sure this silliness played out as best it could . And for that to happen you needed 112 Tomahawk missiles , among other things . March 21 , 2011 at 5:42 pm | Much like Hans Solo -LRB- coalition forces -RRB- clearing the way for a young Luke Skywalker -LRB- Libyan `` rebels '' -RRB- to take the shot that would end the death star , the United States -LRB- along with Coalition forces -RRB- are in Libya to protect those Libyans who wish to live a free and peaceable existence by ensuring that they be allowed to begin a new Libya void of tyranny . If they so desire , it will be the people of Libya which will remove Moammar Gadhafi , not the United States or Coalition forces . We will be there only as an empowering body . I do n't care for Obama 's politics , but I do think this has a very good chance to succeed . It keeps our presence and internal meddling to a minimum -LRB- troops and $ - diplomacy did n't stand a chance -RRB- , and allows the people to rise up and form a government -LRB- that hopefully resembles our Republic -RRB- while protecting them physically all the while they move forward towards that endeavor . March 21 , 2011 at 5:42 pm | The United States and its allies will not commit ground forces to the operation in Libya . The United States seeks to support the rebels and isolate Gadaffi 's support base into a small corridor around Tripoltania . From there , Gadaffi will be unable to fly in any more mercenaries , and will be cut off from his supplies . From there , Gadaffi and his support base will collapse , and the people of Libya will change the government . We will not appoint a leader . That part is up to the people of Libya . Strom in Charleston , South Carolina March 21 , 2011 at 5:43 pm | My understanding is to go in , take out the weapons that could be used to kill the civilians and let the other UN partners take over . But , lets face it . It does n't matter what Obama says , does , does n't say , does n't do , Republicans will highly criticize his every move . This guy ca n't breathe without someone taking a stand on how appalled they are by that behavior . Democrats are not much better . Do n't these politicians know they are so obvious it 's sickening ? Lets get rid of them all and start over again . March 21 , 2011 at 5:43 pm | Our goal is simple , to protect civilians from being killed by their leader whom our President says must go and who we are not authorized to remove . We will succeed in not removing this leader by means of a No-Fly-Zone , which will effectively reduce the leader s ground assets by actively targeting objects that don t fly . To avoid unilateral condemnation of our actions by the Arab world , we will be led in absentia by one of them , so that the others may criticize us for the actions they have authorized . We will know we have successfully achieved our goal , when the leader we have not removed periodically makes statements verifying that he is still in power , that his armored vehicles are no longer capable of flying , and that he has the support of his neighboring nations , who , by the way , unanimously condemn the abominable actions we have taken on our own . March 21 , 2011 at 5:43 pm | It 's not just the NFZ , I guess we were also hoping for a no-drive-zone . The tanks before Zintan and Misrata are destroying the cities , making holes into the civilian buildings , kiling on sight anyone attempting to get out then , with hundreds of snipers on each roof of each house taken from its families . You must continue to help us as long as our new legit authorities ask you to -LRB- which btwm every country out there needs to recognize ASAP -RRB- , please , if only to redeem yourselves from the dark shadow of the happenings in Iraq still hauting you as you come to help us with the accord of the Arab league and the permission of the UN . I have lost so many of my family in Zawia and still do not know what 's become of the rest of the family as I can not contact them yet . There is enough hell with the thousands of armed mercenaries killing about 400 per day everywhere for the past month . Please do n't make this anymore difficult on the Libyan people , it 's bad enough they had to ask for this help , beg for it for a month , long enough for 13 000 of the bravest , youngest to be gone . If the Libyans thinks their allies have crossed a line , they will say it . So far we 're naively trusting the world , but also sending our message of hope for peace with a voice that can not leave anyone indifferent . Gaddafi has to go , worry not about hitting him by accident , we wo n't feel too bad about it . And please arm the freedom fighters , they need to come save the West side of the country turned into a giant prison with executions and tortured and rape being practiced on a regular bases in this blocade . March 21 , 2011 at 5:44 pm | Jack , I 'm confused too . What the president calls `` the U.S. policy on Lybia '' is somewhat different from the UN resolution . The last thing this country needs is another war . These so-called coalition forces are in it for now and we all know it 's gonna end up being an American war . My advise , do n't do it Mr. President . And honestly , these guys in Lybia totally deviated from the model used by their fellow Middle Easterns in Tunisian and Egypt . Those were peaceful movements and this one in Lybia is anything but peaceful . They started this war and now they want us to go fight it for them . They should have copied Egypt and maybe we would n't have gotten to this point . March 21 , 2011 at 5:45 pm | Well once again we 're sticking our nose in where it does not belong , the same things are going on in Yemen , Bahrain and Syria , are we going to do same thing is those countries ? And the reason congress was `` nt told of this is because it was not an announcement of war . that is the only time they need to be notified . And as far as impeachment , HA HA HA , I can only laugh at that threat , by the time they pull that off Obama 's term will be done and we will have another knucklehead in office to deal with . March 21 , 2011 at 5:46 pm | I think the US -LRB- 1 -RRB- is limiting the ability of a hated dictator to kill his opponents `` like rats , house tot house , room to room , '' -LRB- 2 -RRB- has widespread support , even from the Arab League , -LRB- 3 -RRB- has no plans to invade Libya . Whatever any US president does will be bitterly opposed by some groups . In this case I think the incumbent is doing the right thing . With Benghazi about to fall , he had to act quickly . At least Obama does not seem to have lied , as Bush the Younger did to start a war . March 21 , 2011 at 5:46 pm | We 're committed with the French and Britain , with the ok by the Arab League to fulfill the UN resolution of bringing a halt to Ghadaffi 's upcoming slaughter of his people . The guy went on international TV and told the world he would show his own people ` no mercy . ' Are we supposed to pretend that did n't happen ? March 21 , 2011 at 5:46 pm | Our purpose is to help the Libyian people further their aim toward democracy . Without our military actions against Gadhafi 's army , it will never happen . However , this will not mean that once Gadhafi is gone everyone will become law abiding citizens and vote freely . It took the United States over 400 years to achieve the democratic reforms we cherish today . Libiya has a very long , long way to go ... March 21 , 2011 at 5:47 pm | There is NO strategy for the attack on Libya . Gaddafi has gas and vast military resources at his disposal , more than 75,000 troops , planes , rockets , tanks , etc. . He will not leave Libya without trying to destroy everything and kill everyone that opposes him . The coalition forces are shooting at targets when they do n't know what they are aiming at because they lack the intelligence , ask Admiral Mullen . The U.S. has spent hundreds of millions of US Dollars already to waive the sword , without any goal or real commitment that we have agreed to in consensus . Gaddafi has forced Pres. Obama 's hand to act prematurely and without a clear strategy , and the President , unfortunately , has made irrational decisions for appearances sake . March 21 , 2011 at 5:48 pm | Here 's the deal . I 'm a military member , our job is to help uphold the ideals of free nations and prevent crimes against humanity ; that is if we are acting with the UN and NATO forces . I volunteered for service and went to Afghanistan and Iraq with the intent on helping bring down a terrorist network that helped kill thousands of our civilians . Their crimes against humanity itself was enough to make me fight . Oil , land , and power had nothing to do with why I went . Maybe for other people but not me . If Libya 's military is killing civilians let me in first . I will gladly go first . It 's the type of person I am . To me , we 're going because atrocities are being committed . It needs to stop , and it needs to stop right now . God Bless the USA . March 21 , 2011 at 5:48 pm | With the ground swell of middle-eastern youth taking to the streets in protest over lack of basic freedoms , they saw what was achieved in Egypt as possible for their own countries . Fortunately in Egypt , Mubarak did n't turn his military on his own people and their revolution succeeded . Unlike Egypt , Gadhafi is hell bent on holding power and killing anyone who protests against him . His recent successes in quashing the demonstrations and rebels was nearing completion . Without the U.N. -LRB- our -RRB- intervention , it would give license to all the long-term rulers to do the same to their people . Therefore , Obama 's and our allies aim is to send a message to the rest of the Arab world , that we will intercede on behalf of democracy . In the eyes of those middle eastern youth and in the U.S. , the President had waited too -LRB- a necessary step to get the UN to go along -RRB- long to support the Libyan rebellion . This was putting political pressure on him by Republicans and members of his own party . The decision to intervene or not , was weighed , and now the President is firmly focused on the outcome . He pictures pictures a future Libya without Gadhafi just as George Bush saw a future Iraq with Saddam Hussein . The die is cast . Finally , this also sends a big message to Hugo Chavez in Venezuela . March 21 , 2011 at 5:48 pm | Protect the Lybian civilians . Make sure the Gaddafi regime retreats . -LRB- opposition & regime -RRB- I have just found by CNN that U.S. policy is for Gaddafi to go . Thats what I understand . March 21 , 2011 at 5:48 pm | My understanding is that a lot of people agree that Gadhafi is a loose cannon in a country that controls vital resources . His attempts to put down Libya 's uprising against him have given these many nations an excuse , albeit thinly veiled , to remove him from power while claiming to be only there to protect the citizens of Libya . March 21 , 2011 at 5:49 pm | U.S. or U.N. should not take the action such as bombing any nation without provocation . The socalled opposition in Libya were never protesting peacefully and how do you deal with armed rebels who went on , attacking , burning and destroying police and army headquarters . They are no more considered harmless civilians when they are armed and destructive . I am not in anyway condoning any tyranic ruler but we should not make any bad situation worse for our own selfish interest . The money US is wasting in this offensive action could be used to house millions of homeless Americans . Obama should remember his promise of constructive dialogue with people that we disagree with . March 21 , 2011 at 5:49 pm | I would hope we are interested in preventing the Libyan people that are speaking up from being killed ... which is sort of what has been proposed . The old saying `` if you ca n't do something smart , at least do something that 's right '' or as my dad says ... `` do something !! '' March 21 , 2011 at 5:49 pm | Our role stop the killing of innocent civilians , use the resources the other nations did n't have . Now we level the playing field , allow the rest of nations pick up the job . As to the Congress & Speaker saying they do n't understand ... Our President speaks very clear , distinct ENGLISH . He , President Obama was cautious , prudent and willing to consult with members of Congress , his cabinet prior to taking any action . He Listen , then ACTED . Not like the rest -LRB- Palin , Rep. -RRB- who want to strike , shoot and then wonder now what . March 21 , 2011 at 5:50 pm | Jack , political and economic opportunism never seems to cease , anywhere . When one considers the plurality of brutal regimes the US has both partnered with and propped up , it was incumbent upon the US to not act unilaterally in the Libyan case . I fully support your efforts there . They are just , they were pleaded for by the people you are helping and clearly they were needed . My question is how is it possible when there are such gains to be made in the hearts and minds of people the world over , that some in your Congress have the need to shout down the good work done in the name of the suppressed . Those politicians are sheer opportunists and should be seen as such . They have nothing to add to the mix except division . It is high time that one nation on this planet started to act like its ' forefathers wanted it to , that is to truly act in the name democracy and the inevitable freedom that results from it . Acting on behalf of people who can clearly judge the true nature of any intervention is the most important criteria in determining ` national strategic interest ' . March 21 , 2011 at 5:50 pm | Our job ? Drop a few bombs , hopefully take out a crazed weasel of a dictator and then come home . Let the rest of the countries do the heavy lifting for a change . But we went in there to prevent a slaughter . Good job for Pres Obama . Good Job for Our Military Heroes . Good on ya to the Libyan people . We 've cleared the way , now go kick Gadhafi 's butt . March 21 , 2011 at 5:51 pm | My understanding of America 's role in Libya is what ever works for us . There is no clear messages from Wasington or from UN . And where is press confrence of France leader 's . We were told before the strike that France is the leading coalition froce . I understand that we are being lied again by our GOVT . and media is very good job of not doing its job -LRB- remember Iraq war -RRB- . Free pass to Mr. Bush 's policy towards Iraq . March 21 , 2011 at 5:51 pm | Hillary Clinton and Bob Gates are not potted plants . The US is trying to stop Gadhafi fom reasserting control over the country and is trying to provide breathing space for the rebels so that they can regroup and gain control over the whole country . The US would like to not have this seen as a US operation in the same Iraq and Afghanistan are . This makes sense unless you are a Republican politician looking to score political point . March 21 , 2011 at 5:52 pm | My understanding is that the US government is messaging that these strikes are meant to protect innocents from military action by Gadhafi . However , my understanding is also that our government has no concrete plan as to an suitable ending ... nor do they really know who the rebels are that they are assisting . I also understand that there is little agreement with these actions amongst the real countries that should be helping Lybia : Libya 's neighbors . Are these rebels really the people we want having an upper hand in Libya ? No one seems to be asking this question . The U.S. and its allies are trying to prevent Gaddafi from overwhelming and killing off the Libyan opposition . It 's a worthwhile operation . Immediate action was necessary . Kucinich is an idiot who should n't even be in Congress . Lugar knows good and well what this is about - stopping a massacre - but he 's being difficult . If we had waited on Lugar to satisfy his qualms , we 'd be listening to the screams of Gaddafi 's victims in Benghazi . March 21 , 2011 at 5:52 pm | Please support our president and stand united againist this terrorist the Queddafi and his family . CNN stop all the analysis and sending messages to the butcher of Libya that we are not united on this we are united the american are , we are the leaders of the world , lets get rid of him once of all . March 21 , 2011 at 5:52 pm | Our role is to help the rebels in a civil war in Libya . The 2 % of the worlds oil that Libya produces is not the reason we are there . What I really do n't understand is why the Arab League of Nations requested NATO to set up a No Fly zone ! The 22 members of the Arab League spends $ 50.2 Billion a year on their military . They have F-14s , F-15s . F-16s , and F-18s with the best air to air missiles that money can buy . Why do they ask NATO to step in and then complain about the resulting actions ? March 21 , 2011 at 5:52 pm | First it was Iraq oil . We killed hundreds of thousands and razed the country . All lies were tolded . Brits and France wants to control Libya oil . To save the people of Libya is a lie and we are a party to it . UN is always high jacked by first world countries for their sinful activities . Your comment is awaiting moderation . First of all this is nothing like Iraq . 1 - George bush took us into a war based upon lies of weapons of mass disctuction . 2 - 1973 says we are there to protect the civilian population . Gaddafi has used his military , his police , and his spies to attack civilians . Getting rid of Gaddafi , and protecting civilians , is one in the same . If Gaddafi stays in power then the population of Libya suffers , he must go . The President did inform the congress that if the UN resolution passed that there would be swift action , as it should be . 2 - We did not lead the attack against Gaddafi , the French did . 3 - The military operates under the control of the commander in chief . March 21 , 2011 at 5:53 pm | This is the right time for the US and its allies to support the people of North Africa and the Middle Eastern countries for gaining their freedom to choose their future for economic prosperity and education for all men and women . This is our time to help the people in that region to eliminate the rule of feudalism and dictatorship from the whole region . These centuries old suppression of the people in the name of religion is not helping those people to see the lights of their lives with science and technology . It is the responsibility of the West to help them get out of the darkness of brutality and tyranny of their dictatorship so that they can build their better future . They must learn the value of democracy and freedom with good education and science such as Israel to make the country prosperous and strong . They must learn from their neighbor Israel how to build a great nation starting from zero . March 21 , 2011 at 5:56 pm | I believe the United States ' power and supiorority was called out , and tested by an ignorent old man . I 've watched it unfold , and cant help but notice that its mostly about ego 's . That old man 's ego , `` he called on nuclear bombs '' , and Hillary Clintons ego , '' having to defend the United States supiorority '' . I know the United States wants to stop the killing of the libian citizens , but it does seem selective considering the turmoil all over the region . Hello , Bahrain . . March 21 , 2011 at 5:56 pm | Our role in LIbya is to soak up some of those excess tax dollars that might otherwise go to something frivolous , like education or helping the elderly pay for their heating bills . March 21 , 2011 at 5:56 pm | Dover , DE . . This is another sad decision on the part of the American government . If we have personal issues with Gadhafi , we should handle it in a different manner instead of support rebels as a way of retaliation . Here are the problems : 1 . The mission is not defined . What is the definition of victory for this mission or when will it end . We do not have any direct connection with the rebel group . I thought we should have learned enough lessons from Iraq , Afghanistan , and other wars , and learn to better approach issues such as this . If Russia or China -LRB- who are not part of the coalition -RRB- decides to support Gadhafi , where are we headed ? March 21 , 2011 at 5:56 pm | What we understand and what the coalition forces understand are two different things . In addition , each member of the coalition forces ' military have a different objective all together , but one they will not share with other members of the same coalition . There is no doubt that every person that has been around since the 70 's understands that Colonel Gaddafi is one of the most saddistic dictators in the history of the modern world . So , we would like this man 's dictatorship to end . However , Libya is a sovereign nation , and like many other nations that have suffered through the pain , blood shed , or all the other nasty aspects of civil war , Libya has to endure it themselves . Now , the nations of the world can assist our Libyan brothers , just as France assisted the United States , to fight those that oppress them . One thing is for sure : Blood will be spilled , and in some cases , Libyans will raise arms against their Libyan brothers . This because there are supporters of Gaddafi , and of course there are those who oppose him . But the notion that this will be resoved without the shedding of human blood , unfortunately is incorrect . March 21 , 2011 at 5:56 pm | France has influenced the US into this war and now we are stack with another deficit . We did that in Iraq , Afghanistan , and now Libya . Yemen , Qatar , or even Syria . The amount the US is spending in this wars should be use to solve problems of mortgage melt down or pay off some mortgages held by jobless Americans as a goodwill . March 21 , 2011 at 5:57 pm | I believe Pres. Obama wanted nothing to do with this No-Fly business , but he and his European friends realized that it was going to be IMPOSSIBLE without the help of the United States of America . Sure the French made a show by sending a few aircraft over Libya and the Brits fired off a few missiles , but the only nation that has the ability to put the whole package together is the USA . This is perhaps more important than the situation in Libya at this moment . It literally means that Europe is so combat ineffective they can t police anything beyond their own borders . Obama had no choice but to back up his European allies and their oil supply , no matter whether Libya has anything to do with direct US interest . Otherwise , Europe would have been exposed as the empty shell militaries they are March 21 , 2011 at 5:58 pm | The President made it clear . Clear to anyone besides the Right who turn a deaf ear and closed mind when it comes to anything the President does . Just as with health care reform the President could have explained it for a year and they would still be saying they do n't understand it . It was made clear that we are merely there to implement a no fly zone and protect the citizens from attacks by the military . No ground troops just help taking out air defenses and providing logistical support . Translated for the Right `` We 're going to blow up airports and radar and help our allies -LRB- friends -RRB- plan further action . Only the right could be in the dark . Maybe Gov. Walker should n't cut education . It appears the Right is in desperate need of an education from someone other than Fox ... March 21 , 2011 at 5:58 pm | Is there any difference between what Europe did to Asian and African countries in the 19th century and what the US and Europe is doing in the 21st century to Libya , Iraq , and other countaries of Asia and Africa ? Goals are same but the methods are more deadly . Exactly same shameless colonialism and imperialism . No change at all ! March 21 , 2011 at 5:58 pm | The wold needs to be rid of Gaddafi , I am affraid that at this point , all the coalition forces have done is give us hope and help out a little . We really expected a lot more , a lot more quickly . Too many people are still dying in Misrata , Zintan notably today . Tripoli , Zawia and all cities in the West are trapped by Pro-Gaddafi forces , they are going through the worst of things . Of course , we know the world helping us today is probably not parading its armies without any interests expected . But if anything , just the fact they might help erase some of their sins in Iraq makes this worth believing in . Naive , perhaps , it takes a lot of that to uphold principles of freedom and justice at the cost of thousands of lives . Let the Libyans choose , they 've hard earned the right . It 's their risk to take , it 's their people to save . Help them ANYWAY you can , arm them , send them humanitarian aids of all kind , they are in dire need of support , whatever you think you 're doing to help , it 's STILL NOT ENOUGH . March 21 , 2011 at 5:58 pm | Americans are funny and sad all at the same time . You whine `` we 're not the world police '' -- and now that the UN is leading you whine '' why is the UN telling us what to do '' . The US role in Libya is quite clearly laid out , by President Obama , by S of S Clinton , by Resolution 1973 . The leaders of Congress were in the `` loop '' . Was the President supposed to phone each individual member and get their opinion ? I thought the Republicans thought he was dithering and moving too slow ? March 21 , 2011 at 5:59 pm | If the only way of stopping libyan troops , by order of Gaddafi , from continuously trying to eliminate any human resistance to his policies is to take out command and control elements , then this should be supported . Now , since the command is coming directly from the top of the `` command and control '' elements , I do n't understand why media , and others , do not understand that , yes , while Gaddafi is not a target , he may just `` have to go '' . March 21 , 2011 at 5:59 pm | Normally a pacifist , I am in complete support of UN -LRB- and US -RRB- actions . I have been watching CNN a lot due to recent events , and thanks to CNN , feel clear enough . My understanding of US 's role is exactly what Pres. Obama stated today in Chile , that the military actions by the UN -LRB- including the US -RRB- are humanitarian , to protect Libyan civilians , and that US policy -LRB- separate from the military action -RRB- wants Gadhafi gone , and the US has already done much -LRB- non-military -RRB- in that direction . Maybe if Speaker John Boehner watched CNN he would know more about what 's happening . Seriously though , the UN action in Libya is already late , IMO , and getting ` permission ' from Congress would have taken so long to have killed any hope the Libyan peasants had , not to mention their lives . If members of Congress are simply complaining about being ` properly ' INFORMED , then they are disrespecting the president , and undermining his authority in front of the world doing so publicly . Some folks have no manners . If they want to object to the US 's involvement with the UN resolution to take action in Libya , they should pipe down about communication etiquette , and go through the proper channels to object to helping the Libyan people . It 's not just Obama that made these decisions . Did he break any rules ? If not , they are just haters . March 21 , 2011 at 6:00 pm | You have got to be kidding me . The lead republicans were the first spoiling for this fight telling Obama he 's too slow to act . Well Obama set this intervention up through NATO correctly and by definition that process is slow but it is legal . The mission stated by the President is clear as a bell unless you don t want to look or listen . No boots on the ground protect the opposition currently under fire and suppress the Gaddafi forces with airstrikes , make a window for the NATO forces and hand off the progress to NATO command to continue watch until the snake stops moving . We are trying to squeeze Gaddafi forces and sources until he can not move or breath . The Libyan people that are called the opposition need to step up and remove him not us ... The Libyan people have to when this battle and they are the only ones that no friend from foe . Clearly President Obama did not want this fight . The only thing I need from Obama is the exit strategy not how long it s going to take to get Gaddafi . Oh congress they can t even make a budget . Republicans , Independents and Democrats are useless . Aren t they supposed to be making JOBS !!!!!!!!! for the citizens of the United States ? At least Obama is trying to stimulate trade in South America so our companies can sell more products to them and that means we can hire more people to make those products . March 21 , 2011 at 6:01 pm | My understanding of America 's role is that we 're at war . A fighter jet , troops , or support sent , that is our own , which is sent across a border of another nation in order to aid and abet killing someone else , is why many people consider it war . `` Supporting '' killing , is just as bad as killing in my opinion . Cherry picking when you want to call it `` support '' or when you call it `` a nation at war '' is ridiculous . Let 's make it perfectly clear , if an innocent child or women can accidentally be killed by something on the ground OR by something raining down on them from the sky . We , in the civilized world , call this war no matter how you fluff it up . This was an internal civil matter that should have been left to the Libyans in my opinion . It 's not that I 'm unsympathetic . I say this only because there 's no clear guidelines being followed as we tromp around the middle east going from country to country . March 21 , 2011 at 6:01 pm | As I understand it , our role is to support the no-fly zone mission by the U.N. . However , I think most people did n't expect the no-fly zone to mean dropping bombs left and right . My issue is why do we get involved with a humanitarian mission to protect the people of Libya , but have not gotten militarily involved in Congo or Sudan where much more people were being killed ? I know this was n't our initiative , but a U.N. . But is it safe to say the U.N. cares less about African nations ? March 21 , 2011 at 6:02 pm | The US bombs yet another country . . The US needs to stay OUT of Libya March 21 , 2011 at 6:57 pm | CNN has reported that UN forces - that would include US aircraft - did the riads on Libya . Why is this so har dto understand ?

A coalition military official confirmed to CNN that the compound was targeted because it contains capabilities to exercise command and control over Libyan forces . The coalition 's goal is to degrade Gadhafi 's military capabilities . The official , who was not identified because of the sensitivity of the information , insisted that neither Gadhafi nor his residence was the intended target . The leader 's whereabouts were not known . Earlier , Western journalists , including CNN 's Nic Robertson , were brought inside by Libyan officials to survey the destruction . Gallery : Civil war in Libya A four-story building was heavily damaged , possibly by cruise missiles , Robertson reported . Robertson said early Monday that two circular holes in the building may be telltale signs of such missiles , although that could not be immediately confirmed . The building is only 100 yards or so from a statue of a golden fist crushing a model plane emblazoned with `` USA '' -- a monument to the 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya , in which one U.S. plane was downed . Special guests who visit Gadhafi at a nearby large tent are usually housed in the building , reported Robertson , who held a chunk of metal with a label indicating military usage . Video footage showed collapsed columns , pieces of weaponry and chunks of concrete . There were no reported casualties . U.S. officials said they are not targeting the leader , who has defied international calls to stop attacking opposition forces . `` We are not going after Gadhafi , '' U.S. Vice Adm. Bill Gortney said at a Pentagon press briefing . `` Regime forces are more pressed and less free to maneuver . '' Asked about reports of smoke rising from the area of Gadhafi 's palace , Gortney said , `` We are not targeting his residence . '' The United States , detailing significant damage to Gadhafi 's air defenses and a military convoy , also fought a public relations campaign Sunday , insisting that two days of coalition bombing were n't going beyond mandates in the United Nations Security Council resolution . Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warned against widening the current allied operations to include a direct attack on Gadhafi , who earlier Sunday labeled the coalition `` terrorists . '' Anything that goes beyond enforcement of the no-fly zone and prevention of new military attacks on rebels risks disrupting the `` very diverse coalition '' that agreed to the attacks , said Gates , adding there was unanimous agreement in the top echelons of the Obama administration to push forward with military action in Libya . U.S. officials said they plan to hand over operational control of the military mission in coming days . The coalition has nine other announced partners : Belgium , Britain , Canada , Denmark , France , Italy , Norway , Qatar and Spain . Gates said the operation is off to `` a strong and successful start . '' He made the comments while traveling to Russia , which said earlier Sunday that innocent civilians were being killed and urged more caution . The Foreign Ministry in Moscow cited reports that `` nonmilitary '' targets were being bombed , including a cardiac center . A look at coalition 's military hardware Coalition air strike : The first hours `` We have no indication of any civilian casualties , '' Gortney said . A member of the Libyan opposition told CNN that the Gadhafi government collected bodies of people killed in fighting in the past week and displayed them over the weekend , trying to show they were killed by coalition airstrikes . The claim by Ahmed Gebreel , who cited eyewitnesses and medical officials , could not be verified by CNN . The Libyan military on Sunday called an immediate cease-fire after allied forces pounded one of its convoys near Benghazi and , according to U.S. officials , significantly degraded the regime 's air defenses . National Security Adviser Tom Donilon scoffed at the report of the cease-fire , saying , `` It is n't true , or it was immediately violated . '' Meanwhile , President Barack Obama and his national security team worked behind the scenes to shore up support within the Arab world for the military mission in Libya , according to senior administration officials . The senior officials described the Obama team 's phone calls as making clear to the Arab League that bombing Gadhafi 's air defenses falls within the Security Council resolution 's scope of imposing a no-fly zone and taking `` all necessary measures '' to stop the dictator from attacking civilians in his own country . `` We do n't believe this goes beyond the resolution , '' said one senior administration official . The lobbying came after Arab League officials complained earlier Sunday that the bombing by the U.S. military and other allies inside Libya exceeded the scope of merely instituting a no-fly zone . Arab League Secretary-General Amre Moussa told reporters before an emergency meeting Sunday that what is happening in Libya is different from what was intended by imposing a no-fly zone , according to Egypt 's state-run Ahram newspaper . `` What we want is the protection of civilians and not the shelling of more civilians , '' Moussa said , adding that `` military operations may not be needed in order to protect the civilians . '' But Arab League chief of staff Hisham Youssef said Moussa 's comments did not signify a shift by the organization . `` The Arab League position has not changed . We fully support the implementation of a no-fly zone , '' Youssef said . `` Our ultimate aim is to end the bloodshed and achieve the aspirations of the Libyan people . '' On TV news shows in the United States , politicians debated the military campaign 's possible endgame . `` This is a very limited operation that is geared to save lives , and it was specifically targeted on a humanitarian basis , '' Senator John Kerry , D-Massachusetts , told NBC 's `` Meet the Press . '' Senator Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina , and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , said on `` Fox News Sunday '' that this is the `` best chance to get rid of Gadhafi in my life . '' `` If we do n't get rid of him , we will pay a heavy price down the road , '' Graham said . U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen told CNN that Gadhafi forces have shown little ability to counter coalition firepower . Allied aircraft struck a Misrata area airport that has both civilian and military uses , Gortney said . Three B-2 bombers struck only military positions at the airfield , he said . There was violence across the country Sunday , with Gadhafi apparently shelling rebels in the west , while allied airstrikes destroyed one of Gadhafi 's convoys in the east . As of Sunday night local time , the United States and British military had fired a total of 124 Tomahawk missiles at Libya 's air defense sites , Gortney said . Gadhafi had said the strikes were a confrontation between the Libyan people and `` the new Nazis '' and promised `` a long-drawn war . '' `` You have proven to the world that you are not civilized , that you are terrorists -- animals attacking a safe nation that did nothing against you , '' Gadhafi had said in an earlier televised speech . At the same time Gadhafi spoke , his regime was shelling Misrata using tanks , artillery and cannons , a witness said . `` They are destroying the city , '' said the witness , who is not being identified for safety reasons . He said rebels were fighting back . Sounds of heavy gunfire could be heard during a telephone conversation with the man . CNN 's Arwa Damon saw outside Benghazi the remains of a convoy of at least 70 military vehicles destroyed by multiple airstrikes Sunday , leaving at least five charred bodies , plus twisted tanks and smashed trucks as far as she could see . Rebels with Damon told her it was a convoy of Libyan troops loyal to Gadhafi coming to attack Benghazi . Residents of the city , which was reported to be calm late Sunday , believe they can now take the offensive against loyalist troops . CNN 's Nic Robertson , Arwa Damon , Yousif Basil , Charley Keys , Chris Lawrence , Jill Dougherty , Elise Labott , Ed Henry , Larry Shaughnessy , Jim Bittermann , Paula Newton , Richard Roth , Maxim Tkachenko , Niki Cook and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report "}, {"uid": "85", "dct": "2011-03-21", "dates": [null, null], "text": "I interviewed Rashid Khalidi , the Edward Said Professor of Modern Arab Studies at Columbia University , about ten days ago after he spoke with Fareed . But his take on why Egypt and Turkey - two major regional powers - might be reluctant to intervene in Libya is as relevant now as ever . Here s what he had to say : Egypt is a country which has the largest number of foreign citizens working in Libya . They are potential hostages should Gadhafi and his brutal regime perceive Egypt as intervening against his interests . Gadhafi has shown no compunction about taking hostages in the past . I know this is a consideration for Egypt . I ve talked to people who have had input from the Arab League Foreign Ministers meeting and one of the things that was made clear at that meeting was that while Egypt really does support the idea of transition in Libya and wants to play a role , they feel terribly constrained by the fact that they have over a million Egyptians working in Libya ... This is apparently also a problem for Turkey , which is another regional power like Egypt that actually has capabilities . I mean , -LRB- if -RRB- you get the Turkish military or the Egyptian military involved in something in Libya , -LRB- then -RRB- you are actually talking about quite considerable capabilities . But Turkey has a lot of investments and also a lot of people - workers and business people - in Libya . So I think these are constraints on both of them . And in the case of Egypt , the military is running Egypt . The last thing they need is to be charged with running Libya . If Egyptian ground troops go in , I promise you that ll be the next thing - they are going to be stuck there . The final thing for Egypt - and this is a consideration that we have to keep in mind - is that the Egyptians are afraid of Libyan sensitivities . The Libyans have always chafed at the idea of Egypt as an overbearing big brother . They ve always been sensitive to that . Anything that Egypt does has to be weighed in light of that perception , -LRB- and potential -RRB- misinterpretations or overreactions on the part of the Libyans . The opinions expressed are solely those of Rashid Khalidi . The reasons mentioned here are real , but not the most important ones . The most important reason is the understanding by those two leading countries in the region the deep resentment that the population have over Western meddling . And this time , it is no exception . UN Resolution authorizing no fly zone and the use of all means necessary to protect the population , has been in no time flat `` interpreted '' into full scale agression . Indiscriminate targeting of civilian infrastructure , from roads to hospitals , electric and sewer plants , are telling much about the nature of this campaign , that was supposed to `` protect the population '' . The countries that ABSTAINED did so in GOOD FAITH , that is , the respect of the resolutions 's goal - the protection of innocent population . The criticism is mounting from all sides on the nature of bombing , the use of cruise missiles on population centers , and the mounting civilian casualties . Egypt and Turkey both are in the same situation : they are heavily dependent on the public opinion . And at present , the public opinion is heaving tilted against any Western intervention . In no time , the mission approved by UN SC , descended from its objectives into full-fledged attack on Libya . So , instead of enforcing no-fly zone , arms embargo , and humanitarian aid delivery , the first acts were to target all forms of infrastructure - both military and civilian , followed by the supply of arms to the rebels . Humanitarian assistance , under the conditions of continued coordinated missile and aereal bombardment , has been rendered impossible . Clearly , the civilian population in Gadhafi controlled areas are treated as military , as no protection is afforded them , and whatever they had in reserves has been bombed out . The zeal shown here by the trio , US , UK and France , surely compares unfavorably with the lack of attention to the nuclear power plants in Japan spewing radioactive particle clouds all the way to US . Let us talk about Libya , by all means . So we can not talk about our kids being blanketed by radioactive fallout . All the soothsaying by officials only causes higher alarm , as their statements reflect calculated ignorance - something a sharp third grader can spot . They talk about sea water being better at diluting the radioactivity , or funnier yet , how we are in no danger from RADIATION ! As if we are so ignorant ! By all means , we are not worried about radiation , but we are about radioactive MATTER in clouds of radioactive debris , blanketing our country with particles of cesium and plutonium . And everything we touch , inhale or eat , will carry these particles into our bodies . This is the danger to our health , while our leaders fiddle over Libya , like Nero fiddling while Rome was burning . March 21 , 2011 at 2:27 pm | Reply I agree with Bianca . I believe that original article was written to misguide public in a subtle way . Turkish and Egyptians have done the wise thing not to associate with western pro Israel powers . The bombing clearly showed that the purpose was more than just halting Qaddafi . The facilities being damaged belong to Libyan people and not Qaddafi . Ultimate billions of dollars will go back to western countries to rebuild them . I agree that Turkey is in a position to help and they must . Turkish president needs to fly to Tripoli with some of heads of the Muslim state under Organization of Islamic Countries . They need to meet both Qaddafi and Opposition in Benghazi and work out a deal . March 21 , 2011 at 3:46 pm | Reply This Libyan civil unrest is going now and three weeks , why during this time these two Islamic countries have not done anything to stop the fighting , and specially after Qaddafi got the upper hand and threatened to crash his enemies ? March 21 , 2011 at 4:08 pm | Specifically what facilities are you suggesting should not have been bombed ? March 21 , 2011 at 4:21 pm | The Arabs have not intervened in Libya because they are all busy at home with unrest . Saudi Arabia is busy with self preservation of Sunni rule in Bahrain . Anything other than self-preservation is really not of much importance to this Saudi and Sunni royal family . They have to protect their playground -LRB- Bahrain -RRB- so that they can dodge the religious police back home in Saudi Arabia when they get in the party mood . March 21 , 2011 at 4:33 pm | Shah , Turkey is not a trusted actor for reasons I discuss below . In addition to those reasons Turkeys industrial is heavily tied to Qaddafi 's corrupt and repressive regime March 21 , 2011 at 4:34 pm | Being pro western and pro-Israel has nothing whatsoever to do with Libya 's murdering thousands of protesters , nor does it have anything to do with Yemen , Syria , and Bahrain murdering their citizens too . Enough already about Israel ! Israel is not the country bombing and killing innocent civilians in Syria , Yemen , Libya , and Bahrain . It is these Arab governments -LRB- that hate Israel , by the way -RRB- that are murdering their own people for no reason . Do you really believe the Arab world would be any freer if there was no Israel ? Stop using Israel as an excuse for the dictators and madmen of the Arab world . March 21 , 2011 at 4:49 pm | March 21 , 2011 at 8:01 pm | The simple truth is that no one knows what to believe from a country where a `` dictator '' has full control over the state media . Some have actually been buying into his propaganda from the first day of the democratic protests which quickly turned into a civil was because Gadhafi was quick to change to game from democratic protests to civil war by firing on the demonstrators then creating a false narrative out of thin air about western and Al-Quada intervention . When you start believing in `` dictator '' media sources you begin to lose objectivity in favor of emotion , misinterpretations , overreactions and flat out lies . March 21 , 2011 at 4:08 pm | Reply Using the same token , you are discarding any information coming from Libyan sources . The objectivity is not the aim of western news resources either . The news food we are being served is to help justify the action taken -- or to be taken -- by the west . This goes back to Gadhafi 's strategy , same strategy . What happens , in the end , is that we believe what we want to believe . March 22 , 2011 at 10:33 am | The Arab League is a precarious bunch of manure perched on a fence and likely to fall on either side . The western governments were foolish to seek the blessing of this group in order to act on stopping Gadhafi . The Arab League is not trusted by even the Arabs . Many of the men who make up this body are themselves sitting within governments who are being protested by their populaces . No legitimacy is to be had among the coalition of western countries by accepting approval from this body which would predictably be rescinded within days . The Arab League was fully knowledgeable about the United Nations wording and should get out of the game of diplomacy if they are going to straddle the fence on any given day . March 21 , 2011 at 4:15 pm | Reply Right on Cindy . You might add that the `` western '' powers have again been seduced into a charade which wil ultimately be used by ALL Arabs , sunni , shia , whatever , as an attack on Islam . We need to liquidate every president and the boards of directors of every western oil company . This would ensure that inappropriate pressure was removed from the political scene . The Moslem lack of enthusaism for this thing reveaals the ultimate goal of the uprisings . Islamists are behind the entire project . A very dire future awaits us . March 21 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | Maybe the Arab League approval provided the necessary cover to finally act . Once action was taken , there is no such thing as the Arab Leaque saying `` well we really did n't mean it '' , or some variation on that theme . What I am personally a little surprised about is Great Britain . After release of the Lockerbie bomber on `` humanitarian grounds '' -LRB- how in the hell does that even come into consideration given the mass murders this guy committed ? -RRB- , which I am convinced was done to assist BP and for no other reason , it looks like BP does n't matter . Or , perhaps it really is a long term gambit on the part of BP , with the thinking being that Libya is going to be a mess anyway , getting rid of Gadhafi -LRB- whether he leaves , the opposition kills him , or a cruise missle manages to find him is irrelevant to the equation -RRB- , and BP is still in a prime position to make the most of the rebuilding while working with whoever turns out to be in control -LRB- and you just know that whoever does run Libya is going to seek to capitalize on the oil , just as Gadhafi has done -- so why not be in the best position possible when that happens ? -RRB- . March 22 , 2011 at 5:32 pm | I am from Lebanon and I strongly disagree with Shah below . Turkey is not exactly a trusted actor by the region 's residents . Turkey is actually in violation of more UN resolutions than any other country , there is the open question of its brutal repression of the Kurds . Its own military though bloated and having undue and unhealthy political influence and interests , is untested in battle with the exception of killing huge numbers of civilians . And the tactical `` bombing '' is part and parcel of a no-fly zone . No one in Egypt , Libya or Turkey was complaining when Yugoslav was bombed during its civil war to create no-fly zones . In terms of Bianca above , not much US intervention is needed in Japan . The US sent a bunch of ships to help with logistics , but the real need arising form the earthquake in Japan is addressing nuclear safety long term . All energy has hidden costs and dangers . Every mine disaster , oil spill and nuclear accident points to the same issue of which the entire world shares a responsibility . . March 21 , 2011 at 4:27 pm | Reply You must have some beef with Turks ... `` Turkish Army is untested in battle '' ... Give me a brake ... They have the strongest Army , Navy and Airforce in all muslim countries and they are very well trained . remember , they ruled you for centuries ... Stop you biased comments and do some resarch ... March 21 , 2011 at 4:55 pm | Ali , where are you getting your facts from ? Obviously you do not know what you are talking about . Turkey has been fighting against terrorism on its southeast border and is right to do so . The World has been acknowledging this for so long and you are the one who is considering Turkey doing wrong ? As far as Yugoslavia goes , back in 80s Turkey has intervened as part of NATO , and helped those innocent civilians get out of the killings . Turkey has been the only democratic power in the region and will remain to be . Turkey has halted the NATO 's intervention to Libya . Otherwise , NATO would have been acted even before the coalition forces . Ali , you must have some sort of hatred against Turks . Could it be because they ruled your so called country for centuries ? I am sorry for Lebanon . We do n't even know whom it belongs to ? March 21 , 2011 at 5:13 pm | The most important job of the Turkish military has been keeping an Islamic state at bay and keeping secular governments intact within Turkey . With the current president Erdogan , Islam is aggressively trying to get its foot in the government doors . The recent spate with Israel concerning the humanitarian aid being sent to Gaza and the Israeli intervention of that flotilla was candy for the Turkish Islamists that Erdogan played up to its full potential and spread around with populist zeal . It brought Turkish and Israeli communication to a near stand still and was political low hanging fruit for Erdogan to squeeze to its and his ultimate benefit . March 21 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | I have to at least partially agree with Ali ; Turkey did make news not all that long ago when their army entered into Iraq while the US Allied forces were working other regions in the name of suppressing Kurd incursions into their own country . These same Kurds were the ones Saddam Hussein gassed almost 20 years ago and attempted to exterminate . Yes , Turkey does have some of the greatest warriors in the area , but they are just as self-important as everybody else . If Turkey is holding back on Libya now , you really do have to wonder why . March 21 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | `` brutal repression of Kurds '' Kurds are free citizens in Turkey WTF are you talking about ? ignorant google scholar March 21 , 2011 at 8:04 pm | Gok , Turkey is an evil country itself . Turkey killed more than 1.5 Armenians during WWI . Turkey burned more than 5000 Kurdish villages and forced these villagers to live in awful conditions in major cities . Turkey killed more than 18000 Kurds in so called suspicious killings . The police brutality and torture against Kurds is well known . Kurdish identity is still not accepted as the state and government are in full force oppressing and assimilating Kurds . Kurdish language was banned for years and currently not accepted as a minority language . Turkey is not as innocent as you think it is . May be that 's bothering you . March 21 , 2011 at 10:10 pm | dear mike thomson , you are talking about killed kurdish and armenian people by giving numbers but you are n't talking about killed turkish people . And , do n't forget that those people armenian , kurdish and turkish they all were the citizens of the turkey . A I do n't think you are doing by purpose , i guess you are just too illiterate to know about this subject . By the way , turkish government had the March 22 , 2011 at 4:57 am | @Kyle : What a crap - what a zionist crap . There are four political units in Turkey : Laicist represented by CHP , Nationalists represented by MHP , Kurds -LRB- mis -RRB- represented by BDP and finally the conservative democrats represented by AKP , which is in power . The fact that the biggest accomplishment of Turkish military being the ousting of many freely elected governments in favor of oppressive laicist regime is the only truth in your words . Mr. Erdogan and his supporters are working on the clock to put Turkish military where it belongs as governing and lawmaking should be performed by democratically elected governments . Laicists are the second big power in Turkey and they are against Democracy . They want an oppressive regime quite similar in nature , indeed , to that of Gadhafi 's Iran 's or Saudis . Mr. Erdogan , on the other hand , openly states his belief in democracy along with his personal spirituality . There are many un-religious pupil in the AK Party organization . Laicists ' defense of military coups in Turkey is that the administration has a `` hidden agenda '' of establishing an islamic state ! Yeah , my a $ $ ! March 22 , 2011 at 10:59 am | Thanks Ali for the pro-Kurdish point of view which was the most needed at times when half of the world intervenes a major oil-site . In order to shred light on the topic , Turkey has two major concerns none of which are any relevant with the public opinion of Turkey , where neither Bianca nor the author were correct : i. the idea of watching someone bombing your marketplace at which you already have the multi-billion dollar trade volume and 10b $ prospect -- ii . the idea of giving away the command , thus , the initiative to a rivaling nation in the name of France . Comparing Egypt and Turkey on any scale gives you a very poor decision making ; the moment Egypt plays the sovereignty game over the territories apparently and legitimately theirs , let alone on the others , they will end up being worse than Iraq , dealing with unspeakable chaos and terror in no time , and which we suspect , of the Arabic named but internationally originated ones such as Al-Qaida and any others . As for Turks , however , the invention of pro-US Kurdistan offers them other opportunities such as dealing with the matters of the immediate neighborhood , which , at this point , might be ill-interpreted as new-Ottoman sphere of influence . Nevertheless , with the help of such multi-national military exercises , thus grounds to place your objections and risk to be -LRB- left -RRB- alone , in one way or another , the world is going for getting divided into two , then three or four , and none of the sides would like any each other . Instead of questioning the apathy of Egypt , Turkey or Germany , you should , in my humble opinion , probably question the quick decisions and readily willingness of several nations -- France and UK , who are renewing their naval and air forces despite the economic crisis , almost setting up themselves for a war-preparedness against an overly incapacitated enemy , Libya , a major oil site otherwise a poor and small nation , and quite unable to defend herself on any platform . Perhaps France and UK knows more about the immediate future , having things `` a century old '' on their minds . Best regardsl March 23 , 2011 at 6:31 pm | I have to disagree on at least one point . First off , you 're attributing real political posturing on a country that has only just resolved it 's own revolution and barely has any real government of its own . As a result , Egypt , in particular , would be foolish to attempt to project any power that could result in additional internal upheaval . The author of the article is right that Egypt essentially dares not make any moves that could risk their own defensive capabilities . At the moment , one wrong move by the Egyptians either for or against Libya could trigger a different kind of revolution entirely . March 21 , 2011 at 6:02 pm | Reply Re : `` Turkey killed more than 1.5 Armenians during WWI . '' -- Excuse me , you do love getting to off topic , but I should remind you that no one in Turkey , including my own grand-pa has any memory of killing shooting mass-destroying or even running campaigns over Armenians , who had been the prime scholars of our own nation . If it is how come we still have Armenian surnames commonly around in Turkey . Please stay in-topic , leave the off-topic discussion as well as your understandable hatred to your illegitimate terrorist organizations that are being dealt with -LRB- the organization called PKK had to change names and owners 3 times as we know of , so whomever is behind the Muppet-show does n't matter , what matters is they are snuggled weaponry , mines , allowed to run a drug-chain and in return they have the ROI upon investment on blood -RRB- . Best regards ; March 23 , 2011 at 6:41 pm | I for one am thankful that intl. powers , both the West and UAE + Qatar are intervening , Egypt and Turkey still have many people on the ground therefore their hesitation is understandable . Remember the Arab League and Organization of Islamic Conference are supporting the Libyan people and did not want to see Gaddafi crush his own people . Gaddafi has lost all legitimacy when he decided his arrogance and pride are more important than the Libyan people and nation . Let 's get the record straight , Gaddafi is targeting unarmed and armed civilians while the coalition is targeting his military forces . If anything more Muslim nations should come on board and support a political solution , either through the use of military or non-military means . March 22 , 2011 at 11:10 am | Reply Sorry to burst your profound bubble but it really is that simple . I can only speak for the Turkish situation ; but Turkey has over 15 billion dollars in contracts at Libya for construction alone , not to mention the tens of thousands of guest workers many of whom have lived in Libya for the better part of their lives . If one were to be a cynic , it can be argued that the guest workers aside ; merely the amount of investment and future contract payments from Libya alone would motivate the Turkish government -LRB- rightly so of course -RRB- to be very concerned about any prolonged military action in Libya . March 22 , 2011 at 3:47 pm | Reply I do n't know where Bianca is getting her information on the `` wholesale '' targeting of civilians . It is not on Al Jezeera , BBC , or any other source . Reporters in Tripoli are waiting to see evidence of the Libyan government reported claims of civilian casualties and are n't seeing them . So Bianca tell us -- where are you getting your `` facts '' from , or are n't real facts necessary because they get in the way of your point ? March 22 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Reply That 's very true . . I 'm Egyptian & I feel the same . . If the military wasnt running the country now I would support any military action from Egypt ... but I would understand also if they do n't react ... however we have been silently giving weapons to the easter rebels . . Nah , you and Tunisia have your own challenges at the present . And it 's important that your own governments are rebuilt , in a way that will be reflective of what it is you actually want , moving ahead . Revolution is the easy part ; building to the future , that 's the part which is hard . It always takes more time to build to the future , then it takes to topple a dictator . And in this , I wish you and your country the best of luck . Once this is secured , there will be more time and ability to act in these matters , reflective of what it is your own countrymen would like to see . But there is work needed on the home front right about now . Now it is true , that for those of us in the west , having an Arab presense helps prevent this from being turned into a Gadhafi PR pitch , trying to turn this into a `` us vs the West '' pitch , such as with Gadhafi 's many deranged speeches of `` Allah 's on my side , the devil 's on yours ... '' even after giving a speech insisting there will be no mercy and no compassion for those who fight against him , etc. . But we 'll deal with it as we must . Just hopefully something materialises , which will help expose Gadhafi 's nonsense for what it is , and wo n't serve to offer credence to his propaganda here . And I wish some would stop bringing up the oil in the media as well . I could n't give a flying f - about the oil right about now . There 's other deposits in the world . Some matters really should be tabled and given a back seat until more pressing matters are met . Once the people have a country and a future , some matters can be negotiated then ; and in a way where they 'll have the money to help build themselves up . Now is just not the time , and it is n't the time where it 's even important . It should be left for the day after , not the pressing consideation that 's on people 's minds today , where people ca n't even be safe from being rounded up and shot , right in their own homes ...

Who are you , in the comfort of your own air-conditioned living room watching mind-numbing television when the man you corrected may well have been one of those in the Square getting shot at just two months ago ?

The whole region is in turmoil , and all you can do is say , `` We 're better than you . We know what you 're going through .

Or the fact that the Arab nations who do support it wo n't do it publicly and all the negative press is directed at the UN -LRB- mainly the British , French , and Americans -RRB- for doing what the world kept asking them to do . March 21 , 2011 at 3:06 pm | Reply It is no surprise that The Arab League wants to have their cake and eat it too . Or that they would buy into the state run propaganda machine running from Gadhafi 's bedroom . Now that they have bought into Gadhafi 's narrative of civilians being killed , they want no part of Arabs killing Arabs . Even Al-Jazeera is more believable than the Gadhafi mouthpiece media . The should cusp their ears when Gadhafi talks . He keeps spinning and spinning and spinning the story into it has finally spun out of control . His fake cease-fire should be a good indication of his lies . March 21 , 2011 at 4:28 pm | Reply Then Britian , France and America should wise up and walk away or tell the Arab League to put their request in writting . If they are not willing . March 22 , 2011 at 10:12 am | Reply This is great that France , British & US and UN decided to go ahead with the no-fly zone and take actiion , if they had not taken that action when they did , it might have been too late , at least for Bengazi . When this is all said and done , the people of the Arab world and in particular , the Muslims , should not forget that this help was asked by the people of Libia , US did NOT go and interfer . They must not forget this fact . March 21 , 2011 at 3:40 pm | Reply They wo n't forget , they just wo n't care . Do n't forget that being an american is all but illegal is most muslim countries March 21 , 2011 at 4:10 pm | Reply In every country , there are always bunch of people hating the government . The people -LRB- \\* Libya people -RRB- asked for helps are the rebels , not the majority of the country . Just like the guy from Iraq showed the world how much weapons of mass destruction the Iraq government -LRB- Hussein -RRB- has and now confessed that he lied to satisfy his personal goal , did n't care thousands of american soldiers dies , ten of thousands disabled , and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians died . If you go to America and ask if any one think american government should be brought down , and if your power is ten or hundred times the power of american military , of course you will have \\* American people \\* beg you to dispose of their inhuman presidents , who , through Patriot Act , can imprison anyone suspected without forever . It actually happened and is happening . March 21 , 2011 at 10:14 pm | Reply Oh please ! Since when have you EVER seen an order come down from the UN to attack and less than 24 hrs later a country is being bombarded ? WHY are these countries attacking a country who is DEFENDING itself from fully armed rebels ? No peaceful protesters were fired upon by the Libyan army . If state militias armed themselves the way the Libyan rebels did , you better dmn well believe the US would fire upon US citizens . And would be hailed heros for arresting and killing `` resisters '' . France and Great Brittan would also do the same upon such armed attack from rebels within their own countries and the UN would not interfere . It would be deemed a legit attack . PLEASE this is NOTHING more than some kind of diversion . Not sure from what but this all happened WAY too fast . March 21 , 2011 at 11:47 pm | Reply Your statements are ridiculous . The protesters were indeed gunned down . And to your comparison with militias in America ? The difference is that we have a way to rid ourselves of presidents we believe are not acting in our interests : we can vote them out . the Libyans have no such recourse .

Obama should be Constitutionally impeached ! March 21 , 2011 at 11:52 pm | To American Revolution -LRB- ironic name ! -RRB- : The president has every legal right to take these actions for a period of 90 day before getting congressional approval . There is no impeachable offense . March 22 , 2011 at 12:39 am | Jennifer correct me if I ` am wrong and I dont want to come off as a prick when I ask this but I ` snt it unconstitutional for the UN to use the american military in any way without the approval of congress ? I always thought that congress held the athority of the american military and the president was just commander . But my question is , if the UN can send the american military to set up a no-fly zone without the approval of congress isnt that in and of its self unconnstitutional , not just for the president but also the congress ? This may not be a very educated assumption but for some reason I thought the congress had to ok the use of the american military and that the president either had to have a presidental order or state of emergancy declared to bypass congress for american military use .

Sooner or later a mediation is needed to solve the problem . G l and Erdogan , the duo from Turkey would be quite suitable players . Germany , Russia , China and India would be welcomed by Colonel Gaddafi . Chavez could act unilaterally if he does n't feel comfortable with the others . March 21 , 2011 at 4:36 pm | Reply This is the most possible explanation and since France would n't be -LRB- allowed -RRB- to do the job , thus , to be on the cream layer of business , they hurried up taking the initiative on `` other '' grounds -- including being the ghost-busters . Perhaps this is why US government seems to be reserving a final say over the issue and they 're watching events from behind . March 23 , 2011 at 6:49 pm | Reply Turkey has been facing major changes in recent years . It is just normal for Turkey to act as wish , in this instance they are not saying stop the no fly zone . They are angry to France as France has attacked without talking to it 's allies . And Turkey has no more citizens left in Libya . Turkey has been evacuating for the last weeks and foreign nationals including Americans British Bangladeshi Indian etc. . So as this article indicates that too many Turkish companies has been working in Libya so they are not happy about it . This is a wrong statement misleading information . UK France Germany and Italy has major runs in Libya . The only think Turkey is concern is the deaths of innocent in Libya . As you might know Irag is Turkeys neighbor and has been invaded many times by Foreign countries and Turkey knows how people suffered and had to immigrate to Turkey . There was nearly 1.5 million Iraqi immigrants has entered to Turkey during the wars . The region has seen destruction in the most and Turkey does n't want this to Happen to Libya . Recently announced that 4 NYTimes journalist has been saved by Turkish government in Libya . And US UK has announced Turkey 's ambassador to Libya will act on behalf of them . So you can see that Turkey 's being there is actually helping the ally forces . Finally Russia China Germany wants the whole thing to finalize soon . People should n't trash a country just because it says it 's own opinion . For those who has never been to Turkey should not just pretend you know about it . First go for a visit to Turkey drink some Raki eat some fish and enjoy and then write anything bad about it . We have been going to Turkey for 17 years and do not have anything bad to say about them . I hope this war finishes very fast with as least deaths as possible . March 21 , 2011 at 5:57 pm | Reply I just have one thng to say about all of this ! Who is going to launch cruise missiles at the White house , Downing street and Paris when the world falls into economic collapse and the 3 governments send out military troops to imprison , shoot and control civilians within their countries -LRB- US , UK and France -RRB- ? When these countries fall into total chaos in the next few years , will the rest of the world be justified in forming a UN resolution and firing cruise missiles at these 3 countries when this happens . And will Obama stand talll to his words when he said , we can not stand by at let Libyans die at the hands of its leaders without doing anything . Will his own words be used against him at a later date ? And is n't it funny that exactly where the rebels have formed in Benghazi is where the majority of oil is produced in Libya ? Is this and Oil control maneuver ? Hmmmm wake up world to what is going on here and it is n't about helping the Libyans .

March 21 , 2011 at 8:56 pm | Reply The decision is made , no matter who says what , the goal is set . You can see it yourselves when you look at the blood decision maker vampire smiling as they decide . You would think they are bringing life to people dying by bombing them . Do you forget that the Libyans pleaded for the world to act ? March 22 , 2011 at 12:44 am | Reply The problem is n't Islam , Judaism , or Christianity . It is n't West or Arab either . It is greed in the human heart . Greed of the West over oil . Greed of Arab leaders over controlling the vast amounts of money they generate and amass from oil while leaving their populace poor . The issue that bothers me about my country is the U.S. hypocrisy . Khadafi is killing his own people which of course is wrong . Yet the other U.S. `` allies '' are doing similar things but because they are friendly to us we look the other way . Sometimes , our moral compass lacks consistency . Why are n't we involved in the Ivory Coast ? The U.S. does it fair share of supporting dictators around the world that kill their own people . As far as Khadafi , we always bring up Pan Am 103 on how evil he is yet we fail to mention that before that we bombed Libya many times before that in which one attack we killed his adopted daughter . As far as supporting the rebels in the Libyan civil war we must be careful . The U.S. has a very bad habit of arming a side that winds up being our enemy . We supported Osama bin Laden against Russia in Afghanistan as well as Saddam Hussein in Iraq against Iran . I really wish we would stop this `` Christianity is evil '' or `` Islam is evil '' . It is human greed that is evil . March 21 , 2011 at 9:16 pm | Reply For once in a blue moon the UNSC had done something , that is to impose a no fly zone in Libya . They say the purpose is to avoid the loss of civilian lives , but what the US and it 's allies are doing right now with their bombing is not the right solution as well . It still kills innocent civilian , and by destroying infrastructures , it is making life more miserable for Libyans . It is also emboldening the opposition to counter attack and prolong this civil war . And since it is obvious that the Western countries , want to to eliminate Gadhafi , I guess that civilians both pro and against Gadhafi are simply part of collateral damage . So , how can the UNSC justify these actions ? And truthfully , the only reason the west is doing these thing is because of oil , they can be hypocrite about it but the people around the world are not stupid as they may think . They will not venture to Yemen , or even Syria if needed because they know too well , that there is nothing to gain in that part of the world . And even Iran has been quite ruthless in trying to suppress it 's people , and yet America for one has not done anything . Remember , America is on the brink of bancruptcy and with this callous act of being the sheriff of the world once more , Obama just put us much more closer to being broke .

They are threatening Israel , Really ? Still occupying a large part of an EU member state , Cyprus since 1974 . Constantly violating the Greek air space and provoking the Greeks into war over a few dry rocks . Most of the UN resolutions on Turkey have fallen in deaf ears . Now , thay are playing neutral again with the Lybia thing . I bet if it was bombing the Serbs the Turks would have been all over that . They love killing Orthodox Christians and Catholics . The Turks are NOT trustworthy and the Western powers are making HUGE mistakes in regards to not holding Turley accountable for it 's actions .

When you 're ` feet dry ' in a country for a while , one tends to analyze the decisions being made by the powers that be , to try to get an understanding of the methods to their madness . Turkey is a country that stands firm by not letting outside influences dictate foreign policy . That 's a very smart move in this part of the world . Although no one close to me supports the ruling party , they have made a few sound judgments lately . Jumping on the ` Let 's Hit Libya ' bandwagon is not a smart decision on the part of the US ...

Mike , I think you do not know anything about Turkey and Turkish people , I have a lot of Turkish and Kurdish friends but I can only say that Turkish people are more polite and nice than Kurdish people . I dont know it is diffucult to tell but I dont believe that Turkish would try to exterminate Kurds . Also I must say that all nations try to kill other people from other nations . Remember WW2 and what people did each other and in Turkey , you can see that everybody is freedom and really nice to other foreign people . I have never listened any songs more beautiful than Turkish folk songs and I dont believe that the people who created this unique culture can not try to exterminate any nations ... It is about fashist politicians and not about Turkish people ... March 23 , 2011 at 4:07 pm | Reply I always respect others opinions ... as well as yours . Just a few things for you . . maybe you can help me . If you go further below in this discussion you will see someone posting as me under the name `` Mike '' just to distort and confuse the discussion . Why Turks need to do that ? Their behavior does not come with a whole lot of humility and integrity . They are constantly sending mixed signals as far as their intentions with Israel ... Why ? They are talking about attacking teh French airforce ... Really ? They deny the right to Kurds to have their own country ... 40 million people without a country ! They are in violation of a number of EU chapters ... Why ? They are still occupying a large portion of the Republic of Cyprus -LRB- EU member state -RRB- Why ? They are in violation of not implementing a plethora of UN resolutions . They are in denial of the extermination of millions of Armenians . They are constantly provoking Greece into a war . i. Turkey did n't have to fight in WWII , they need n't show what military skills they had acquired in order to serve whatever their hidden agenda proposes -LRB- reference to US goals -RRB- . After all , Germans were the allies for a century , and were the Soviets thanks to a heroic WWI defense . Turks did not need to oppress the so-called minorities -- in contrast , they needed to embrace every prime citizens to build up fast ; the country was economically bleeding and most of their citizens were killed or injured after WWI -- since the country was not industrialized the human loss had been extreme . The number of churches in Turkey exceeds that of the Rome ... sometimes it is forgotten perhaps , but Turks believe they have already contained the Christian teachings -- it may be altered , but not devilish to them . Religious talks against Turkey has never been a fruitful and great idea -- believe me . . Turkey has warned Israel over their uncontrolled actions , yes , threatened them ? Turkey , unlike Israel is part of multinational organizations of any kind , and can be checked , controlled , praised or blamed . Israel is an abomination in this regard , roaming freely unchecked , because they feel they were isolated . Turkey offers them to break off this isolation in the language no others tried . No one knows the issues that include Jerusalem , Palestine and Israel as Judaism any more and any better than Turkey . v. Yes , Turkey has no intention for giving up their own legitimate right of doing so no matter what -- they had to silence Greece and intervene the military coupe they gone out of control on the island ; the island has an extremely valuable location since it gives the owners an overseer position above the Suez channel and control over all East Mediterranean . Under normal circumstances Greece would thank to Turkey for their intentional helps over the coupe , their EU and NATO memberships , I suppose they did n't . Turks should stop provoking their mighty neighbors or they may once again feel like conquering all the way to ancient Persia . the deaf population in Turkey is around 2,5 million , Turkey , in total , is nearing 80M dynamic population . Turkey did not stay neutral as the Serbians attacking Bosnians , who had been a major contributor to their civilization , thus , culturally tied population , as they will not stay neutral while their 10b $ prospected marketplace is getting bombed by a rival nation . Turkey has completed a major evacuation from the country , and has sent 5 ships and one sub marine , vix . Interesting point of view that suggests Turks are somehow related to the protestants and other churches , just not to those your parents were used to take you . We also raise a vampire race and have finest selection of other breeds FYI . x. I fail to see any supportive arguments why Turks , not even Turkey have not been trust worthy , though respecting your own faith on this subject , I understand Red and White are not favorite color combination . With all respect , I do not believe Egypt has any kind of control over their own territories . This is the very same reason why Turks have ruled the Northern Egyptian territories and the Channel , but not `` conquered '' the land or stayed on foreign soil as invaders . Egyptians are loved in Turkey , they have the resources , but they are not left alone , and Turks do not pay a role in this I 'm afraid . In my opinion , Turkey is a solid country whose words and potential friendship or partnership should be credible enough . Do not be surprised if one of these days Turks start flying over Libyan cities to intercept French vultures should they continue acting upon their own will . Best regards ; March 23 , 2011 at 8:36 pm | Reply You get credit for recognizing that Alexander the Great was 100 % Greek . As far as your comments ... I respect your opinion . Respect is something the majority of the Turks lack . As you can see below in this discussion someone is posting notes as me with the same name `` Mike '' ... Is that another Turkish quality ? Steal others identities and spread mis-information ? Writing fake Mike is not about nationatity and is not about being Turkish !! If there was another discussion about other subjects , maybe a German or an South African would do the same , you can not know !!!!! 2 . For this question , I think every country does it . Trade and showing reaction about diffirent situations are different aspects !!! 3 . Every country has patriots who think and aim to destroy something which is owned by other countries . I am sure a person who lives in Iraq might want to destroy all the things which come from the west if his father were klled by Western forces ... Think about that ... !!!! 4 . You may be right about this subject but I have just researched Turkish election done in 2007 and in this election , BDP which supports right of Kurds and advocates PKK organization which is considered as terrorist group by EU has just taken the 5 % of the all votes in Turkey . I means that 95 % of the people in Turkey do not want a Kurdish Territory in their homeland . And There is Kurdish TV and Kurdoloji studies and Kurdish language courses at Turkish universities ... 5 . I think it is good for a country to be able to say no about what you say to do as you think that it is not good for country 6 . I also researched about Cyprus past and there was an ANNAN PLAN which was refused by Greek part There is no need to tell about the war , massacres from two sides . It is a well known story for all wars . We all know that Israel does not obey UN rules . I think Armenians and Turkish historins must search all together in a neutral comission . As far as I know Armenians refused that . Greeks spent a lot of money for military developments , that 's why there is an economical crisis . For this subject , it is the guilt of not Only Turks but also Greeks . I reseached that Greeks had tried to occupied anatolia and there were two massacres from each side ... did you do any research through legit sources or you get all your information from the Turks ? Turkey is in violation of more UN resolutions than any other country . The geneocide against Armenians and the Turkish denial about this geneocide is one example of why Turkey can not be trusted . Invading small Nations -LRB- Cyprus 1\\/2 million people -RRB- vs Turkey -LRB- 70 some million -RRB- , using Napalm bombs , killing and raping unarmed citizens and now they want to establish a separate country ? That is another example why Turks have zero credibility . March 26 , 2011 at 6:14 pm | Bias , bias , bias ... I also know that Armenians must prove that , as I wrote , it is not about nationality , for example , think that American or French parliments decide there was a genocide against Armenians , as we know , parlimenters are not historians-at least all of them - , they are businessman and something like that and Armenian political lobbies say them to vote about accepting there was a genocide , then Parliments decide there was a genocide !!!!!!!!!!!! We need scientific evidences , dont we ? If they prove also , it is not a guilt of existing Turks , as I researched in the internet that Kurdish gangs had tried to exterminate Armenian people . I wish nobody would have been killed in anywhere . For UN , we can not count how many people die all over the Africa and we can hear almost nothing from UN . So UN is not a good example for us !!!!!!!!!!! I will not write more ... I actually agree with you on the point that killings and injustices are happening all over . Unfortunately The USA and friends choose and pick which are worthy to help and which are not . Kuwait was worthy , Iraq was worthy , x-Yugoslavia was worthy , and now Libya . The massacres at Darfur apparently was not good enough for international intervention , the Turkish invasion of Cyprus apparently was not good enough for international intervention ... . Where there is oil there is interest -LRB- x-Yugoslavia was an odd one ... since there is no oil -RRB- ... . . Interests above all ... There is not much integrity left in the world . But , that does not mean that people like me and you should n't take the high road to respect and integrity . Arab world has abundance of tyrants and is going through an era where younger generation is thirsting for democrary and more representative governments . Strong religious influences have always been obstacles to dramatic , social and political changes . For the long term , I see great things for our Arab brothers and sisters . In the short term , I am fearful of the suffering they will have to endure . Whatever the reasons , thousands of innocent lives were saved this past weekend in Libya and I 'm very thankful for that . March 21 , 2011 at 10:47 pm | Reply Libya is an easy call : Qadaffi is a rogue , his county is too close to NATO bases , and even the other Arab gov ` ts wo n't mind seeing him go . If it were n't for the military he built up with all of Europe 's money for oil over 40 years , the rebels could have won two weeks ago anyway . No reason to let them be slaughtered like Saddam did to the Shiites after the first US-Iraq War . Ivory Coast is n't going to get any press . No oil and too black for US\\/EU involvement . How long has Somalia been a sh \\* thole , and we wo n't do squat there , even after it became a pirate haven . Bahrain and Yemen are too close logistically and politically to Saudi Arabia for the U.S. to do anything to help them . The US ca n't get on the side opposite the Saudi gov ' t since they control so much oil and so much of our debt . It 's awful hard to attack your paymaster 's friends in the Gulf . March 21 , 2011 at 10:57 pm | Reply 60 per cent of those polled in a Jazeera Arabic website poll are in favor of the military action both no fly zone and surgical strikes , they have been watching a month of graphic coverage that never made it on Western Tv , seeing even more horrific images of atrocites agaisnt civilians and children on Arabic facebook pages for the Libyan oppostion including when this was still a peaceful movement of sit ins and demos met with tanks and artillery fire , and they have also heard not just opposition fighures but ordinary Libyans call for help so the majority of Arabs see this as saving Libyan lives . The callers on Jazeera Mubasher , the Cspan like channel , are almost all in favor , those who regret it wish arab armies were doing the job and hoping that when we have represntative Arab leaders they will act in such crises .

I would like to see Eqypt flourish as a strong democracy . It could be a leader and admired in the Arab world . It could influence `` what is Arab '' . Two weeks ago Obama , Clinton and Gates were all hesitant in Lybyan involvement . US is fearful of being in the middle of `` Arab matters '' .

It is the same country and government that did not let US troops into Iraq over its borders . ii - Current operation is nothing more than a chaos with no clear motives , no central control and coordination , as well as no support from the rest of the world , including the arab league and former russian republics or the russia itself . Why would a country accept to be a part of such an unclear goal , with unclear results and risks ? It is Turkey 's right to ask for more information , and stay aside . You will be sending your troops to a war , we are talking about human beings , and no matter what nationality they are , a human life is invaluable . iii - Every country may have interests on another country , which is normal , however , it is not really very ethical to change the rules of the game while playing it . This is what France did . Mr. Sarkozy , only to have more public support for his current seat , started using force , and now he is paying for it . Turkey and France have a very limited amount of money-cash flow and commercial relationship , but a lot more with Libya happens to be . Now Turkey is actually losing money because of France 's irresponsible attack . It is normal for a country to try to control the amount of losses in such a crisis situation , this is what Turkey is doing .

Both countries have been actively seeking diplomatic resolution to the civil unrest in Libya . They have shown much , much more ambition and have given plenty more efforts than western countries did , to have Gadhafi make a positive move towards a peaceful resolution of the unrest . Both countries have enormous economic and social ties with Libya & Libyans . Both countries are losing a considerable economic activity between Libya and theirs in the process . COnsidering all these facts , it would be quite foolish to claim that Turkey and\\/or Egypt may have ambitions to participate in western military assault of Libya . Turkish PM have made it very clear that his administration -- reflecting the feelings of majority of Turks -- believe that Libya belongs to Libyans and Westerners are attacking Libya for Oil , economic & political gain . This should not be taken lightly . March 22 , 2011 at 10:27 am | Reply Mike , just wanted to give you some facts about Turkey ; - During 2nd World War Turkey had no financial means to even prepare for the war . After the 1st World War , the loans of Ottoman Empire was portioned to be paid by Turkey , in addition to the poor state of the economics , which is why neither Ataturk nor Inonu forced to select government run economy rather than market economy . There are more details about that period if you go to wikipedia and read the presidency of Inonu . - Violating human rights , are in the hands of government . Unfortunately the money is talking most of the time rather than the ` national interest ' . And the journalists who points that out or works on that gets to be assasinated or jailed . Just few Ugur Mumcu , Hrant Dink not to mention just recently jailed Ahmet Sik my old colleague . If what you say about freedom of religion was true there should have been no Jewish , Armenian , Greek Orthodox living in Turkey . And just recently they have changed the law on Education , so that illegal Armenians children can attend to Armenian schools -LRB- or any other school -RRB- without looking for their residency in Turkey . Isreal will always be an ally to Turkey , no matter what current givernment is trying to do . The links are too deep , and not only due to historial alliance but also due to the fact that Isreal was the only country to help us caught Apo . I do n't think you are in the knowledge that there is a place called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus , with an army , government , representatives and they held election every four years . Oh I forgot , you guys are still not recognizing that they are a separate government . Just an fyi do n't say that around a Northern Cypriot . They go bezerk if you say they live under siege . In any case Turkey does not have to prove itself to people one by one . The history will show ... March 22 , 2011 at 10:31 am | Reply It sounds to me that is a bunch of rhetoric with no substance . That is the answer you give to someone that has no idea about history and facts . You claim that you are a historian ? I believe you are more like the department of mis-information . During second WW2 Turkey made a choice to stand by the sidelines while the rest of Europe was getting destroyed by the Germans . Many other countries were poor as well but they made a choice to stand up against Hitler and the extermination of thousand of Jews and others . Turkey took the easy road out and did nothing while thousands were tortured and killed . You claim Turkey was so poor from Ottoman debts that they could n't fight a war ? However , they found the necessary means to exterminate millions of Armenians , uproot thousands of Greeks from their ancestoral homes and kill without mercy just before 1923 . I seriously doubted whether or not Israel is going to be normal ever again . Cyprus : Are you kidding with the puppet Turkish pseudo-state ? Nobody in the world is recognizing that except the invaders themselves . Numerous UN resolutions call for the withdrawal of the Turkish military from the island - Of course the Turks do not really pay attention to any of that . In addition the Turkish occupation of part of the Republic of Cyprus -LRB- Full memebr of the EU -RRB- is prohibiting Turkey 's asparations to enter the EU . If Turkey does not plan to comply with EU requirements then they should withdrawal their application and form their own club . As far the `` illegal '' Armenian children ??? Really ???? Illegal to who ? And thousands of Turkish illegal settlers in Cyprus are what ? We only cheer with friends . Re : `` exterminate millions of Armenians '' - the lack of money is one of the reasons how still we do n't understand those 1.5 M fictitious number managed to get killed without our knowledge . Why should we keep it secret , I can tell how many Cypriot was shot to death trying to climb a flag-pole , among one of the things they should n't be doing . You were misinformed heavily which only serves to make you hate us ... if you 're unsure about the reasons see where it serves . Cyprus was not invaded after EU , actually , Greece was taken into EU after Turkey has intervened freely , legitimately and successfully -LRB- though this part is arguable -RRB- . May be we should start talking about the Greek legitimacy over Crete , and the Rhodes + 12 islands . I would also love to see if you can price several of the big ones that are close to the shore .

March 22 , 2011 at 1:25 pm | Reply John , what is an Islamist anyway ? I am interested in learning what is meant exactly by this term as I am a Muslim who practices prayer fasting and the other pillars , I believe in divine law based upon the Qur ` an and tradition of the Prophet Muhammad . We do not believe in enforcing our beliefs and values upon anyone nor do we support terror or radical ideologies and yes born and raised in good ol USA mom grandma and everyone for the past two hundred plus years . Here is some research on the salafist perspective regarding radicalsim and thes contemporary issues we deal with IMO an Islamist does seek to impose Shiria law and lacks tolerance for those who are not Muslim , and very often also for those who are not Muslim of the same stripe . There is a militancy to Islamists in which force is justified because of the end , and\\/or those to whom it is directed against are marginalized as `` infidels '' , unbelievers , or otherwise lesser human beings whose killing and targeting does n't count . A common trait in Islamists is a paranoia that all others are out to destroy them . Oftern , there is some bases to the paranoia as others , feeling threatened by the militancy of the Islamist , but perhaps not differentiating between Islamist and Muslim , push back , sometimes in the process of fighting the militancy of the Islamist , commiting atrocities of their own -LRB- see Uzbeckistan 's history since breaking apart from the USSR as an example of the push back being practiced on a state wide level with horrendous brutalitiy -RRB- . I also see a similar distinction between a Zionist and a Jew , and between radical western religious zealots and Christians . I have real problems with Zionists -LRB- as I do with Islamists and western zealots -RRB- , but no issues with Muslims or Jews or Christians per se . Once the mindset shutters out those not of the same belief as enemies , and the mindset of the extremist group can justify all manner of injustice and atrocity against those not in their group , the process of dehumanizing the practioner has begun , and the result is the fanatism we see all over the world today . Most recently much of that fanaticism has involved the Islamists , but it comes in phases , and the Zionists have had their turn , as has the western zealots , and each may come to the forefront again .

I myself am a muslim too , and we , in Turkey have our own right to choose how to believe and how to practice our belief ... that the same Turkey , in a different name , have waved the banner of ISLAM for great many centuries without spreading an islamic terror of any kind -LRB- knowing we still have aunts of my father who remained to be christians back in kosovo as their men in the army had to pull back with the shrinking borders -RRB- . Perhaps this is not a good place , but to underline the irrelevance of any religious role in Turkey 's hesitation , we do believe we accept what Jesus had brought and had told , and we do not distinguish any of those coming with the same knowledge , Mohammad or Jesus or Noah . For those who may not know , Qur ` an says `` leave my people alone '' it does n't say `` go and teach them a good lesson '' .

This is a simple forum where people express their ideas and of course this particular Turkish person positing as me , `` mike '' is trying to do what Turks are known for doing for ages , dis-information , chaos , propaganda and yes steal others identities so they can re-inforce -LRB- in their own minds -RRB- their positions on subjects that are just plain wrong and criminal . There is NO freedom of speech in Turkey . You dare speak against `` Turkisheness '' and you are done . Nobody will ever find you again ... not in a million years . Yes , Turkey is peaceful when and if you play by their rules and their rules only . In other words allow them to take whatever they want from their neighbors , rape whoever they want and kill unarmed prisoners of war and even civilians over a piece of cloth . That is what Turkey represents ... basically nothing good or human . I live in stanbul and I can just laugh what you write my friend-Mike - . First we had an independence war against emperyalist powers during 1920-1923 . Just researched who came to Anatolia to conquer the Turkish lands in these years and learn what happened after that . Secondly , Turkey is the only country which had kicked out emperyalist goverments -LRB- not nations -RRB- like France , England , Greece and taly . We have no problem with any nations . We have problem with the mind that tried to execute our culture . I am proud of my grandfather who had defensed my country in anakkale during WW1 . I really respect other nations as my nationality but as I say We had a problem with capitalist forces in the past . Also , I am sorry but I must say that I can not breathe anywhere except my country and I feell so lucky that Turkish people is not cold people like some European nations but we like all nations . If Israel soldiers kill babies on beaches in Palestine , I must show my reaction and If a Palestinian person tries to kill Jewish people , I feel the same and show reaction in the same way . For Greeks and Armenian , nobody talks about Turkish people who had been killed by Armenian and Greek partisans . I listened a lot of stories from my grandmother about what Greek did in my hometown K tahya after WW1 and what armenians did in the east of Turkey . After these , you can not except any nations not to do anytithing to stop this extermination !!!! Some people can not see the other perspectives of the situations . I can just thank to Mustafa Kemal ATAT RK Hope the Turkish air force soon will start to chase and hunt down the Hypocrite French Vultures over the Libyan sky !!

Turkey ... still deny the self detemination of millions of Kurds to establish homeland . Not only that but the treatment of the Kurds is extremely harsh and unbearable conditions . Turkey is still threatening Greece every other week ... Violating the Greek air space as well as sea borders . Turkey is in violation of more EU resolutions than any other counrty .

'' Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The story of the Libyan intervention may pain some of the most ardent believers in the proposition that it is America 's role to take the lead , all of the time , everywhere . But when the French and the British began the first sorties into Libyan airspace , it made an awful lot of sense : It 's their neighborhood after all . And when the Arab League decided to support some kind of allied intervention , it seemed a powerful consensus was developing . Then came the United Nations resolution , and the deal was sealed . Some complained that President Barack Obama had dithered and that it was too late for an effective no-fly zone . Others applauded his insistence on not going it alone . Put me in that camp : Without a strategic reason for unilateral U.S. military action , this is clearly a humanitarian effort . And a worldwide one . So if the president has done the right thing , why does it feel as if something is wrong ? It 's hard to pinpoint exactly , but there 's an amorphous and unsettling nature to this action . On the one hand , there is one coalition goal that has been explicitly stated and affirmed : This is an effort to keep Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi from murdering his own people . Yet there 's another goal here -- an implicit one -- that suddenly no one can explain in any great detail : Gadhafi has to go . It 's something the president himself said two weeks ago . And on Monday , he labored to separate his own words -LRB- as in , the end of the Gadhafi regime is `` U.S. policy '' -RRB- from the wording of the U.N. resolution -LRB- the humanitarian protection of the Libyan people -RRB- . In other words : We know the ouster of Gadhafi is part of the preferred endgame . But we ca n't make it part of the official coalition plan because regime change is nowhere in it . What are U.S. expectations for Libya ? How Americans feel about Libya The president has stated the obvious : The military operation is there to prevent a bloodbath . But we know that the military , political and financial pressure is also there to remove Gadhafi . So we understand the ultimate goal , but the coalition ca n't spell it out . Nor can we do it , exactly -- at least not as a stated goal . -LRB- And the generals were out in force over the weekend explaining that indeed , Gadhafi could potentially remain in power . -RRB- So we 're left with the prospect that once the rebels are no longer in danger of being overwhelmed by Gadhafi 's forces , we will then proceed to the `` tightening the noose '' phase of the operation that will finally lead to Gadhafi 's departure . And then there 's this : How do we know when we have succeeded ? How can we judge a humanitarian crisis averted ? Sure , we can tell when the danger to innocent civilians has abated -LRB- because we have destroyed or dismantled Gadhafi 's air capability -RRB- . But if the core of that danger is a murderous thug who still reigns , can you only abate it by removing him ? That 's where the strategy gets a tad circular : How can you ensure the end of the killing unless you get rid of the hideous man ordering it ? Richard Haass , the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and who is no fan of this intervention , tells me that America 's problem is an administration that is focused more on process than policy . `` This was based too much on getting support and not enough on a sustainable plan , '' he says . `` I do n't think we thought it through . Simply getting a coalition does n't mean it 's a good idea . Getting the Arab League does n't make it a good idea . Multilateralism does n't make the end better . '' In fact , it probably makes the intervention even more difficult to manage . In theory , the Obama doctrine -- which is clearly attempting to change the storyline of American military intervention in the Arab world -- is a game-changer . In a way , Barack Obama is still behaving as he did as the editor of the Harvard Law Review , hanging back until a center of gravity is established . But in the specific case of Libya , the caution can be confusing : Try as we might , there 's no way to keep American participation in any military action in the backseat , no matter who flies the first planes . There 's no way to ensure that any multilateral coalition works . And , most important : Is there a way to leave if Gadhafi stays ? And if we win -LRB- whatever that means -RRB- , who 's left ? Who are the Libyan rebels , if they are anything cohesive at all ? And what if the civil war flares up after we tamp it down ? Is that our problem ? Or some other country 's problem ?

CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : Not every rescue worker in Japan is human . We 've got a report coming up about rescue dogs and how they carry out their unique work . I 'm Carl Azuz . CNN Student News starts right now ! AZUZ : Things are getting more tense in the nearby country of Yemen . Protesters there have been calling for the president , Ali Abdullah Saleh , to step down . President Saleh made an offer to the people who are against him . He said he would step down , but at the beginning of next year . The opposition rejected that offer . That want Saleh out now . The protests have gotten violent at times , with government crackdowns leading to dozens of deaths . Because of that , some officials in President Saleh 's government are now supporting the opposition . And this was the scene at the Interior Ministry building in the Egyptian capital of Cairo on Tuesday . This fire broke out after a protest at the building earlier in the day . The protest was peaceful . People were calling for higher wages . They denied setting the fire , which was put out in less than an hour . BRIAN TODD , CNN CORRESPONDENT : With an energetic , hardwired bust , Atticus charges into the rubble , bouncing around a fallen roof . He 's focused on one thing : finding a living , breathing human amid the sprawling wreckage of the tsunami . It might seem an unfair request of a German shepherd , but Atticus and more than a dozen other dogs working with U.S. and British rescue teams here are more than equal to it . How important are these dogs to these operations ? ROB FURNISS , BRITISH CANINE SEARCH SPECIALIST : Very . There 's a lot of technical gear . Obviously , the listening devices , the cameras . There 's all that stuff , all that stuff for locating people . But at the end of the day , you ca n't beat a dog for hitting the scent of a human being . TODD : Like most canine specialists , Rob Furnace has a tight bond with his Border Collie Byron . TODD : The dogs are so highly trained , they 're able to block out the scent of a deceased person and pick up only on someone who 's alive . Their success rate is impressive . These teams pulled more than a dozen survivors safely from the rubble in Haiti , in no small part due to teammates like this German shepherd named Wracker . But keeping them sharp involves some creativity . The team just had to do a drill with Wracker because they have n't found anyone alive in a few days . They 've just had one of their own team members hide in this place , out of sight , just out of any sensory perception for Wracker . Sent Wracker in there to see if they could find that team member . That 's how they keep the dogs sharp if they have n't found anyone in a few days . You stare in amazement as they run full speed , jump , land and bounce off objects that are so jagged and uneven that most people could n't even attempt it . But they 're not invincible . Did he give you any kind of a signal or did you just see the blood ? TODD : Tomo , a German shepherd , snagged something in his paw . A little field surgery and he 's back in the game . Later on , Wracker needs more work to stitch up a wound . Never during either incident do we hear one whimper from either dog . TODD : Traveling , sleeping , eating and playing with their handlers is part of the routine . Their communication is so instinctive that they sometimes understand each other just by making eye contact . We did n't witness them finding survivors in Japan , but the dogs serve another purpose for those who 've lost everything . ELIZABETH KREITLER , FAIRFAX CANINE SEARCH SPECIALIST : Having the dog and seeing the times that the people in Haiti or something would enjoy a little solace from the dog , that 's also part of their job and helpful to everybody , to teammates and myself alike . TODD : All of these dogs actually live with their handlers , who are heavily involved in their training . That helps solidify the bond between them and helps them get through these long deployments a long way from home . Brian Todd , CNN , Unosumai , Japan . TOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Today 's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Golebiewski 's social studies classes at Northridge Middle School in Middlebury , Indiana ! The word `` vernal '' refers to what season ? You know what to do ! Is it : A -RRB- Winter , B -RRB- Spring , C -RRB- Summer or D -RRB- Fall ? You 've got three seconds -- GO ! Vernal comes from the Latin word for spring . That 's your answer and that 's your Shoutout ! AZUZ : The vernal equinox occurs when day and night are equal lengths , and this happened Sunday night . That event marks the official start of spring . But depending on where you live , it does not mean you should start packing up your snow gear just yet . A winter storm brought snow and rain to California on Monday , leaving thousands of homes without power and closed some schools and roads . Every road into California 's Yosemite National Park was closed after storms dumped three-and-a-half feet of snow throughout the park . And in New Jersey , on the East Coast , some people spent the first full day of spring clearing sidewalks instead of hitting golf balls . AZUZ : As you might expect , the weather 's a little warmer down in Miami , Florida . Officials there are hoping some new outdoor facilities will let Floridians do more than just have fun in the sun . They want people to work out -- outside ! Men 's Health Magazine recently named Miami as America 's fattest city . Now , that is a reputation that city officials want to shed , so they 're installing these outdoor gyms in order to encourage people to get out and get in shape . If you ca n't afford a memership ? These outdoor facilities are totally free . And as you can see , some fitness fanatics are already putting them to good use . AZUZ : But what we 're curious about is this : Do you think it 'll work ? Some of the people in that video , you could tell it was n't their first time at a gym . But do you think these outdoor facilities would encourage folks who would n't normally work out to hit the equipment if it 's outside ? Head to our blog at CNNStudentNews.com and weigh in with your thoughts . AZUZ : An undefeated senior season . Anthony Robles is definitely an impressive athlete . He 's also an inspiration . Robles was born without a right leg . He 's never let that hold him back . He adapted his wrestling style , building the strength and size of his upper body into more than other wrestlers in his weight class . That style helped him win a national title recently . Robles says everyone faces some kind of adversity . The key is to stay focused . ANTHONY ROBLES , NCAA WRESTLING CHAMPION : Everybody has their own obstacles in their life , whether it be physical , mental , the outside world . Whatever it is , everybody experiences their own obstacles , and it 's about just looking beyond that , and really just focusing on your goals and going after them . AZUZ : Good insight . Before we go today , there 's a shuttle mission we 're talking to you about that 's never going to get off the ground . But it 's not supposed to . About 2,000 employees at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center got together to form this human shuttle in the parking lot . It 's a tribute to the space program , which is going away . Probably cost a lot less than an actual shuttle . It took about an hour . We sped the thing up so you could see how it all came together . It 's impressive that they found a spot to pull this off . AZUZ : But if there 's anything NASA 's good at , it 's finding space . We hope that you 'll find space for CNN Student News tomorrow , when we return . We will look forward to launching into more commercial-free headlines then .

Obama could have canceled his Latin American trip to remain in Washington while the Libyan bombing campaign commenced . Instead , braving criticism at home , he embarked on a tour amounting to a long-term investment in America 's geopolitical position . The United States has historically overlooked Latin America . Yet today , the region constitutes a market nearly as large as China 's , boasts an influential rising power in Brazil and hosts dangerous criminal insurgencies that respect no borders . Whatever U.S. interests exist in Libya -- there is room for reasonable debate -- the country does not outweigh the rest of the Western Hemisphere . Gloria Borger : Obama and Libya : Tell us how this ends In theory , the Obama doctrine -- which is clearly attempting to change the storyline of American military intervention in the Arab world -- is a game-changer . In a way , Barack Obama is still behaving as he did as the editor of the Harvard Law Review , hanging back until a center of gravity is established . But in the specific case of Libya , the caution can be confusing : Try as we might , there 's no way to keep American participation in any military action in the back seat , no matter who flies the first planes . There 's no way to ensure that any multilateral coalition works . And , most important : Is there a way to leave if Gadhafi stays ? And if we win -LRB- whatever that means -RRB- , who 's left ?

First Piers talked to Ali Suleiman Aujali , former Libyan Ambassador to the U. S , who was very outspoken against Gadhafi . `` He must be captured dead or alive , '' Aujali said . Piers also talked to Paul Wolfowitz , former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense , and Anne-Marie Slaughter , former Director of Policy Planning for the State Department , about what the Arabs want and how they 'll get it . Wolfowitz said that if we did n't go into Libya it `` would have been a blood bath in Benghazi . '' He emphasized , `` The Arabs want freedom . '' Slaughter said the Libyan opposition is working to defeat Gadhafi and `` what we 're doing is making it possible for them to do that . '' Piers , how many of those returning libyan fighters on both sides got their training as `` volunteers '' to fight US soldiers in Iraq , via Syria ? Libya posessed the highest PER CAPITA foreign fighters whom left Libya to go to Iraq . Arte these returning fighters breeding the chaos in Arab lands now ? Below is a list of fighters by name , country , city of residence . PDF file is way too many pages to print , but leads one to wonder if these revolts were comprised off fighters returning from Iraq ? The opening clip on Piers Morgan tonight -LRB- Mar 22 -RRB- showing violence in the street is stated to be `` thought to be from today '' . The one shot on a cell phone with another person stepping out onto a balcony however is a clip we have already seen during the first week of protests in Libya . why , oh why , do you have Rick Santorum on . I mean , who really cares what he has to say . what does he have , maybe 10 % support of trhe Republican nut case right wing . so , he has maybe 3 % support in the country ? so how low do your support ratings have to be to be disqualified from being on television as a voice that hs any importance . Why dont you have Charlie Sheen on to talk about the war . I think he probably has much more credibility than that idiot . Yes , i would agree with Henry Shustin . . Rick Santorum is about as looney as they get . if anyone can tell you how things are it is political leader Kuchinich from Ohio , atleast this man can tell you how it is , whether you or his fellow elected nutjobs care to hear about it . Go interview Kuchinich some day and then you will realize about all the failures of the US State Department 's foreign policy . Rick Santorum lost his re-election bid by the largest margin ever in PA senatoral elections , he has been out of the national spotlight for four years and yet you lead him off as an expert on Libya . I do n't get it . I enjoy your show and your style , but this one has me confused . It 's not a political party thing or a liberal-conservative issue , it just what could he know and other that yip about the President , I ca n't see what he can add to the discussion or the discourse on international concerns . Piers , we do not need another hour of Anderson Cooper . I am on the verge of leaving CNN programming at 6PM all together . 3 hours of news is too much . Do what you were supposed to do , get our minds off the wars for an hour , and do interesting one on one interviews , politicians , entertainers , extra-ordinary people . Your wannabe news show is for the birds and dry as dirt . CNN is a 24 hour news station . You want celebrity interviews , try Fox . You can watch Ann Coulter , Sarah Palin , Michelle Bachmann , Christine O'Donnell all being interviewed . I want to inform you that the supply from the west of the city of Misurata comes from 3 camps , the first is the so-called camp market Althelata corresponding to the market Allata Bzletn and base camps the other two come after the bridge Zlitin direct dist I want to inform you that the supply from the west of the city of Misurata comes from 3 camps , the first is the so-called camp market Althelata corresponding to the market Allata Bzletn and base camps the other two come after the bridge Zlitin direct distance of 200 meters and one on the right and the other on the left in case of bombing Hedda camps in addition to the camp volcano south Zlitin the supply and security will Idhwr in Hedda battalions i seen this ambasador of libyia to usa , in beginning of libyian revolution , in his interviw with , i believe mr. anderson he support kadafi , now he is against kadafi , not because not of changing opinions , just because of his private interests , and he is afraid if kadafi win this battle , he going to be gone from his lucrative position , as ambasador of lybia , also i do n't like propaganda what is going on cnn permnanet underlaying that action against kadafi is to protect civilians , a seen on your video that civilans are armed with heavy weapon , some of them are taking picture on line of fire , they risk their lives on their own , because there is civil war , also a seen small kids there , what kind of parents let them go on line of fire , the other propaganda is about no flying zone there is no kadafi planes , and i seen regular cars destroyied , tanks , and buildings , because of flying zone , if coalition forces support rebels is simple to say that we are support military rebels and we want take kadafi aut , so it would be the best scenario , but this stupid propaganda make simple unbelivable in usa and koalition intentions in addition i think that even kadafi will be out , it is going to be bloody long war , because kadafi supporters will fight even without kadafi I was just wondering that same thing ... just who are these supporters ? Is Libya more divided than Egypt seemed to be ? Because those supporters seem awfully passionate in those videos , like they 'd continue the fight ... What would the coalition do then ? If it 's just Libyan versus Libyan ... March 23 , 2011 at 12:55 am | Report abuse | my advise in this situation libya that kadafhi should go sooner or later . . united nations did the right way to protect the civiliens destroy kadafh regims because this is a civil war it is not iraq or afhanasten . . etc now it a very tough situation because the mess has started . the country 's that support that bring some troops in and tell the civilines that want dremocracy should move out . ai believe a lot of kadafhi military want to do the same thing should drop the guns who is left until finding kadaphy all the way to the end . one more time it isnot Irak or afhanistan . fight door to door find the enemy it is a civil war . i believe the president of the united states made the right decision because it is power to action Your opening film shot for tonights -LRB- 22March 2011 -RRB- episode : How embarrassing !!! Do you realize that this film shot was from the recent Egyptian uprising , NOT Libya ??? What are you trying to do ??? I immediately recognized this film footage ... look at the Mubarak THUGS in yellow hats with sticks ... Remember the silhouette of the people from the upper decks looking down as the Mubarak Thugs attacked the local Egyptians ? I like your show ... but your STAFF failed you miserably tonight !!!!!!! The no-fly zone may possibly save Benghazi , however , in the long term ; the only sustainable solution would require Gadhafi s removal . Gadhafi will respond only to force , remember he s already lived through American bombings of Tripoli in 1980s . This is not a comment about last nights show as sadly we are not getting your show in South Africa any more . We throughly enjoyed the program when it first came to CNN & now for no reason what so ever it has been taken off the schedule . This is completely unacceptable & please can someone at CNN sort this out & return your excellent program to the CNN International Service ASAP . This is this second email I am sending in this regard . CNN you guys got your photos wrong . The photos was from Egypt not Libya . I understand both countries are in Africa , it 's like saying Mexico instead of United States . How do I trust you all now ? If you all had a shortage of photo clips you all could borrow from Aljezeera -LRB- US -RRB- that has very graphic photos of Libya and the killing of little kids playing ball by the Israelis . ? What is the difference between Netanyahu and Sadam Husain or Gaddafi ?? Where is the UN now ? You all did the same thing with Ahmadinejad interview , he said something to the effect by his translator in English '' In history no occupier has ever stayed on the land indefenately '' CNN and the Western media said '' Israel will be wiped out from the face of the earth '' . Around the same time Ahmadinejad received an award by the Jewish Rabbis . Why should one group of people be allowed to occupy land some one is living on presently and be ruthlessly KILLED by another group because it was written in the book FIVE to SIX thousand years back ? If this is the case can we give Normandy to Great Britain and the Americas back to the Native Indians ????? The Lies , Fascism , Hypocrisy is the root of the problems in the Middle East not the Judaism , Christianity or Islam . The Al-quida is a creation of the West and the media spin . Who ever monitory gains from this conflict are the culprits . Now do we go attack Iran because Israel wants us to ????? Does any one think about our service men an women who are made to fight these wars from our tax dollars ? Why do any interviews at all on the Lybian conflict , what the coalition should do is drop leaf-lets to all opposition fighters telling them to spread the word to get clear of any cities where pro-Gadaffi fighters or supporters may be and once their all clear , `` JUST LEVEL THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WITH THOUSANDS OF DAISEY-CUTTERS '' ... Boom-bang problem solved , then move back in and mass bury the bodies and go on with the new government they want !!! And they will always know what will happen if things get out of control again ... `` PROBLEM SOLVED , NO MORE THREAT FROM THE COUNTRY OF LYBIA '' \\* Wayne \\* This would simply be loved by avid Daisey-Cutters in this country of ours . And we have plenty of them around up on the Hill too aka McCain & Leiberman . There has developed a perverse fondness in our nation of seeing us bomb far off nations . We raelly love to sit back & enjoy the fireworks . I quite agree with the comments posted by @ Nani . The reason the Middle East is in upheaval of violence can be explained to some extent by what this blogger said . For too long we in the US & Western countries in general have followed a policy based on bigotry , suspect poltical agenda and deception while dealing with issues in that region . American public has been insidiously shielded from the truth and reality on the ground by Lobbies & special interests . Openly & calendistinely supported by politicos whose loyalty to American interests is subservient to the interests of another state posing as our ` ally ' . Unfortunately our mainstream media tags along . Mr. Morgan its time that anchors like yourself perk up courage , in the face off ungodly opposition I know , to bring the truth to American public . Put the likes of Robert Falk the American academic , Ilan Pappe the Israeli historian and public intellectuals like Naom Chomsky , Uri Avnery and MJ Rosenberg on your show and do the right thing . As always , well written and spot on with your assessment . Very nice to see you again IKHAN . It has been a long time ... and you have been missed How does one attempt imposing Democracy out of the Barrel of a gun is beyond any ones critical thinking . Arabia : After all , the people who would like to rise against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are those Shias and Sunnies they just happen to be close to Iran , that we simply can not risk as Iran it 's to good target to deviate some home truth . Besides , if the House of Saudi is removed , the extremists will take over ... what ? Saudi are not enough extremists in power already ? Well , that depends on how we define `` extremists '' if thrown out the surviving Israels will be in question . The House of Saudi have distorted Islam and lets not forget the 19 terrorists were Saudi citizen along with Bin Laden . So who is the terrorising there people ??? Bahrain : A dot of a country with over 40 percent Arab Shia 's , 30 percent foreigners and 30 percent Suni 's . The country that is surviving on Saudi money and US tax dollars . Where will the Kingdom go ???? they loathe the Saudi 's that feed them . Who is killing the Bahrain people ? The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia sent Pakistani born solders to do the genocide ... and the Pakistani police is doing the killing in hospitals . What do we do ? Nothing just wait and see . Bahrain has no OIL just some stupid pearls . Chechnya : Oh no ! Russia is a rather strong nation and they are after all , simply `` defending themselves '' against those `` Muzlem terrorists '' in Chechnya . China : A country that has woken up and will be taking on the world . China is a matured country but do they trust us ? What happened to Qinjiang and Tibet ? we do n't hear of them even the Dalal Lama is retiring , what happened to all the human right issues that we use to hear ? We were sure the Muzlem Uighurs in Qinjiang were `` terrorists '' and we hear no protests from the Tibetans . Israel they are not technically killing its own people , they are simply killing people under its occupation . Who cares about Palestinians they are all terrorist resisting the occupation and not cooperation . the Chairman of the WA State Republican Party said , `` I think there is something in the DNA of the Arabs that makes them violent '' . No he is not a raciest he was stating a FACT , had he said this about Jewish brothers next door that would be `` RACIEST '' . He would be out of sacked , shoed , kicked out , spat on out of office like the Designer for House Dior few weeks back . Iran : Oh yes , Iranians ! Those Mullahs and Ahmeda whats his name should be blasted out of existence because they are a threat to Israel , I mean , the whole world ! They have WMDs , nukes and all that bad and evil things , beside the leader has beedie eyes that shine like a monkey and Sara Pailen can not get his spelling right or pronounce his name so lets attack Iran this will keep the Middle East conflict and a little longer the Kingdom of Saudi can hold on to his golden toilet and Israel can occupy Libya and Egypt and Sara Palen , Trump and Newt can run the White House . The Iranian are all `` terrorist '' though they have never occupied any country or attacked any of it 's neighbors and 54 percent of it 's women have university degrees . -LRB- This must fear Pailen -RRB- The Iranian are Arin 's not Arabs but this does not matter we still do n't like them . Ivory Coast : Ouch , do they have oil or not ? This little country should probably be left to settle its own problems , What are we world 's the Security for the world ? India : India is a democracy country and the Kashmiri people are after all , `` Muzlem terrorists '' . We simply do not have the resources to engage all countries in the world . Beside we ca n't fight all the curry smelling people . Pakistan : Pakistan is where our tax dollars is going feeding Zardari and friends build there palaces in England and Dubai . We do n't need to attack Pakistan they are eliminating innocent people for $ $ $ they just call the dead terrorist . Who is going to identify them ? They let the US drones bring down the whole village while Zardari son studies poetry at Oxford waiting for his father to abdicate before he is called King . Long live corruption but who cares we are getting the Al quidas out ! Sri Lanka : What genocide ? this completely is a UN issue and they are busy in Haiti right now , short staffed because of all the conflict and earthquakes . Yemen : Dear Lord Yemen , against the worst `` terrorists '' . If Yemen falls , then Al-Qaeda will take over and we need to maintain a low , low profile . The Yemenis will bring the Kingdom of Saudi down right after the flood and storms on a Friday . Friday prays will be soon banned in Saudi Arabia after this predication and that black cat under the stairs will be brought to trial in Court . Libya : OK so what 's going on in Libya ? We can not get Gaddafi out because we need to bombed Libya flat into the ground then take Gaddafi alive with his son , his wives , his nurses and all his female body guard to the Hague and given him proper treatment and justly try them in court that will take years and cost millions of dollars and some get very rich . While we will build Libya we will take it 's oil in exchange . You make me sick Piers . The US got into WW11 because Germany was bombing the British . We saved Britain and most of Europe . Now when the Libyans ask for our help you are calling us wrong . Kadafi is killing his own people instead of giving them a Democratic government . He closed the hospitals for God 's sake . He is ignorant monster . You were probably born 20 years after the war because we took to the air . The Guy who Helped Bush-Cheney attack Iraq on false pretenses killing 1 million Iraqis ? The Same Paul Wolfowitz who gave a commencement speech on June 2001 PREDICTING 9\\/11 ? Piers ... you are not an American so perhaps you are the wrong man for the job . Press in the USA serves as watchdog not as Ministry of Propoganda . Wolfowitz is a war criminal responsible for 9\\/11 as sure as Alquaida is ! -LRB- required , but will not be displayed -RRB- CNN welcomes a lively and courteous discussion as long as you follow the Rules of Conduct set forth in our Terms of Service .

The two images of an area of Zawiya , west of Tripoli , were taken February 20 and March 20 , according to the source , who provided them on condition of anonymity . In the first picture , a mosque can clearly be seen just south of Zawiya 's Martyrs ' Square , but in the later picture , the mosque is gone . The images , the source said , were released as part of the international effort to build pressure on Gadhafi and to illustrate what coalition members say are crimes against his own people . Pro- Gadhafi forces retook Zawiya this month after defeating rebel forces there . What are U.S. expectations for Libya ? CNN could not verify the authenticity of the images , nor when they were taken . The images were provided to CNN at a time when there is some wavering of support from within the Arab League for the coalition military effort . The image of a mosque that may have been destroyed by Gadhafi loyalists may provoke angst in the Arab and Muslim world . A CNN team that was in Zawiya both before and after government forces retook the city confirmed the mosque served as a makeshift clinic as well as a rallying point and command center for the resistance . The mosque was badly damaged during fighting to retake the city , the CNN team reported . CNN 's Tommy Evans and John King contributed to this report .

But in the specific case of Libya , the caution can be confusing : Try as we might , there 's no way to keep American participation in any military action in the back seat , no matter who flies the first planes . There 's no way to ensure that any multilateral coalition works . And , most important : Is there a way to leave if Gadhafi stays ? And if we win -LRB- whatever that means -RRB- , who 's left ? Who are the Libyan rebels , if they are anything cohesive at all ? And what if the civil war flares up after we tamp it down ? Is that our problem ? Or some other country 's problem ? Clearly , the ambiguity is exactly what Obama was trying to avoid . Gadhafi is a brutal dictator , an international outlaw , and a sponsor of terrorism with gallons of American and other blood on his hands . Thus , to the question , is it in America 's vital interests to see Gadhafi go , the answer can only be `` yes . '' What could very well be worse than taking out Gadhafi now would be a surviving , embittered and emboldened Gadhafi dictator having survived and prevailed over another U.S. attack -- a hero-dictator willing to link up with other terrorist organizations or states set on attacking the United States and the West . The rest of the world is watching how we follow through with Libya . Leaving Gadhafi in power , yet again , will send precisely the wrong message to others in his league -- be they terrorist dictators in Iran or elsewhere . There is no question -- Col. Moammar Gadhafi is committing atrocious acts of violence against his own people . President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton should be commended for working with the United Nations and our allies to shape a strong international response . With that said , I am very concerned that the president committed America 's military to operations in the region without true consultation with the Congress . Call this what they will , we are waging war -- while still engaged on two other fronts -- which will likely require substantial resources over a long period of time . Assuming the opposition forces are safe in Benghazi , then what must be done to protect civilians in those towns previously held by the opposition but have now been retaken by Gadhafi 's forces ? Presumably some U.N. presence must enter these areas and work to identify and protect civilians . This will likely be resisted by Gadhafi and could spur further conflict . Will the U.N. and the coalition be satisfied with a political stalemate on the ground , in which the eastern portion of the country achieves de facto and de jure independence ? The cease-fire called for in the resolution would seem to rule out any renewed offensive activity by the opposition . So unless there is some means to apply additional leverage , there may be two Libyas : one a vengeful dictatorship , the other a fledgling democracy needing long-term international protection . The head-snapping change in policy toward Libya has everyone guessing where the Mideast is heading , whether the U.S. has a good handle , and most of all , what President Obama is trying to achieve ... Will we be caught in increasing contradictions between our policy in Libya -LRB- crack down on an enemy government that kills demonstrators -RRB- vs. Bahrain and Yemen -LRB- go easy on a friendly government that kills demonstrators -RRB- ... The big question mark is the president himself . Rebounding from his electoral defeats last November , he seemed to be asserting a much firmer grasp on power , but in recent weeks , he appears to outsiders as someone who has slipped back into a haze of caution . The Economist this week is even questioning his political courage . As he sends U.S. troops into harm 's way , many in Washington are now waiting to see which Obama now emerges . Much rides on the outcome . The military intervention that President Obama authorized against Libya on Saturday -- eight years to the day after President George W. Bush announced the commencement of `` Operation Iraqi Freedom '' -- is a quite different operation from the 2003 invasion of Iraq . Beyond the obvious difference that Obama has not authorized the use of U.S. ground forces in Libya , there are other differences to consider : First , the Obama administration was handed a gift by the Arab League , which in its more than six-decade history has garnered a well-earned reputation as a feckless talking shop , but unusually took a stand one week ago by endorsing a no-fly zone over Libya . The unexpected action by the Arab League gave the administration the impetus and diplomatic cover to then go to the United Nations Security Council to secure a broad resolution endorsing not only a no-fly zone , but also allowing member states to `` take all necessary measures '' to protect civilians in Libya . This is in contrast to George W. Bush 's ineffectual attempts to gather international support for the invasion of Iraq in 2003 . There was no U.N. resolution explicitly authorizing the use of military force against Hussein , and no Muslim countries participated in the American invasion and occupation of Iraq .

NEW : Officials invite journalists to tour damaged house , but ca n't find it Tripoli suburb of Tajura is struck , a government official says Coalition effort is not `` a land invasion , '' according to U.S. official Hospital patients and doctors paralyzed by fear Tune in to `` AC360 '' for the latest on the airstrikes in Libya . Watch `` AC360 '' at 10 p.m. ET Wednesday on CNN . Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The coalition air effort to halt the Libyan government 's attacks on civilians continued into Thursday for a sixth day , with an airstrike in the Tripoli suburb of Tajura , a government official said . On Wednesday night , the government reported that military and civilian locations in the neighborhood of Al-Jfara and in the Tagora district of the capital had been struck by `` crusading colonial '' bombardment . In response , Joint Task Force Operation Odyssey Dawn Lt. Cmdr. Jim Hoeft said in an e-mail to CNN , `` It is not likely that civilians were a part of any airstrike today . '' He said coalition forces `` have been using all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Libya from the violence and killing inflicted upon them by Colonel Gadhafi . '' An opposition activist in Tripoli accused state media of lying about civilian victims of the coalition airstrikes . For example , she said , she was accompanying a cousin to a hospital for medical care when she saw a TV producer asking some people to close their eyes and play dead and others to pretend they were wounded . Some of the `` wounded , '' she said , were soldiers in civilian garb . Rebels help rescue U.S. serviceman People appeared apprehensive , anxious . Opponents of Gadhafi were afraid to speak publicly . In Ajdabiya , parts of the city fell to opposition forces even though Gadhafi 's men , who had been pounding the area with artillery and heavy tank bombardments , retained control of the northern and western gates , opposition fighters and witnesses told CNN . A hospital staffer and opposition fighters said nine people were killed Wednesday in fighting near the northern gate . So far , the coalition has crippled the Libyan air force , and established a no-fly zone that spans Libya from east to west along its coastline , said U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Gerard Hueber . Hueber , the chief of staff for U.S. operations said Wednesday that coalition planes had flown 175 sorties over Libya -- 113 of them by U.S. planes . But the coalition had no indication that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was complying with a United Nations mandate to stop attacks against civilians . On Wednesday , troops loyal to Gadhafi terrorized residents of the besieged rebel-held city of Misrata . One witness said Gadhafi 's forces had attacked the city 's main hospital , where 400 people -- about half of them patients -- were located . The push began at 8 p.m. -LRB- 2 p.m. ET -RRB- , when `` heavy tanks for Gadhafi troops start attacking the hospital -- the bombs falling here 20 meters -LRB- 66 feet -RRB- around us , '' said one person inside the hospital . He said two deaths had occurred `` around the hospital . '' At one point , shelling occurred without respite for 40 minutes , he said . `` Now , fortunately , no more shelling , but the situation is so serious that all the teams here -- the doctors , the patients -- are paralyzed , scared . '' He called for international intervention to protect the civilians inside the institution . `` Nobody can work here , '' he said . Ambulances were not able to leave the hospital , which had lost its electricity and was using generator power , he said . Coalition jets are using smart bombs to target mechanized forces and mobile surface-to-air missile sites and impede supply lines for their `` beans and bullets , '' Hueber said . The targets include Libya 's premier 32nd Brigade , commanded by one of Gadhafi 's sons and fully engaged in the fighting . `` It 's an extremely complex and difficult environment , '' Hueber said about going after forces in populated areas . Gadhafi : ` We will be victorious ' Santorum : Mission confusion in Libya Obama hopes Libyan rebels will organize Inside bombed Libyan military base `` And our primary focus is to interdict those forces before they enter the city ... cut off their lines of communication and cut off their command and control , '' he said . `` There have been no reports of civilian casualties . Our mission here is to protect the civilian populace and we choose our targets and plan our actions with that as our top priority . '' Wednesday night 's outbreak of violence broke a respite that began earlier in the day with the coalition attacks -- the first calm in a week , Misrata residents reported . `` We would like to express our gratitude to the international community since there were airstrikes this morning , '' said Mohammed , an opposition spokesman in the city who would identify himself only by his first name . Gadhafi 's forces had been stationed on the outskirts of the city , where they were providing support and supplies to loyalists fighting rebels in Misrata proper . Earlier in the day , grocery stores and other shops opened in the city , which is located two hours east of Tripoli and has been inaccessible to journalists . One person inside the hospital told CNN that five more people were killed in the last 24 hours , raising the death toll to at least 95 in the last seven days . A man who died Wednesday morning was shot by a sniper , the person said . Gen. Abdul Fatah Younis , a former interior minister who quit to lead opposition forces , said rebels have requested weapons from several nations to help the embattled city . `` Misrata is destroyed and they need weapons , '' Younis told CNN . `` We try to send them weapons , but of course they were all light weapons . There were no heavy weapons . '' Asked about the situation in Misrata , Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communications Ben Rhodes said , `` We 're concerned about it , but I think you 're actually seeing some indications that the effort of the coalition is ... focused on Misrata and is having an effect there . '' The rapid advance of Libyan forces had been halted , particularly their move toward the nation 's second-largest city , Benghazi , Rhodes told reporters aboard Air Force One . Libya 's elite forces are drawn from tribes loyal to Gadhafi . Though they comprise no more than 10,000 men , those forces are on the offense , Hueber said . `` Those forces are fully-engaged in this conflict , that are attacking those civilian populations , '' he added . Though the rebels are in a better position than they were a few days ago , the Gadhafi forces have the upper edge , a U.S. official said . They remain capable of carrying out attacks on the opposition , are relatively well-organized and continue to fight effectively , the official said . Rhodes predicted the transition of command and control to another entity would be effected in `` a matter of days . '' NATO will likely play a key role in the command and control , he said , adding that he would not describe the conflict as `` an open-ended war , a land invasion in Libya . '' The international airstrikes against Libyan military positions began over the weekend after Gadhafi defied a United Nations-mandated cease-fire in attacks against civilians . The strikes are intended to help establish a no-fly zone . Sweden announced Wednesday it has frozen more than $ 1.53 billion in Libyan assets in response to EU sanctions imposed on the northern African country . France launched the air campaign in Libya and Britain and the United States followed . Germany is not participating in the military action , though it agrees with the United Nations resolution in principle , and moved Wednesday to ensure that its ships were far removed from the Libyan campaign . A German navy spokesman said Wednesday that all German ships previously under NATO command in the Mediterranean Sea were reassigned to operate under national command and are returning to previously scheduled port stops in Europe to await further instructions . German crew members of NATO fighter jets were also under German command . Britain has announced an international meeting for next Tuesday to assess the situation in Libya . The war was sparked in February by protests demanding an end to Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule . The Libyan strongman responded with force against civilians , prompting the international community to take action . However , a Johns Hopkins University professor said the coalition can achieve only so much through aerial strikes . `` We have to understand the limits of what air power can do , '' Fouad Ajami told CNN 's `` AC360 . '' `` This is a recipe for a stalemate , '' he said . Criticism and questions persist about the international campaign , with no clear answer on who will take over command of the mission and what the exit strategy will be . U.S. President Barack Obama said the timetable for a transition of military leadership will be coming in days , not weeks . NATO said Wednesday it will decide shortly what its role in the operation will be . A spokesman added the alliance is well prepared . `` This is the bread and butter of NATO , '' an official said . French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has voiced his opposition to NATO taking political leadership over the Libya campaign . He suggested that a commission composed of foreign ministers from the participating states play that role . Ajami , however , said the Arab world would welcome NATO involvement . `` They know that the calamity is unfolding in Libya , and they know that no help is going to come other than from the West and from the United States . '' British Prime Minister David Cameron said Wednesday that Kuwait and Jordan have agreed to provide logistical support to the Libyan effort . Jordanian government spokesman Taher Edwan told CNN that Jordan 's role will be limited to a humanitarian one . `` Jordan did not and will not have any military participation in Libya , neither in planes or on the ground at all in Libya , '' he said . Qatar has already contributed planes to mission . The United Arab Emirates said Tuesday it will participate -- but only in providing humanitarian assistance . Toward that end , the country has sent a ship and two planes with basic relief supplies , the country 's news agency said .

In a 13-minute interview with CNN 's Spanish-language network , Obama said the immediate goal of the U.N.-sanctioned military mission that began Saturday was to prevent an onslaught of the rebel stronghold of Benghazi by Gadhafi 's military . `` Because the international community rallied , his troops have now pulled back from Benghazi , '' Obama said . Now the United States and its coalition partners , including NATO allies and Arab states , are establishing a no-fly zone over Libya , with U.S. forces taking out Gadhafi 's air defense systems , Obama said . He conceded that Gadhafi could `` hunker down and wait it out even in the face of a no-fly zone , even though his forces have been degraded . '' Obama hopes Libyan rebels will organize Obama on Libya : We have saved lives Gadhafi ` not backing down one-inch ' Critics : U.S. ca n't afford Libya mission `` Our hope is that the first thing that happens once we clear this space is that the rebels start discussing how they 're able to organize themselves , how they articulate their aspirations for the Libyan people , '' Obama said . `` Potentially what we may see is all the enthusiasm that the Libyan people had for a change in government that was occurring a few weeks ago , '' but was brutally repressed by Gadhafi , can now resurface , the president said . In particular , Obama said he hoped that the Libyan people decide it was time for a change that ends up sweeping Gadhafi from power . The president acknowledged the irony of being a Nobel Peace Prize winner who ordered the U.S. military into action on the eight anniversary of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq , but said the goal in this case was humanitarian . `` I 'm accustomed to this contradiction of being both a commander-in-chief but also somebody who aspires to peace , '' Obama said , adding the Libya mission was to protect the Libyan people from Gadhafi 's military . `` We 're not invading a country ; we are not acting alone , '' he said . `` We are acting under a mandate issued by the U.N. Security Council . '' The American people will see no contradiction between someone who believes in peace and `` who wants to make sure people are n't butchered because of a dictator who wants to cling to power , `` Obama added . Speaking in El Salvador on the final leg of a three-nation Latin American trip that included stops in Brazil and Chile , Obama also cited what he called a new relationship between the United States and the region to the south . He noted that an area once known for dictatorships and coups now featured democratic governments that were less focused on political ideology and more focused on results in helping their people . `` That 's the kind of partner we want , '' Obama said , describing the relationship as a `` two-way street '' based on mutual respect , interests and trust , rather than the old model of underdeveloped nations approaching the United States with `` hat in hand . '' Asked about immigration reform back home , Obama said he would again make the push for a comprehensive bill . `` I 'm going to need some help , '' he said . `` I can get the majority of Democrats to support it . I need some help from Republicans . '' With last year 's census results showing a growing Hispanic population in the United States , Obama said Republicans will have a hard time winning future elections if they focus on anti-immigration sentiment .

'' He was talking about the coalition attacks on Moammar Gadhafi 's forces in Libya , why the United States was still in control , why tensions are rising among members of the coalition , why there 's no plan for any group or nation to take the lead . The allies , you see , are n't getting along so well . In fact , there are reports today that the coalition is falling apart . France yesterday suggested a committee be formed - outside of NATO - to oversee the military operations . It would be a political steering committee and would include members of the Arab League . See if a committee is running the war , no one has to take responsibility if things go to hell and everyone can take credit if they go well . The French were early backers of the no-fly zone and were the first nation to launch airstrikes against Libya on Saturday . The Italians have accused the French of not originally backing a NATO-run operation to be in a better position for oil contracts when a new government is established in Libya . It 's not just the French causing problems Russia 's defense minister yesterday called for a cease-fire in Libya . Germany today pulled its naval ships out of NATO operations in the Mediterranean over a disagreement over the Libyan campaign 's direction . It 's not pretty . Foreign ministers from Western coalition partners will meet in London Tuesday along with members of the Arab League and the African Union to see what can be done . Here s my question to you : France wants a committee to run the war in Libya . Is that a good idea ? Interested to know which ones made it on air ? Yes , I think it is a good idea . Handing command over to Allied forces shows solidarity . Let the allies figure this one out for a a change . Hopefully they will decide to drop a missile on Gadhafi himself so this thing will come to a swift end . You 've got to be kidding . A camel is a horse designed by a committee . This won t come out as good . We 've done our part . We should tell the coalition they have 48 hrs to take over and then we 're gone , whether they have something in place or not . This is the first conflict in recent memory where no one has a plan , everyone is passing the buck , no one knows the players and no one knows the end-game . All we know for certain is that we have wasted a vast amount of expensive cruise missiles . The replacement costs are extraordinarily high and this approach depletes our stockpile . Where is the sense in this approach ? I 'm all for propping up democracies , supporting freedom and liberty , but where is the plan ? Jack , how many people have to die before the coalition gets rid of the problem in Libya , whether accidentally or purposely ? Gadhafi must go , hopefully sooner than later . Maje in Vancouver , British Columbia : It 's a great idea if you want to see the Odyssey Dawn crew out-daffy Gadhafi ! I can see it all now : Inspector Clouseau draws up the battle plans and Mr. Bean leads Larry , Moe and Curly in the charge . And the wacky Libyan colonel dies laughing . I worked with an American subsidiary of a French company for fifteen years , and this is so typical , not just of the French , but of the Europeans in general . This is a bad , bad , bad idea . Define the objective , put an American in charge , and Get ' r done . As long as we get to move out and let others have control , with little to no involvement , sounds good to me ... committee away ! Fantastic idea as long as they do n't use assets\\/resources from the United States . Its amazing how many good ideas come to light when another country -LRB- s -RRB- is footing the bill . The United Nations is a good example as all of their projects are either partially or fully funded by the west . Jack : Leadership by committee is not a good idea . Its lead , follow , or get the hell out of the way . The military lives and works by a chain of command or commanders to accomplish a common purpose mission . The idea of leadership by committee reminds me of the United States Senate where there are alot of ideas , but little is accomplished . The military needs one action commander not a committee . March 23 , 2011 at 1:46 pm | If the committee is Obama style , a gathering of the best expertise from war departments and State Departments , yes that 's fine , but a la Obama there must be a Chairperson who synthesizes the committee 's determinations . March 23 , 2011 at 1:54 pm | I hope so americans are war sick . We cannt stop every bad guy . March 23 , 2011 at 2:06 pm | I think we should just let France run it , and back out entirely now . We do n't need to get involved in another open-ended costly boondoggle , especially when we do n't know what kind of people we 'd be helping replace Khaddafi . They could be Islamic radicals for all we know . It 's very unlikely they 'll create a Western-style secular democracy , though . And since Republicans in Congress refuse to raise taxes , I 'd hate to have to explain to Grandma that they 're going to cut her Social Security check to pay for this . March 23 , 2011 at 2:11 pm | Nothing of that magnitude can succeed without an intelligent Committee from all the countries issuing orders . March 23 , 2011 at 2:13 pm | Good for France , but bad for military action . I have a better idea , let the French take the lead and see whether they 've learned their lessons from Viet Nam and Algeria . March 23 , 2011 at 2:18 pm | If having a committee run the war in Libya means not putting a western label on the war then it 's a good idea . It is time for the United States to take a backseat . We have already bitten off more than we can chew by being involved in two wars . March 23 , 2011 at 2:22 pm | Yes , that way the US will not have to take all the blame for the action taken . March 23 , 2011 at 2:30 pm | Yes , I think it is a good idea . Handing command over to Allied forces shows soloidarity . Let the allies figure this one out for a a change . Hopefully they will decide to drop a missile on Gadafy himself so this thing will come to a swift end . Saving more lives , time and money . March 23 , 2011 at 2:33 pm | It 's a great idea if you want to see the Odyssey Dawn crew out-daffy Ghadafi ! I can see it all now : Inspector Clouseau draws up the battle plans and Mr. Bean leads Larry , Moe and Curly in the charge . And the whacky Libyan colonel dies laughing . March 23 , 2011 at 2:37 pm | Committees do not make executive decisions . They debate and debate like the UN , then pass resolutions . This is a baaaad idea . Now you know why U.S. leadership is indispensable . Without it , the rest of the world is confused and lost . March 23 , 2011 at 2:37 pm | Oh great -- that is just what we need . We ca n't get things right when we run the war now we need a committee -- let France deal with it . Throughout history war conducted by a committee will almost always end in disaster ! One of the principles of war that has been taught since the days of Clausewitz is `` Unity of Command . '' Only ONE person is in charge of a military operation if you want a chance to be successful . March 23 , 2011 at 2:54 pm | What 's next , going to the U.N. to ask permission to raise taxes ?? Worldwide leadership has reached an all time low . Washington , Churchill , and Eisenhower must be rolling over in their graves . March 23 , 2011 at 3:02 pm | We do n't need a committe to run the war in libya . We need a committe to end the war in libya , iraq , afghanistan , and pakistan . Time to stop the bombings , killings , and assasinations of people in other countries we do n't like . The entire defense and supplemental war budget is borrowed money . Gaddafi blew up one plane , the u.s. has blow up thousands of planes , and buildings . The u.s. military killed a million people in iraq , nuked hundreds of thousands of japanese civilians with 2 nuclear bombs and yet we have the nerve to call gadaffi a mad man . The rebels in libya drew first blood so it is their mess to clean up not some french fry committee . March 23 , 2011 at 3:03 pm | John Moore - New Britain , PA It is well proven that a committee can not run anything . Just as there can only be one chef -LRB- french for chief -RRB- in the kitchen there has to be a visible leader for this Libyan campaign . March 23 , 2011 at 3:07 pm | Good idea as long it is not the U.S. leading , late France and the U.K. lead it is there OIL ! It does n't matter , a committe or take turns , it should be an easy mission that does not take a rocket scientist to figure a strategy to check Khadafy . Its seems like its only the people out for a political game thats trying to muddy the waters . March 23 , 2011 at 3:13 pm | Committee to do what ? The only thing that needs to be done is to Remove the tyrant from office Dead or Alive ! March 23 , 2011 at 3:19 pm | I can just imagine what a guy like General George Patton would think of an idea like that : A committee Jack , A COMMITTEE - Not on your life . If a committee had been running the war in Europe 67 years ago , Paris would still be in Nazi hands and the French would be speaking German . No wonder France has n't won a war in over a hundred years . Could France also have a commitee run a war in Ruwanda , Darfur , Congo , Uganda , Ethiopia , Somalia , Zimbabwe , Togo , Burundi , Liberia , Botswana , Colombia , Afghanistan , Palestine , after all they civilian massacres everyday ... , ah , maybe they dont have that much Oil to share with France , does really France care about Libyan civilians ? Mike from NYC March 23 , 2011 at 3:31 pm | Of course it 's a good idea . NATO has worked together for more than a half century . There are decent and capable people in every chair . Let the America Firsters go to work building a wall around the country and begin on the part that extends westward from Southern California to surround Hawaii . I 'll buy the scuba gear , but no air tanks . France wants a committee to run the war in Libya . Is that a good idea ? Sounds to me like France just expected the US to take the lead and they were sadly mistaken . So instead of taking the lead they pass it off on others . So typical , no one wants to take responsibility for anything these days . The only one who laid it out as it is was President Obama , . He told the world that this was not our `` war '' that we were only in a supporting role and would not take the lead . I believe we just let France run the entire war and bring all of our troops home . This entire issue is just another way to stimulate the economy and take peoples mind off of the real issues in America , jobs and education . March 23 , 2011 at 3:38 pm | Cliff Glass - Rego Park , New York What a novel concept . Allies equally sharing cost , risk , and responsibility for a global military action . Neocons , take cover , American exceptionalism is definitely under attack . March 23 , 2011 at 3:53 pm | If you want to see the results of committee rule look at the U.N. Security Council . If that does n't scare you check out the NATO Council of Ministers . Both are great examples of cowardice and ineptitude . If there is a concil running the show I hope we pull out completely . March 23 , 2011 at 3:56 pm | As long as we get to move out and let others have control , with little to no involvement , sounds good to me ... committee away ! March 23 , 2011 at 3:59 pm | Excuse my confusion , Jack , but are we , along with France et al , `` at war '' with Libya ? Did I miss the declaration of war on Libya by Congress and Obama ? If indeed we are in another Mid-East war , then we should not be debating who should `` run '' the war and quickly and completely crush the Libyan army and its commander in chief , Gadhafi without debate or hesitation . Either we are at war or we are not . To play politics with our troops , Libya 's people without total commitment is a crime in itself . Either commit to war and victory or get the hell out . Gadhafi and his army should have been history by now if we were committed to doing so . Are we indeed at war with Libya , Jack ? If you want an issue to be killed , all you have to do is assign it to a committee . They will kick it around until it changes shape so bad that you ca n't recognize the original issue . Most committees ca n't control themselve let along assignments\\/issues assigned to them . March 23 , 2011 at 4:04 pm | We have plenty of committees in this country and they ca n't get anything done efficiently . So yeah running a war in Libya by committee should be great . Can only imagine how messy this will be in a couple months . March 23 , 2011 at 4:05 pm | Joe Ft Walton Bch Fl It is a very good idea , if they all decide to take him down . Gaddafi got to go now , if not what have we accomplish . ? March 23 , 2011 at 4:08 pm | Why not what a great idea work as a team something the USA lost long ago by the outsource idea that now seems to have been to optimistic to say the least . Any large project should work as a committee otherwise known as a team . I think the `` team '' should go for it . March 23 , 2011 at 4:13 pm | Skarkosy wanted this thing to increase his political clout in an upcoming election . If he wants to cash in on the glory , he should do the heavy lifting . March 23 , 2011 at 4:22 pm | Only if the committee does not include us let the rest of the world handle Libya . We have no real interest there but France does , so let them do the heavy lifting for once . I m tired of fighting everyone else s battles for them . March 23 , 2011 at 4:26 pm | Dee in New Paris Ohio Do you mean that France wants the U.S. to commit to helping them run the war in Libya ? Or do you mean that FRANCE wants to commit to running the war but wants all the other nations that signed on o commit ? Anyway , what I want to know is , between France , the U.S. , and all the other U.N. nations who are willing to help get rid of Gadhafi , what 's the holdup ? How can it be that Libya has not already been conquered and the despot got rid of ? It does not give one a lot of confidence in the ability of the allies if between them they have not accomplished their goal . March 23 , 2011 at 4:28 pm | What doesFrance want ? A committe of Western coalisions , a committe of Arab c ountries , or a combination of those ? We are already talking about war . Where it is going to end is every ones guess . The only solution , of course , would be to catch the dictator , a sly and cruel fox , and cookoo to boot . The International court will be impatiently waiting to get its hands on the man . The U.N contract ONLY has issued the R2P -LRB- Resolution to Protect -RRB- Even that may prove extremely difficult to do without `` collateral damage '' . I have a feeling that the President has been co-erced in taking a military roll in this adventure . The U.S.A. should have stayed OUT of it , lest it will later be pilloried by the Arabs who found some fault in the countries engament . , something THEY should have wanting to tackle . Unfortunately they dislike each other more than anybody else . March 23 , 2011 at 4:37 pm | What war or even what military action was ever successfully commanded by a committee ? What is needed is another Eisenhower . March 23 , 2011 at 4:39 pm | A war run by committee ? If people think the `` plan '' is cockeyed now , give the `` committee '' a chance . March 23 , 2011 at 4:53 pm | Well , since the only person from the United States who has demonstrated ANY leadership whatsoever during this war is President , Hillary Clinton , perhaps a `` committe '' is the solution to this whole mess ! I wonder , which community organizer suggested the creation of a committie ? March 23 , 2011 at 4:58 pm | This kind of stuff is the reason you have your ducks in a row before you act . But no , a committee is a terrible idea . You ever want to see how effective committees are , take a look at any government . March 23 , 2011 at 4:59 pm | Looks like we have a `` food fight '' going on in Europe . Forming a commitee-sounds like our Congress in action . Gadhafi is probably laughing inside his bunker . Meanwhile Russia and China are sounding `` high and mighty . '' If this is the `` new world order '' , I do n't think I want to be part of it . March 23 , 2011 at 5:01 pm | Well , why not ! war is a business , kind of like congress is . Why not run it like one ? We can have committees , subcommittees , committee chairpersons , secretaries who secretly run things , vice-president of important stuff , keeper of the keys , bullet managers ... well , you get my drift ! March 23 , 2011 at 5:08 pm | Yes , it is a wonderful idea . The United States has proven its bravery , courage , and resolve time and time again . We have nothing left to prove . It makes since both financially and politically . Financially , it is time other countries help foot the bill when we are called on to stop a dictator from mass murdering his own people . Politically , it lets the world know we are not the only ones sick and tired of these murderous thugs committing genocide . We do n't need any more PR . As Ann Landers used to say , `` it is better to keep your mouth shut and be thought a fool than to open it and prove it . '' Absolutely !! Hold a meeting , form a committee , anything to make it look like someone is doing something to justify transferring money from the taxpayers into corporate coffers . March 23 , 2011 at 5:13 pm | Fabulous idea . Let France do it for a change . Time for America to stay out of other countries that hate us anyway . March 23 , 2011 at 5:16 pm | Yes , it is a wonderful idea . The United States has proven its bravery , courage , and resolve time and time again . We have nothing left to prove . It makes since both financially and politically . Financially , it is time other countries help foot the bill when we are called on to stop a dictator from mass murdering his own people . Politically , it lets the world know we are not the only ones sick and tired of these murderous thugs committing genocide . We do n't need any more PR . As Ann Landers used to say , `` it is better to keep your mouth shut and be thought a fool than to open it and prove it . '' P.S. I also like Wolf 's idea of withholding Lybian funds to pay for our involvement in this fray . March 23 , 2011 at 5:16 pm | Sure . France has such an outstanding record in military actions in the past couple of centuries . Let 's listen to them on matters military . March 23 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | Rather than a `` committee '' how about a bureau ? We can call it the `` Bureau of Misplaced Priorities . '' March 23 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | It is a great idea . This operation would n't have begun without France and the French have the most interest in Libya . US has little interest in being involved and it gives them an easy exit strategy to let others lead . If France wants to take the ball , let them have it . No one else does . March 23 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | of course its not !!! the military although it may defend democracy is not one itself . there are decisions which must be made immediately and you just cant do that with a fractured committee . peoples lives depend on quick action and ive never seen a committee that was able to do that . March 23 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | I think it is a good Idea since the US does n't have it 's house in order , maybe some other country will do a better job . Maybe a country that is n't into debt `` clear up to it 's eyeballs '' would be a good choice for the leadership role . March 23 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | Yes Jack By all means put the French in charge . They have a long history of surrenders and defeats . In no time at all The Colonel will be drinking French wine while his body guards shop in Paris . March 23 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | I dont know if that would work . We seem to be close to pulling out and the French are becoming . . well , the French to be honest . Why would Russia even speak out about this ? They abstained from the vote when they could have voted against it . March 23 , 2011 at 5:20 pm | If France suggested it , I would be against it automatically . When did France ever do anything that smelled anything like success , since Napoleon 's time , as far as war efforts are concerned ? March 23 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Yes . This committee is called the United Nations and I am grateful that America is now supporting the vision of a strong United Nations . Please stop over-analyzing this no-fly zone , the immediate purpose is to save Libyan citizens from being slaughtered by a dictator . March 23 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Sure Jack , a committee sounds like a wonderful idea . Let 's put a committee in charge where people can talk for days and no actual action be taken . There 's a reason why the military does n't use committees . March 23 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Remo , from beautiful downtown Pflugerville Texas Jack , you 've got to wacth the French , they 'll want to surrender to Libya next . Well that has been their history . We should n't have stuck our necks in there in the first place . And we are there in an illegal manner . For a president who `` boasts doing thing right '' , he sure as hell tends to do the opposite . March 23 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | How French ! No wonder they have n't won a war in forever . Someone has to be in charge -- whether in the newsroom or the battlefield . -LRB- I 'm a retired US Military officer who studied at the French Army Staff School in France and worked at our Embassy in Paris . I can assure you this is a ` political ' statement and did not originate from French Military officers . March 23 , 2011 at 5:21 pm | Wow ! I worked with an American subsidiary of a French company for fifteen years , and this is so typical , not just of the French , but of the Europeans in general . This is a bad , bad , bad idea . Define the objective , put an American in charge , and Get ' r done . A Committee !!!!!!!! You 've got to be kidding . A camel is a horse designed by a committee . This won come out as good . We 've done our part . We should tell the coalition they have 48 hrs to take over and then we 're gone , whether they have somthing in place or not was n't it the Frech who we bailed out in WWI ? Was n't it the French who insisted on the war reparations that set up Hitler 's rise to power ? Was n't it the French -LRB- Le Grand Charles -RRB- who were angry that we prevented new war reparations after WWII ? Then there was Dien Bein Phou . Obama better read some history and take charge ! March 23 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Absolutely . The question is , is the US going in as a bully oil mogul\\/occupier or to help democratically minded people set up a democracy . It 's best if we sit equally at the table with everyone else and abide by the opinion of consensus . March 23 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | This sandbox is the result of a President who has ZERO military experience . Come on folks -- when are we going to start requiring prior military service for the Office of Presidency ? It 's just common sense . Then again , we have n't seen much of that in quite some time now from any party ... March 23 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Let 's form a committee of intelligent military men and put Hillary Clinton in charge of all . She seems to be the only one in office that is where she 's supposed to be . March 23 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | It 's ok with me , Jack - as long as the US is not on the committee and we get the heck out of Libya and the other places we do n't belong . March 23 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | A committee o run this `` war '' in Libya would be a fantastic idea , as long as the United States does n't try and run it . Its about time that someone else step up to the challenge of trying to be World Peace Keeper ! But if they need the muscle the US wont be too far behind ! March 23 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | CNN Jack Cafferty : France wants committee to run war in Libya . Jct : Under Khadafi , Libyans were burdened with no taxes , free health care , free education at home and abroad , lots to be rebelling against . I have no doubt the Committee will be able to `` raise '' them to the same standard of living as in the US . Har har har har har . March 23 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | Here we go again . I remember we went into Vietnam to help the French and once we did that , they promptly backed out leaving the US holding the proverbial bag Remember , history does repeat itself . First the UAE is MIA , now the collation is fracturing apart . So do we enter war # 4 ??? A no fly zone will Not oust Qaddafi from power . Qaddafi s ground forces are superior to the poorly equipped freedom-fighters which means there will ultimately be boots on the ground and now the question would be whose boots ? Which country will ultimately send in ground troops ? I vote NO American ground Military ! Enough is enough !! March 23 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | Jack , excluding every previous committee ever set up , how many have failed ? The very idea a bunch of French bureaucrats can win a war is absurd . March 23 , 2011 at 5:25 pm | If it 's a committee , how about calling it a `` C.R.I.M.E. '' - Committee Rationalizing Infiltrating Moammar 's Empire . First , why did we let the French pull our strings ? What have we ever learned from the French , accept how to lose ? NATO has to step forward and take the lead regardless of what others say . The Arab leagues that supported this U. N. resolution , needs to put up or shut up . They are just to worried about the backlash , but really do not want to defend the freedom that all humans seek . NATO has a chain of command , they need to use it , that is why we have NATO . People are dieing while the world including the U.S plays in politics . March 23 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | Sounds like France has never read `` The Art of War '' by Sun Tzu . One leader at the top -LRB- with advisors , but one leader is the only effective way to approach conflict . March 23 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | French is in favor of running everything with commitees . Which is excellent way of screwing a war effort beswides anything else . Reminds me of a joke : What is a Camel ? March 23 , 2011 at 5:26 pm | Establishing a committee shows how disorganised this coalition forces are . A no-fly zone headed by a committe , will have no effect . Gadaffi stands a good chance of winning this battle because he has shown leadership , and those trying to remove him , lack a clear vision . March 23 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | Regarding the recommendation for a committee to run the war . It should be a select group of Senators and Reps. My reason for suggesting this is that it would cost billions of dollars , take forever and six months , the war would be over by then which is okay since any plan these dolts come up with would n't work anyway March 23 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | Look at how politicians are running our government and then try to convience me that committee members from different nations can run a war like campaign . Moammar Gadhafi would probably die of old age before a committee would come to a concensus on the campaing . You know how politicians work together . March 23 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | No a good idea . President `` George W. '' Sarkozy of France is having a problem with re-election next year . He is trying to prop up his approval rating in France by being a cowboy . Why should we engage in a civil war in Libya ? Unlike Sadam , Gadafy is a appeaser of the West . Should we pull him down and replace by an Islamic alternative government , an Islam Republic of Libya ? March 23 , 2011 at 5:27 pm | It has been said that a horse is a camel built by committee . Suddenly the GOP wants answers about military actions ; funny they were n't so curious when furious George B. went to war because of his beliefs and false rumors . We need to finish the job and take Gadafhi out ! March 23 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | No one to blame if things go wrong . No one is responsible if things go right . Sounds like a win -- win to me ! March 23 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | No. . The U.N. has had more than a half century worth of experience dealing with these kind of problems . Will the committee handle the financing , logistics and take responsibility for civilian or other losses ? We have started a humanitarian effort to help the people in Libya as well as try to settle the unrest in the area to try and quell the speculators desire to raise oil prices . Which is in the U.S. 's and worlds best interest . This is a civil war in Libya . We have leveled the playing field and now it is up to the Libyans and their neighbors to fight for their Democracy and change ... March 23 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | If the `` politicians would turn over the war to the warriors like Pres. Bush did in the first gulf war , this one would be over with by now . Politics do n't win wars , they just prolong them March 23 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | It 's just another attempt by France to be politically safe at all costs . I ca n't remember the last time France had a `` good '' idea . It was France 's idea to warn Ghadafi when the U.S. tried to cut the head off of this snake more than 20 years ago . We should push France out of the equation altogether , since they have protected him in the past , and hand leadership to a country that has the least to gain from the whole situation , This would attempt to gain some form of political neutrality in the military decision making . Political and military decision making never go well together . March 23 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | No , this was France 's idea in the beginning . It was politicking all around . France just wants oil as usual and they will benefit from this the most this is why they convinced Hillary to convince obama to say yes to this crap . No one should ever trust the French when it comes to wars , did n't they abandon us in iraq when they realized people would die ? The French are only good at retreating . . punks the whole lot ! Also CNN stop telling Obama\\/what to do and outlining his agenda for him he is a grown man he knows what he is about . He talked to congressional leaders and now the tan man is having selective amnesia about it . March 23 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | A committee is always a good idea because a smaller group can accomplish more by coming into agreement quicker . If we get all countries on board with a committee then tensions will ease because everyone will feel like they are part of the oversight of this endeavor . This is new , but if other countries contribute resources then its a good thing . March 23 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | Absolutely a good idea . I love my country and respect the presidency , but this jerk and the last jerk attacked countries who did n't first attack us . We are supposed to believe in democracy , but it is not democratic to believe you can speak for other countries . Plus Obama needs to be more thoughtful of the American people whom he 's helping Bush bankrupt . March 23 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | Nurse Lisa in Shelton CT Sure France -- compile a committee . Hoping the US will not be on the committee nor footing any part of the financial burden of their efforts . Was mad about last weeks magical announcement about Daffy 's involvement in terrorist activities of the past -- like we did n't have this intel for yrs . The public never gets the truth , just the bills . March 23 , 2011 at 5:29 pm | Since everyone seems to think having Arab backing is needed , then I do n't see a better approach than the committee . If we had consulted with Congress before deploying the no-fly zone then we would not have needed the committee because the opposition forces would all be dead by now . There is a reason why the President is the Commander-in-Chief and not the Congress . So , France wants a committee to run the war in Libya . My only concern is that the US Congress might be involved in some way , shape or form . If that happens ... all is lost . If those bickering boneheads can be sidestepped ... hey , we just might see something work for a change . March 23 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | Everything is a bad idea , Jack . There are no solutions . They need dictators to function . They know no other way . But , where was Speaker Boehner -LRB- or however you spell his name -RRB- when the U.S. basically unilaterally launched a full scale war and occupation to follow on a country that did n't have anything to with anything ? March 23 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | That is not an excellent idea . We already have too many organizations . It will just lead to the already economic problems we face in this world today . We will see more bloodshed in this world . Why are we not making more organizations for world peace ? March 23 , 2011 at 5:33 pm | Why does Committee almost rhyme with dither . Committe also means that US forces will be commanded by nations that do n't care to much for us-The French among the others in the EU . I usually support Obama , yet this time he is foolish in not wanting to appear imperialistic . The timid cringe and make deals ; those that `` CAN DO '' make the rules and lead their lessers . The US is the only democracy in the coalition . Only the US has a First Amendment . So we also `` KNOW HOW '' . fn : US troops were under the UN command in Somalia ; That turned out really good ! Jack , we should n't be there at all ! We keep removing dictaters from power and destablizing the region I only want their Oil . I do n't care about them at all . Jack From Nice , Ca . March 23 , 2011 at 5:34 pm | If the strategy is anything other than get in , destroy all Libyan air forces and military vehicles where civilians are being slaughtered , and get out , then the coalition should disband . For people to even think about who gets oil from Libya at a time like this is beyond disgusting . I hate high gas prices , but I also ca n't stand those who look to profit because of others ' suffering . Are they actually thinking , these women and children are being slaughtered , but hey , at least I can make a few million dollars by getting first dibs on their oil ? If so , then we need to come up with a vaccine to protect the world from such ignorance . Ghadafi could be killed at any time with special forces , so no military action is needed to unseat him . Ghadafi is over confident and seems to think that he is immortal . He is a perfect target . He will soon realize that he is a spec and that his legacy is worthless . March 23 , 2011 at 5:35 pm | A committee ???? What is this ? Maybe it 's a good idea . We could abstain from every motion put forward . What happens if we do n't have a quorum ? They say that it was a committee that created the camel when they were trying to create a horse . ` nuff said March 23 , 2011 at 5:35 pm | Committee ? Your kidding me more . I am surprised they have not surrendered to Libya yet ... Someone is always in charge of a committee . So who chairs the committee ? March 23 , 2011 at 5:36 pm | Absolutely a good idea . I love my country and respect the presidency , but this and the last president attacked countries who did n't attack us . We are supposed to believe in democracy , but it is not democratic to believe you can speak for other countries . Plus Obama needs to be more thoughtful of the American people whom he 's helping Bush bankrupt . March 23 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | When you say , `` It 's not just the French causing problems ... '' and then you state `` Russia 's defense minister yesterday called for a cease-fire in Libya , '' are you stating that steps towards peace only cause problems ? How is a cease-fire a bad thing ? Is this what a committee is needed to discuss , what is a peaceful move and a war-mongering move ? Also , with Germany not agreeing with the way Libya is being handled , how are they causing trouble by protecting their citizens and military by not involving them in a dispute that they have nothing to do with ? Did Libya do anything to Germany ? I have n't seen anything to hint this . Did Libya do anything to the U.S. ? I have n't heard anything to hint this either . Alliances only drag countries into conflicts in which they had nothing to do with originally . `` Peace , commerce , and honest friendship with all nations -- entangling alliances with none . '' ~ Thomas Jefferson But why would we want peace , commerce , and honest friendship ? We would n't have any real reasons to go kill and flex our military muscle then , because that solves everything all the time . So , no , a committee to run the `` war '' in Libya is a bad idea , just like it was stated , '' ... if a committee is running the war , no one has to take responsibility if things go to hell and everyone can take credit if they go well . '' We should know this already by the countless committees in our own Congress and how no one jumps at the opportunity to take responsibility when things go wrong . March 23 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | Oh good . I 'll hold my breath waiting for that to work out well for everyone concerned . March 23 , 2011 at 5:37 pm | A committee has to have a leader and hopefully parties who desire to work together a for a common goal . THis bunch ca n't agree on anything for more than a day or two ?

We have paid the bulk of this so far and Europe are the one 's who really need this mess cleaned up . Geez , is our leadership dumb otr what I think ignoring too many other of our own problems while trying to conceal our very serious financial issues to the rest of the world by appearing strong is laughable . Sounds like another money laundering scandal in the making . March 23 , 2011 at 5:39 pm | France and England wanted to get Gaddaffi and did a lot of tough talk b\\/4 this started . Why do n't they put their troops in there for a clean up and bring this to a close ? We have done enough I think . France needs some kind of leadership or steering committee when it comes to military action , but not us . Usually they need someone to fight for them since their rifles have all been dropped a time or two . We have the green light now so use it , and let the US make Kadafi want to join the French Foriegn Legion . March 23 , 2011 at 5:43 pm | I have experienced `` decisions '' by committee . Listen to the upside , downside , likes , dislikes blah blah blah . At the end of the meeting , I make the call . Let the French discuss it into the ground . I say drop a 2000 pounder on Kadafi and lets , the USA , call it game over . Then we can debate that for years . Poop or get off the pot ! March 23 , 2011 at 5:44 pm | Barbara Teixeira - Las Vegas , NV A Committee ? And next they will argue about who should be the chairman ! Are there no leaders in this world ? How about one leader who knows what the heck he -LRB- or she -RRB- is doing ? Maybe we should let Hillary run the show . If this is what is going on concerning this mess in Libya , then how about the US pulls out of the `` committee '' . We do n't need to have our fingerprints on everything . And especially not this mess . March 23 , 2011 at 5:48 pm | Yes , I think that a NATO-led committee should run the war in Libya and hopefully the U.S. stays out of the affair altogether . Let the U.N. assume the control and the expense of this operation . We already have enough to deal with in terms of military occupations and do not need to assume full responsibility by occupying a third arab country . March 23 , 2011 at 5:52 pm | Why not ? We have hearings on all manner of things . This is a compelling issue which should be discussed . We know too little about the Middle East and Islam : and apparently US government if we are to beleive that sad poll of earlier in the week .

Avlon , CNN Contributor John Avlon : Voices are being raised against Obama 's action against Libya He says many are coming from the left , not the right Some liberals are very unhappy with Obama 's continuation of some Bush policies , he says Avlon : Obama is making policy based on reality , not ideology Editor 's note : John Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for The Daily Beast . He is the author of `` Wingnuts : How the Lunatic Fringe Is Hijacking America . '' New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's dj vu all over again . Congressman Dennis Kucinich is talking impeachment . Ralph Nader is grumbling that the president of the United States is a `` war criminal . '' Michael Moore is venting his spleen on the subject of U.S. hypocrisy . What 's different is that the president provoking the professional protest crowd this time is a Democrat . For all the overheated anger at President Obama from the far right , where people have called him a socialist and worse , the fact is that Obama is n't considered a ideological soul mate by the far left . One of the reasons : Libya is just the latest example of Obama embracing national security executive powers that have prompted some liberals to claim that he is leading George W. Bush 's third term . First , there was the decision to increase the number of troops in Afghanistan . Then came the realization that closing Guantanamo was easier said than done . There is the administration 's use of wiretaps and escalation of predator drone strikes . And now the airstrikes in Libya , engaged without extensively consulting Congress . War power policy in question An objective assessment of the Obama record on foreign policy shows that he has not been the soft liberal ideologue that conservatives want to run against . An excellent book by my Daily Beast colleague Stephen Carter , `` The Violence of Peace , '' analyzes Obama 's War Doctrine at length from a legal , but readable , perspective . Carter writes , `` On matters of national security , at least , the Oval Office evidently changes the outlook of its occupant far more than the occupant changes the outlook of the Oval Office . '' While Obama has changed the unilateral style of the Bush administration , he 's kept much of the substance . He has drawn down troops in Iraq , as promised . But on many other fronts , he has found that campaign rhetoric often does not square with the responsibilities of governing . Because many on the left define themselves in opposition to authority , they are historically quick to turn on presidents of their own party for being insufficiently liberal -- whether it is Truman 's and Kennedy 's Cold Warrior enthusiasm , LBJ 's escalation of the Vietnam War , Jimmy Carter 's budget cuts or Bill Clinton 's welfare reform . Kucinich has been joined by a small chorus of voices from the left in Congress in condemning the president . These include : Barbara Lee -LRB- who was the lone vote against the Afghanistan invasion after 9\\/11 -RRB- ; Michael Capuano -LRB- last seen telling a union rally `` you need to get out on the streets and get a little bloody '' -RRB- ; Maxine Waters -LRB- who repeatedly pulled a proto-Joe Wilson by calling President Bush a `` liar '' -RRB- and Sheila Jackson Lee -LRB- a House Foreign Affairs committee member who last year said `` Today we have two Vietnams , side by side , North and South '' -RRB- . This cast of characters is a fair representation of the far left in the minds of the right . And yet they are now among Obama 's fiercest critics . That should be a reality check that resonates with centrist and independent voters . But you 've got to give Obama 's critics on the left points for ideological consistency . They are apparently not swayed by simple partisanship . Some of their newfound allies on the right , however , will have a harder time making that case . For example , former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , a potential Republican presidential candidate , took aim at the Libya intervention , calling it `` opportunistic amateurism without planning or professionalism . '' A few days earlier , as Alana Goodman pointed out in Commentary , he had been criticizing Obama 's inaction , saying , `` This is a moment to get rid of -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- . Get it over with . '' Libertarian , and longtime critic of the neo-cons , Ron Paul can at least claim consistency in his circulation of a congressional resolution `` expressing the sense of Congress that the President is required to obtain in advance specific statutory authorization for the use of United States Armed Forces in response to civil unrest in Libya . '' Among its supporters to date is Detroit Democrat John Conyers -- Ron Paul 's philosophic opposite on almost everything . The Beltway buzz was that committed partisans finally found something upon which they could agree . Obama can be criticized for delay in his decision to impose a no-fly zone . He can be criticized for communicating more with allies in advance of multilateral action than with members of Congress . He can be criticized for lack of military experience before entering office and insufficiently clear directives after . But the secret hiding in plain sight is that Barack Obama was never the simple `` anti-war candidate '' his leftist supporters hoped or his conservative opponents feared . While he opposed Iraq from the beginning , he supported escalation in Afghanistan , even proposing drone strikes into Pakistan during the campaign . The criticism of the professional left and the professional right is likely to heat up if the conflict drags on . Michael Moore 's tweeted sarcasm will set the tone for other liberal Obama critics on the netroots : `` We 've had a `` no-fly zone '' over Afghanistan for over 9 years . How 's that going ? But Moore 's suggestion that Obama return his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ignores the substance of what the president said in his acceptance speech : `` I believe that force can be justified on humanitarian grounds , as it was in the Balkans , or in other places that have been scarred by war . Inaction tears at our conscience and can lead to more costly intervention later . That is why all responsible nations must embrace the role that militaries with a clear mandate can play to keep the peace . '' The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John P. Avlon . "}, {"uid": "250", "dct": "2011-03-23", "dates": ["2011-03-23", "2011-02-23", "2008-01-01", "2011-03-23", "2009-01-01"], "text": "Libyan civil war : An opening for al Qaeda and jihad ? March 23 , 2011 | By Paul Cruickshank and Tim Lister , CNN Libyan youths walk past a burnt out building in this file picture in the eastern Libyan town of Derna on February 23 , 2011 . The town of Derna is not much to look at -- a heap of Soviet-style concrete buildings in a deprived and windswept corner of eastern Libya . But it has a rich history -- fought over and colonized since Roman times -- and a stunning location on the Mediterranean . It has also gained a reputation as a hotbed of jihadists . And that has diplomats and analysts asking whether the unrest in Libya might provide an opening for al Qaeda and fellow travelers , just a short hop from Europe . Derna even made it into U.S. diplomatic cables obtained by Wikileaks . A cable from 2008 describes it as a `` wellspring of Libyan foreign fighters '' for al Qaeda in Iraq . High youth unemployment , discrimination by the Gadhafi regime and the influence of veteran Libyan jihadists from Afghanistan all played a role in radicalizing a new generation . `` Other factors include a dearth of social outlets for young people , -LRB- and -RRB- local pride in Derna 's history as a locus of fierce opposition to occupation , '' the cable said . `` Most young men watched a mix of al-Jazeera news , religious sermons and western action films on English language satellite channels broadcast from the Gulf . The result was a heady mixture of violence , religious conservatism and hatred of U.S. policy in Iraq and Palestine . '' Today , Derna is very much in the opposition 's hands , and accounts from eastern Libya say Islamists and others are fighting side-by-side with one aim : removing Moammar Gadhafi . But what comes next ? Gadhafi has been quick to raise the specter of al Qaeda as the beneficiary of unrest in Libya , even claiming that it was drugging young Libyans into opposing his rule . The regime has also paraded a former member of the Libyan Islamist Fighting Group who had allegedly been `` captured '' during fighting in Zawiyah . While the regime 's claims may seem outlandish , a former leader of Libyan jihadists tells CNN that al Qaeda will seek to take advantage of chaos in Libya . `` If there is a power vacuum in Libya there will be an open market for al Qaeda , '' says Noman Benotman , a former commander in the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group and one-time ally of Osama bin Laden . The LIFG fought the Gadhafi regime in the 1990s , but formally ended its campaign to overthrow the Libyan regime two years ago , and repudiated al Qaeda . Benotman is now a senior researcher at the Quilliam Foundation in London , a counter-terrorism think tank .

But consider Obama s remarks . Left unchecked , he said , we have every reason to believe that Gaddafi would commit atrocities against his people . Many thousands could die . Every year , one million people die from malaria . About three million children die , either directly or indirectly , due to hunger . There is much we could due to help the world if we were willing . The question that needs to be asked is : Why this ? What are our interests in Libya ? Richard Haas argues that the U.S. doesn t have any , anyway : '' U.S. interests are decidedly less than vital . Libya accounts for only 2 percent of world oil production . The scale of the humanitarian crisis is not unique ; indeed , this is not strictly speaking a humanitarian intervention . It is a decision to participate in Libya 's civil war . `` I understand the humanitarian impulse to help the underdog , but we have finite resources , and can not hold ourselves responsible for the political freedom of every human being on Earth . As many others have said , the obvious problem with this action is that we must set the pretty gauzy-sounding benefits of influencing public opinion in the Middle East , avenging ourselves for the Pan Am bombing , possibly improving the lives of people in Libya and so forth , against the many ways that this could plausibly turn into a much more expensive proposition than is currently anticipated and not only in terms of money . '' Who are we helping ? Friedman further holds that we don t know who we are helping : '' ... we should be doubly cautious of intervening in places that could fall apart in our hands , a l Iraq , especially when we do not know , a l Libya , who the opposition groups really are democracy movements led by tribes or tribes exploiting the language of democracy ? '' James Fallows says that the American military rarely asks this essential question : `` Count me among those very skeptical of how this commitment was made and where it might lead . The most predictable failure in modern American military policy has been the reluctance to ask , And what happens then ? We invade Iraq to push Saddam Hussein from power . Obama increases our commitment in Afghanistan and says that `` success '' depends on the formation of a legitimate , honest Afghan government on a certain timetable . What happens then ? '' Next up : five arguments in favor of intervention . It 's a UN resolution , not a U.S. invasion . And we ca n't stay -- we 're tied up .

In your reply please also include the link of a credible news organization article that has the country taking the lead from the U.S. DECLARING it is doing so . Until then its just wishful thinking . NATO just refused to take the lead due to Turkey voting no and that is the only organization capable of coordinating this kind of coalition operation besides the U.S. , whoops .

March 23 , 2011 at 9:55 pm | Because if we nedd `` to allow the mid east to step up and take care of their own '' than Africa can do the same by that coin .

March 23 , 2011 at 6:23 pm | Reply Actually , and this is something I hate seeing when I go down past the signs to Yorktown Battlefield , the France that helped us was the Kingdom of France , not the Third Republic that exists now . Yet the tricolor is shown on the signs at Yorktown . Yes , French peasants came over here and helped us fight with aristocrats over them as officers . However , when they revolted against their King we sat aside and did nothing , absolutely nothing . It 's a wonder anyone 's trusted us as allies since . As for another point I 'd like to make : The American Revolution was income tax evasion on the largest scale ever seen . We were subjects of the King of England , France owned Quebec down to what we now know as Maine . During the Seven Years War the French attacked colonials , did we raise an army to fight ? We left that up to the King to send troops to fight for us . The taxes he imposed were to pay off the cost of having to ship troops over to the Colonies in order to fight in our defense . We had more than enough manpower to raise an army at the time , militias are not an army because they often lack the courage to stand their ground when faced with professional soldiers . As well as they allowed too many of the officers to argue with superiors who were placed in authority based off of who they know or who their father 's were , not skill at leading men into battle , nor being able to inspire men . England helped defend us from becoming all French , since we dislike them so much and seem to think they ca n't fight -LRB- they seemed able to hold the Germans back for quite some time during World War One with what help the British could offer -RRB- seems that was what we wanted . Seems people have forgotten the things we 've done in our pasts . Maybe we should try understanding that while war is terrible , this new century of warfare has nothing on the last . Four years = 20 million or more dead , that was World War One . In roughly six months worth of actual combat the American Expeditionary Force lost 50,000 dead and hundreds of thousands wounded , today the American people would call John J. `` Black Jack '' Pershing a murderer . At the time he was hailed as the greatest hero America had of the time . So why do n't all the doomsayers and those that want to espouse opinions without allowing their brains to digest the true information try looking back at what has happened before ? I am currently trying to re-enlist in the US military . Not because I have to , not because someone told me I should , but because it 's the right thing to do . March 24 , 2011 at 9:09 am | Yaa the french wanted to take the colonies over at first but that was in the very beginning were there were very few colonist and actual american 's -LRB- born in america -RRB- and they only attacked then after that the french indian war they only attacked the ohio river valley which as claimed as both french and british , in fact the british strted making bases there and the french were just defending `` their '' land -LRB- thats what president polk did to start the U.s. mexican war -RRB- then pershing actually gave his troops training . he refused to let untrained americans fight in trench warfare and that saved lives . and it was in trenches the only way to move was to risk lives , it was a deadlock between france and germany -LRB- hitler actualy was a runner in one of the trenches -RRB- they made hundreds of miles of trenches and then neither moved they just shot spied and maurdered . When pershimg sent the toops he sent them with training so more could live and almost every1 in the u.s. at the time would do anything to stop germany and the kaiser March 25 , 2011 at 4:19 pm | What was the name of that country that had a revolution and a super power -LRB- France -RRB- came in to help win that revolt ? Oh yeah , it was America . America and the rest of the world has a moral obligation to help those who can not help themselves , especially when their government is killing civilians . I use the term government loosely ; Gaddafi is a thug and in no way represents a legitimate government . March 23 , 2011 at 9:13 pm | Reply That is a legitimate argument Mike D ! Albeit a world coalition not a U.S led operation . March 26 , 2011 at 1:49 am | From the libyan intervention with no clear objective , it is clear that the west is restless with its weapons . U. S , and Europe have so much and highly sophisticated weapons that they do not know what to do with . This is more true when juxtaposed with the fact that there are ` real ' wars now , only occupations . So the U.S and Europe are looking for the slightest opportunity to use their weapons that are getting ` rusty ' . There is no objective in this misplaced libyan war . U.S and their allies have said Ghaddafi is not the target . Then who is the target ? I know Obama is against the libyan war but he allowed himself to get forced into it . Obama did n't get it the first time because he was looking for a way to dodge the war but could n't see it initially . The easy way for Obama to dodge the idea that the neoconservative american interventionist forces were selling to him on the need to start another war was for him -LRB- Obama -RRB- to seek the approval of the congress . But he did n't and was cowed into staging an unconstitutional war without getting the congress ' nod . March 24 , 2011 at 6:07 am | Reply The President of the United States by law has the ability to commit American forces to any conflict for up to 30 days before seeking a decleration of war from the Congress . Truman did it in Korea , which was never actually called a war while it was happening . Gahdafi needs to go , he 's a tyrant that gets his jollies by harming the innocent . The hell with what the rest of the world thinks the right thing to do is the right thing to do . As for the whole `` Americans getting restless with our weapons , the Europeans are more experts on that than us . Remember there was a period of twenty or more years that they went through an arms race , forming internal alliances before finally the powder keg caught it 's spark . The spark came on June 28 , 1914 , the resulting explosion is what we now call the First World War . They could n't even handle that peace treaty without allowing their vindictiveness to blur the lines between vengeance and justice . I 'm glad Europe is trying to help in Libya , but it 's ironic that they used to own that area , so if Iraq and Afghanistan are `` America 's mess '' how would they feel if we left Libya to them as `` Europe 's mess '' ? March 24 , 2011 at 8:54 am | That would be wonderful if the U.N. had ever won a war against anyone . The last time the U.N. led a coalition into an actual war was sixty one years ago . All we got out of that was 36,000 dead Americans , millions of dead from the two countries we were fighting in , and who knows how many from the other coalition members . A country that is still divided along the same line as it was when that war began . That 's called the Korean War . The U.N. is as useless as the League of Nations was . The League could n't nor did they try to stop Nazi Germany , Japan and Mussolini 's Italy from just walking out on them . What did that get us ? Oh that 's right , another `` War To End All Wars '' . Gahdafi is murdering his people , that 's different from diseases doing the same . No government has the right to rule by fear and terrorizing of their own people . We stood up against that during the Second World War and thankfully Obama is doing it now . I do n't support all of what he does because recently he 's been sounding more and more like Woodrow Wilson . He 's been smart enough to avoid using the phrase `` America is too proud to fight '' a cowards defense against war that he used to keep us out of the Great War for so long . Yet an untold number of Americans went and fought on both sides for what they believed in before the U.S. got involved in 1917 . No , we do n't need to commit troops to battle , but it seems glaringly obvious that the Libyan Opposition needs better training , Noncommissioned Officers and officers who know how to organize their troops and fight . If they lose , the result will be equivelent to what Hitler called `` the Final Solution '' .

There is no compelling reason to believe that French and other foreign help is more then enough to help the Libyan people kick out Ghaddafi , without involving us . And the last leader that tried to fight on 3 fronts was Hitler , and everybody knows the results . This thing can easily blow up in our faces and become another Vietnam .

March 23 , 2011 at 7:33 pm | Reply Americans do not understand the Arab\\/Muslim view of the world . The arguments in this article do not take into account the strongest arguments because the US discounts the effect of religion on politics , which is a fatal flaw in the Middle East . The political leaders view is that the US will throw the dictators that the US -LRB- and Britain -RRB- set up -LRB- The Shah of Iran , Kuwait , Jordan , Saudi Arabia , Libya , Egypt , Tunisia , etc. not to mention the arming and support of Saddam Hussein by the US -RRB- under the bus whenever it becomes convenient . The Saudis see how quickly the US turned on Mubarak and believe the US would do the same to them if their were protests to break out in Saudi Arabia . So , whatever remaining allies the US has in the region will become increasingly distrustful of the US . The population see it as a religious war and this action fuels Islamist activists .

The Europeans , specifically the French , British and Italians , are addicted to Libya 's oil . British and French oil companies are angry because they 've been losing oil contracts to the Chinese , Indians and Russians . Italy gets most , if not all it 's oil from Libya -LRB- its former colony -RRB- . To show that this is about oil : The Chinese reported -LRB- yet not picked up by main stream western media -RRB- that its oil field workers in Libya were attacked by `` gangs '' , who proceeded to destroy the Chinese equipment . These `` gangs '' are the so called peaceful protesters . China evacuated 20,000-30 ,000 of its citizens from Libya because of these peaceful protesters attacking the oil fields the Chinese were working on . India also evacuated its workers . This is all about Europe holding onto what it has always seen as its oil . Gaddafi has been offering oil deals to Russia , China , India and even Germany . Notice they all abstained from the UNSCR 1973 vote . So much for `` no foreign states '' have interests . It is about the oil !

It is the stupid elected officials , that stupid American voters keep electing , that keep screwing things up ! The military is very good at what it is supposed to do ; kill and destroy .

March 24 , 2011 at 1:29 am | Reply Of these arguments against taking action in Libya , only one is legitimate ... `` who are we helping '' ? I do n't think it is clear that the government that would replace Ghadafi would be any better or any more friendly toward us . But I believe they deserve a chance to prove that they love Democracy as much as they claim . However , here is a point-by-point refutation of the other four arguments : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Why This ? There will always be different , and perhaps better ways to spend our resources . If we accept this argument as a valid reason for inaction , then we would never do anything at all . Doing nothing is a lousy way to remain a world leader . -LRB- 2 -RRB- What are our Interests in Libya ? Why is it necessary that we have an interest there ? The fact that Libyans are human beings and Americans are human beings ought to be interest enough . Sometimes doing the right thing should be its own reward . I can not stand when people will only do something helpful when they expect something in return . Doing something for someone else when there is no tangible reward for ourselves makes us better than 99.9 % of all the other nations of the world . -LRB- 3 -RRB- At What Cost ? Well , war is expensive . So is maintaining armed forces in peacetime . The fact is that , with the exception of expending ordnance , we are n't really spending anymore than we would if we were not engaged in a military action . Every soldier and sailor would continue to be paid whether they were fighting or not . We would still fly aircraft of routine missions or training sorties . Our aircraft carriers would still be at sea and still would be incurring operational expenses , whether or not we were engaged in Libya . Its all in how you cook the books . Besides , when we order new cruise missiles from Raytheon , American workers will get paychecks which they will spend here at home to stimulate our sagging economy . -LRB- 4 -RRB- What Happens Next ? This is unknown , granted . However , doing nothing has predictable consequences . First , if we do nothing and Ghadafi wins , then we will have allowed a dictator to massacre huge numbers of innocent civilians . Since this is something we could have prevented , this would make us at least in part responsible for their deaths . Second , if we ignored the opposition 's pleas for help and they won ... well , then do you think they might have some resentment toward us for abandoning them in their time of need ? So , our carefully measured actions , supported by the UN and the Arab League is , I believe , precisely the correct course of action at this time .

Apparently he had dissagreement with Foreign Ministry -LRB- who unambiguously wanted veto it -RRB- and also with Putin -LRB- who technically had no say , but expressed himself later any way in very clear terms , furthermore he did it twice already -RRB- . Medvedev and Foreign Ministry stroke a `` compromise '' between support and veto : this resulted in `` abstain '' , which in this context equivalent to support .

March 24 , 2011 at 1:54 pm | Reply I agree with you , we should cut defense spending right after we stop send billions in foreign aid to countries that neither appreciate it or remember who sent it . Cut all foreign support to rebuilding other country 's infrastructure , stop sending advanced technology to countries that use that technology against us , stop allowing US companies to outsource work to foreign countries that use child and impoverished labor . Stop supporting and bailing out financial institutions that send US dollars to foreign banks . Then cut defense spending after we block our borders and keep illegal aliens from using our services and breaking the backs of our public school systems . Yeah , I agree with you ...

Meanwhile , fighting raged in Misrata , east of the capital , where a witness claimed Gadhafi has placed snipers on the tops of buildings . Also Tuesday , the commander of U.S. Naval forces in Europe and Africa said multinational air strikes would continue until Gadhafi complies with a United Nations mandate to stop attacking civilians . Americans `` are going to be satisfied that lives were saved '' by the U.S. military action , President Barack Obama said during a visit to El Salvador . He said the timetable for a transition of military leadership will be coming in days , rather than weeks . Gadhafi vowed Tuesday to emerge victorious in his battle with international forces seeking to impose a no-fly zone in his country and to halt his forces from attacking civilians . Santorum : Mission confusion in Libya Obama hopes Libyan rebels will organize Inside bombed Libyan military base Gadhafi sitting on billions in gold `` We will not give up , '' he said to a crowd of supporters , many of them waving green flags in a speech broadcast on state television . `` They will not terrorize us . We are making fun of their rockets . The Libyans are laughing at these rockets . We will defeat them by any method . '' He said Libyans `` are leading the international war against imperialism , against despots and I tell you , I do not scare . '' Gadhafi is violating the U.N. Security Council resolution by `` continued aggressive actions his forces have taken against the civilian population , '' U.S. Navy Adm. Samuel Locklear III said . Locklear also spoke about the U.S. F-15E Strike Eagle that had flown from Aviano air base in Italy to Libya , where the fighter experienced mechanical problems . Both the pilot and the weapons officer ejected and were rescued within hours -- one retrieved by the U.S. military , the other by anti-Gadhafi Libyans . The aviators , who suffered minor injuries when they landed , were both out of Libya and in U.S. hands , Locklear said . The U.S. military dispatched a pair of Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft from the amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge , about 100 miles off the coast of Libya , to rescue the downed aviators , said Capt. Richard Ulsh , spokesman for the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit . But the two men landed in different places when they parachuted , and the U.S. rescue crew was able to pick up only the pilot . He was flown to the Kearsarge , which has extensive medical facilities . Libyan rebels recovered the second crew member and treated him with `` respect and dignity '' until coalition forces were able to reach him , Locklear said . Residents in the area , some of whom witnessed the crash , told CNN they combed farmlands to search for the two Americans . They also expressed their gratitude to coalition members for the United Nations-authorized coalition attack on Libyan air defense targets meant to protect civilians . Locklear said he would investigate reports villagers were injured when allied forces opened fire during rescue operations . `` The recovery mission from my perspective was executed as I would have expected it to be given the circumstances , '' he said . Criticism and questions persist about the Libyan campaign , with no clear answer on who will take over command of the military operation and what the endgame or exit strategy will be . But U.S. officials said the international mission has succeeded in halting Gadhafi 's momentum . Rebels help rescue U.S. serviceman Locklear told reporters that initial military strikes by the French , followed by attacks by Britain and the United States , have rendered Gadhafi 's long-range air defenses and his air force largely ineffective . And the Libyan opposition 's newly formed administration urged the international community to continue enforcing the U.N. charter . `` The interim national council has called on the international community to take all forceful deterrent measures , based on the U.N. charter and international covenants , to help the Libyan people put an end to further crimes against the humanity , '' the statement from the Transitional National Council said . Missiles rained down Tuesday and anti-aircraft fire pierced the night sky in Tripoli hours before dawn . The Libyan government took international journalists to a port area that appeared to have been damaged by missile strikes that left craters 15 feet deep . A destroyed mobile rocket launcher system lay smoldering . Several warehouses were hit . The United States fired 20 Tomahawk cruise missiles into Libya during a 12-hour period , said military spokeswoman Cmdr. Monica Rousselow . A total of 162 Tomahawks have been fired by the United States and Britain since the start Saturday of Operation Odyssey Dawn , which includes enforcement of a no-fly zone . The operation has included 212 U.S. and 124 sorties . The international operation has targeted air defense sites and command centers , but Gadhafi himself has not been targeted , and there are no plans to kill the leader , said Gen. Carter Ham , the head of U.S. forces in Africa . `` I could see accomplishing the military mission , which has been assigned to me , and the current leader would remain the current leader , '' he said . `` We think we have been very effective in degrading his ability to control his regime forces . '' Ham said no Libyan aircraft have been observed flying since the military operations began Saturday . And air attacks have stopped Libyan ground forces from approaching the eastern rebel stronghold of Benghazi . But fighting raged in Misrata , a city under siege two hours east of Tripoli . Four children in the same family were among 13 civilians killed in Misrata fighting Tuesday , said Dr. Khaled Mansouri of Misrata Central Hospital . About 30 people were injured , he told CNN . The death toll from the clashes between Gadhafi forces and rebels in the city stands at 90 over the last five days . An opposition spokesman who would give only his first name , Mohamed , told CNN the situation in the city is dire and worsening by the hour as Gadhafi forces have taken control of the main street that leads from the city center to a highway that connects Misrata to Tripoli . Loyalist snipers are on the top of buildings , he said . The hospital is running out of medical supplies and are turning patients away , he said . `` I have seen a man whose broken arm is hanging being discharged because of lack of space , '' said Mohamed , who said he would not divulge his full name because of concern for his safety . He said the city has been without water and electricity for nine days . Violence has raged in Libya following protests calling for democracy and demanding an end to Gadhafi 's almost 42-year rule . Protesters have been met by force from the Gadhafi regime , and numerous world leaders -- including U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon -- have denounced the killings of civilians by Gadhafi 's troops . The U.N. Security Council passed a resolution Thursday that allows member states `` to take all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country ... while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory . '' It also imposed a no-fly zone . Barak Barfi , a research fellow with the New America Foundation , said `` it 's certainly clear '' that the allied coalition has stymied the onslaught of Gadhafi troops against rebels in eastern Libya . `` Before the decision in the U.N. was taken Thursday , it seemed like Gadhafi was going to overrun the opposition in a matter of days , '' he said . But `` it 's unclear if the rebels can form under any type of organized command and move forward now that the airstrikes have taken away Gadhafi 's offensive capabilities , '' Barfi said Tuesday . `` It 's unclear at this point in time who would take control after Gadhafi leaves . We know that there are really no state institutions in Libya . '' A former Gadhafi aide told CNN Tuesday that the Libyan strongman would not go down easily . Abubaker Saad said Gadhafi has several bunkers deep underground and is likely hiding in one of them . `` As you probably all have noticed that now he is giving all of his statements by phone to the Libyan television , '' Saad said . Obama said that once leadership of the military mission in Libya shifts from the United States to the coalition , `` it is not going to be our planes maintaining the no-fly zone '' and `` it is not going to be our ships that are necessarily enforcing the arms embargo . '' There has been intense debate among the allies over NATO 's role going forward . The natural choice to coordinate `` Operation Odyssey Dawn '' would seem to be NATO with its experience leading and coordinating international coalitions , but U.S. and European officials tell CNN that some allies , especially French President Nicolas Sarkozy , are concerned the action in Libya could be perceived negatively as another NATO operation in another Arab country . Another complication is how to consolidate Arab support . The United States expects additional Arab support for the coalition enforcing the no-fly zone over Libya , a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday . So far , Qatar is the only Arab country that has contributed planes to mission . The official said that several Arab states are in the process of finalizing their plans , adding the Obama administration was `` confident we will have further concrete contributions of different kinds '' for enforcement of the resolution in the next two to three days .

A former Libyan jihadist says al Qaeda will seek to take advantage of chaos in Libya Diplomats and analysts ask whether unrest might provide an opening for al Qaeda There is a long history of Islamist radicalization in Libya Especially in the impoverished , restive eastern provinces -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The town of Derna is not much to look at -- a heap of Soviet-style concrete buildings in a deprived and windswept corner of eastern Libya . But it has a rich history -- fought over and colonized since Roman times -- and a stunning location on the Mediterranean . It has also gained a reputation as a hotbed of jihadists . And that has diplomats and analysts asking whether the unrest in Libya might provide an opening for al Qaeda and fellow travelers , just a short hop from Europe . Derna even made it into U.S. diplomatic cables obtained by Wikileaks . A cable from 2008 describes it as a `` wellspring of Libyan foreign fighters '' for al Qaeda in Iraq . High youth unemployment , discrimination by the Gadhafi regime and the influence of veteran Libyan jihadists from Afghanistan all played a role in radicalizing a new generation . `` Other factors include a dearth of social outlets for young people , -LRB- and -RRB- local pride in Derna 's history as a locus of fierce opposition to occupation , '' the cable said . `` Most young men watched a mix of al-Jazeera news , religious sermons and western action films on English language satellite channels broadcast from the Gulf . The result was a heady mixture of violence , religious conservatism and hatred of U.S. policy in Iraq and Palestine . '' President Obama 's plan on Libya Obama on Libya : We have saved lives Gadhafi : ` We will be victorious ' Today , Derna is very much in the opposition 's hands , and accounts from eastern Libya say Islamists and others are fighting side-by-side with one aim : removing Moammar Gadhafi . But what comes next ? Gadhafi has been quick to raise the specter of al Qaeda as the beneficiary of unrest in Libya , even claiming that it was drugging young Libyans into opposing his rule . The regime has also paraded a former member of the Libyan Islamist Fighting Group who had allegedly been `` captured '' during fighting in Zawiyah . While the regime 's claims may seem outlandish , a former leader of Libyan jihadists tells CNN that al Qaeda will seek to take advantage of chaos in Libya . `` If there is a power vacuum in Libya there will be an open market for al Qaeda , '' says Noman Benotman , a former commander in the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group and one-time ally of Osama bin Laden . The LIFG fought the Gadhafi regime in the 1990s , but formally ended its campaign to overthrow the Libyan regime two years ago , and repudiated al Qaeda . Benotman is now a senior researcher at the Quilliam Foundation in London , a counter-terrorism think tank . Having played no role in the rebellion so far , al Qaeda and its affiliates will have to play catch-up if they do want to exploit the situation , says Benotman . Individuals who might have jihadist sympathies are keeping them under wraps for the sake of uniting with one aim : removing Gadhafi , he says . Added to which there has been a broad welcome among Libyan rebels of all stripes for U.S. and coalition airstrikes to protect the city of Benghazi . According to Benotman , dozens of former LIFG fighters have now joined rebel efforts to topple Gadhafi , but he stressed that they had done so in a personal capacity rather than organizing operations as a group . Protest movements across the Middle East -- predominantly secular and pro-democracy -- have so far reduced the jihadist message to irrelevance . But Benotman sees potentially dangerous parallels in Libya with neighboring Algeria and with Afghanistan . After the Soviet withdrawal in 1989 , the West walked away from Afghanistan rather than use its `` soft power '' to bring about positive change , he says . The Taliban eventually filled the void . As a young jihadist , Benotman was there to witness it . Fighter jet crash : What happened Preparing for battle in Libya And in Algeria , a 1992 army coup following electoral gains by radical Islamist parties spawned a violent insurgency . More than 100,000 Algerians were killed in a savage conflict between the state and Islamist extremists before the insurgency waned in the mid-1990s . Some Western counter-terrorism officials fret that a prolonged civil war in Libya could open up space for al Qaeda . Governments and NGOs have to be quick , says Benotman , in helping rebel-held areas develop education , health-care and the institutions of democracy . Libya -- like Yemen -- has a less developed `` civil society '' than either Egypt or Tunisia after 40 years of authoritarian rule . It also has entrenched tribal rivalries and a small middle class . Such conditions were compounded by Gadhafi 's strategy of divide and rule through a baffling array of competing power centers . Al Qaeda has already scented an opportunity . Its leading ideologue , Abu Yahya al-Libi -- himself a Libyan -- told Islamists in the country : `` Store your weapons and do not relinquish them . '' In an audio tape released on March 12 , he said that `` ousting these regimes is not the end in making a change . '' A week later the leader of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -LRB- AQIM -RRB- had a similar message . In an audiotape posted on Jihadist websites and translated by the SITE Intelligence Group , Abu Musab Wadud told Gadhafi 's opponents : `` We will be side-by-side with you , Allah willing . '' Until now , That may be wishful thinking . AQIM has in recent times been restricted to remote parts of Mali , Niger and Mauritania and has suffered leadership splits . Wadud may also have damaged his cause by predicting the United States and NATO would never help the rebels because they were the `` source of the disaster . '' But al Qaeda is nothing if not persistent . And there is a long history of Islamist radicalization in Libya , especially in the impoverished , restive eastern provinces . At the peak of the Iraqi insurgency , more jihadists per capita traveled to join al Qaeda in Iraq from Libya than from any other country . And according to al Qaeda records seized by the U.S. Army in Iraq , in 2006-07 more volunteers -- a total of 53 -- traveled to Iraq from Derna than any other city in the Arab world . And in the 1990s , Benotman 's group had tried to establish a safe haven in Derna , eventually being bombed into submission by the Libyan air force . Which brings us back to the U.S. cable from 2008 , in which an American diplomat who traveled to Derna , quoted a local businessman who had `` likened young men in Derna to Bruce Willis ' character in the action picture ` Die Hard , ' who stubbornly refused to die quietly . For them , resistance against coalition forces in Iraq is an important act of ` jihad ' and a last act of defiance against the Gadhafi regime . '' `` It 's jihad -- it 's our duty , and you 're talking about people who do n't have much else to be proud of , '' he said . Maybe that at last is changing . "}, {"uid": "199", "dct": "2011-03-24", "dates": [null, null], "text": "I just wrote a piece for Time Magazine on Obama 's strategy problem in Libya . Here 's an excerpt : Call it the Goldilocks military plan : Not too much , not too little , not too unilateral , not too American . The operation against Muammar Gaddafi 's regime in Libya mirrors the moderate temperament of its architect , Barack Obama . But will it work in the rough realities of international politics ? That 's the question that will be tested in the weeks ahead as high-tech images of cruise missiles hitting their targets give way to a mess on the ground in Libya . President Obama has launched an operation that has two distinct qualities , one highly unusual and the other familiar . At its broadest , Obama 's diplomacy has tried to redefine the exercise of American power . It is an effort at a distinctive form of multilateralism , deeper than anything any President has tried before . At the same time , Obama is proposing a limited military intervention for a problem in which U.S. interests are limited . That 's something Presidents in the past have promised but mostly been unable to deliver as events on the ground forced them to escalate for fear of being humiliated . However wise his multilateral instincts , it is how Obama handles this latter problem that will determine the mission 's success and duration . Check out the full article over at Time and let me know what you think . So far both conflicting parties in Libya refuse to cede . Gaddafis regime wants to recapture the east of the country and the rebels want to seize Tripoli and make it the capital of their new nation . What happens in Libya is deja vu . In history we see quite a number of similar cases . Ho Chi Minh and Mao Tse Tung had to fight hard to achieve their goals and they are the revered founders of their countries . Let the rebels fight the regime and as time goes by we know them better . If they prevail , they win the legitimacy to build a new Libyan nation . Another alternative would be a time-consuming negociation with the two parties . March 24 , 2011 at 10:55 am | Reply Farid , you most probably have read the Koraan , and have an educated understanding of Islam . . I do think the media should raise the following questions to Muslim Leaders , regarding what is happening in Libya : 1 - Where is Muslim Justice ? Is Gadafi & his thugs carrying out Sharia Law ?? Is killing Muslims & destroying Mosques the example of Muslim leadership to set in the world . Is this the Nation of Islam , that we should look up to ??? 2 - Where is Muslim Brotherhood ? Is it just a label of a group of fanatics used to extort or blackmail the West ??? 3 - How come the West have moved to protect defensless muslims in Libya , Egypt , Tunisia etc. , and Muslims Leaders together with their so called Arab league has not moved a finger to help suffering Muslims ? 4 - Is n't it time , for these Muslim leaders , to grow up , take responsibility , clean up their dirty wash , and stop crying to the West for aid & dole outs ?? 5 - Why has the Azhar and other supposedly scholarly institutions , not decree a ` Fatwa ' condemning Gadafi & his like to be infidels , that all Muslims should prosecute , and carry out a ` Gihad ' against him until he is brought to justice ... This is not a load the US or West should take . This is a load Muslim Leaders should take ... Thanks for reading . First off , my demographic . I 'm a WASP , 56 years of age , living in the US , who has been a news and political junkie since Johnson had to take the Oath of Office when Kennedy was assassinated . I 'm also a stringer reporter , albeit new to the business . Now , here is my beef . These are mighty trying times , both at home and abroad . We are being insanely co-opted into realms that we can not possible handle , nor explain , nor resolve . As an old guy , here are the things that I do not understand . Perhaps you can help me with this . We intervened in Bosnia , because the atrocities were so acute . However , we stayed away from Rwanda . We went , guns a blazing to Grenada , yet we were content to allow all the despots in Africa have full rein to slaughter as many as they liked . North Koreans have been starving to death for decades , but somehow that 's okay . I guess because they supposedly have a bomb that works . Myanmar has been hideous for a long time , but I guess that 's okay too , because they are Indonesian , and we do n't want that again . It 's okay that Mubarak can go . We never really liked him anyway , no matter how many dollars we pumped into his military . But , we ca n't mess with Bahrain , or the Saudi 's , nor half a dozen other places there , because it would not be in our best interests . We can beat our chest at Iran , but forgo any action towards Syria . We leave Lebanon hanging out to dry , because , well , I 'm not even certain anymore . But , it 's okay to spend millions of dollars spanking Libya , and to what end ? We do not have enough fingers to plug up the holes of so many dikes ! This whole thing is really getting insane . The other night , I watched as we shot over $ 136 million dollars worth of Tomahawk Missiles into Libya . I thought , Jeez , that money could have really come in handy to those of us here at home who are suffering , and looking for a place to sleep , and a warm meal , and perhaps retraining for a job which they can sustain their families with . I will share an acronym with you , Fareed . It 's called POTS , which stands for Pandemic of Terminal Stupidity . Feel free to use it . March 24 , 2011 at 1:23 pm | Reply Not all situations are equal risk for equal results . Albeit Clintons great regret was doing nothing in Rowanda , Bush took us on an adventure in Iraq and Afghanistan , the crimes of the Ivory Coast are off the chart . We ca n't fight them all and more than likely we will have little say about the futures of Bush 's wars . Right now there are two big issues on the table . In North Africa there are three nations facing the possible light of democracy . Tunesia , Egypt , and Lybia each have there own issues to find the path to democracy . If one falls off the path it can take down the other two . 15 % of the population of Lybia is Egypsian workers for example . If we ` can invest a smal air war to support freedom in that 3 nation stretch its a triple homerun . Imagine an out of the park victory for the moderates of the world . That could bring true peace to the west of Isreal that is really lasting . The other problem is the middle east proper . King Abdoulla of Saudi Arabia vrs the Iatolla 's in Iran . Bahrain is ruled by Suni , like King Abdoulla of Saudi Arabia . Yemen is also ruled by Suni , but Syria is friendly to the Shiites that are friendly with Iran , supply hezbolla with weapons and so forth . My money is on King Abdoulla and his 500,000 man USA trained military . Why does this all matter to you ? Well in Europe they pay $ 7 to $ 8 usd pergallon for gasoline . We spend enmass on the 5th and 6th fleets to keep trade routes and our business partners safe in the middle East . If we stop supporting the King , get your wallet out and we will pay like the rest of the world for gas . In fact with the current speculation we will face an estimated $ 9.50 oper gallon in the USA . Why dont we `` Drill Baby Drill '' ? Ron Reagan was a really smart guy . His Idea was we use everyone elses oil first before we touch the massive oil reserves in the USA and the Artic . We can argue , fiddle , fight , and all sorts of things until the world is dry of oil before we even think to begin to drill what we can . He implied in policy that there will be a day , when nations fight for food , water , and of course oil . The nation that runs out of oil reserves will lose that war . While we were plaing in Iraq and Afghanistan , China made massive investments in Africa . Lybia sells the lions share of their light crude to China , thus the 30,000 Chinese workers in Lybia . Sub Saharan African is all locked up on oil by China . Meanwhile Saudi Arabia is starting to run out as is Mexico and a few other places we get oil . Estimates on those feilds are falling dramatically and the Saudi 's have failed to miss estimates for 5 quarters . Mexico like Venezuala nationalized the oil industry and stuck it to every oil company that did the exploration like Texico in the day and now no one trusts them to do business . So now it really boils down to that nut job in Iran vrs King Abdoulla . Remember the Saudi protesters are the Shiite group that 12 of the 199\\/11 hijackers came from . So we are betting on this Arab Sping to grow into Iran and Syria at the same time that we want Jordan , Baharain , and I raq to hang with King Abdulla . Yemen will likely end up in total chaos , and get its tail kicked by either King Abdulla or the USA . The uprising in Yemen is Al Quieda in the Arab Pennesula demanding their own country . The USA currently spends 150 million a year with the `` president of Yemen '' to fight AQAP . They control more than half the country and bombed the USS Cole . I hope this explains the whole picture to you . March 26 , 2011 at 8:14 pm | Reply Thank you , Randy , for interesting reading . '' ... Remember the Saudi protesters are the Shiite group that 12 of the 199\\/11 hijackers came from ... '' - are the 12 of 19 shia , indeed ? Al Qaeda is fundamentally sunny organization , I believe , furthermore it is on the extreme end of this shia to sunny spectrum , and bin Laden has ideological differences with both Iran and Qaddafi . March 27 , 2011 at 5:57 pm | Ohh I forgot one thing , I 'm a WASP young guy that lives in the Phillippines , work in China and Korea , but still keep an apartment in San Diego . I make a living on understanding the worlds economic issues . As a former Kansan and US soldier with a degree in economics I feel sad about the USA . We can solve this countries problems with common sense but we refuse to do so . We spend 300 billion dollars a year and 500,000 Americans are killed by smoking every single year , why is that not outlawed ? If you want to smoke sign a waiver that we need not spend $ 250,000 usd trying to apply palative care when you get stage IV non small cell lung cancer . Other wise if a cop see 's you smoking you go to jail and get fined $ 20,000 usd . We spend 1 trillion dollars a year on 4 single issues like that which would balance the budget as fast as the congress can write the bills . Secondly we need four investments in the USA and a new 18 % flat tax . # 1 Invade Mexico and end the drug war combined with a real fence like Isreal has and seems to be impossible to pass . Give Amnesty to those in country along with a $ 50,000 usd price tag per man or woman . They can pay $ 100 a week payments until they earn their citizenship , and pay their back taxes or get out and dont come back . 10 years hard labor if they try to sneak back in the USA . Mexico is our largest customer and business is bad because of the drug wars . More people die each year in Mexico than get killed in Iraq or Afghanistan . # 2 Lead the world in High Speed Rail so a worker in Indiana can get a job in Detroit 300 miles away and get to work in 45 minutes . In China that high speed national rail system drpped unemployement by 4 % . In South Korea it dropped unemployent by 6 % . In South Korea I visit a factory built at a manufacturing hub 190 km south of Seoul every year . It takes me 30 min to get to that manufacturing area where 95,000 people work in 300 factories . Shuttle buses take people from the rail to factories like clock work . Much the same in China quarter million jobs after about 9 months training . Like IKES Interstate highway system that took 6 months to set up and 12 years to build . # 3 Complete President Obama ; s -LRB- actually the brain trust at MIT designed the new electrical grid system called `` Smart '' It starts with the meter on your house , new wiring all through , new smart transformers , and Nano Technology integrated into the new power grid . Currently it will be done in 2025 when its 10 years out of date . If we hire and train 250,000 men today it would be done in 36 months . Thousands of factories ca n't come to the USA cause our utilities are out dated and every new factory requires a multi million dollar invesrtment in direct power lines to the factory from the source . We rank 61rst of 168 countreis in our Utility techniology in use . The new power grid will cut lost energey amounting to 35 % of what we use in the USA more than enough to cover the oil we buy from outside the USA . It will cut everyones electric bill by 26 % . # 4 High Speed Boadband the new advanced model that is only available in 3 US cities like Chatanooga . A Dr can email a massive file like a ct scan over this in real time . That speed is available in all of Europe . Also let me point out when I 'm in Europe my cell phone works in Spain or Sweden and there are no zones or coverage areas . Were a really 8th rate gaggle in our wireless networks and half assed cell towers . # 5 Get rid of the IRS and its half million workers . Flat tax the country at 18 % for every corporation , partnership , or individual in the USA . We will save 490 billion a year in cost . -LRB- Not counting what we pay to get our taxes done -RRB- Corporations like Exxon wont be tax free and earn 10 billion net a year , or GE 5.1 billion and also pay nothing on a 24,000 page tax return thar will never be seriously looked at cause the IRS has no time . March 26 , 2011 at 8:56 pm | Reply Thanks for the thoughtful and insightful article . Too many of your colleagues shoot from the hip with their superficial criticisms and vacuous questions , which they accompany with no analysis and no answer . Neither you nor the President , nor any of us , will get it right all of the time , but at least there are some , like you and the President , who use their minds to reason and articulate , and disregard the bombast . March 24 , 2011 at 7:47 pm | Reply Your insight in the Libya situation and other world issues is always welcomed . I have a question however , and maybe you can answere it . Why does CNN and many of their commentary guests relative to Libya , refere to gadaffi as `` Colonel Gadaffi '' ? Is this individual actually a commisioned military colonel , or is that just an aquired `` nick name '' . To me , he absolutely does not deserve the true commission title of `` Colonel '' . Refering to and addressing this terrorist and yet to be determined `` war ciminal '' as `` Colonel '' , is to me , to very offensive . Unless he has a genuine claim to the commision of Colonel , I would suggest that CNN and all other media , STOP USING THE TERM `` COLONEL '' in the context of this gadaffi buffoon ! March 24 , 2011 at 10:32 pm | Reply Yes , he is professional military man by training and by service and he was commissioned\\/raised to colonel rank by King Idris - the king whom Qaddafi and group of his fellow officers ousted back in 1969 . Because of his modesty for which he is well known , he did not promote himself to general , generalissimus , or whatever other title dictators usually invent for themselves , and stayed in colonel rank throughout his entire 42-year tenure . So there is nothing wrong with CNN calling him `` Colonel Qaddafi '' , or simply `` Colonel '' . March 25 , 2011 at 8:21 pm | Reply You know ... the internet is a very useful tool in learning information like the knowledge you are apparently looking for -LRB- an badly need -RRB- . If you would have simply took the 15 seconds to `` google '' Colonel Gadhafi ... you would have saved yourself from looking like an uneducated fool . Sad but True March 26 , 2011 at 11:35 am | Reply OK . Hopefully the `` colonel '' part is sorted out . Now let 's sort out the use of term `` war criminal '' and the implied `` use of air strikes against populated areas '' by Qaddafi and `` slaughter of innocent civilians '' , `` atrocities '' , etc : It is actually NOT PROVEN at this point . Not by Al Jazira . Not found on Youtube . Surely , Qaddafi had used tanks and multiple rocket launchers : we saw them very clearly in reports by CNN correspondent Nick Robertson . And , presumably , these tanks fired their guns sometimes . And presumably some bombs were dropped by Qaddafi airplanes . And presumably all these tanks were used to intimidate civilians when they entered into a city or town . But what about showing destruction of civilian homes We clearly so Qaddafi residence destroyed by NATO cruise missiles , and crater left in some port , but what about showing destroyed civilian homes in Benghazi or elsewhere in rebel-controlled territory . Can anyone on this board ... After all , tanks a routinely used to intimidate peaceful demonstrators throughout the world . We saw tanks in Egypt recently . In Bahrein , etc. . . March 26 , 2011 at 5:55 pm | Reply I womder @ the reactions 2 the Libyan issue . The leaders of d nations of d world cant just ignore despots or d guise in any manner . the world wil drift into anarchy . Hwever these are just signs of d biblical winding down prophesied . No doubt these cruel treacherous leaders will be consumed . Hang more of such will still be recorded March 25 , 2011 at 12:19 am | Reply It 's almost comical the way western leaders play to the gallery and invest huge sums in military theatrics that achieve little . It seems evident that it 's economic interest more that anything else that influences the west especially America . So Gbagbo can choose to ignore the peoples vote and continue his illegitimate rule without as much as a look in from America . Once oil interests show up , America 's moralistic gibberish spews forth . It 's not about care for the Libyans , Egyptians or Saudis , it 's the oil `` stupid '' !

Apparently CBS feels they can work easier with Moammar and feel he is a bit more `` stable '' over the long term . March 26 , 2011 at 11:39 am | Reply America and England are alike two brothers in a dark room trying to create light . First it had to be learned , then taught to others , now metasized to the world . It 's a growing process that requires time and learning to grow up . Civil rights , and the abundance of issues are still being learned so do n't expect instant perfection . France is the 3rd in this trio and all the harsh words come from those who are less educated and lower in the cycle of learning . Now in places from Germany , Japan , South Korea , and so on we have helped inspire generations of like minded individuals . So it 's 2011 and the troubles in Tunisia , Egypt , and Lybia are the child bearing pains of new democracies . Have faith that the solid middle class or moderate minded will win in the end . Wait and watch as our leaders risk political capital on the idea that these Arabic Speaking people can find their way onto the path of true Civil Democratic ideals .

March 26 , 2011 at 7:46 pm | Reply I have little faith in governments , but do believe when someone like President Obama really sticks his neck out for an idea or a group of people . I agree there is a bias against sub-saharan Africa and it 's probably a racial matter . The USA has never gone to war to defend those people . I predict that Ghadaffi will fall on May 1 after a pounding by our planes , and that he will cut a deal to not go to jail and keep his money and be allowed to retire somewhere like Venezuala . The mans a coward and he will leave all those with him now to suffer the world courts . May day is the likely date as it will take time to beat down his 250,000 military of which 105,000 are army March 26 , 2011 at 9:14 pm | thanks , but this vividly indicates the road map for col. Gadafi to reave power . the intervation of these military powers potrays that libya has no dot of democrancy , just imagine 42 years with out elections what kind of government is that . therefor , such kind of military attacks will curb down the problems in African politics and indeed Afrcan presidents should emulate from what is happening to col. Gadafi of libya . however , according to the constitution Uganda says that power blongs to people i think it should be the same thing to libya because the natives were the first people to protest before the intervation of America and other countries . but the interest of Amemerica is never excluded from economic outcome .

How many people are going die before and after dictator Gadhafi is over ? When Libyan people ask the world for help , they need to do fair and equal to every people in Libya .

CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : Fridays are awesome ! Thank you for rounding out your week with CNN Student News . I 'm Carl Azuz , here to pilot you through 10 minutes of commercial-free headlines . AZUZ : First up , United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says there are no signs of a cease-fire in Libya . That announcement came yesterday , one week after the U.N. Security Council voted to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya . That 's part of the military operation that 's been firing missiles and running airstrikes . It 's been led by the U.S. Yesterday , there was talk of a deal that would make NATO , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , the leader of the operation . But that was n't set in stone , and there was some doubt about it . One interesting point about the conflict in Libya is how it could affect gas prices in the U.S. Libya produces about 2 percent of the world 's crude oil ; it 's not very much . But some stock traders are afraid that the trouble there could happen in other countries that produce more oil . That fear is one reason why oil prices are rising in the stock market . And that means gas prices are more likely to increase too , since crude oil accounts for about 65 percent of what we spend on gas . Now , getting back to the military operation . Diana Magnay is on the ship that some of those airstrikes are launching from . She gives an idea of what life is like there . DIANA MAGNAY , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Each night they fly , Harrier jets off the USS Kearsarge , bound for Libya . U.S. strike missions to take out Gadhafi 's air defense and attack capabilities as rebels clash with Gadhafi 's forces . CAPTAIN MIKE WYRSCH , HARRIER FIGHTER PILOT : It was pretty neat the next day after the first attacks , to see that the rebel forces , their morale once they saw that they had people coming to help them out . But it 's breaking their supply chains as well as slowing down their advance onto Benghazi by taking out their tanks and artillery . MAGNAY : Day times are about maintenance and repair , checking over these V-22 Ospreys , which had their first outing in Operation Odyssey Dawn early Tuesday morning . A daring rescue mission with a team of 30 Marines to find a U.S. fighter pilot who ejected over eastern Libya after his F-15 fighter jet suffered what the military called mechanical failure . The pilot 's back in the medical facilities here on board . His other crew member , the weapons officer , also had to eject , but landed in a completely different location . So , he was rescued first by rebel forces and is now back on a U.S. Air Force base in northern Italy . There are around 700 Marines on board , but this is n't a war which involves coalition ground forces . The Kearsarge 's six Harrier jets taking the active role in enforcing the U.N.-mandated no-fly zone REAR ADMIRAL MARGARET KLEIN , COMMANDER , EXPEDITIONARY STRIKE GROUP FIVE : If there are vehicles on the ground that can shoot down our aircraft which are enforcing the no-fly zone , we consider that a legal mandate to be able attack that equipment . MAGNAY : Precision targeting , 500-pound laser-guided bombs , and the sorties continue . No sign here that this part of the offensive is over yet . Diana Magnay , CNN , on the Kearsarge in the Mediterranean . AZUZ : Syria is the latest country to deal with the political unrest that we 've seen around the Middle East and North Africa recently . Syria is located between Iraq and Turkey . And people there have been protesting over economic and human rights issues . Those demonstrations have gotten violent in the past few days , with protesters and security forces fighting on the streets of at least one city . Human rights workers say at least 34 people have been killed in the violence this week . And that includes a soldier who was reportedly shot because he refused to fire on the protesters . Thousands of people came out on Thursday for the funerals of that soldier and some of the other people who 've been killed . AZUZ : Toyota , the car company , might shut down some of its U.S. manufacturing temporarily because it does n't have enough parts . There 's been a delay in getting those parts from Japan because of Japan 's recent earthquake and tsunami . Inside Japan , workers are still trying to get things stabilized at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant . These pictures were taken inside the plant . Two of the workers were taken to the hospital yesterday after they accidentally stepped in contaminated water . Officials say the men could be all right if they 're quickly decontaminated . A U.S. Navy aircraft carrier is going through a similar process right now . Martin Savidge , you 're on deck . MARTIN SAVIDGE , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Right now , every piece of hardware , every aircraft and every piece of machinery used to move that aircraft is on the front of the USS Ronald Reagan . And you can see a lot of the crew hands . You 're wondering maybe why are they all sitting around ? Well , we 'll show you . Look what 's going on back over here : water . Lots and lots of water just being sprayed all over the deck right now , in what is probably the biggest cleanup effort you 're ever likely to see at sea .

But there were no empty beds , no electricity -- only generator power . No anesthesia or painkillers . A doctor said 109 people have died in Misrata over the past week . Six were killed Thursday by Gadhafi 's rooftop snipers -- unseen but too often precise . More than 1,300 others have been wounded since the protests erupted in the western city last month . People flooded the hospital , wounded in war that has raged between the opposition and Gadhafi 's forces . The strongman 's tanks have been pounding the city and bombs fell Thursday near the hospital , the doctor said .

They camped on the periphery of Misrata , trying to wrest it from opposition control , and leaving its people , including those at the central hospital , in a dire situation .

Gadhafi 's elite ground forces are well-paid , well-equipped Those troops fight within cities , where coalition ca n't easily get them Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Libyan military has been pounded by coalition airstrikes neutralizing its air capabilities but it is still able to fight and maneuver on the ground , U.S. officials said . The Libyan Air Force has been grounded after five days of operations by the coalition forces . More than 160 Tomahawk missiles and several hundred strikes from fighter jets have virtually destroyed Moammar Gadhafi 's air defense . The toll on the air system is `` to the point where we can operate with near impunity across Libya , '' said Vice Marshall Greg Bagwell of Britain 's Royal Air Force . Despite the targeting of mobile launchers , Libyan forces still have numerous mobile launchers that could pose a risk to coalition planes . What does Libya 's military have left ? Gadhafi tanks turned into wreckage Haas on Libya : ` Extraordinarily messy ' Preparing for battle in Libya But it 's the ground forces where Gadhafi has more maneuverability because of the coalition 's limitations in fighting Libyan forces only from the air . Gadhafi 's forces have retreated from the eastern city of Benghazi , but continue to fight in other cities including Misrata and Ajabiya using `` tanks , artillery , rocket launchers , '' according to Rear Adm. Gerard Hueber , chief of staff for the coalition Odyssey Dawn . The coalition is able to strike at forces moving toward cities , but once they are inside city limits , dropping bombs with enough precision to avoid civilian casualties is difficult . Before the war , Libya had about 500 mortars and 2,400 pieces of artillery . Gadhafi had close to 2,000 tanks and armored vehicles to move around , but much was poorly maintained . Libya 's elite forces come from tribes loyal to Gadhafi , dedicated to protecting the regime . The 32nd Brigade , for instance , is commanded by one of Gadhafi 's sons . Those forces total , at most , 10,000 men . They are better paid and better equipped , said Gawdat Bahgat , a military analyst at National Defense University , with tanks and conventional weapons . Those elite forces are on the offense . U.S. surveillance planes have seen some attacks by the elite units . `` Those forces are fully engaged in this conflict , that are attacking those civilian populations , '' Hueber said . The Gadhafi forces remain capable of carrying out attacks on the opposition , a U.S. official told CNN . They are relatively well organized and continue to fight effectively in certain parts of the country , said the unnamed official , who is not authorized to speak on the record . The rebels have gained some additional battle space due to coalition efforts , the official said . Rebels are in a better position than they were a few days ago , but the Gadhafi forces have the upper edge at this point in time , the official said . However , where possible , the coalition is hitting the forces on the ground , arguing it is within the mission of protecting civilians . `` Gadhafi 's forces are feeling the strain of several weeks of fighting without any resupply , '' the official said . `` In Ajdabiya to Misurata , our targeted priorities are mechanized forces , those mobile integrated -- those mobile surface-to-air missile sites , interdicting their lines of communications which supply their beans and their bullets , their command-and-control , and any opportunities for sustainment of that activity , '' Hueber said Wednesday .

Rabasa , a member of the Bosnia Train and Equip Task Force in the early 1990s , is a senior political scientist at the RAND Corp. , a nonprofit institution whose mission is to help improve policy and decision-making through research and analysis . -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The no-fly zone and air strikes on military targets of the Gadhafi regime bear close parallels to events in Bosnia in autumn , 1995 , when NATO air strikes and the threat of further attacks halted the Bosnian Serb military onslaught against Bosnian Muslim targets . If effective , the international action might prevent the Gadhafi forces from crushing the rebellion in Libya , but it will not end the conflict . The Gadhafi regime retains overwhelming military superiority over the Benghazi-based Interim National Council . Unless the military imbalance is redressed , Gadhafi will retain the ability to threaten or renew his attacks on his opposition . As long as this situation persists , international military involvement in Libya -- to enforce the no-fly zone and prevent ground attacks by Gadhafi 's forces -- will likely have to continue . What the United States did in Bosnia might hold the key for an effective response to the crisis in Libya . In Bosnia , the United States sought to redress the military balance , which since the onset of the war in 1992 had heavily favored the Bosnian Serb army . Should coalition support Libyan rebels ? What could be the end game in Libya ? Despite the Europeans ' skepticism and dislike for the program , it succeeded . The program raised donations of several hundred million dollars from Muslim countries , supervised the purchase of military equipment for the armed forces of the Federation and arranged for a U.S. contractor to train Federation troops . The program also helped promote other U.S. objectives in Bosnia by diminishing Iranian influence and ensuring the departure of the foreign fighters . The situations in Bosnia then and Libya now grow more alike as the violence in Libya evolves into prolonged conflict . Despite establishment of a no-fly zone over Libya , there is little reason to expect that air or naval power alone will dislodge Gadhafi from areas he controls . The U.N. Security Council resolution that authorized the no-fly zone and all necessary measures to protect civilians under attack in Libya did not call for Gadhafi 's ouster . There are reports that some Arab countries are considering deploying ground troops to Libya . But if they do , their role would likely be protection of the civilian population in areas outside Gadhafi 's control . That outcome would still leave Gadhafi in power in western Libya . That leaves few effective options if the United States wants to prevent the crisis in Libya from leading to a prolonged armed conflict or de facto partition that leaves a ruthless , embittered dictator with a terrorist record in control of half the country . That situation could have long-term destabilizing consequences for Libya and the Middle East . The way out of this conundrum would be for the United States to clarify its goals in Libya . Recognizing that lasting stability could only come about as the result of the removal of Gadhafi from power , the United States and like-minded countries could begin by recognizing the Benghazi government as the legitimate government of Libya . The Libyan National Council is , after all , a government set up by a popular uprising against tyranny and therefore inherently more legitimate than Gadhafi 's government in Tripoli . The United States also might consider launching an effort to provide the Benghazi government with arms and equipment to defend itself against Gadhafi 's forces and to help it liberate western Libya . The U.S. need not become directly involved in the training and equipping of the Libyan opposition . As with the Bosnia train and equip program , a small U.S. team could help arrange for the purchase and delivery of arms , as well as supply training , possibly by third parties . There are those who would caution that the United States does not know enough about the Libyan opposition to support it , but this is not entirely true . Some of the opposition leaders are former cabinet ministers and generals in the Libyan government , known to the United States and its allies . As in all revolutions , a few of Libya 's opposition leaders have emerged from the rank and file of protesters . Some may be Islamists , but this was also true in Bosnia during that war . If the U.S. were to simply stand aside , extremists could fill the gap , as occurred in the early days of the Bosnian war . The U.S. decision to support victims of aggression paid off in Bosnia and advanced America 's interests and values . Involvement on the side of the democracy movement in Libya would enable the United States to exercise a positive influence on Libya 's evolution and prevent destabilizing outcomes .

The Brotherhood in Libya is energized by the sudden upheaval sweeping the Arab world It says it has no organizational links with the Brotherhood elsewhere It is largely drawn from educated middle classes in Tripoli and Benghazi -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Dr. Abdulmonem Hresha knows first hand how Moammar Gadhafi 's regime works . He says the seeds of his opposition were sown when he was age 10 . He and classmates were taken to witness the public execution of a political opponent of Gadhafi . `` They hung him up in front of thousands of small kids , '' Hresha said . `` He did that to scare people . '' Hresha , who taught physics at Tripoli University , later fled to Canada . A central , open question about Libya The prominent member of the Muslim Brotherhood now lives in London , and anticipates the group could become an important player in a post-Gadhafi environment . As in Egypt and Tunisia , the Brotherhood in Libya has been energized by the sudden upheaval sweeping the Arab world . It says it has no organizational links with the Brotherhood elsewhere , but shares the philosophy of the pan-Arab Islamist movement founded in Egypt in the 1920s . Largely drawn from the devout educated middle classes and university campuses in Tripoli and Benghazi , the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood was founded in the mid-1950s . Islamist opposition to the Libyan regime gathered force in the late 1980s , as part of a wider Islamic awakening or `` Sahwa '' in the region and in reaction to what many saw as an attempt by Gadhafi to hijack and interpret Islam for his own purposes . While jihadists launched a brief but unsuccessful campaign to overthrow Gadhafi in the 1990s , the Brotherhood focused much of its efforts on clandestine preaching and social welfare efforts in Libya .0 In 1998 , Gadhafi 's security services launched a crackdown against the group that saw more than 200 members imprisoned and hundreds more forced into exile , including Hresha . Despite years of repression , Hresha claims the Brotherhood still has thousands of members scattered across Libya , with chapters in almost every single town , including Sirte , Gadhafi 's birthplace on the coast west of Tripoli . In 2006 , its leaders were released after reconciling with the Libyan regime . But now the Brotherhood is siding with the rebellion . In February , as protests in Libya began , Yusuf al Qaradawi -- an Egyptian preacher in Qatar widely viewed as the Muslim Brotherhood 's chief spiritual guide -- issued a fatwa or religious ruling obliging any Libyan soldier who had the opportunity to do so to assassinate the leader . Fighting on Libya 's front lines Should coalition support Libyan rebels ? Al-Amin Bilhaj , a leading figure in the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood and the President of the Muslim Association of Britain -LRB- MAB -RRB- recently traveled to Benghazi , the headquarters of the rebel movement , according to Hresha . Other Brotherhood exiles have returned to help treat the wounded in hospitals , according to Kemal el Helbawy , the Egyptian founder of the British association . There is little or no overt presence of the Brotherhood in Benghazi , according to CNN 's Arwa Damon , who has been there for most of the month . But in the longer term , in a country where the political space has been dominated by Gadhafi for more than 40 years , the Brotherhood 's organization and nationwide presence may afford it an advantage . The West has nothing to fear from the Muslim Brotherhood in Libya , according to Hresha . Like their counterparts in Egypt , they would embrace multiparty democracy . `` I 've lived for many years in Canada and the UK , and that 's exactly the political system that we want , '' Hresha said . Hresha says that if his organization forms a political party , it would seek to legislate according to Koranic principles , which would include , for example , a continued ban on the sale of alcohol . `` Why should n't we be able to press our point of view -- we are humans too , '' he said . Hresha said the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood welcomes airstrikes in Libya , a startling turnaround for a movement that previously supported jihad by Iraqis against U.S. forces occupying Iraq . `` I salute and am very grateful to the Americans , French and British governments for stopping the killing , '' he said . `` I will never forget this . '' Hresha said he hopes a post-Gadhafi Libya will be a close friend to the West . A more prominent role for the Brotherhood in Libya could dent support for al Qaeda and other jihadist groups , especially in eastern provinces that have witnessed significant radicalization in recent years . But Libya 's deeply tribal structures -- unlike Egypt and Tunisia -- may complicate its efforts to build a national base . And hardline `` Salafi '' preachers have gained influence in neglected towns like Derna -- on the coast near the border with Egypt . `` Conservative imams -LRB- in Derna -RRB- , '' a U.S. diplomat wrote in 2008 , `` deliberately sought to eliminate the few social activities on offer for young people to monopolize the social and cultural environment . '' But in the end , the reach of the Brotherhood may be most limited by the emergence of secular forces at the forefront of the rebel movement . The Interim National Council in Benghazi -- a 30-member opposition leadership -- is mostly made up of lawyers , doctors , intellectuals and former political prisoners with a secular bent . In a statement Monday , the Council stated the ultimate goal of the revolution was `` to build a constitutional democratic civil state based on the rule of law , respect for human rights and the guarantee of equal rights and opportunities for all its citizens including ... equal opportunities between men and women and the promotion of women empowerment . '' Guma el-Gamaty , a Libyan academic based in the UK who has emerged as a key liaison between the Libyan opposition overseas and the Benghazi Council said no Muslim Brotherhood leaders had yet been appointed to the Council , and played down their influence . Hresha , the long-time Brotherhood member , expects that to change . `` We 've been working secretly till this moment , '' he said .

Gen. Carter Ham , commander of U.S. Africa Command , also said on CNN 's `` The Situation Room '' Friday that removing leader Moammar Gadhafi by military means is not the aim of the mission and that the coalition is not arming rebel forces . And the general claimed `` we have achieved already a large degree of success '' -- including an arms embargo , the no-fly zone and the halting of loyalist troops near the rebel-held city of Benghazi . President Barack Obama will update the nation at 7:30 p.m. ET Monday from the National Defense University at Fort McNair in Washington , D.C. , the White House announced . NATO this weekend is expected to take over control of the no-fly zone from the United States and finalize procedures on protecting civilians . But Ham acknowledged that challenges remain . NATO prepares to take over Libya mission Bullets fired into Libyan maternity ward `` We find these regime forces taking cover inside built-up areas where they know -- because of our concern for civilian casualties -- that we wo n't strike in there , '' he told CNN 'S Wolf Blitzer . Loyalist snipers , along with armored units , continue to be a threat . `` It is a tough , tough challenge for us , '' said Ham , speaking from Stuttgart , Germany . `` When we see regime forces attacking civilians , we will do everything we can to stop those attacks . '' Not long after allies unleashed cruise missiles against Gadhafi air defenses last Saturday , Obama told Americans he wanted the United States , which has headed the military campaign , to hand over control of the enforcement of a U.N. Security Council resolution . The resolution called for the protection of Libyan civilians and the enforcement of the no-fly zone . NATO , which includes the United States , will lead both efforts . The United States has been treating the protection of civilians as part of the mission , and that activity will continue regardless of the command structure , Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney said . `` Job one is to protect the Libyan people and the job does n't change because we have a new boss , '' he said , briefing reporters at the Pentagon . Fighting on Libya 's front lines Obama on Friday conducted a conference call and meeting with congressional leaders to provide an update on the conflict and attempt to address their concerns about the mission 's organization , cost and consequences . Democrats appeared more satisfied than Republicans . Meanwhile , coalition fighter planes in a 24-hour period took out seven Libyan tanks it claims were threatening civilian populations , including in the city of Ajdabiya , authorities said Friday . Although Gadhafi is feeling the pinch of more than 850 air sorties , the `` regime is still able and still determined to reinforce their positions , '' Gortney said . British Tornado fighter jets identified Libyan tanks with their weapons pointed north toward Ajdabiya and destroyed them , Air Vice Marshal Phil Osborn said Friday . The British military released video of two such tanks bursting into flames and smoke . The United Arab Emirates , meanwhile , announced it will send 12 aircraft in the coming days to help patrol and enforce the United Nations-mandated no-fly zone . And Turkey , once wary of military operations , agreed to the use of an eastern air base in Izmir as a sub-command station . Other Muslim nations participating in the Libya mission include Qatar , which will begin flying planes this weekend , and Kuwait and Jordan , which have agreed to provide humanitarian or logistical support . But as the military operation continues , the situation for Libyans caught in battle zones grows more dire by the day , humanitarian agencies reported . The United Nations refugee agency said Friday that increasing numbers of Libyans are displaced from their homes due to fighting . Refugees streaming out of Ajdabiya described chilling scenes . `` I could n't even begin to describe to you the horror that I have seen , '' one man told CNN . `` Leaving Ajdabiya we saw dead bodies in the street . No one would ever dare go to recover them . '' CNN is not identifying Libyans it has interviewed for their own safety . Another man said Gadhafi 's troops were going house to house in Ajdabiya , hunting for opposition members . He said the troops took away five men from his neighbor 's house . He did n't know what happened to them . Early Friday , coalition warplanes roared again through Libyan skies , bombing the periphery of the capital where military bases are located . Anti-aircraft fire burst out but then fell silent . International reporters in Tripoli were escorted to farmlands east of Tripoli in Tajura , where Gadhafi 's government claims airstrikes killed civilians . Reporters found no evidence of civilian deaths . Two military bases along the way had been bombed and were still smoking Friday . In Tajura , missile fragments lay scattered about a palm orchard and shrapnel had peppered walls of still-standing farm buildings . One farmer told reporters that a missile landed about 8 p.m. Thursday , but there were no military installations nearby . The missile gouged a small hole in a palm tree and sprayed debris that damaged windows and doors of the farm buildings . Gadhafi has been keen to put out the word on collateral damage from the coalition 's airstrikes . International reporters were taken this week to a seaside cemetery in Tripoli where the funerals of 33 people allegedly killed in airstrikes were taking place . State television said the dead were victims of the `` crusader colonial aggression . '' CNN could not independently verify the circumstances of the deaths or who the victims were . In Tripoli , CNN reporters go on government-organized tours in an effort to do their own reporting ; Libyan authorities forbid independent movement by international journalists in Tripoli . The reports of civilian deaths have been given little credence by coalition forces . `` The only civilian casualties we know of for certain are the ones that the Libyan government itself has caused , '' Gortney has said . Instead , it is Gadhafi who is almost sure to face serious charges for his brutal crackdown on protesters , said a spokeswoman for the International Criminal Court . The prosecutor of the court is `` 100 percent '' certain Gadhafi will face charges of crimes against humanity once an investigation has been completed , the spokeswoman said . Meanwhile , the Libyan delegation attending an African Union meeting in Ethiopia said the country is committed to a cease-fire and is ready to let the African Union monitor one . `` We demand the cessation of the air bombardment and the naval blockade carried out by Western forces and the United States for the invalidity of its argument to protect civilians since it is killing them by the hundreds and is attacking and destroying our armed forces and paving the way for the other side to attack , '' said Mohammed al-Zwai , speaker of the Libyan People 's Assembly . Under an agreement reached Thursday , NATO forces will be able to close Libyan air space to all flights except humanitarian ones and will be able to use force in self-defense . Michael Burns , a former U.S. ambassador to NATO , said he expects the defense alliance to take over command of the entire operation in a few days to keep up pressure on Gadhafi . The alliance said Friday that Canada 's Lt. Gen. Charlie Bouchard , stationed in Naples , Italy , will take the lead for the Libya mission . `` The no-flight zone alone can not protect the civilians of Libya , '' Burns told CNN . `` Gadhafi is still attacking . ... He is still on the move in some places . '' U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he has seen no signs of the cease-fire called for under U.N. Resolution 1973 , which was hurriedly passed March 17 , as Libyan forces were closing in on the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . `` To the contrary , fierce battles continue in and around the cities of Ajdabiya , Misrata and Zinan , '' Ban said Thursday , adding his envoy told Libyan authorities that if the government did not comply with the cease-fire resolution , `` the Security Council was prepared to take additional measures . '' The Libyan conflict was sparked in February by protests against Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule . The strongman responded with force against civilians , prompting the international community to take action beginning last weekend .

Under Thursday 's agreement , NATO forces will be able to close air space to all flights except for humanitarian ones and will be able to use force in self-defense . NATO also has sent a directive to its military chain of command asking for a plan on how to execute an expanded role for enforcement of U.N. Resolution 1973 , according to NATO sources . Under what some officials were calling `` no-fly plus , '' NATO would be given more robust rules of engagement to ensure that civilians are protected , the sources said . And , in an effort to ease concerns from Turkey -- the organization 's sole Muslim country -- coalition forces would be allowed to withdraw from certain missions , such as those involving attacking Libyan soldiers , the sources said . media trip goes wrong Gadhafi tanks turned into wreckage What does Libya 's military have left ? Should coalition support Libyan rebels ? As for the prospect of a more robust mandate , one that the U.S.-led coalition has followed so far , `` That decision has not been made yet , '' Rasmussen said . He added that NATO will have outside help in whatever mission it opts to pursue . `` It 's of utmost importance to stress that this is not primarily a NATO operation , '' he said . `` It is a broad international effort in which we will include partners from the region that have pledged to contribute to this protection of civilians in Libya . '' Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , who will travel to London to attend an international meeting on Libya on Tuesday , gave an upbeat assessment of what the coalition has accomplished in five days . `` We have made significant progress , '' she told reporters . `` A massacre in Benghazi was prevented . Gadhafi 's air force and air defenses have been rendered largely ineffective , and the coalition is in control of the skies above Libya . '' She welcomed the fact that the coalition includes aircraft and pilots from Qatar and Thursday 's announcement by the United Arab Emirates that it , too , would send planes to protect Libya 's civilians . `` In the days ahead , as NATO assumes command-and-control responsibilities , the welfare of those civilians will be of paramount concern , '' she said . `` This operation has already saved many lives , but the danger is far from over . '' Rasmussen said the issue did not represent a split in NATO over the mission . However , he also acknowledged that , if unaltered , the agreement would mean the overall mission would have two parts , with NATO enforcing the no-fly zone and the U.S.-led coalition handling a naval blockade and airstrikes . Thursday 's deal was reached after a conference call among Clinton and her counterparts from Britain , France and Turkey , according to diplomatic officials who spoke on condition of not being identified by name . So far , U.S. forces have shouldered the bulk of the mission , according to figures provided by the Pentagon . Of the 175 Tomahawk missiles fired , 168 were from the United States and seven from Great Britain , the only two countries to possess them , while U.S. planes have flown almost two-thirds of the sorties and U.S. ships comprise more than two-thirds of the total involved . The flurry of diplomatic activity came as the battle for control of Libya was continuing to unfold . After a fifth consecutive night of pounding by coalition jets , Libyans gathered at a seaside cemetery in Tripoli on Thursday for the funerals of 33 people Gadhafi 's government said were victims of an airstrike . State television said the dead were victims of the `` crusader colonial aggression . '' Earlier , a Libyan government official said coalition planes struck the suburb of Tajura and state TV showed images of fires , smoldering vehicles and the charred bodies of the dead . At the cemetery , anger trumped grief and Gadhafi 's message was loud and clear : innocent people were wrongly killed and the Libyan people will fight back . CNN could not independently verify the circumstances of the deaths or who the victims were . In Tripoli , CNN reporters go on government-organized tours in an effort to do their own reporting ; Libyan authorities forbid independent movement by international journalists in Tripoli . Fighting on Libya 's front lines White House answers Libya questions What could be the end game in Libya ? Military leaders talk U.S. role in Libya The reports of civilian deaths were given little credence by coalition forces , which launched airstrikes Thursday near Tripoli , Misrata and Ajdabiya in Libya . `` The only civilian casualties we know are for certain are the ones that the Libyan government itself has caused , '' U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney said . At the United Nations , Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he has seen no signs of a cease-fire by Libyan government authorities , as called for by U.N. Resolution 1973 , which was hurriedly passed last Thursday as Libyan forces were closing in on the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . Ban told council members , `` to the contrary , fierce battles continue in and around the cities of '' Ajdabiya , Misrata and Zinan . He added that his envoy told Libyan authorities that if the government did not comply with the cease-fire resolution , `` the Security Council was prepared to take additional measures . '' Ban said he had sent his envoy to an African Union meeting to be held Friday in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , at which representatives of the Gadhafi government and the opposition were expected to attend . `` Their aim : to reach a cease-fire and political solution . '' But there was no sign that any such solution was near . The battle for Misrata , Libya 's third-largest city , has been ongoing for more than a week . British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Thursday that many residents remain trapped in their homes without electricity and communications and with a dwindling supply of food and water . In the east , Gadhafi 's tanks were shelling Ajdabiya , where fighting had occurred the day before . Loyalist forces still controlled the northern and western gates to the city . `` This underlines the appalling danger its inhabitants would be in without coalition action , as do continued threats by Gadhafi forces to ` massacre ' residents in areas under bombardment , '' Hague said . The coalition has established a no-fly zone that spans from east to west along Libya 's coast . French jets fired air-to-ground missiles on a Libyan combat aircraft Thursday that was in violation of the no-fly mandate , destroying it , the French Defense Ministry said . The plane was struck as it was landing in a Misrata airfield . The civil war was sparked in February by protests demanding an end to Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule . The Libyan strongman responded with force against civilians , prompting the international community to take action beginning last weekend . Though the rebels ' position may have improved since then , a U.S. official said Gadhafi 's forces still have the upper hand . They remain capable of carrying out attacks on the opposition , are relatively well-organized and continue to fight effectively , the official said .

Robert Gates recently completed a six-day trip abroad He is due to step down at some point this year He has served eight presidents over his career Aboard A U.S. Military Aircraft -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Defense Secretary Robert Gates stepped out of a helicopter at Amman Airport in Jordan . He smiled at his staff and the cameras , raised his hands and said , `` Let 's go home . '' Moments later , the `` Doomsday Plane , '' his link to the Pentagon and the White House from wherever he is in the world , rolled down the tarmac and climbed into a sunny sky . The 67-year-old secretary is on his way out of government after serving eight presidents , but he has n't announced a departure date yet other than saying it will be this year . And these regular trips are intensive , long days for the former career intelligence professional -- walking the beat , embracing allies , bolstering morale and getting his own fix on the troubles of the day . Gates ended his latest overseas jaunt -- a six-day trip to Russia and the Middle East -- by traveling by helicopter from Amman Airport to Jordan 's Royal Palace for a private , no-cameras-allowed meeting with King Abdullah . He said privately , according to aides , what he had been saying publicly on the trip -- that the upheaval across the Middle East was serving up challenges and opportunities , and the key was to sort them out . Overshadowing his stops in Russia , Egypt and Israel was the U.S. and coalition military operation over Libya . He delayed his planned departure on this trip for a day at the start of the air attacks . Gen. Ham : We will not arm Libyan rebels Libya 's civil war making families homeless Will coalition forces target Gadhafi ? While in Russia , he found himself in the middle of a political dispute over the Libyan mission . Aides informed him when a U.S. fighter jet and two aviators went down and were rescued near Benghazi . He was briefed on every development as the U.S. Air Force and Navy led the airstrikes . And while many on his plane dozed or ate their meatloaf and mashed potatoes on the flight back to Washington on Friday , Gates was linked to the White House and a National Security Council conference call for the latest deliberations on the military , diplomatic and political calculus of enforcing the Libyan mission . Gates will make appearances on the Sunday talk show circuit and visit Capitol Hill in the coming days to offer public and private explanations of how the U.S. military performed . And perhaps he also will speak about his view of the future . But on the trip , in public statements , and in talking to traveling and local journalists , he was careful and diplomatic . He dispensed with each question about `` the endgame '' of the Libyan missions by saying the goals are clear : creation and enforcement of the no-fly zone and protection of Libyan civilians . About targeting Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , about working in concert with Libyan rebels , about the risk of a military stalemate , Gates would n't bite , saying the future there is for the Libyans themselves to decide . Gates told America 's Middle East allies that Washington stands by them . In Cairo , he repeated his praise for the Egyptian military for keeping that country from going over the brink in the mass protests that toppled President Hosni Mubarak just last month . He arrived in Israel just after a bus stop bombing in Jerusalem and continuing rocket attacks in the south . Gates repeated the standard line that the U.S. commitment was unshakeable and used the code words for continued aid , saying that the United States would ensure Israel 's qualitative military edge . On his last day , he moved briskly from photo-op to meetings . The first stop was the old Roman town of Caesarea , a luxury hotel where guests gawked at the motorcade and the heavily armed , plain-clothes Israeli agents standing watch . Inside , Gates met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who promised that the recent terrorism would be answered with what he called `` great force and great determination to put a stop to it . '' And there was also mention of the elusive goal of a peace agreement , with Netanyahu adding , `` we seek to establish security for the establishment of peace . '' Gates offered his condolences to the families of the victims of the terror attack and those enduring the rocket attacks in southern Israel . Next stop for Gates , after a wild convoy ride through Israeli traffic , was the West Bank , and a reminder of how many administrations have tried and failed to nudge the sides toward Mideast peace . Now in an armored SUV , he crossed over to newly constructed Palestinian Authority offices in Ramallah . In the diplomatic game , where symbols can substitute for substance , Gates acknowledged that his presence alone made history . `` I understand I 'm the first American secretary of defense to visit Ramallah , '' Gates told the Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad . At the end of his remarks before the assembled media , before a 50-minute closed-door meeting , Gates added that he looked forward to discussing the central -- but elusive -- element of U.S. peace proposals for Israel and the Palestinians , a two-state solution . Later , in Ramallah , crowds of people leaving a mosque at the end of Friday prayers watched the Gates convoy glide past , as the secretary raced on to his next meeting and on to Washington .

By Saturday evening , advancing opposition fighters had reached the outskirts of the city of Brega , to the west of Ajdabiya , said opposition spokesman Col. Ahmed Omar Bani . `` The winds of change are starting to blow , '' Bani told reporters in Benghazi . Gadhafi 's troops fell back after days of fierce fighting in Ajdabiya , Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told reporters . He said the coalition 's airstrike attacks were direct and the Libyan military decided to withdraw . That air campaign continued Saturday , further limiting loyalist movements . French warplanes destroyed at least five Libyan combat planes and two helicopters over a 24-hour period , the Ministry of Defense said . Rebels take back critical Libyan city Libya 's civil war making families homeless Meanwhile , an especially loud explosion and the subsequent sound of a plane , most likely belonging to the allies , were heard late Saturday in Tripoli , but there was no anti-aircraft fire in response . After the fall of Ajdabiya , the fighting is sure to shift westward through cities and towns that are more loyal to Gadhafi . Jalal al-Gallal , another spokesman , said the opposition expects heavy resistance in towns like Sirte , Gadhafi 's birthplace , where he has strong support . Gadhafi 's forces resumed shelling Misrata , just two hours east of Tripoli , where some of the most intense fighting has taken place since protests erupted in Libya last month . A witness told CNN that Gadhafi troops randomly targeted buildings and people in Misrata . Another witness said he saw busloads of loyalist snipers being brought to the city . CNN could not independently verify those accounts . Officials have said Gadhafi is far from defeated and still retains the power to reinforce units . Opposition fighters chanted gratitude for the coalition 's support after they wrested control of Ajdabiya , considered a gateway to Libya 's vast oil fields and a stopping point en route to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . They were confident that with protective air power they would be able to hold onto the city they had captured once before but lost to Gadhafi 's army . Ajdabiya is now `` 100 percent '' in opposition hands , said Shamsuldin Abed Mawlah , spokesman for Libya 's opposition interim council . He said many loyalists were retreating westward . Overnight , international fighter jets again bombed Libyan tanks that have been entrenched at the city 's northern and western gates for days , said al-Gallal . At the northern entrance , damaged tanks lay strewn across the rolling desert . The buildings around the city entrances were riddled with bullet holes . Rebel troops combed the city 's streets Saturday , hunting for any remaining Gadhafi loyalists as some displaced residents trickled back to their homes . The Ajdabiya victory is viewed as significant for the opposition . It also served as evidence of the impact of coalition airstrikes as NATO prepares to take command of the Libya mission this weekend . Coalition airstrikes targeted Gadhafi 's military on the outskirts of Misrata but tanks resumed shelling Saturday , a doctor at the main hospital told CNN . Opposition fighters , armed only with light weapons , were trying to repel the attack and casualties were mounting , he said . At least 20 people were wounded in Misrata , victims of snipers taking aim in the heart of the city , said the doctor , who was not identified for safety reasons . Friday , seven people were killed and another 70 were wounded . Al-Gallal said the next big battle will be for control of Misrata . `` He -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- is scared about Misrata , '' al-Gallal said . `` It 's too close to Tripoli . He 's going to do everything he can to hold on to it . '' Opposition leaders uploaded a video that showed a rooftop view of Misrata . Gunfire could be heard and puffs of smoke rose from at least one rooftop , possibly indicating a sniper . CNN could not verify the contents of the video . Coalition planes flew 164 sorties Friday in Operation Odyssey Dawn and coalition leaders reported damage to Gadhafi 's ground forces . `` Coalition forces have targeted anti-air capabilities , tanks , armored vehicles , as well as other regime forces threatening the civilians throughout the country , '' said Capt. Clint Gebke , a coalition spokesman . U.S. President Barack Obama defended America 's leadership in the international coalition in his weekly radio address Saturday . `` Make no mistake , '' Obama said , `` because we acted quickly , a humanitarian catastrophe has been avoided and the lives of countless civilians -- innocent men , women and children -- have been saved . '' `` The United States should not -- and can not -- intervene every time there 's a crisis somewhere in the world , '' Obama said . `` But I firmly believe that when innocent people are being brutalized ; when someone like Gadhafi threatens a bloodbath that could destabilize an entire region ; and when the international community is prepared to come together to save many thousands of lives -- then it 's in our national interest to act . And it 's our responsibility . This is one of those times . '' Obama is scheduled to deliver a televised address on Libya Monday evening . Libyan government spokesman Ibrahim Mussa slammed the coalition attacks . `` This is immoral , illegal and it was not authorized by the -LRB- United Nations -RRB- Security Council , '' he told reporters in Tripoli .

Her face was heavily bruised . So were her legs . She displayed blood on her right inner thigh . She said her name was Eman al-Obeidy . She was well-dressed and appeared to be a well-to-do middle-aged woman . She spoke in English and said she was from the rebel stronghold of Benghazi and had been picked up by Gadhafi 's men at a checkpoint east of Tripoli . She sobbed and said she was held against her will for two days and raped by 15 men . `` Look at what Gadhafi 's brigades did to me , '' she said . `` My honor was violated by them .

International journalists , including CNN 's staff , are not allowed to move freely in the Libyan capital and are escorted out of the hotel only on organized outings by government minders . This was the first time a Libyan opposed to Gadhafi attempted to independently approach the journalists here . What followed was a disturbing scene of how Gadhafi 's government operates .

'' They dragged her unceremoniously to a waiting white car . `` If you do n't see me tomorrow , than that 's it , '' she yelled . The journalists believed al-Obeidy 's life to be in danger , and several of them demanded to see her . At a news conference later , they challenged Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim on what they had experienced . Kaim told them that authorities were investigating the incident . `` We will let you know , '' he said . Later , a government spokesman said al-Obeidy was `` safe '' and `` doing well . '' He said her case was a criminal one -- not political -- and that she has been offered legal aid . Officials later said the woman was sane and would bring criminal charges against her attackers . Journalists would be able to see her , they added . But his assurances did little to assure the journalists who had witnessed Gadhafi 's firm and pervasive grip on Libyan society . A woman who dared to speak against him was quickly silenced . Journalists who dared to tell her story paid a price .

Rebel forces told CNN that forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi pulled back from Ras Lanuf . A CNN crew in the city witnessed damaged vehicles on the outskirts of the town , though the town appeared to have avoided major destruction . There were some homes that appeared burned , and others had gaping holes . The damage looked to be from fighting when Gadhafi 's forces had originally pushed the rebels out . There were no clashes reported Sunday , rebels said . Rebels also appeared to have taken control of the key oil town of Brega , a CNN team on the scene observed . Some opposition fighters focused on securing Brega 's entrance while others traveled in trucks heading west , encountering little resistance along the way . NATO takes over Libya mission The gains signify that the rebel forces have reclaimed all the territory they lost to Gadhafi 's forces at the start of the war . The opposition comeback was paved in part by coalition airstrikes designed to stop the killings of civilians , and that have hit Gadhafi 's forces . Coalition airstrikes continued Sunday as NATO approved an operations plan that will shift the entire Libyan military mission to alliance command , officials said . The new NATO mandate will begin in two to three days , NATO officials said , allowing the current coalition , led by the United States , the United Kingdom and France , to stand down . Coalition officials say the airstrikes are aimed at enforcing a no-fly zone and protecting civilians in Libya . But Libyan government officials have countered that claim , arguing that coalition forces only target troops loyal to Gadhafi . `` The rebels are making their advance and no one is stopping them . And no one is even talking to them or saying , ` Where are you going ? ' or ` Why are you taking offensive positions and attacking the Libyan army and Libyan cities ? ' '' Moussa Ibrahim , a Libyan government spokesman , told reporters in Tripoli . He accused NATO of `` starving the Libyan population to get Libya on its knees to beg for mercy . '' `` They are trying to weaken our spirits . They are not trying to protect civilians , '' he said . Ibrahim added that 29 people were injured Sunday when a `` peace convoy '' came under attack by `` armed militias . '' No one was killed , he said . While the opposition rolled westward , the city of Misrata -- located between the rebels ' current position and Tripoli -- remained under siege by government forces for the 11th consecutive day , an eyewitness told CNN . The city remained under shelling and pro-Gadhafi snipers remained on rooftops , he said . Pro-Gadhafi forces appeared to be shelling strategic places like the port and a main industrial area , he said . Busloads of soldiers have arrived in the city dressed as civilians , the witness said . The soldiers ostensibly came to participate in a peace march , but it appeared to be a ploy to set up positions around the city , he said . Woman alleges Libyan forces raped her Libya responds to rape claim `` The snipers are firing into the main streets and into the back streets . There are also tanks , '' he said . According to him , 116 civilians have been killed in the last week . A doctor in Misrata working at a hospital said eight civilians were killed and 22 injured in the violence Sunday . CNN could not immediately confirm his report independently . French warplanes on Sunday led airstrikes on armored vehicles and on a large ammunitions depot in the regions of Misrata and Zintan , according to the French Ministry of Defense . After Ras Lanuf , the next major city on the highway toward the capital of Tripoli is Gadhafi 's hometown of Sirte . Rebel forces told CNN they expect a long and bloody battle there . In Tripoli on Sunday , CNN 's Nic Robertson reported he heard six loud explosions and saw heavy anti-aircraft tracer fire . The CNN team there heard at least four explosions early Monday , followed again by anti-aircraft fire . Meanwhile , U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said that Gadhafi is placing the bodies of people his regime has killed at the sites of some missile strikes by the U.S.-led coalition , according to intelligence . In an interview broadcast Sunday on the CBS program `` Face the Nation , '' Gates said he was unaware of coalition attacks causing civilian casualties . `` The truthof the matter is we have trouble coming up with proof of any civilian casualties that we have been responsible for , '' Gates said in the interview conducted Saturday . `` But we do have a lot of intelligence reporting about Gadhafi taking the bodies of the people he 's killed and putting them at the sites where we 've attacked . '' Asked how often it has happened , Gates replied : `` We have a number of reports of that . '' Determined to topple Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year reign , rebels have said they will continue the westward march to Tripoli . `` The dictator has chosen to take the bloody road . ... We encourage him to leave or we will force his removal , '' opposition spokesman Col. Ahmed Omar Bani told reporters Saturday . State television reported that civilian and military locations in Sabha and Gadhafi 's birthplace of Sirte were bombed overnight . Coalition planes flew at least 96 airstrike missions in a 24-hour period that ended Saturday , according to statistics released by the Pentagon , and leaders reported damage to Gadhafi 's ground forces . Opposition fighters chanted gratitude for the coalition 's support Saturday after they wrested control of Ajdabiya , considered a gateway to Libya 's vast oil fields and a stopping point en route to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . The coalition 's air campaign continued Saturday , further limiting loyalist movements . French warplanes destroyed at least five Libyan combat planes and two helicopters over a 24-hour period , the Ministry of Defense said . Explosions and airstrikes were also reported in Tripoli , Tarhunah and Misrata .

NATO agrees to take on all Libya operations Transition to happen in two to three days The United States will get the transition it has been pushing for NATO to take over no-fly zone by Monday Brussels , Belgium -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- NATO 's North Atlantic Council on Sunday approved an operations plan that will shift the entire Libyan military mission to alliance command , officials said , easing the burden on the United States and its allies to protect civilians in the war-torn country . NATO ambassadors unanimously approved a so-called `` no-fly plus '' plan that will put the alliance in charge of protecting civilians as well as enforcing a no-fly zone and an arms embargo . `` Our goal is to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas under threat of attack from the Gadhafi regime , '' NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said . `` NATO will implement all aspects of the U.N. resolution . Nothing more , nothing less . '' The new NATO mandate will begin in two to three days , NATO officials said , allowing the current coalition , led by the United States , the United Kingdom and France , to stand down . NATO 's role in Libya unclear Libyan rebels claim key gains US Libya mission : Fly-over with no end ? At the same time , NATO was putting the final touches on its takeover of the no-fly zone over Libya . The handover from the United States and allies should be complete by Monday . NATO officials described the transition as a phased and seamless operation . All alliance members will have to abide by the rules of engagement approved Sunday , albeit with caveats that may allow some nations not to participate in operations in Libya . However , it is assumed that none of these nations will prevent other alliance members from executing the military plan and rules of engagement that were approved . A senior U.S. administration official spoke to reporters soon after the announcement . He stressed the NATO mission is to protect civilians and did not rule out the possibility of an attack on the rebels if they were to go on the offensive and strike cities with civilian populations , now held by pro-Gadhafi forces . The official also said he expected more countries to participate in the Libyan mission now that NATO has assumed command of it . He praised the speed with which the group of 28 allies reached a consensus . The office of British Prime Minister David Cameron similarly cheered the news of a NATO agreement . `` NATO is already enforcing the arms embargo and the no-fly zone . Today 's agreement to transfer complete command and control of all military operations to NATO both ensures that partners from the region are able to participate and represents a significant step forward as we plan for the next phase of this vital mission , '' it read .

'' Abdallah says government minders violently blocked journalists , broke his camera Abdallah saw one minder with a gun in his hand , so the photojournalist backed away Editor 's note : CNN photojournalist Khalil Abdallah recounted his experience to CNN.com writer Ashley Fantz for this story . Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- CNN photojournalist Khalil Abdallah was having breakfast Saturday in a Tripoli hotel that houses foreign press when a woman burst into the restaurant , screaming that she had been raped and beaten for days by Moammar Gadhafi 's brigades . Her sudden entrance startled the group of international journalists , who were about to begin another day covering the crisis in Libya . The woman 's face was heavily bruised , a long bruise running down the left side of her cheek . She walked around , sobbing , shouting , lifting her dress to show a bloody thigh . Her ankles and wrists were bloody where she said she had been bound . One of the few present who spoke Arabic , the photojournalist understood her pleas . `` She was saying , ` We are all Libyans ! Why do n't you treat us the same ? ' '' Abdallah recounted Sunday for CNN.com . The woman told the journalists that she had been picked up at a government checkpoint east of Tripoli , tied , beaten and raped for two days . Her name was Eman al-Obeidy , she said . Woman alleges Libyan forces raped her Reporters gathered around her , trying to calm her , Abdallah recalled . He and other photojournalists dashed for their cameras . `` We were all in shock , '' Abdallah said , trying to keep a steady hand . He knew that minders -- the men Libya 's government assigns to foreign journalists to monitor their every move -- were nearby . Reporters had barely asked a few questions before those minders were on them , pushing and shoving reporters to the side , trying to jerk the woman away . Some of them were wearing their distinctive red badges , Abdallah said , while others were in plain clothes . Journalists tried to defend themselves and keep the woman away from the minders . `` It was like a rugby pileup , '' Abdallah said . A correspondent for Britain 's Channel 4 , Jonathan Miller , tried to push one of the minders back . The woman was trying to fight back as well , Abdallah said . `` She is pushing him -LRB- a minder -RRB- back saying , ` Do n't touch me , leave me alone ! ' '' `` From that point on , everybody in this hotel was against us -LRB- the journalists -RRB- , '' the photojournalist recounted . Minders ran after journalists , jumping on them , beating them , he said . At one point a bag was placed over the woman 's head and she was led out to the hotel garden . She was questioned for about 40 minutes , and then minders came back inside . They announced that the woman was crazy and that she was being taken to the hospital . `` All the minders were telling us she was drunk or had mental problems , '' Abdallah said . A short while later , the woman was led through the lobby . Journalists followed , protesting , shouting for the men to let her go . A journalist can be heard on video asking her : `` Are you OK ? '' `` No , '' the woman answers , her voice shaky . She yells into a camera : `` If you do n't see me tomorrow , then that 's it ! '' The woman is forced into a waiting car . She shouts that she is being taken to jail . The minders told reporters that they could see the woman again , later . `` We have been told that we 'd see people again , but we never do , '' said Abdallah . An image he captured shows a minder pointing his finger at Abdallah just before snatching his camera and breaking it . `` He ripped the microphone off , the viewfinder , his nails sunk into my arm , '' said Abdallah . `` I was pulling the camera one way ; he was pulling it the other way . '' While wrestling for his camera , Abdallah saw a minder standing nearby holding a 9 mm handgun . The photojournalist let go and slowly began to back out of the restaurant . Then Abdallah heard something from the minders that he has come to expect , but that never fails to sting him . '' ` He is Arab ! ' ` Why is he doing this to us ? ' '' `` Once you 're labeled like that , it does n't matter what your citizenship is , '' he said . `` But what I felt more was terrible for this woman and how the government is going to deal with her . `` That is the thing that is most disturbing .

Her claim contradicts an earlier statement from the government , which has said that Eman al-Obeidy was released and is at home with her family . `` Yesterday , late at night at 3 a.m. , they called me from Bab al Aziziya , '' Gadhafi 's compound in Tripoli , al-Obeidy 's mother told Al-Jazeera television Monday . `` And they told me : Make your daughter Eman change her statement ... and we will release her immediately and whatever you ask for you will get , whether money , or a new apartment , or guaranteeing financial security for you and your children . But just tell Eman to change her statement . '' A government spokesman said Sunday that al-Obeidy had been released and was with her family . Spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said then that al-Obeidy and her family were asked if they wanted to be interviewed by `` one or two , preferably female , reporters to verify that she 's fine , she 's healthy , she 's free with her family . '' He refused to take further questions on the issue , repeatedly stating that Libyan society is `` very conservative . '' Marriage for woman allegedly raped Cousin : ` She did n't look like herself ' A group of lawyers and human rights activists tried to approach Al-Obeidy 's sister 's house Monday , but were blocked by security forces . The sister 's mobile phone has apparently been turned off , a source with the opposition in Tripoli told CNN , and no one has seen her since the incident at the hotel . The family of al-Obeidy said she is a lawyer -- and not a prostitute or mentally ill as Libyan government officials initially said after the incident . The government has since changed its story , saying she is sane and pursuing a criminal case . Al-Obeidy 's father told Al-Jazeera that his daughter `` has her full mental capabilities and she is a graduate of law school and a lawyer and she is pursuing higher education in Tripoli . And she was kidnapped by Gadhafi 's tyrannical forces . '' `` I am not ashamed of my daughter , '' al-Obeidy 's mother , who spoke from an undisclosed location in Libya , told the network . `` I am proud of her because she has broken the barrier . She broke the barrier that no man can break . And those dogs there with him , Moammar , -LRB- are -RRB- the criminals ! '' She urged the youth of Libya to take action . Al-Obeidy burst into a Tripoli hotel as international journalists were having breakfast Saturday morning . Her face was bruised , as were her legs . She showed reporters blood on her right inner thigh . Speaking in English , she said she was from the rebel stronghold of Benghazi and had been held against her will for two days and raped by 15 men . Though her injuries appeared consistent with what she said , CNN could not independently verify al-Obeidy 's story . `` Look at what Gadhafi 's brigades did to me , '' she said . `` My honor was violated by them . '' Al-Obeidy displayed what appeared to be visible rope burns on her wrists and ankles . Government officials tried to stifle her , but she persisted . Security forces moved to subdue her , and even a member of the hotel 's kitchen staff drew a knife . Another staffer tried to throw a dark tablecloth over her head . One government official , who was there to facilitate access for journalists , pulled a pistol from his belt . Others scuffled with reporters and wrestled them to the ground in an attempt to take away their equipment . Some journalists were beaten and kicked . CNN 's camera was confiscated and deliberately smashed beyond repair . As security forces subdued the screaming woman and dragged her away , al-Obeidy warned , `` If you do n't see me tomorrow , then that 's it .

John McCain : Obama saying regime change wo n't be pursued militarily is `` puzzling '' CNN 's Fareed Zakaria : `` Important '' speech explains U.S. military response is limited Rudolph Giuliani : `` The president 's speech tonight has made things even murkier '' -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In a televised address Monday night , U.S. President Barack Obama explained the reasons he involved the U.S. military in the U.N.-authorized mission in Libya , saying `` it was not in our national interest '' to let the citizens of a rebel stronghold suffer a massacre at the hands of approaching pro-government forces . Obama also said that NATO would take full control of the military mission on Wednesday . Following is a collection of reactions from people including U.S. politicians and political analysts . U.S. Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona : `` I think that the first part of his speech was excellent , and he laid out the reasons why it was important to intervene and what would have happened in Benghazi . ... He made a strong case . '' `` Then ... he made a very puzzling comment , and that was -LRB- regime change by force -RRB- would be a mistake . Gadhafi must have been comforted by that . '' `` The president 's policy is Gadhafi must go . I think there 's a chance , if we keep the pressure on , Gadhafi could be thrown under the bus -LRB- by people surrounding him . -RRB- '' `` It 's clear we 're on the side of the rebels in this conflict . ... -LRB- But -RRB- if we tell Gadhafi , ` Do n't worry , you 're not going to be removed by force , ' I think that 's very encouraging for Gadhafi . '' Fareed Zakaria , host of CNN 's `` Fareed Zakaria GPS '' : `` It was actually an important speech . It was quite carefully constructed . It had a humanitarian angle , a strategic angle . But at the heart of what Obama is saying is that there are places in the world where the United States does not have vital national interests , where we have not been attacked , but we have limited interests and we 're going to try to find a way to have some kind of limited military response . '' `` What John McCain was suggesting -LRB- in the reaction above -RRB- frankly strikes me as a very dangerous argument -- that in a place where we have clearly limited interests , clearly nonvital interests , the United States and the president should -LRB- have -RRB- an open-ended policy of military escalation and say we will do whatever it takes to get Moammar Gadhafi out of office . That is , frankly , the way we got in conflicts like Vietnam . In order to not be humiliated , we could n't back down . '' Michael Steel , spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio : `` The speech failed to provide Americans much clarity to our involvement in Libya . Nine days into this military intervention , Americans still have no answer to the fundamental question : What does success in Libya look like ? '' U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina : `` I thought he did a good job talking about the signal we would send , that we are a values-based people , and stranding by these young people in Libya will serve us well in the future . But the line that really sort of broke my heart was that regime change by force would be a mistake . The goal of this country is to replace Gadhafi . If you look at the balance sheet of what it costs this nation with Gadhafi versus what it costs without him , it is in our interest to get rid of him , and the opposition needs continued military support -- not a ground invasion by the U.S. or any other Western power , but air support -- all the way to Tripoli . '' `` If we continue the model we have in place ... -LRB- the rebels -RRB- will win . If we back off , this thing is going to go on for a long time , and a lot of people will die unnecessarily . '' Ali Suleiman Aujali , former Libyan ambassador to the United States : `` I think it is a great speech . The president was very clear and very determined , and defended his position in a nice way , and I think he convinced the American people . '' `` The Americans , they proved to the world they will not only intervene if there -LRB- are -RRB- American interests only , but ... also when human life is in danger . This is a historical decision . ... We really appreciate what America did for the Libyan people . The Libyan people ... deserve a better government . '' Rudolph Giuliani , former New York City mayor : `` The president 's speech tonight has made things even murkier than they were before . The whole purpose of this was to clarify our mission . Our mission is just internally contradictory . The president says our mission is to protect the people of Libya . Well , how do you protect the people of Libya and not be for regime change in Libya ? Is n't the danger to the people of Libya Gadhafi ? '' `` The president 's speech is illogical . If you were grading this on a Greek logic exam , you 'd give it an F. The speech contradicts itself . It says limited action ; we 're not going to go any further than just protecting the people of Libya ; we 're not going to be for regime change . But you ca n't protect the people of Libya without regime change . Why are we there in the first place ? Because Gadhafi was slaughtering his people . How can you leave him there ? '' P.J. Crowley , former U.S. State Department spokesman : `` The president 's policy is to assist in the removal of Moammar Gadhafi . The issue is not with the policy . The issue is the mechanism . We 're acting in a limited manner to level the playing field so the Libyan people themselves and the opposition that has formed , they 'll do that job . It 's not for the United States to impose that from the outside . '' Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson : `` I felt the president was very presidential tonight . He explained the purpose : To avert a humanitarian disaster , to protect civilian lives . He even added ... a -LRB- potential -RRB- refugee crisis going to Tunisia and Egypt . '' `` I was very satisfied with his speech tonight . Again , consultation with Congress in the days ahead is going to be very important . But he explained the objective , and he explained what he wants to do , and the airstrikes have succeeded . Air defenses of Libya have been almost destroyed . The rebels are gaining momentum . Look , they 're probably not perfect revolutionary characters , but they 're sure as heck a lot better than Gadhafi staying . ... I applaud the president tonight . '' Fouad Ajami , professor of Middle Eastern studies at Johns Hopkins University : `` I think it 's the right thing at last . I think the president did a great job . I 'm not a fan of President Obama ; I did n't vote for him . I think he should have done this much earlier . But ... he finally did it . And I think he answered the great questions about this intervention . ... And he told us the truth : This was always about Benghazi . It was about a rescue operation that he was forced to do , and I think it 's the right thing . '' Anne-Marie Slaughter , professor of international affairs at Princeton University : `` I think -LRB- Obama -RRB- ... made clear that we went in to avoid what he described as violence on a horrific scale in Benghazi ; that the mandate of the U.N. coalition ... is to protect Libyan civilians . I think that makes very clear what success looks like there . It means that Libyan civilians are safe -- safe in their houses , safe in their cities . At the same time , he made very clear that in his U.S. policy -- and the policy of many of our allies -- that Libya needs to have a new government that responds to the demands of the Libyan people , and that we will pursue every diplomatic and economic means to that end . And leveling the playing field militarily will certainly help . '' David Gergen , CNN senior political analyst : `` I thought in general -LRB- Obama -RRB- made a compelling case -- a very strong case for intervention itself on humanitarian grounds . He made a compelling case that the United States has helped to organize the international coalition much more rapidly than has happened in the past , as in Bosnia . And furthermore , I think he made a compelling case that these early U.S. actions really have accomplished what the United States promised to do , and that was to stop Gadhafi from killing other people . `` But ... the success of the speech ended there , because he left open all these questions about where we go from here if there 's a stalemate -- and there were signs today that there may be a stalemate . What are we going to do ? What is NATO going to do ? I do n't think anybody knows that . What is going to happen if Gadhafi hangs in there for six months ? What do we do then ? What happens if Gadhafi gets forced out ? What happens if the regime cracks and they turn on him -- even assassinate him ? What 's the United States ' role going to be in building a new Libya ? It thought that was left cloudy , and is going to continue the debate . `` But give President Obama his due . On the most important issue that he had to face tonight -- why he went in -- I thought he made a very , very strong case . '' Ari Fleischer , White House press secretary under President George W. Bush `` The tricky think here is , when you have a president who does the right thing , but who does it four weeks too late , can you really say it is the right thing ? This is really something that should have been done four weeks ago , when it was really likely that the rebels , by virtue of ... a multilateral action , could have tipped the scales and made Gadhafi think ... he needs to get out of there . I have a hard time seeing that happen now . I think it 's a fight to the finish , and this finish ends up in a stalemate .

The first NATO sorties to maintain the no-fly zone over Libya flew on Sunday , NATO officials said . The alliance is expected to be in complete command of the no-fly zone by the end of the day Monday . The mission of protecting civilians is expected to be under full NATO control by the end of the week , they said . By taking control of the full mission , NATO will allow the United States to step out of its lead role and more into a supporting one as requested by the Obama administration . In an interview with CNN here at NATO headquarters , Anders Fogh Rasmussen said , `` The U.N. mandate authorizes the enforcement of an arms embargo , '' and that NATO has decided to participate . `` We are not in Libya to arm people , but to protect people , '' he said . NATO takes over Libya mission Libyan rebels continue westward push Obama to speak on Libya Monday What does Obama need to say Monday ? The ambiguity of the U.N. Security Council Resolution about Libya has made for a wide range of opinion among nations about exactly the kind of intervention that is permitted in order to `` protect civilians . '' In an interview Sunday , U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates would not rule out the possibility of arming the rebels . `` No decision has been made about that at this point . The Security Council resolution would permit it . The second resolution , 1973 , would permit it . But no decisions have been made by our government about it , '' Gates told NBC 's `` Meet the Press . '' Some NATO sources acknowledged to CNN that they expect the scope of the rules of engagement to be more narrow than the coalition 's thus far , but they caution that as the situation on the ground changes , so too will the character of the NATO mission . `` Our mandate is very clear : We are there to protect civilians against attacks , no more , no less , and that will be our focus , '' Rasmussen said . He was unwilling to further characterize the nature of the rules of engagement . `` I will leave it to the military commanders to take decisions in concrete operations . We have decided in the NATO council on the overall political framework in full accordance with the U.N. mandate , and that is to protect civilians . And then we will leave it to the commanders to take daily decisions . '' The rules of engagement and the use of force to protect civilians have been contentious issues as NATO sought consensus to take over the Libyan mission . Turkey and Germany were among a handful of alliance members that want a more strict interpretation of the U.N. mandate . France , in particular , had been seeking more latitude to further embolden the rebels to topple Moammar Gadhafi . Rasmussen ruled out the possibility of any NATO member country carrying out a parallel campaign in Libya , including France . `` No , NATO is about solidarity , and the fact that NATO takes over the operation means that we have a unity of command '' he said .

If you missed it , here 's what you need to know from the speech -- all in `` just '' 1,350 words . \\*\\* please note : this is an edited down version of the president 's speech , as prepared for delivery \\*\\* Good evening . Tonight , I d like to update the American people on the international effort that we have led in Libya what we have done , what we plan to do , and why this matters to us Mindful of the risks and costs of military action , we are naturally reluctant to use force to solve the world s many challenges . But when our interests and values are at stake , we have a responsibility to act . That is what happened in Libya over the course of these last six weeks . For more than four decades , the Libyan people have been ruled by a tyrant Moammar Gaddafi . He has denied his people freedom , exploited their wealth , murdered opponents at home and abroad , and terrorized innocent people around the world including Americans who were killed by Libyan agents . Last month , Gaddafi s grip of fear appeared to give way to the promise of freedom . In cities and towns across the country , Libyans took to the streets to claim their basic human rights . Faced with this opposition , Gaddafi began attacking his people . Ten days ago , having tried to end the violence without using force , the international community offered Gaddafi a final chance to stop his campaign of killing , or face the consequences . Rather than stand down , his forces continued their advance , bearing down on the city of Benghazi At this point , the United States and the world faced a choice We knew that if we waited one more day , Benghazi a city nearly the size of Charlotte could suffer a massacre that would have reverberated across the region and stained the conscience of the world . It was not in our national interest to let that happen . I refused to let that happen . And so nine days ago , after consulting the bipartisan leadership of Congress , I authorized military action to stop the killing and enforce UN Security Council Resolution 1973 . We struck regime forces approaching Benghazi to save that city and the people within it And tonight , I can report that we have stopped Gaddafi s deadly advance . To summarize , then : in just one month , the United States has worked with our international partners to mobilize a broad coalition , secure an international mandate to protect civilians , stop an advancing army , prevent a massacre , and establish a No Fly Zone with our allies and partners . To lend some perspective on how rapidly this military and diplomatic response came together , when people were being brutalized in Bosnia in the 1990s , it took the international community more than a year to intervene with air power to protect civilians . Moreover , we have accomplished these objectives consistent with the pledge that I made to the American people at the outset of our military operations . I said that America s role would be limited ; that we would not put ground troops into Libya ; that we would focus our unique capabilities on the front end of the operation , and that we would transfer responsibility to our allies and partners . Tonight , we are fulfilling that pledge . Our most effective alliance , NATO , has taken command of the enforcement of the arms embargo and No Fly Zone . Last night , NATO decided to take on the additional responsibility of protecting Libyan civilians . This transfer from the United States to NATO will take place on Wednesday . In that effort , the United States will play a supporting role . . Because of this transition . the risk and cost of this operation to our military , and to American taxpayers will be reduced significantly . Despite the success of our efforts over the past week , I know that some Americans continue to have questions about our efforts in Libya . Gaddafi has not yet stepped down from power , and until he does , Libya will remain dangerous . Moreover , even after Gaddafi does leave power , forty years of tyranny has left Libya fractured and without strong civil institutions . The transition to a legitimate government that is responsive to the Libyan people will be a difficult task . And while the United States will do our part to help , it will be a task for the international community , and more importantly a task for the Libyan people themselves . In fact , much of the debate in Washington has put forward a false choice when it comes to Libya . On the one hand , some question why America should intervene at all even in limited ways in this distant land . It is true that America can not use our military wherever repression occurs . And given the costs and risks of intervention , we must always measure our interests against the need for action . But that can not be an argument for never acting on behalf of what s right . In this particular country Libya ; at this particular moment , we were faced with the prospect of violence on a horrific scale . Some nations may be able to turn a blind eye to atrocities in other countries . The United States of America is different . And as President , I refused to wait for the images of slaughter and mass graves before taking action . Now , just as there are those who have argued against intervention in Libya , there are others who have suggested that we broaden our military mission beyond the task of protecting the Libyan people , and do whatever it takes to bring down Gaddafi and usher in a new government . Of course , there is no question that Libya and the world will be better off with Gaddafi out of power . I , along with many other world leaders , have embraced that goal , and will actively pursue it through non-military means . But broadening our military mission to include regime change would be a mistake If we tried to overthrow Gaddafi by force , our coalition would splinter . We would likely have to put U.S. troops on the ground , or risk killing many civilians from the air . The dangers faced by our men and women in uniform would be far greater . So would the costs , and our share of the responsibility for what comes next . To be blunt , we went down that road in Iraq . Thanks to the extraordinary sacrifices of our troops and the determination of our diplomats , we are hopeful about Iraq s future . But regime change there took eight years , thousands of American and Iraqi lives , and nearly a trillion dollars . That is not something we can afford to repeat in Libya . As Commander-in-Chief , I have no greater responsibility than keeping this country safe . And no decision weighs on me more than when to deploy our men and women in uniform . There will be times , though , when our safety is not directly threatened , but our interests and values are In such cases , we should not be afraid to act but the burden of action should not be America s alone . As we have in Libya , our task is instead to mobilize the international community for collective action . Because contrary to the claims of some , American leadership is not simply a matter of going it alone and bearing all of the burden ourselves . Real leadership creates the conditions and coalitions for others to step up as well ; to work with allies and partners so that they bear their share of the burden and pay their share of the costs ; and to see that the principles of justice and human dignity are upheld by all . My fellow Americans , I know that at a time of upheaval overseas when the news is filled with conflict and change it can be tempting to turn away from the world . But let us also remember that for generations , we have done the hard work of protecting our own people , as well as millions around the globe . We have done so because we know that our own future is safer and brighter if more of mankind can live with the bright light of freedom and dignity . Tonight , let us give thanks for the Americans who are serving through these trying times , and the coalition that is carrying our effort forward ; and let us look to the future with confidence and hope not only for our own country , but for all those yearning for freedom around the world . Thank you , God Bless you , and may God Bless the United States of America . Tunisia , Egypt , Libya Protests , and the likes , share one thing in common . It would boil down to unstoppable wave and movement of freedom . March 29 , 2011 at 12:43 am | Reply March 29 , 2011 at 12:59 am | Reply I am a long time CNN fan , but was most frustrated with tonight 's `` covrerage '' of the President 's speech on Libya . In particular John King , normally a smart man and equally savvy Wolf Blitzer tortured us and their guests respectively with the same questions . I lost respect for their repetitious harranging of Fareed Zakaria and Wesley Clark , who both made outstanding and insightful comments on the speech . More of them as commentators please particularly on this subject , and John and Wolf , how many times can you ask the same question ? Situations like what is happening in the region are by definition fluid and to not appreciate nuances is incomprehensible . How can one expect an `` exit strategy '' while the situation is unfolding by the hour and not the day ? You two sounded like GOP `` plants '' in your less than subtle criticism of the President not being more specific . it is not good for Americans , who have been `` dumbed down '' enought by the likes of black and white sound bite thinkers . You 're better than that ... at least I hope that this was an off night . As a political `` junkie '' I was so appalled by you two in particular that not only did it seem as if iwas in the movie `` Groundhog Day , '' but I had to go to Law and Order re-runs just to settle down . And with that I 'll rest my case . March 29 , 2011 at 1:17 am | Reply The Democrats pounded President Bush for years , asking why he have entered two wars without an exit strategy . I is only true that we should ask the same of the Democrat President . March 30 , 2011 at 3:01 pm | Reply This was a perfect speech outlining the most intelligent path any US president could possibly take and have taken regarding intervention in Libya . There is no height of praise that overstates President Obama 's valor in his approach to helping the world and the Libyan people in the past days . It was absolutely optimal . I am glad I am not a republican struggling to find some modicum of error in President Obama 's choices to advance my own political position . I would open my mouth and whatever contradictory words seeped out would make me feel like an idiot . March 29 , 2011 at 3:09 am | Reply I was satisfied with the speach he said exactly what I felt this mission was about in the first place . I had no false ideas and knew the presidant would get critizided from all sides . He is is correct on being a true leader means to create a team a team than can work together and help bear the burden you can witness that in all successful corparations and grat sports team Duh and with this nato team I expect grat things in the world to happen as long as they stick together March 29 , 2011 at 10:11 am | Reply Hypocrite ! Now , that it suites his purpose he tells us that American 's do n't turn a blind eye to atrocities . He tells us that our own future is safer and brighter if more of mankind can live with the bright light of freedom and dignity . Then why did we do NOTHING when there were mass protests in Iran in 2009 ? Why , when the people of Iran were asking for help & support , for the same freedoms that we say we support around the world , we sat on our hands , did NOTHING , said NOTHING ! Hypocrisy at it 's very best ! March 29 , 2011 at 2:59 pm | Reply @ Eli -- It was not President Obama who wanted to go in . He reluctantly did so after the UN decided to intervene . So your question should be to the UN . You can not blame everything on President Obama . March 29 , 2011 at 9:22 pm | Reply @Eli , evidently the UN nor CONRESS saw fit to intervene ! We as ` blogging politicians ' , evidently did n't PUSH for intervention either ! So who are REALLY the hypocrites ? PRESIDENT OBAMA works , if at all possible within the boundaries of the law . AMERICA was put in mainly in support of the humanitarian crisis ! ` He tells us that our own futures are safer and brighter ... ' ? Well now , did n't GWB say just about the same thing when he pull down HUSSEIN ? IRAQ was truly ` THE ILLEGALEST WAR OF THE CENTURY ' , PERIOD ! March 30 , 2011 at 1:54 pm | Reply Liz , please remind me again , just how was the war in Iraq illegal ? Let 's see , he got congress approval , some 80 % of Americans were behind the war , oh yea , and the UN had approved the removal of Hussein . March 30 , 2011 at 3:05 pm | Reply When did the UN approve anything other than sanctions ? Or are we in FOX territory ? `` Following Sean Hannity 's lead , The Washington Times falsely suggested that the United Nations supported President Bush 's invasion of Iraq . In fact , the U.N. Security Council did not back Bush 's invasion of Iraq , and then-Secretary General Kofi Annan suggested the invasion was ` illegal . ' '' People seem to forget hitsory a lot these days . it was only 40 years ago that Psychologists at UC Davis declared homosexuality not a mental disorder ? I know that has little comparison to what you were talking about but I 'm smelling what you 're stepping in . August 1 , 2012 at 10:56 pm | Reply The connection for world Islamic terror somehow always can be traced back to Syria and Iran . Trouble is that we have a Wimp in Chief in the White House who was supposed to make things better with Iran and has only made it worse . And when Obama had the chance to help the Iranian people who were begging him for at least verbal support , he was on vacation and cared less . But when an ally of the US , Mubarak was in trouble , Obama ditched him under the bus just like he did his mentor Rev. Jeremiah Wright . March 30 , 2011 at 2:06 pm | Reply It was to halite a historically documented fact that almost all social and economic disaster in the past century and half , have been a direct result of lunatic leftist policies . See socialism , communism , Maoism . . and all other isms . It is as if this -LRB- mostly lest educated lot -RRB- are convinced that hey know best . They are usually the noisiest in all political forums but once their planned policies fail they quickly move on to another bizarre set of actions . See their most recent hoax , Global Warming . March 30 , 2011 at 2:07 pm | Reply Jay , why are you saying DEMOCRATS are the only ones who were asking about an exit strategy ? There were a few REPUBLICANS questioning the same thing . There was not 80 % of AMERICANS behind that war and I mean from ANY party ! We all wondered what in the hades was going on when we knew BIN LADEN was n't there ! Then early on we found out there were no WMDs ! We found out that was just lies and trickery ! We finally heard about the ` oil potential ' ! So what 80 % of AMERICANS are you talking about ? That 's just lies ! March 30 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | Reply May 2003 A Gallup poll made on behalf of CNN and the newspaper USA Today concluded that 79 % of Americans thought the Iraq War was justified , with or without conclusive evidence of illegal weapons . March 31 , 2011 at 4:35 am | Reply Bush 's administration was saying we could n't wait for conclusive evidence because `` the smoking gun will be a mushroom cloud . '' Of course people were for the war when Bush was saying in the SOTU to Congress that Saddam was buying uranium from Africa . Every justification Bush gave for the war at the time -LRB- the humanitarian aspect was not a factor -RRB- was proved false . All the intelligence was forged or extremely dubious , foreign governments said it , the CIA knew it , and if Bush did n't know it then there was a huge problem with his administration . April 1 , 2011 at 10:46 pm | Yes , we sure did start asking when were we going to get our boys and girls back home ! We were n't really asking for an ` exit strategy ' persay ; we just wanted to know when they were getting out of there ; out of IRAQ , period ! We did n't care about strategy , it could have been by any means necessary ! The mission changed 2 or 3 times after there were no weapons ; it became lets go get HUSSEIN ; then let 's stay here in these civil wars to protect the people ! Let 's go get this oil and money while we 're here !

We could disagree until we were blue in the face , the cowboys went right on doing what they wanted to do !

In mid-January , autocratic Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali fled the country and an interim government took over .

Khamis Gadhafi abruptly cut off his visit and returned to Libya , where he has led the 32nd Reinforced Brigade , known at the Khamis Brigade , in its suppression of rebel forces . ABC News was the first to report Khamis ' recent stay in the U.S. . The brigade 's headquarters was the target of six Tomahawk missiles overnight , according to Vice Adm. William Gortney of the Joint Staff . Libya 's state TV on Monday night broadcast live footage from Gadhafi 's Tripoli compound of Khamis dressed in uniform and greeting people . Prior to the broadcast there had been unconfirmed reports that the younger Gadhafi had died from injuries he suffered when a plane flown by a disgruntled Libyan pilot crashed into a military compound while he was there . -LRB- 7:55 p.m. Monday ET , 1:55 a.m. Tuesday in Libya -RRB- The world had a `` unique ability to stop '' violence `` on a horrific scale '' in Libya by acting in a broad coalition with the support of Arab countries , U.S. President Barack Obama said in his televised address on Libya . `` I am convinced that a failure to act in Libya would have carried a far greater price for America , '' he said . He also said that while there is no question that Libya would be better off without Moammar Gadhafi as leader , the United States will actively pursue his ouster through non-military means . But broadening the military mission `` to include regime change would be a mistake , '' Obama said . The transition to a `` legitimate government '' in Libya is `` a task for the international community , and more importantly , a task for the Libyan people themselves , '' Obama said , adding : `` If we tried to overthrow Gadhafi by force , our coalition would splinter . '' -LRB- 7:38 p.m. Monday ET , 1:38 a.m. Tuesday in Libya -RRB- - U.S. President Barack Obama , addressing the Libyan situation in a televised speech , said he ordered U.S. warships into the Mediterranean off Libya because of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's `` brutal repression '' of his people and `` a looming humanitarian crisis . '' `` It was not in our national interest '' to let the citizens of Benghazi - a rebel stronghold on which pro-Gadhafi forces were advancing before coalition airstrikes - suffer a massacre at the hands of Gadhafi 's forces , Obama said . It would have `` stained the conscience of the world , '' he said . -LRB- 7:03 p.m. Monday ET , 1:03 a.m. Tuesday in Libya -RRB- Pro-Gadhafi forces say they have taken control of the entire western Libyan city of Misrata after days of fighting there , but rebels say they still control the center of the city . The Libyan government has escorted journalists , including CNN 's Nic Robertson , to Misrata , but not to the city 's center . In the video below , Robertson describes seeing signs of heavy fighting in Misrata , including `` mile after mile of damage '' and `` tanks hiding under trees at the side of the road .

CNN 's Jennifer Rizzo takes a look at those capabilities - military tools that other coalition and NATO countries do not , or do not have as much of , including surveillance and communication jamming capabilities . -LRB- 5:31 p.m. Monday ET , 11:31 p.m. in Libya -RRB- The U.S. military already has reduced its day-to-day presence in the coalition military operation above and around Libya , according to a defense official . `` Some of the ships have peeled off , but are still in the region , '' said the official , who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the mission . At least two of the ships involved in the initial phase of establishing the no-fly zone over Libya - which began March 19 - are no longer involved in day-to-day operations , the official said . NATO is beginning to take command and control of the no-fly zone . However , it could take until Thursday or Friday for the organization to take over the entire mission mandated by a March 17 U.N. Security Council resolution . That resolution authorized the no-fly zone 's creation and the protection of civilians . -LRB- 4:37 p.m. Monday ET , 10:27 p.m. in Libya -RRB- U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney said at the Pentagon Monday that the United States is not working in direct support of opposition forces in Libya . `` We 're not coordinating with the opposition , '' he said , adding that any gain it makes is `` tenuous . '' Gortney 's comments come after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov complained Monday that airstrikes by an international coalition including the United States seemed to expand beyond the scope of a U.N. resolution . That resolution , approved on March 17 , created a no-fly zone above Libya and mandates the protection of civilians . `` There are reports - which go undenied - that the air forces of the coalition conduct airstrikes on -LRB- Libyan leader Moammar -RRB- Gadhafi 's troops and support the military actions of rebels . There is an obvious controversy there , '' Lavrov told reporters in Moscow . `` We believe that the interference into what is , essentially , an internal civil war is not sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council resolution . '' Libyan government officials also have argued that coalition forces target only troops loyal to Gadhafi . -LRB- 4:31 p.m. Monday ET , 10:31 p.m. in Libya -RRB- U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney said at the Pentagon Monday that there have been no confirmed reports of civilian casualties in Libya as a result of coalition activity . On Monday , Libyan state television displayed images of injured people in a hospital and destroyed buildings as it reported that civilians were wounded when bombs struck the central Libyan city of Sabha . CNN was unable to independently verify that report . U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates on Sunday said America had `` intelligence reporting about Gadhafi taking the bodies of the people he 's killed and putting them at the sites where we 've attacked . '' -LRB- 4:10 p.m. Monday ET , 10:10 p.m. in Libya -RRB- Hours ahead of U.S. President Barack Obama 's nationally televised addressed on the situation in Libya , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that `` if the American people are uncertain as to our military objectives in Libya , it 's with good cause . '' `` What national security interest of the United States justified the risk of American life ? '' McConnell , R-Kentucky , asked . `` What is the role of our country in Libya 's ongoing civil war ? '' Obama 's speech follows calls from across the political spectrum for him to clarify America 's role in the U.N.-authorized military mission in Libya . -LRB- 3:14 p.m. Monday ET , 9:14 p.m. in Libya -RRB- U.S. intelligence sees signs that some of those who are `` relatively close to the Libyan leader are questioning whether he has staying power , '' a U.S. official says , according to CNN 's Pam Benson . American intelligence has seen indications that the `` morale of Gadhafi forces is on the decline '' as rebels have made significant gains over the past week , the official said . -LRB- 1:23 p.m. Monday ET , 7:23 p.m. in Libya -RRB- Libyan opposition fighters Monday entered territory loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , but soon had to flee amid a barage of gunfire , rebels told CNN . As they moved into Umm el Ghindel - near Sirte , Gadhafi 's birthplace - they began searching some homes and found that Gadhafi 's forces had armed residents in the area , rebels said . As they were talking to residents , asking them to join the opposition , gunfire broke out . Rebels told CNN they refused to fire back and began a hasty retreat . A stream of vehicles could be seen fleeing the area . -LRB- 1:21 p.m. Monday ET , 7:21 p.m. in Egypt -RRB- Egypt 's military rulers reduced a nationwide curfew so that it applies from 2 a.m. to 5 a.m. as of Monday , said Maj.

The death toll was expected to rise , said the sources , who asked that they not be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the news media . The blast comes after months of demonstrations against Yemen 's President Ali Abdullah Saleh , and a weekend of violence between government forces and the local al Qaeda group . -LRB- 11:34 a.m. Monday ET , 5:34 p.m. in Syria -RRB- Two Reuters journalists missing in Syria since Saturday have been released by Syrian authorities , the news agency reported Monday . A Syrian official said the journalists were detained and questioned because they did not have a permit to work in Syria and had filmed `` in an area where filming is not permitted . '' The two traveled to Syria on Thursday to cover the unrest in the country , according to Reuters . Until their release Monday , television producer Ayat Basma and cameraman Ezzat Baltaji were last heard from on Saturday , when they sent a message to a colleague saying they were about to leave Syria for Lebanon , the news agency said . -LRB- 11:13 a.m. Monday ET , 5:13 p.m. in Syria -RRB- An `` extraordinary number '' of security forces flooded the Syrian city of Daraa on Monday , patrolling streets and guarding government buildings in an apparent attempt to stave off further protests , a political activist in the city told CNN . The city is extremely tense and `` people are sitting at home scared watching the updates on TV , '' said Aman Aswad . He said thousands of troops were deployed in the city , guarding government buildings , major streets and the city gates . At least 37 people have died in violent protests since last week in Daraa , according to the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights . But Syria 's state-run news agency denied reports that security forces had fired on protesters Monday . The reports are `` completely false , '' the agency reported on its website , citing an official government source . -LRB- 10:21 a.m. Monday ET , 4:21 p.m. in Libya -RRB- NATO officials said the alliance is expected to be in complete command of the no-fly zone over Libya by the end of the day Monday .

The first NATO sorties to implement the no-fly zone over Libya flew on Sunday , NATO officials said . NATO expects to have complete command and control of all aspects of the Libyan mission by week 's end , allowing the United States to step out of its lead role and more into a supporting one , as requested by the Obama administration . In an interview with CNN at NATO headquarters , Anders Fogh Rasmussen said , `` The U.N. mandate authorizes the enforcement of an arms embargo , '' and that NATO has decided to participate . `` We are not in Libya to arm people , but to protect people , '' he said . -LRB- 9:19 a.m. Monday ET , 3:19 p.m. in Egypt -RRB- Voters in Egypt will elect members of parliament in September and cast ballots for president sometime after that , a member of the ruling military council said Monday .

Mamdou Shahen said the elections would not be held under Egypt 's emergency law , though he did not specify when the law would be lifted . -LRB- 9:03 a.m. Monday ET , 3:03 p.m. in Libya -RRB- Libyan opposition fighters continued their march west Monday with a key target in their sights : Sirte , Moammar Gadhafi 's birthplace . Rebel forces claimed to have gained control Ras Lanuf on Sunday . The opposition also appeared to have taken control of the key oil town of al-Brega . Victories in those cities marked a comeback for the ragtag group of amateur soldiers who are unified by one mission : toppling Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule . On Monday , opposition troops and Gadhafi 's security forces battled over the town of Nawfaliyah . Opposition forces told CNN they had gained control of the city . -LRB- 8:11 a.m. Monday ET , 3:11 p.m. in Yemen -RRB- At least 40 people were killed and 90 wounded in an explosion at an ammunition factory in Yemen on Monday , medical and security officials said .

The setback for the rebels highlights the tenuous nature of their recent gains and suggests they might face more resistance in the days to come . As they moved into Umm el Ghindel -- near Sirte , Gadhafi 's birthplace -- rebels began searching homes and found that Gadhafi 's forces had armed residents in the area , they said . As they were talking to residents , asking them to join the opposition , gunfire broke out . Rebels told CNN they refused to fire back and began a hasty retreat . A stream of vehicles could be seen fleeing the area . CNN could not independently confirm details of the report . NATO takes over Libya mission Earlier , a wounded rebel with bandages on the left side of his head and face described what happened Monday about 30 kilometers -LRB- nearly 20 miles -RRB- from Sirte , near the city 's main entrance . He said he and a group of fellow opposition fighters came across a group of Gadhafi forces who raised a white flag -- a suggestion that they would not shoot . But as the opposition approached the group , Gadhafi forces fired on them indiscriminately , killing some of the opposition members and wounding others , the rebel told CNN 's Arwa Damon . Vehicles were destroyed as well , he said . Rebels credited coalition airstrikes with helping them regain ground , noting that they had encountered little resistance as they headed west over the weekend . But they said Monday that they need more airstrikes to advance further . Coalition officials say they are enforcing a U.N. Security Council resolution approved on March 17 that creates a no-fly zone above Libya and mandates the protection of civilians . Taking Sirte would be a symbolic victory for the rebels , who regained control of several significant towns over the weekend as coalition airstrikes continued . Rebels said the fight to take over Sirte could be their toughest and bloodiest battle yet . Opposition forces claimed to have gained control of the town of Ras Lanuf on Sunday . The opposition also appeared to have taken control of the key oil town of Brega . Those victories marked a comeback for the ragtag group of amateur soldiers who are unified by one mission : toppling Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule . On Monday , opposition troops and Gadhafi 's security forces battled over the town of Nawfaliya . Rebel forces told CNN they had gained control of the city . CNN could hear explosions and see plumes of smoke in the area of Nawfaliyah and Sirte . In Misrata , where rebel fighters have said they have been under siege for weeks , CNN 's Nic Robertson saw evidence of heavy fighting and damage Monday when the government organized a trip for reporters to the city . Government forces said they were in control of Misrata , though they did not allow Robertson and others into the city center , which rebels have said they control .

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , British Prime Minister David Cameron , Chairman of the African Union Jean Ping and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . U.S. President Barack Obama delivered a speech about Libya Monday , making his case for military intervention amid tough calls for him to clarify the United States ' role in the U.N.-authorized military mission . He stressed the United States has a strategic interest in stopping the Libyan leader , and said `` history is not on Gadhafi 's side . '' Despite the pressure for more international action , Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov complained Monday that the coalition 's actions seemed to expand beyond the U.N. resolution 's scope . `` There are reports -- which go undenied -- that the air forces of the coalition conduct airstrikes on Gadhafi 's troops and support the military actions of rebels . There is an obvious controversy there , '' he told reporters in Moscow . `` We believe that the interference into what is , essentially , an internal civil war is not sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council resolution . '' Russia abstained from voting on the U.N. Security Council resolution but did not veto it . Libyan government officials have also argued that coalition forces target only troops loyal to Gadhafi . `` The rebels are making their advance and no one is stopping them . And no one is even talking to them or saying , ` Where are you going ? ' or ` Why are you taking offensive positions and attacking the Libyan army and Libyan cities ? ' '' Moussa Ibrahim , a Libyan government spokesman , told reporters in Tripoli Sunday . He accused NATO of `` starving the Libyan population to get Libya on its knees to beg for mercy . '' `` They are trying to weaken our spirits . They are not trying to protect civilians , '' he said . NATO , which has 28 member countries , formally approved plans Sunday to take control of enforcing the U.N. Security Council resolution . The coalition enforcing the resolution has been led by the United States , the United Kingdom and France . `` Our mandate is very clear . We 're there to protect civilians against attacks . No more , no less , '' NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told CNN . Rasmussen said military commanders will make decisions on day-to-day operations within the framework NATO members agreed upon over the weekend . He declined to discuss specific rules of engagement , but stressed that NATO also is enforcing an arms embargo in Libya . `` We are not in Libya to arm people , but to protect people , '' he said . On Monday , Libyan state television displayed images of injured people in a hospital and destroyed buildings as it reported that civilians were wounded when bombs struck the central Libyan city of Sabha in the early morning hours . CNN was unable to independently verify that report . U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney said at the Pentagon Monday that there have been no confirmed civilian casualties in Libya as a result of coalition activity . Also Monday , video footage emerged online purporting to show forces loyal to Gadhafi abusing prisoners . CNN was not able to confirm the authenticity of the video or determine exactly when and where it was shot . In the clip , soldiers are seen taunting and slapping prisoners , who are crouched in the back of a truck with their hands bound . Qatar announced Monday that it would recognize the Transitional National Council , composed of opposition representatives , as the sole legitimate representative of the Libyan people .

Moammar Gadhafi has ruled Libya for 42 years He took control in a bloodless coup with fellow military officers in 1969 His efforts at a larger world role have often brought harsh international attention to his nation -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Once called the `` mad dog of the Middle East , '' Libya 's often flamboyantly dressed ruler , Moammar Gadhafi , has ruled the north African nation for 42 years . But Libya 's 679,362 square miles and 6.4 million people have rarely seemed enough for Gadhafi , who in 2008 gathered a group of African tribal leaders and had them grant him the lofty title , `` King of Kings . '' It was part of his campaign for a unified Africa -- a single federation with a million-man army at its disposal -- a nation that he , naturally , would serve as president , said Ronald Bruce St. John , the author of seven books on Libya . `` The Libyan stage is not enough of a playhouse for Gadhafi . It never has been , '' St. John said . Gadhafi 's `` King of Kings '' ploy was only another in a string of efforts by the mercurial leader to secure a larger-than-life place for himself on the world stage , efforts that have frequently landed him and his citizens in the harsh glare of an angry international community , according to St. John . Gadhafi 's growing anger over the rejection of Arab and African leaders and his own growing anti-Western sentiment led him to turn to terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s , said Dirk J. Vandewalle , a Libya expert at Darmouth University . It led to the infamous bombing of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie , Scotland , in which 270 people died . `` Terrorism was a cheap way to get even with the West , '' Vandewalle said . Gadhafi , who will turn 69 in March , seized control of Libya in the very place where the current tumult seems strongest , the city of Benghazi . As an Army captain , he led a bloodless coup against King Idris on September 1 , 1969 , establishing the Libyan Arab Republic in just two hours , according to GlobalSecurity.org , an independent provider of security information . He established a putative system of direct democracy called Jamahiriya that supposedly allowed the nation 's citizens direct input into their government , St. John said . In reality , the country was sliding into a dictatorship led by Gadhafi , he said . In taking control of the country , he became one of a number of young revolutionaries in the region carrying a strong message of Arab nationalism in the mold of Egyptian President Gamel Abdel Nasser , Vandewalle said . Although U.S. leaders initially tried working with Gadhafi , it quickly became clear he was an Arab nationalist and relations with the West quickly deteriorated , St. John said . By 1972 , he was urging Muslims to fight Western powers , including the United States and Great Britain , and backing black militants in the United States as he pursued a leadership position in the Arab world , seeking to succeed his political idol , Nasser , who had died in 1972 . But Arab leaders shunned his responses , Vandewalle said , seeing him more as a `` buffoon '' and a `` clown '' than a potential pan-Arab leader . That rejection , his own growing anti-Western sentiment and a lack of criticism within the tightly controlled Libyan political environment led Gadhafi to turn to terrorism , Vandewalle said . `` I think it was frustration more than anything else , '' he said . In 1986 , Libya was implicated in the fatal bombing at a West Berlin nightclub that left one American service member dead , prompting U.S. President Ronald Reagan to dub the Libyan leader the `` mad dog of the Middle East . '' The United States bombed targets in Libya in response and imposed economic sanctions . Two years later , Libya was implicated in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 , which exploded over Lockerbie , Scotland . In 1999 , seeking rapprochement with the West , Gadhafi succumbed to Western demands to turn over suspects in the Lockerbie bombing , and in 2003 the country agreed to eliminate weapons of mass destruction . The moves helped the country regain diplomatic relations with the United States in 2006 , but that was n't the end of Gadhafi 's touchy relations with foreign nations . In 2008 , Swiss officials jailed one of Gadhafi 's sons , prompting the furious leader to cut off the country 's oil supplies , withdraw the country 's money from Swiss banks and threaten to cut off diplomatic relations . And in 2009 , Libya and Gadhafi again became the subject of international ire in 2009 when the government granted a hero 's welcome to Abdel Basset al-Megrahi , who had been convicted in the Lockerbie bombing but was released by Scottish authorities for health reasons . While his politics have brought the attention of international leaders , it may be Gadhafi 's personal style that has brought him the most awareness around the world . Gadhafi is known for appearing in public in outrageous , sometimes outlandish , garb , St. John said . Images of the Libyan leaders available on the Internet show him dressed in everything from lavishly decorated military uniforms to animal prints . Gadhafi famously travels with a traditional Bedouin tent , whose appearance in 2009 frustrated officials in Bedford , New York , when he came to New York to address the United Nations . He also travels with a retinue of female bodyguards , St. John noted . While Gadhafi has a substantial number of enemies within Libya , his use of the county 's enormous oil revenues to provide subsidized health care , education and housing to citizens , as well as his willingness to stand up to the West , granted him a reserve of good will that he still draws on today , said Vandewalle . `` This was a young nationalist who stood up to the West , who nationalized the oil companies , who stood up to Great Britain and the United States , '' Vandewalle said . `` It was highly symbolic and there are a number of people there who still grudgingly respect him for that .

'' The president also signaled a willingness to negotiate a settlement to the conflict with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , but only based on the condition that Gadhafi would relinquish power as called for by the United States and its allies . Asked about the chances of Gadhafi fleeing or losing vital support from his family and top aides , Obama said that he believes those close to the Libyan leader likely feel what he called a tightening noose . `` I think that Gadhafi 's camp , people around him , are starting to recognize that their options are limited and their days are numbered , and so they are probably reaching out to a range of different people , '' Obama told CBS . `` But that information may not have filtered to Gadhafi yet and I think it 's too early for us to start having formal negotiations . '' Will U.S. arm Libya 's rebels ? Reaction to Obama 's Libya speech Gadhafi `` knows exactly what he needs to do to stop the constant bombardment that he 's under , and it may at some point shift to him to figuring out how to negotiate an exit , but I do n't think we 're at that point yet , '' Obama continued on CBS . On ABC , the president said that `` the first step is for Gadhafi to send a signal that he understands the Libyan people do n't want him ruling anymore , that 40 years of tyranny is enough . '' `` Once he makes that decision , I think the international community will come together and make a determination as to what the most appropriate way of facilitating him stepping down will be , '' Obama said . The interviews continued the determined tone of Obama 's Monday night speech , which detailed the strategic and moral reasons for committing U.S. troops to the Libyan mission while also promising the U.S. role would be limited in time and scope . Initially led by U.S. forces due to their `` unique capabilities '' for taking out Libya 's anti-aircraft and communications stations to establish a no-fly zone , the mission shifts to NATO control this week so allied nations share the responsibility and costs , Obama said . He pointed out to CBS that coalition airstrikes on Gadhafi forces threatening civilian populations `` will continue for some time '' despite the transfer in mission leadership . `` One of the questions that we want to answer is , do we start getting to a stage where Gadhafi 's forces are sufficiently degraded , where it may not be necessary to arm opposition groups ?

The way Ahmed tells it , he may have been a bit of a knucklehead growing up in Lexington , Kentucky . As teenage boys sometimes do , especially when bored , Ahmed threw eggs at houses , played pranks on neighbors , and would ditch school occasionally . He rooted for the University of Kentucky Wildcats , rode his bike around town , and listened to Lauryn Hill , Tupac Shakur and Nas . `` Yeah , it was a pretty normal childhood , for the most part , '' Ahmed says . `` Except I grew up wanting to assassinate -LRB- Libyan leader Moammar -RRB- Gadhafi . '' Ahmed , a 26-year-old U.S.-born Libyan-American , is better known as the rapper Khaled M. His father , Mohamed Ahmed , and mother , Wafa Nashnoush , spent most of their lives protesting the Gadhafi regime . Now , Khaled M. is doing the same in the song `` Ca n't Take Our Freedom . '' Ahmed grew up in Lexington 's Libyan community . His father was a Libyan political prisoner from 1972 to 1977 , after leading student groups against Gadhafi . Mohamed Ahmed was able to escape prison , flee Libya and lead opposition groups from abroad . But after three years of running , the family decided to raise Khaled and his two brothers in one town . The family settled in Kentucky , Khaled says , because `` Gadhafi 's assassins would never look for members of the opposition in Lexington . '' `` Every day , for the first five years I can remember , we lived with the paranoia that Gadhafi 's thugs would come to the door like they did to political opponents living in Europe , '' he says . After college at the University of Kentucky , Khaled moved to Chicago to pursue his rap career . `` Ca n't Take Our Freedom '' is his only overtly political song -- and his biggest hit . In the first week , the video for the song got more than 50,000 plays on YouTube . `` It is a tremendous feeling knowing people in Libya are hearing that message , '' he says . `` And not just there , but Indonesia and Argentina . There are a lot of people around the world who want to see a free Libya . '' It is quite a transition for Ahmed , who began rapping about girls back in sixth grade . `` It was never my intention to be a political rapper , or write political songs , '' he says . But , he adds , he felt compelled to record the song as the protests in Libya turned into a civil war . `` I felt like I had to stand up with them , in the way I know how . '' As the sun goes down and the wind picks up , we start winding down our interview . Ahmed , dressed in a black pea coat , flat cap and square-rimmed glasses , is looking down at his phone , trying to pick up more news about the fighting in Libya . Just then , two young women carrying shopping bags approach . Khaled is oblivious to them as he scrolls through his phone . They stand in front of him for a moment before asking if they can take his picture . `` Absolutely , '' he says . He stands up , and the woman with a free hand whips out her phone and snaps a quick shot . As they begin to leave , Ahmed shakes her hand , while his manager , who is on hand for the interview , quickly hands her fliers for an upcoming show . Ahmed 's manager Darrin Rich tells me that during that time , people have begun noticing the rapper with the trademark flat hat on the street . In the past month , he has been featured in more than a dozen national and local news profiles . As the two women leave , Ahmed seems unfazed . He plops back down on the stoop . `` I 'm not going to tell you it 's not nice being noticed , '' he says as he leans back against a concrete wall . `` But I think success comes for me personally only if I stay humble , if I stay happy , if I stay on a straight path .

Khamis Gadhafi abruptly cut off his visit and returned to Libya , where he has led the 32nd Reinforced Brigade , known at the Khamis Brigade , in its brutal suppression of rebel forces . The brigade 's headquarters was the target of six Tomahawk missiles overnight , according to Vice Adm. William Gortney of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . Gortney described the brigade as `` one of the most active in terms of attacking innocent people . '' Libya 's state TV on Monday night broadcast live footage from Gadhafi 's Tripoli compound of Khamis Gadhafi dressed in uniform and greeting people . Prior to the broadcast there had been unconfirmed reports that the younger Gadhafi had died from injuries he suffered when a plane flown by a disgruntled Libyan pilot crashed into a military compound while he was there . ABC News was the first to report Khamis Gadhafi 's recent stay in the United States . Gadhafi opposition runs into resistance AECOM has business dealings with Libya . The younger Gadhafi traveled from coast to coast meeting with high-tech companies , universities and defense contractors . His itinerary included stops in San Francisco , Los Angeles , Colorado , Chicago , Houston , Washington and New York City . Khamis Gadhafi left the United States for Libya on February 17 . Paul Gennaro , the senior vice president and chief communications officer for AECOM , issued a statement saying , `` The educational internship , which consisted of publicly available information , was aligned with our efforts to improve quality of life , specifically in Libya , where we were advancing public infrastructure such as access to clean water ; quality housing ; safe and efficient roads and bridges ; reliable and affordable energy ; and related projects that create jobs and opportunity . '' Gennaro said the company was `` shocked and outraged '' to learn of Khamis Gadhafi 's role in the Libyan crisis . `` We were aware of the student 's family relationship , but we were not informed of any military connection whatsoever , '' Gennaro said . It was the company 's understanding that Khamis Gadhafi was an MBA student from an accredited university in Spain . `` The student was positioned to help oversee improvements in Libya 's quality of life and infrastructure initiatives , which the country had been advancing since 2007 , '' he said . The U.S. State Department was aware of and approved all the meetings , Gennaro said . According to Gennaro , AECOM did not provide any funding for either Khamis Gadhafi or the internship program . Since 2008 , AECOM has been involved in a multibillion-dollar initiative with Libya to modernize the country 's infrastructure . The company withdrew all its expatriate employees and their families from Libya earlier this month .

The United States provides high-tech military equipment to the Libyan operation `` There are things we can do that our allies ca n't do , '' says one expert U.S. capabilities including surveillance and communications jamming Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As the United States transfers control of the Libyan operation to NATO , officials say the American military will continue to be a part of the effort . Since the operation began more than a week ago , the United States ' `` unique capabilities '' have been referred to time and time again by U.S. officials , from the president to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates . But what exactly does that mean ? The U.S. has military tools that other coalition and NATO countries do not , or do not have as much of , including surveillance and communication jamming capabilities that are major keys to any successful operation or war . `` The United States buys as much high-tech military equipment as all the rest of the world combined , '' says national security and weapons expert Loren Thompson of the Lexington Institute . `` Because of that , there are things that we can do that our allies ca n't do , like jamming radars , and collecting intelligence . '' Without these capabilities the coalition would have thought twice about the operation , Thompson says . Woman alleges rape by Gadhafi forces `` Our European allies would be reluctant to take on military combat in Libya unless they had support from the U.S. because there are so many advanced military systems that they do not have themselves , '' he says . The U.S. role however , will not be at the forefront just because of the high-tech weaponry , says defense expert John Pike of GlobalSecurity.org . `` It will be more of a supporting role than a pointy end of the spear role , '' said Pike . `` Most of these unique capabilities are support . '' At a Pentagon briefing Monday , U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney described the U.S. role in Libya by saying , `` Maybe we are n't flying the bulk of combat sorties any more , but the U.S. is now providing nearly 80 % of all air refueling , almost 75 % of aerial surveillance hours and 100 % of all electronic warfare missions . '' Here 's a partial list of what is being used by the United States in the Libya mission , based on Defense Department information , Jane 's defense publications and various analysts : -- The Global Hawk : A high-flying , unmanned aircraft that provides intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance . Its very long endurance allows it to stay in flight longer than any manned and unmanned aircraft . The Global Hawk collects pictures and video of the ground and some versions have the ability of electronic eaves dropping . This allows the aircraft to see the location of Libyan troops and activity at their various military sites . It is also helpful in assessing the success of strikes on targets and bomb damage . -- Joint STARS -LRB- Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System -RRB- : An intelligence and surveillance aircraft with radar capabilities tucked underneath the plane . Different than the Global Hawk , this aircraft is manned . The radar looks sideways at the ground , allowing it to see moving ground targets , such as Libyan tank movements . The Joint STARS ' very sensitive radar system generates its own radio waves , sending them out , and then receiving radar returns , which allows it to create pictures of what is on the ground . Operating with radar waves allows Joint STARS to take pictures at night , without light . -- AWACS -LRB- Airborne Warning and Control System -RRB- : This is a radar aircraft like the Joint STARS , capable of surveillance , but is used for monitoring aircraft such as Libyan planes or helicopters , instead of monitoring ground forces . The radar is a rotating dome on the top of the aircraft . Besides tracking enemy planes , the AWACS also monitors allied aircraft , directing friendly planes to the best location for targeting . -- Maritime Patrol Aircraft , P-3 : An older propeller aircraft mostly used to monitor vessels and submarines at sea but it can also track ground targets . Enforcing the arms embargo on Libya is a main task . The aircraft can track electronic emissions like radio waves , allowing the coalition to listen in on enemy radio transmissions . The P-3 is also capable of identifying the types of communication and radar systems the enemy is using by differentiating between the unique electronic signals being sent out . -- EA-18G Growler : An aircraft used to jam radar and other enemy communications and electronic signals . With pods on its wings and under its fuselage , the Growler identifies what kind of emitters the enemy is using for its radar and communication devices . Then it puts out a much stronger signal on the same line , causing the enemy 's communication devices or radars to not function properly . The Growler focused on disrupting Libya 's air defense radar systems in the beginning of the operation . -- Commando Solo : The aircraft disrupts enemy radio signals , allowing the United States to broadcast its own message on enemy channels . In this operation the U.S. is transmitting messages to Moammar Gadhafi 's forces in both Arabic and in English , telling them to stop fighting and leave their weapons . `` Although we will not discuss specifics , Commando Solo could be used to transmit information to regime military forces to cease hostilities or broadcast humanitarian relief information to the Libyan public , such as where people can get basic food and water supplies , '' the Pentagon says . -- Compass Call : The aircraft disrupts the enemy 's command and control communications with electronic jamming .

He is a professor of public service and director of the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard University 's Kennedy School of Government . For another view , read '' Now the tricky part '' and for Fareed Zakaria 's analysis , read here . Cambridge , Massachusetts -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Now that the `` commentariat '' has had its say about President Barack Obama 's speech Monday night on Libya , chewing over every phrase , the decisive American verdict about his address rests not in television studios but in homes across the country . And so , if I may , let me ask : What did you think ? Do you believe that the president made a compelling case for military intervention by the U.S. and its coalition partners ? Before the speech , a Pew survey found that a bare 47 % thought the president had made the right decision in intervening , compared with 36 % who disagreed . That was the lowest level of support in years for a president sending U.S. troops into harm 's way . After the speech , there was a near-universal view among commentators that the president had indeed made a convincing argument on behalf of intervention . I was among those who believed so . But what about you , the people who count ? Do you believe that the president was clear about his goals and what should come next in Libya ? Before the speech , Pew showed that a strong majority -- 50 % to 39 % -- thought that Obama has not been clear about U.S. goals there . Afterward , the pundits were split on whether he answered the big question of where this goes . I was among those who believe that he left enormous vagueness -LRB- e.g. , the stated mission has been to defend citizens from Moammar Gadhafi 's forces , but with a rebel force now on the offensive , should NATO give assistance ? What do we do if there is a stalemate and Gadhafi clings to power ? What happens , on the other hand , if there is an internal coup and Gadhafi is overthrown ; will the U.S. be heavily engaged in nation building ? -RRB- . I did not think the president clearly answered those questions . But more important than what commentators thought -- what did you think ? Did the president enunciate a new Obama doctrine about the uses of U.S. military power that you find appealing ? As CNN 's Wolf Blitzer said after the speech , we clearly heard Monday night the beginnings of an Obama doctrine -- the clearest enunciation he has provided so far of his views on the use of force . Some thought he was opening the door to the possible use of military force in other Middle Eastern nations that are shooting protesters -LRB- e.g. , Syria , Bahrain , Yemen -RRB- ; I thought just the opposite , that the president was closing the door unless there was horrific violence and a number of other exceptional circumstances . To me , the speech laid out a vision of U.S. leadership that was much more limited , cautious and collaborative than we have had in recent presidents -- certainly a far cry from the muscularity of President John F. Kennedy 's inaugural address that said we would pay any price , meet any burden in the defense of liberty . A half century ago , Americans rallied to JFK 's call , but today , when Americans are weary of war and feeling broke , perhaps people will find his more cautious approach more appealing . How did you interpret his `` doctrine '' and what do you think of it ? Give the president credit : His speech has advanced an important dialogue not only about Libya but about American leadership in the world . What did you think ? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Gergen .

NEW : Armed Services chairman says the mission is to allow the Libyan people to oust Gadhafi NEW : GOP Sen. Lugar says the use of military force should have been debated Gates says the goal is to increase pressure for Gadhafi 's ouster No evidence so far of missile strikes killing civilians , Gates says Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Presidential leadership or kowtowing to allies ? Abuse of power or decisive action in the face of imminent catastrophe ? Supporters and critics used Sunday talk shows to debate President Barack Obama 's Libya policy on Sunday , the day before the president addresses the nation on the issue . The speech Monday night follows calls from all quarters for Obama to clarify the reason he sent U.S. forces to head the U.N.-authorized military mission intended to prevent Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi from unleashing his military on his own people . Obama has said that U.S. policy is the ouster of Gadhafi . However , the mandate of the military coalition is only to enforce a no-fly zone and arms embargo in Libya while taking other necessary steps to protect civilians . Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan , chairman of the Armed Services Committee , explained on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' that the mission 's goal is to give the Libyan people the political freedom to oust Gadhafi . `` We 're part of an international coalition , which has been supported now by U.N. resolution with the support of Arab countries , to prevent the slaughter of civilians in Libya , '' Levin said , adding : `` It 's going to take the people of Libya to remove their dictator with the help of economic sanctions that the world has put in place . '' Meanwhile , two senior Cabinet members -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates -- appeared on three programs in interviews conducted Saturday to also make the case for the Obama policy . Woman alleges Libyan forces raped her NATO 's role in Libya unclear `` There is no perfect option when one is looking at a situation like this , '' Clinton said on the ABC program `` This Week . '' `` I think that the president ordered the best available option . The United States worked with the international community to make sure that there was authorization to do what we have helped to accomplish . '' Both Clinton and Levin emphasized that the international support was essential to avoid any perception or accusation that the United States -- already engaged in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- was unilaterally committing military forces in a third Muslim country . `` The secret to success is a coalition , '' Levin told CNN , advocating an `` international decision where a unilateral decision could have significant downsides . '' Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , who is expected to announce his candidacy soon for the Republican presidential nomination , challenged such an approach , telling `` Fox News Sunday '' he wants Obama 's speech to be `` dramatically clearer than he has been up until now . '' `` I hope the president will say , first of all he is consulting the U.S. Congress , not just the Arab League and United Nations , '' Gingrich said . `` I hope he will say second that it 's clear that the Gadhafi dictatorship has to leave , and that we are prepared to do whatever it takes to make sure the Gadhafi dictatorship leaves . '' Despite his tough rhetoric , Gingrich made clear he opposes sending any U.S. ground troops to Libya -- a position also held by Obama . `` Once you engage air power , you should use the air power in its most effective way , '' Gingrich said . `` You do n't need to send in ground forces . '' Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana , the ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee , criticized a lack of congressional debate before Obama committed military forces to the Libyan mission . `` There should have been a plan as to what our objectives were , a debate , before we committed armed resources , '' Lugar told the NBC program `` Meet the Press , '' later adding : `` I do n't believe we should be engaged in the Libyan civil war . I think the Libyans are going to have to work that out . '' Obama has said the U.S. role in the Libyan mission will diminish once NATO takes over control and command , which could start happening as soon as Monday . However , Gates made clear that even in a diminished role , U.S. forces will still be involved in the mission as long as it continues . `` As long as there is a no-fly zone and we have some unique capabilities to bring to bear -- for example , intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance , some tanking aviation -- we will continue to have a presence , '' he said on ABC . So far , he said , the military mission was proceeding well . `` I would say , for all practical purposes , the implementation of the no-fly zone is complete , '' Gates said . `` Now it will need to be sustained , but it can be sustained with a lot less effort than what it took to set it up . '' Asked if there was a problem between the military mission 's limited goal of civilian protection and Obama 's stated policy objective of ousting Gadhafi , both Gates and Clinton said no. `` You do n't , in a military campaign , set as a mission or a goal something you are not sure you can achieve , '' Gates told the CBS program `` Face the Nation . '' `` And as we 've learned over the past number of years , regime change is very complicated and can be very expensive and can take a long time . So I think the key here was establishing a military mission that was achievable , was achievable in a limited period of time and could be sustained . '' On the same program , Clinton noted how former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic remained in power despite mounting internal and external pressure for his ouster that ended with Milosevic dying while on trial in the international war crimes court . She likened that situation to Gadhafi today . `` It took a while for Milosevic to leave , but you could see his days were numbered even though he was n't yet out of office , '' Clinton said . Gates joked on CBS that he `` would n't be hanging any new pictures '' if he were Gadhafi , then noted that there are several possible scenarios for the Libyan leader 's ouster . `` His military can turn , we could see elements of his military turning , deciding this is a no-win proposition , the families splitting , I mean any number of possibilities are out there , particularly as long as the international pressure continues , and those around him see no future in staying with him , '' Gates said . On the same program , Gates also said that Gadhafi is placing bodies of people his regime has killed at the sites of some missile strikes by the U.S.-led coalition . Gadhafi has claimed that coalition missile attacks have killed civilians , and some NATO members and Arab nations responded with concern that the Libyan military mission might exceed the intent of the U.N. Security Council resolution that authorized it . `` The truth of the matter is we have trouble coming up with proof of any civilian casualties that we have been responsible for , '' Gates told CBS . `` But we do have a lot of intelligence reporting about Gadhafi taking the bodies of the people he 's killed and putting them at the sites where we 've attacked . '' Asked how often it has happened , Gates replied : `` We have a number of reports of that . '' A senior defense official told CNN on Sunday that the U.S. military has information gleaned from intelligence sources that Gadhafi has tasked his aides to search morgues and hospitals for dead bodies to be posed as civilian casualties . NATO ambassadors on Sunday agreed to rules of engagement for coalition forces to follow once the alliance takes over the Libyan mission . A key question is how robust the NATO-led forces will be in attacking Libyan ground forces to protect civilians . That does n't mean using military force to remove Gadhafi from power , Levin insisted on CNN . `` The people of Libya can remove their dictator , but we are not the ones to remove him , '' Levin said . `` We are the ones that is part of an international coalition that are going to prevent him from massacring his own people . '' Others called for a more robust international role . `` I think we do need to consider arming the rebels and let them -- with anti-tank weapons and anti-aircraft weapons -- let them impose their own no-fly zone , '' former National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley said on CNN . `` In the end of the day , how this ends is when the Libyan people can overthrow the tyrant . That 's the narrative we want to establish . '' Lieberman , an independent who caucuses with the Democrats , said on Fox that the United States had chosen a side in Libya by joining the international coalition , `` and it 's the right side . '' `` We ought to be open about it , '' Lieberman said . `` We are taking a side of the freedom fighters in Libya against one of the most totalitarian regimes that has ever existed in the world , which is Gadhafi 's . And in the end of this , Gadhafi has to go , one way or the other .

James Stavridis says there is no evidence of a significant presence of al Qaeda in the Libyan opposition . He sees `` more than reasonable '' chance Gadhafi will leave power Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There is a good chance NATO pressure will encourage Libyan tyrant Moammar Gadhafi to leave power , the U.S. NATO commander told Congress Tuesday , but the opposition that could come in the Libyan leader 's wake has `` flickers '' of al Qaeda . While there is a wide range of possible outcomes in Libya , running from a static stalemate to Gadhafi cracking , there is a `` more than reasonable '' chance of Gadhafi leaving power , Adm. James Stavridis said before the Senate Armed Services Committee , But potential `` flickers '' of al Qaeda and Hezbollah elements have been seen in intelligence regarding the Libyan opposition , which is poised to take power if Gadhafi leaves , Stavridis said . However , he added there is no evidence of a significant presence of al Qaeda or other terrorist groups . Stavridis is also the commander of U.S. European Command . `` The intelligence that I 'm receiving at this point makes me feel that the leadership that I 'm seeing are responsible men and women who are struggling against Col. Gadhafi , '' Stavridis added . The comments come the same day as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with a leader of Libya 's opposition in London . Clinton and the heads of 40 other countries met Tuesday to discuss Libya 's future . A senior counterterrorism official , unnamed because he is not authorized to speak on the record , backed up Stavridis ' assessment , downplaying the concern about al Qaeda among the Libyan opposition . There is probably `` a sprinkling of extremists to perhaps include al Qaeda '' in Libya among the rebels , `` but no one should think the opposition is being led by al Qaeda or one of its affiliates , '' the official said . Al Qaeda has had a presence in North Africa for years . It `` would n't be surprising if small numbers -- a handful '' -- of extremists or al Qaeda are in Libya . `` It 's hard to tell who all the leaders are in the opposition , '' the official said , but `` the rebels do not appear to be adopting an al Qaeda bent or ideology in Libya . '' If Gadhafi 's forces cease fighting there would be a series of decisions on how NATO should proceed . Leading the senators through the NATO command chain , Stavridis said the intelligence and ground assessments would work their way up through NATO , first going through Canadian Gen. Charles Bouchard leading the NATO operation in Libya , then up to Stavridis and eventually going up to the United Nations for the ultimate decision on course of action , Stavridis said . `` I think there would be actually another level that this discussion would have to go to , which would be the United Nations since the authority for NATO to participate in this operation is under the United Nations Security Council resolutions 1970 and 1973 , '' Stavridis pointed out . During this process there would be a pause in NATO activity over Libya . But for now the fight is still very much on . No-fly air zones have been set up to allow air assets to strike Libyan forces if the civilian population is threatened , Stavridis said , going beyond a basic no-fly zone patrol mission . For the first time , A-10 and AC-130 ground attack aircraft were used over the weekend in Libya , Vice Adm. Bill Gortney said at a press briefing on Monday . These aircraft fire machine gun rounds from cannons , up to thousands of rounds a minute , and due to their low-altitude flying ability provide more precision in densely populated areas . On Monday night , one A-10 aircraft attacked Libyan coast guard ships in the port of Misrata after reports were confirmed that the ships were firing at merchant vessels . NATO is set to take control of the full operation in Libya including protecting civilians on Thursday , greatly easing the financial costs on the United States , which has already hit $ 550 million as of Monday , according to Pentagon figures . Of those costs , 60 % were for munitions , the Pentagon said , including Tomahawk missiles , which cost $ 1.4 million each . The United States has launched approximately 200 since the beginning of the operation . `` Future costs are highly uncertain , '' Pentagon spokeswoman Cmdr. Kathleen Kessler said , but the U.S. expects to incur another $ 40 million in costs over the next three weeks . After the transition to NATO control is complete , the Pentagon expects the cost of the U.S. support operation to drop significantly , costing $ 40 million per each subsequent month .

He has not been seen since a February 18 gathering near Benghazi . Amnesty International said in a briefing paper issued Tuesday that Al-Atrash is one of many people who have vanished in what they say is a `` campaign of enforced disappearances '' -- a practice by pro-Moammar Gadhafi forces trying to squelch the opposition movement . The paper -- titled `` Libya : Detainees , Disappeared and Missing '' -- explores more than 30 cases of people who have disappeared since protests started in the war-torn North African nation . Among those missing are political activists and `` those suspected of being rebel fighters or supporters of fighters . '' `` It appears that there is a systematic policy to detain anyone suspected of opposition to Colonel al-Gaddafi 's rule , hold them incommunicado , and transfer them to his strongholds in western Libya , '' said Malcolm Smart , Amnesty International 's director for the Middle East and North Africa . `` Given the circumstances of their enforced disappearance there is every reason to believe that these individuals are at serious risk of torture and ill-treatment . '' Witness : ` Utter carnage ' in Misrata Smart called on Gadhafi to `` halt this outrageous campaign and order his forces to abide by international law . '' Amnesty says the documented cases `` are believed to represent only a small proportion of the total number of people who have been detained or have disappeared '' recently in Gadhafi 's custody . Recent video indicates the extent of the problem . It shows prisoners roughed up and taunted by Gadhafi forces . Some of them say there were demonstrators and others deny it . `` The true number is impossible to establish , as the authorities in Tripoli generally do not divulge information about detainees they are holding and because many areas of the country are not accessible for independent reporting . Some relatives of detainees are also unwilling to publicize their names for fear of possible reprisals , '' Amnesty said . Libyan officials did not immediately respond to efforts to obtain a response to the Amnesty International report . The cases include `` three broad categories , '' the report says : -- Government critics , pro-democracy activists , writers and others detained in the days before the February 17 `` peaceful demonstrations '' across Libya . `` They appear to have been arrested by the authorities as a pre-emptive strike in an effort to nip the protests in the bud following the public protests that had caused the downfall of longstanding repressive governments in Tunisia and Egypt , two of Libya 's neighbors . '' -- Anti-government protestors and youths who went missing on February 20 , when the Kateeba al-Fadheel , a pro-Gadhafi special forces unit , was forced to evacuate from a military compound in Benghazi after violent clashes with protesters . `` Amnesty International has documented the cases of nine men and boys who have not been seen since they went to the Kateeba compound area on evening of 20 February 2011 , including four teenagers under 18 . '' -- People captured in or near Ben Jawad , where there had been `` intermittent fighting . '' `` Amnesty International has obtained information about a number of individuals who went missing in the area between Ajdabiya and Ben Jawad , west of Benghazi . Some are believed to have been fighters , others to be civilians who went to the area in order to assist the wounded , and still others people who may have been onlookers . '' Amnesty said foreign journalists who had been detained and released `` have reported that they were beaten and assaulted and threatened with execution , in some cases even being subjected to mock execution , and have expressed concern about Libyans who they saw being mistreated in detention . '' It said there are fears too that some detainees may be held `` as bargaining chips or to put pressure on their relatives and friends to deter them from joining the opposition . '' The agency said its concerns `` are heightened by the long pattern of gross and widespread human rights violations '' that have marked Gadhafi 's rule . `` These include enforced disappearances , extrajudicial executions , prolonged arbitrary detention , torture and other ill-treatment , as well as severe restrictions on freedom of expression and the rights to freedom of assembly and association . '' Amnesty is urging the government to release peaceful protesters , ensure than any alleged captured fighters be treated humanely and given access to the Red Cross , and grant `` unhindered access '' to humanitarian groups . As for Atef ` Abd al-Qader Al-Atrash , his family fears for his safety . One relative told Amnesty that `` he has simply disappeared , '' and speculates he was taken to areas under the control of pro-Gadhafi forces . `` We kept trying to call his phone but never got through , until some days later when a man who spoke with a western -LRB- western Libyan -RRB- accent answered and said : ` this is what happens to those who throw stones at us ' . But Atef had never even thrown stones , '' the relative said .

Also Tuesday , world diplomats met in London to discuss the future of the North African nation . Opposition fighters in Bin Jawad battled Gadhafi forces and came under a hail of artillery and rocket attacks , a rebel source said . CNN saw rebel fighters streaming back out of the city , beating what looked to be a hasty retreat . One said the barrage was too much for the opposition to withstand , and that Gadhafi loyalists had infiltrated Bin Jawad . Rebel forces regrouped in the nearby city of Ras Lanuf , a key oil town that they said they seized on Sunday . They came under heavy fire on the western edge of that city , said the rebels , who responded in kind , firing back with whatever weapons were available . Tuesday 's fighting marked a reversal of the momentum of the opposition , which until recently had faced relatively little resistance in its westward march . Planning Gadhafi 's exit from Libya Witness : ` Utter carnage ' in Misrata Elsewhere in Libya , three loud explosions were heard in Tripoli . The blasts came within about a 20-minute span and were the first time since the uprising began that such blasts were heard during daylight in the Libyan capitol . On state television , a bulletin attributed to a `` military source '' said that military and civilian locations were bombed in Tripoli `` by the crusader colonial aggression . '' It was not immediately clear where the explosions actually took place . To the east , Libyan forces continued to pound parts of the city of Misrata Tuesday , with tanks firing mortar shells and troops using heavy artillery in an effort to retake control of the city , a witness told CNN . Coalition planes circled overhead but did not strike the tanks , he said . The day after Gadhafi 's regime tried to convince journalists that it was in control of Misrata by taking them on a trip to part of the city -- but not allowing them into the city center -- his troops were killing and wounding civilians and evicting thousands of people from their homes , the witness told CNN . `` The carnage and the destruction and the human suffering from both the evictions and ... terrorizing the city -- it 's beyond imagination , '' said the witness , an opposition councilman in Misrata , in western Libya . `` It 's incredible . '' CNN could not independently verify the witness ' descriptions . Fierce battles on the ground raged in Libya as diplomats from around the world met in London to decide next steps . More than 40 foreign ministers and representatives attended the Tuesday conference , including U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Chairman of the African Union Jean Ping . `` The purpose of this conference is to broaden and deepen the coalition effort , '' said British Foreign Secretary William Hague . `` We all want to see that cease-fire . We all want to see Gadhafi go . Those things are clear . But once we have that cease-fire , we have something to work with . '' Gadhafi has showed no sign of letting up his effort to crush the rebellion , which seeks an end to his nearly 42 years in power . Organizers of the conference said it will look for ways to strengthen the U.N. Security Council resolution approved on March 17 that created a no-fly zone above Libya and mandated the protection of civilians . It will also search for urgent ways to get humanitarian aid to war-torn cities like Misrata . Opposition fighters have credited coalition airstrikes with helping them advance in their rebellion , but say more are needed . The witness in Misrata on Tuesday pleaded for coalition forces to strike Gadhafi 's forces in that city to `` save Misrata from a massacre . '' Off the coast of Misrata , U.S. military planes fired at three Libyan boats , destroying one and damaging the other two , military officials said in a statement Tuesday . The Libyan ships were targeted because of reports that they were firing indiscriminately at merchant vessels in the port of Misrata on Monday , the statement said . Libyan state TV had a banner Tuesday saying , `` Civilian and military locations in Misrata , Tripoli , Zaltin , Mazda and al-Watiyaare being bombed by the crusaders and colonial enemies . '' The central group representing the opposition in Libya and working to plan a new government if Gadhafi were to fall issued a statement Tuesday describing its `` vision of a democratic Libya . '' `` We have learned from the struggles of our past during the dark days of dictatorship that there is no alternative to building a free and democratic society and ensuring the supremacy of international humanitarian law and human rights declarations , '' the statement from the Interim National Council said . The group , representing numerous areas throughout Libya , has been meeting in Benghazi . In the statement , the council vowed to draft a constitution , guarantee key rights to every Libyan citizen , respect freedom of expression and establish `` a state that draws strength from our strong religious beliefs in peace , truth , justice , and equality . '' Much of the statement focused on promises to build a better economy that would eradicate poverty . About a third of Libyans live at or below the national poverty line . The declaration makes no reference to religious freedom . Mahmoud Shammam , a spokesman for the council , said the future government would try members of the Gadhafi regime , not `` hang people in the street . '' `` We are going to establish law and order , '' he said in London . `` We are not going to take revenge on the streets of Tripoli and Benghazi . '' U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with a leader of the council Tuesday at the meeting , part of a U.S. effort to expand ties with rebel leaders fighting to oust Gadhafi . It was the second meeting in less than two weeks between Clinton and the Libyan Interim National Council 's Mahmoud Jabril , a former head of Libya 's economic planning council . Clinton warned that military action against Gadhafi would continue until he `` ceases his attacks on civilians , pulls his troops back from places they have forcibly entered , and allows key services and humanitarian assistance to reach all Libyans . '' President Barack Obama gave interviews to all three major U.S. television networks Tuesday , in which he made it clear he would be open to arming the rebel fighters . `` I 'm not ruling it out , but I 'm also not ruling it in , '' Obama told NBC in one of the separate interviews he gave the day after a nationally televised speech on the Libya situation . `` I think it 's fair to say that if we wanted to get weapons into Libya , we probably could , '' Obama told ABC . `` We 're looking at all our options at this point . '' The United States will also send a liaison to Benghazi to open up a more direct line of communication with members of the opposition , a senior administration official told reporters Tuesday . The official did not say when . The U.S. government has spent about $ 550 million on the Libya effort , the Pentagon said Tuesday , adding that about 60 % of that went for munitions . Another $ 40 million is expected to be spent over the next three weeks . After that , costs are expected to be about $ 40 million per month , said Pentagon spokeswoman Cmdr. Kathleen Kesler .

Such findings are required for the CIA to conduct secret operations , the report said . A U.S. official not authorized to speak publicly could not confirm the finding , but noted when there are crises like this , `` you look at all instruments of national power . '' In early March , a U.S. official told CNN `` the intelligence community is aggressively pursuing information on the ground '' in Libya . British Prime Minister David Cameron told the House of Commons that he has not ruled out arming the Libyan opposition , but added that Britain has not made the decision to do so . U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton provided classified briefings to House and Senate members who asked whether the United States intended to arm the rebels , participants told CNN . Clinton and Gates made clear that no decision had been made , and Congress members from both parties said they believed it would be a bad idea , according to participants . Regarding the committing of U.S. forces to the U.N.-backed operation , the White House has said Obama acted within his authority under the War Powers Act . It notes that the president and other officials consulted congressional leaders several times in the run-up to the March 19 deployment of U.S. forces to the U.N.-authorized Libya mission . Clinton told members of Congress the administration acted within the requirements of the War Powers Act and needed no authorization for further decisions on the mission , lawmakers said . The opposition got a boost Wednesday with news that Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa willingly traveled to London and told the government there that he has resigned , the United Kingdom Foreign Office said . CNN 's Ben Wedeman , who has been reporting from Libya for several weeks , said that Koussa 's departure is a significant blow , but not a critical loss to the regime . World leaders map out future for Libya The players in Odyssey Dawn Ahmed : ` I 'm not afraid of Gadhafi ' Will U.S. arm Libya 's rebels ? The department provided no other details on the surprise move . CNN 's Nic Robertson , who previously met with Koussa , said the former head of intelligence once was a stalwart defender of the government . The Senate 's Rogers called Moussa 's defection `` huge news . '' Libya 's opposition said its fighters are executing a `` tactical withdrawal '' from a swath of territory they once controlled , a move that comes as Gadhafi 's forces relentlessly pound them . Col. Ahmed Bani , speaking at a news conference in the opposition capital of Benghazi on Wednesday , said his forces are being outgunned by the superior military power of loyalists , spared the wrath of coalition airstrikes . They have been pushed eastward over the last two days after CNN reported on Sunday that rebels took Brega , Ras Lanuf and Bin Jawad and reached a town just east of Sirte . Rebel forces have now lost Bin Jawad and the key oil town of Ras Lanuf and are backed up to the Brega area , Bani said . Ajdabiya , which is east of Brega , will be prepared as a `` defense point '' if the withdrawal continues farther east , he said . CNN 's Wedeman said the rebels continue to have no effective command and control . Bani called on the international community to supply opposition fighters with better and more powerful weapons to hold off the Gadhafi forces . He said the opposition was open to foreign troops training rebel fighters . Bani asked for tanks , heavy artillery and communications and logistics equipment . The rebels have been demanding an end to Gadhafi 's almost 42-year rule in Libya , but they have been facing `` sustained attacks in the face of the coalition bombing '' in Misrata , Ras Lanuf , and Bin Jawad , Robertson reported . In an address to the House of Commons in London on Wednesday , British Foreign Secretary William Hague said that `` regime forces have intensified their attacks , driving back opposition forces from ground they had taken in recent days . '' He cited the violence in the western town of Misrata . `` Misrata also came under heavy attack yesterday , with further loss of civilian life , including children , from mortars , sniper fire and attacks on all sides from regime tanks and personnel carriers , '' Hague said . In the outskirts of Ajdabiya -- which was recently taken over by opposition forces -- Gadhafi 's regime planted several dozen land mines , Human Rights Watch said in a statement Wednesday . `` Given the pedestrian and vehicular traffic in the area , the mines were clearly laid while government forces were in Ajdabiya , '' the group said . Human Rights Watch also said 370 people are missing in the eastern part of the country , with some suspected to be in government custody . That list includes rebel fighters and civilians , including doctors , the group said .

British and American leaders are openly considering arming the Libyan rebels The rebels have suffered military setbacks this week The rebels would likely need training to use advanced weaponry An al Qaeda and Hezbollah presence among the rebels is a concern -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- European and American leaders weighed the pros and cons of arming Libya 's rebels Wednesday -- a possibility made more urgent by a series of new military setbacks for forces seeking to topple strongman Moammar Gadhafi . Government forces have been pushing from Bin Jawad to Ras Lanuf , a critical eastern oil town that the opposition seized on Sunday . Gadhafi 's military has also launched escalated strikes in the western town of Misrata . The new offensive was launched in the wake of an international arms embargo and air strike campaign designed to establish a no-fly zone and provide humanitarian relief for civilians threatened by the Libyan military . British Prime Minister David Cameron told the House of Commons Wednesday that the United Nations Security Council mandate `` allows all necessary measures to protect civilians and populated areas -LRB- and -RRB- this would not necessarily rule out provision of assistance to those protecting civilians in certain circumstances . '' `` As I 've said before , we do not rule it out but we have not taken the decision to do so , '' he said . U.S. President Barack Obama said Tuesday he is also open to the possibility of arming rebel fighters . `` I 'm not ruling it out , but I 'm also not ruling it in , '' he told NBC . In a separate interview with ABC , Obama said that `` if we wanted to get weapons into Libya , we probably could . ... We 're looking at all our options at this point . '' One significant problem , however , is the need to train opposition forces on how to use advanced weaponry . `` The notion of the gang that could n't shoot straight might be lived out , '' retired Maj. Gen. James `` Spider '' Marks told CNN Tuesday night . `` There must be some degree of training associated with arming this force , '' said Marks , a former commanding general of the U.S. Army Intelligence Center . `` However , some weapons systems , clearly they can get a handle on and they can use immediately . It 's the more lethal weapon systems that would require training , and I do n't think there 's time to do that . '' Another problem : a possible al Qaeda and Hezbollah presence within Libya 's rebel movement . U.S. intelligence has detected evidence of `` flickers '' of al Qaeda and Hezbollah elements among the rebels , according to Adm. James Stavridis , the U.S. NATO commander . Stavridis stressed Tuesday , however , that such a presence appears to be minimal . `` The intelligence that I 'm receiving at this point makes me feel that the leadership that I 'm seeing are responsible men and women who are struggling against Col. Gadhafi , '' Stavridis told a congressional committee . Stavridis 's comments come the same day that U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with leaders of Libya 's opposition in London . A senior counterterrorism official , unnamed because he is not authorized to speak on the record , backed up Stavridis ' assessment , downplaying the concern about al Qaeda among the Libyan opposition . There is probably `` a sprinkling of extremists to perhaps include al Qaeda '' in Libya among the rebels , `` but no one should think the opposition is being led by al Qaeda or one of its affiliates , '' the official said . Al Qaeda has had a presence in North Africa for years . `` It 's hard to tell who all the leaders are in the opposition , '' the official said , but `` the rebels do not appear to be adopting an al Qaeda bent or ideology in Libya . '' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday that the rebel leaders meeting with Clinton `` made clear what their principles are . '' `` We believe that -LRB- their principles are -RRB- meritorious , '' Carney said .

Not after they watched their daughter manhandled and dragged away from a Tripoli hotel . Eman al-Obeidy 's parents told CNN Tuesday they are no longer afraid to publicly condemn the Libyan strongman , an act that would have been unthinkable just weeks ago . If Gadhafi were to face Ahmed now , she would slap him , she told CNN Tuesday . Al-Obeidy burst into the hotel housing international journalists in Tripoli Saturday and told them she had been raped by 15 militia men . Cameras captured the drama as al-Obeidy , sobbing and screaming , wanted the world to know the brutality of Gadhafi 's regime . Woman alleges rape by Gadhafi forces Marriage for woman allegedly raped The Libyan government said al-Obeidy has been freed and that a criminal case is underway . The men accused of raping al-Obeidy have filed counter-charges for slander , Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said Tuesday . But Ahmed contradicted the government , saying the government was still detaining her daughter , in an interview in the eastern city of Tobruk . She said she wanted Gadhafi to air footage of al-Obeidy as proof of her safety . Ahmed said she can not forgive the grave injustice her daughter has suffered . She said the family has even received phone calls offering bribes to reject their daughter 's claims and to tell their daughter to change her story . But they stand by her . They believe that Gadhafi 's regime is trying to discredit her as a woman who has been raped and -- as some people in conservative Muslim societies believe -- therefore dishonored . An in-absentia engagement ceremony held at a mosque in Tobruk Monday night proves that al-Obeidy 's family and tribe stand by her , Ahmed said . She described her daughter , 29 , as a kind , caring woman who wanted to be a journalist . She chose to study law instead when she realized there was no freedom of the press in her homeland . The government first portrayed al-Obeidy as mentally ill and a prostitute . It has since changed its story , saying she is sane and therefore able to withstand legal proceedings . She also harbored a deep love of languages , particularly Italian and French , Ahmed said . As a young girl , she looked out over the deep blue waters of the Mediterranean and called on the oil tankers to carry her to France . A government spokesman said Sunday that al-Obeidy had been released and was with her family . Moussa Ibrahim said then that al-Obeidy and her family were asked if they wanted to be interviewed by `` one or two , preferably female , reporters to verify that she 's fine , she 's healthy , she 's free with her family . '' He refused to take further questions on the issue , repeatedly stating that Libyan society is `` very conservative . '' A group of lawyers and human rights activists tried to approach al-Obeidy 's sister 's house Monday , but were blocked by security forces . The sister 's mobile phone has apparently been turned off , a source with the opposition in Tripoli told CNN , and no one has seen her since the incident at the hotel . Ahmed said she was also concerned for the safety of her other daughter . Al-Obeidy stormed into the Rixos Hotel as international journalists were having breakfast Saturday morning . Her face was bruised . So were her legs . She showed reporters blood on her right inner thigh . Speaking in English , she said had been held against her will for two days and raped by 15 men . Though her injuries appeared consistent with what she said , CNN could not independently verify al-Obeidy 's story . `` Look at what Gadhafi 's brigades did to me , '' she said . `` My honor was violated by them . '' Al-Obeidy displayed what appeared to be visible rope burns on her wrists and ankles . Government officials tried to stifle her , but she persisted . Security forces moved to subdue her , and even a member of the hotel 's kitchen staff drew a knife . Another staffer tried to throw a dark tablecloth over her head . One government official , who was there to facilitate access for journalists , pulled a pistol from his belt . Others scuffled with reporters and wrestled them to the ground in an attempt to take away their equipment . Some journalists were beaten and kicked . CNN 's camera was confiscated and deliberately smashed beyond repair . As security forces subdued the screaming woman and dragged her away , al-Obeidy warned , `` If you do n't see me tomorrow , then that 's it .

By Paul Cruickshank and Tim Lister , CNN These surface-to-air missile were left at an abandoned Libyan air force base in the dissident-held city ofTobruk in eastern Libya on February 24 . Chad president claims North African affiliate has stolen some SAMs No concrete evidence yet of this But al Qaeda known to have enough funds for weapons black market -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The pilots hardly had time to react . Two streaks of light shot past their plane as it climbed into the skies above Mombasa in Kenya . Fortunately for the hundreds of tourists on board , the two SA-7 surface-to-air missiles -LRB- SAMs -RRB- fired by terrorists from a hillside close to the airport missed their target . Minutes later and thousands of feet below , more than a dozen people were killed in a bomb attack on an Israeli-owned hotel , the second part of a coordinated attack carried out by al Qaeda in November 2002 . It remains the only record of al Qaeda firing SAMs on a passenger jet . But if the president of Chad is right , the terrorist group may just have acquired another batch . President Idriss Deby has told the magazine Jeune Afrique -LRB- Young Africa -RRB- that al Qaeda 's North African affiliate -- Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -LRB- AQIM -RRB- -- has taken advantage of unrest in Libya to seize SAMs from military stockpiles in rebel-held areas . He claimed that the missiles had already been `` exfiltrated '' by the AQIM from Libya and taken to the group 's sanctuaries in the Tnr region of north and northwestern Niger . `` It 's a very serious situation , '' he added . `` AQIM is on the way to becoming a veritable army , the best equipped in the region . '' ` Flickers ' of al-Qaeda in Libya U.S. military switches Libya strategy Anderson : Gadhafi opposition badly armed Deby said he was `` 100 % sure '' of the information , but U.S. military officials have not publicly weighed in on the claim . When asked about the reports during testimony before Congress Tuesday , Adm. James Stavridis , the NATO supreme allied commander in Europe , said he would respond in closed session . There are certainly plenty of SAMs in Libya . Video and photographs have shown rebel fighters posing with shoulder-fired surface to air missiles including SA-7s , the same type fired in Kenya . The SA-7 is a 1960s-era Soviet-made missile , later distributed to insurgents fighting Soviet troops in Afghanistan by the CIA in order to disguise their true origin . But analysts doubt that AQIM has obtained such missiles . Deby offered no concrete evidence -- in public at least -- to back up his claims . He may also have an interest in playing up the al Qaeda threat in his own backyard . Counterterrorism analysts say that Deby did not add to his credibility when he said there was some truth to Moammar Gadhafi 's assertion that al Qaeda was orchestrating the Libyan rebellion , a claim for which no evidence has surfaced . Stavridis said in his testimony that only `` flickers '' of al Qaeda activity had been detected in eastern Libya . Given relatively high rates of Islamist radicalization in eastern Libya in recent years , it is possible that al Qaeda sympathizers in rebel ranks could have transferred weapons to AQIM . But it seems unlikely because the rebels ' overwhelming motivation is to topple the Gadhafi regime . A more plausible scenario sees AQIM buying missiles on the very substantial black market in weapons in Africa . According to Andrew Lebovich , a researcher at the New America Foundation who closely tracks AQIM , the organization 's significant revenues from kidnapping , drug smuggling and human trafficking mean that it has the money to buy SAMs . `` If , and it 's a big if , AQIM really did get hold of surface to air missiles and transport them all the way down to Niger , their main rationale would likely be to use them to defend against helicopter raids on their camps by French and other special forces teams in the area . '' AQIM appears to have already acquired some anti-aircraft weapons . Geoff Porter , an expert on AQIM , wrote in the February edition of CTC Sentinel , published by West Point 's Combating Terrorism Center , that AQIM has used its rising revenues to purchase DSHK -LRB- Dushka -RRB- .50 caliber anti-aircraft machine guns on the black market , possibly from West Africa . AQIM has been traditionally weak in Libya , according to Noman Benotman , a former Libyan jihadist who is now a senior researcher at the Quilliam Foundation , a UK-based counterterrorism think tank . The group 's leadership is mainly Algerian , and its foot soldiers are being increasingly drawn from the Sahel region of Mali , Niger and Mauritania . But there are signs that its horizons are broadening . According to a recent briefing paper on Libya co-authored by Benotman , up to 40 Libyans have joined the group in the last two or three years . And in 2009 , Saif al Islam Gadhafi , one of the Libyan leader 's sons , told CNN 's Nic Robertson that several Libyans had joined AQIM 's ranks in Algeria and Mali . According to Benotman , AQIM decided to start infiltrating Libya after the fall of the Tunisian regime in January , after years of avoiding the country because of Gadhafi 's intimidating security apparatus . He wrote that `` in early January 2011 , two Libyan AQIM members left their bases in northern Mali and traveled via southern Algeria into Libya . Arriving in Ghat , a remote desert city in Libya 's extreme south-west on 15 January , they were involved in a shootout with Libyan security forces , killing one policeman , before being killed themselves . This is AQIM 's first known armed operation in Libya . '' CNN has not been able to independently verify the incident . Last week Sheikh Abu Musab Wadud , the head of AQIM , reacted to Western airstrikes by issuing a video statement denouncing the intervention as a `` modern crusade '' and promising to work to remove it . The SA-7 may not be state of the art , but it has proven crudely effective over the years . SA-7s were among the weapons deployed by Iraqi insurgents to bring down several U.S. military helicopters in Iraq . While most military aircraft are equipped with counter-measures , civilian planes generally are not . Western counterterrorism officials say they are concerned about the flood of weapons from Libyan garrisons now in circulation and the difficulty of tracking them . Most are not as dangerous as SAMs , but some just may be .

From the Barbary wars -LRB- fought against the Barbary States , which included parts of modern Libya -RRB- to gunboat diplomacy in Asia to the many military interventions over the past few decades -LRB- Grenada , Lebanon , Somalia , the no-fly zone over Iraq , Bosnia , Kosovo -RRB- , the United States has often tried to find ways to use its military yet not engage in all-out war . Some were more successful than others , but in all cases , the central task was to find the balance between the goals we sought and the means we were willing to deploy . The time we didn t ask questions about the costs and simply escalated the means , we ended up in Vietnam . The tendency for a president is to be pushed to achieve a decisive victory , no matter the costs , no matter whether the interests at stake are vital or secondary . Presidents want to be leaders of great causes , and the Libyan mission is certainly a good cause . But the more grandiose the rhetoric and the goals , the broader the military mission . And then the United States takes responsibility for the fate of Libya a country riven with tribes , lacking strong institutions and a civil society , and destroyed by four decades of Gaddafi s madness . Do we really want to own this , and largely alone ? Is it such a bad idea that others should be involved ? Washington is now hoping that a bit more military power will dislodge Gaddafi s regime . My fingers are crossed . But it would be far more sensible , while hoping for the best , to plan for other likely outcomes ... As I argue in the op-ed , limited interventions might have limited successes , but they can also avoid catastrophic failures . President Obama 's reasons for employing U.S. military force in Libya are idealistic at best , if not hopelessly romantic at worst . Unfortunately , idealism is not what drives , much less influences significantly , the clashes and movements in relations between and among nation states . Foreign policy veterans , and most military leaders know that intuitively , if not explicitly . Woodrow Wilson s League of Nations idea following The Great War is a good example of what happens when the ideal conflicts with the real . As Americans , we harbor very idealistic notions about wars of rebellion . It is part of our own History , mythology , and legends . History is grittier than what we wish , and harder than what we would like to remember . All civil wars and rebellions are ugly . Something President Obama and the rest of us will learn in due course in Libya . March 31 , 2011 at 11:35 am | Reply Arabian Spring ? President Obama is obviously a man of conscious and the fact that he has refused to sit on his hands in the face of the happenings across Northern Africa and surly now events building in the Middle East demands that the U.S. needs to forge new policy . The U.S still being a super power with responsibilities that come with the title , is obligated to lead not only in forming needed new international policies for America but also by example set the bar for all nations of the world to follow . Because of our fundamental democratic believes , believes in freedoms , the rule of law , equality , and most importantly truth ; our policy makers now find themselves in a vary difficult position . These countries around the globe with their populous demanding change and hopefully desiring to move towards a system similar to our own ; are now forcing us to evaluate our own policies in dealing with dictators that all the nations of the world have had relationships with for decades . Its time for the U.S. to begin the process of coming clean or the face the consequences ; that we can no longer continue this business as usual practices with murderous dictators . If America and the nations of the civilized world continue trade relations with such dictators we not only promoting but also empower the vary behavior that we deplore . The closest thing we have to a globe committee is the United Nations and honestly we all known the dysfunctional qualities of committee rule . Getting things done under such constraints are merely impossible , thus the other strong reason why America and currently the Obama administration needs to and has to take on these issues as impossible as they may seem . The U.N. mandate 1973 is surly only the beginning of a conversation that all the nations of the world need to begin . That if the nations of the world are going to come together in consistent policies that effect the populous of the world now is the time . If our policy makers don t lead the way ; we are no better than an individual who buys stolen goods , from a murder . March 31 , 2011 at 2:31 pm | Reply Does the U.S. want to own Libya ? Of course it does !!! Only a person whose IQ is less than 10 would believe otherwise !!! What a ridiculous question ! March 31 , 2011 at 4:41 pm | Reply This question seems to confirm the views of the Libyan people lately , that the U.S. is after their oil . Otherwise the Americans ca n't be bothered to engage themselves in this millitary foray . No , the U.S. does n't necessarily want to own Libya , but it wants to show the world , who has more to say . March 31 , 2011 at 6:29 pm | Reply Of course the U.S. wants to own Libya as anybody with half a brain would surmise . Why do you think that Obama 's setting up a `` no-fly '' zone and now arming the `` rebels '' for ? After all , Libya is an oil rich country like Iraq and we invaded Iraq and now own it for that very same reason . March 31 , 2011 at 7:36 pm | Reply ahhh , thats all i needed to know to understand the US involvement ... i was wondering why the US even cared but now it all makes sense once again May 7 , 2012 at 7:09 am | This is a three layered chess game for the removal of a dictator . If I may explain the first layer of the game is a least cost intervention meaning no blood and very modest treasure used . Second layer is the CIA they will goose things along to the conclusion and the objective we need . Third layer offer buisness and jobs for all of those 20 year olds that just want the freedom to get jobs that pay well . This is known as a piece of the action . Remember if our emotions control our moves we will loose . Everybody thought Regan was nuts two but it worked . There was no real operational star wars program . I am going with the President on this one he is precise when he wants to get something done . April 1 , 2011 at 1:41 am | Reply I feel it serves the U.S. well in keeping some portion of the globe destabilized , but in the end , this game is going on since far too long for anybody 's comfort , American Middle East policies have indirectly contributed to the economic down slide of that nation . it would be in everybody 's interest that America stops playing the global cop , else it might find itself pitted against the whole world in manner of the Nazis during the penultimate stages of the WW II . April 1 , 2011 at 2:12 am | Reply US only wants to liberate Libya with democracy , as it always has . Saying this in case Americans have forgotten their heritage ... April 2 , 2011 at 1:28 am | Reply It grieves me to see mindless cynicism and downright non-comprehension in the comments here . The question is not whether we want to `` own '' Libya , but whether we want to `` take ownership '' as the current business jargon goes of the whole Libyan situation . I think the administration has answered that with a resounding `` no '' . Afghanistan and Iraq show what happens when we involve ourselves in primitive countries with tribal loyalties and no history of democratic institutions . When you remove a dictator in a country of this nature , all you do is create a power vacuum . If you leave , you will just leave it to some warlord to take over again . If you stay and try to do `` country building '' with military means -LRB- and the military are the wrong ones to do this in any case -RRB- you just unite the people against you as the foreign occupier . No fly zone to prevent a Rwanda style massacre of innocent civilians ? Ok , but let the other Arab states do that . No , we do n't want to `` own '' the Libya mess . That 's for the Libyans to figure out .

Russian diplomatic officials , meanwhile , warned against a `` creative '' interpretation of the U.N. resolution and hinted it was beginning to regret its decision to abstain during the U.N. vote . Russia , as one of the Security Council 's permanent members , has veto power . But NATO officials insist they are employing the strictest interpretation of the resolution . `` The alliance has nothing to hide -- not to Russia and not to you , '' Adm. Giampaolo Di Paola , chairman of NATO 's Military Committee , told a press briefing at NATO headquarters .

CIA operatives are inside Libya , sources tell CNN There is a debate over whether the U.S. should arm rebel forces Key issue : Can they be trained in time to use the weapons ? Also , would the armed rebels then support NATO 's mission ? Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States has seen what happens when it arms rebel forces against brutal regimes -- and how it can backfire . Libya could end up in that same category . Here are some frequently asked questions on the situation in Libya , what the options are and the debate over arming the rebels . The North Atlantic Treaty Organization , of which the United States is a member , is working to take down Col. Moammar Gadhafi 's brutal regime , which has reportedly killed thousands of Libyans since a revolt broke out over the past month . Adm. Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said Thursday that Gadhafi still wants to take back the city of Benghazi , the rebel stronghold , and that the dictator `` will kill as many -LRB- people -RRB- as he must to crush the rebellion . '' France was the first nation to step in to enforce the no-fly zone directive . French fighter jets struck military targets in eastern Libya on March 19 . Britain also stepped into the conflict by providing logistical support . Shortly after , U.S. fighter jets used air strikes to take out targets while warships launched missiles into the northern African nation . The United States has since handed over the brunt of the mission to NATO , but it is still the major force behind the effort . But administration officials , including Defense Secretary Robert Gates , insist that `` there will be no boots on the ground , '' or sending in U.S. troops to support the rebels . By taking down Gadhafi , the country stands a chance at developing a democracy . In essence , Gadhafi needs to go and prevent a humanitarian and refugee crisis that could help destabilize the entire region . It 's a point that has been made clear from President Barack Obama , his administration and leaders around the world . Who are the opposition and what do they want ? Simply put , Libyans who are outraged at the atrocities that the Gadhafi regime has inflicted on its people including massive human rights violations . But if the rebels are successful , there are concerns that such a fractured group could form an actual government -- or work with the U.S. And perhaps that is why Central Intelligence Agency operatives are inside Libya , a U.S. intelligence source said , to get firsthand knowledge of who the coalition is working with . Will U.S. arm Libya 's rebels ? Rumsfeld speaks out on mission in Libya Gates : Obama followed War Powers Act Why it 's a bad idea Training Libyan rebels against Gadhafi 's forces comes down to education . Can the rogue group learn to use sophisticated machinery and the tactics to employ it in time -- and with a clear directive ? `` This is a nightmare trying to train the Libyans . I tried to do it many years ago , said Robert Baer , a former CIA operative . `` These people are very difficult to manage . '' Baer added that the type of discipline needed `` takes a very , very long time , especially when you 're dealing with a foreign force and you have to have Arabic speakers on the ground . It 's tough . '' So is it practical to arm the rebels fast enough ? `` Well , the notion of the gang that could n't shoot straight might be lived out , '' Retired Army Brigadier Gen. James Marks said . `` Absolutely , there must be some degree of training that is associated with arming this force . However , some weapons systems clearly they can get a handle on and they can use immediately . '' `` We simply do n't have control over the rebels . They do n't have to follow our orders , '' Baer said . `` They take our money and weapons and go shoot who they want . '' Why it 's a good idea Paul Wolfowitz , a deputy secretary of defense under former President George W. Bush , said it 's vital the U.S. supports arming the rebels . `` I think we should be doing everything we can to support the opposition , '' he said . `` It 's true , we do n't know what the opposition would be like when they take over , but there are actually some promising signs . '' Another Bush official said that arming rebels is vital to the overall mission . `` Somebody has got to be on the ground doing the hard work of taking the territory , '' said former National Security adviser Stephen Hadley . `` And if it 's not going to be U.S. troops -- and nobody really wants that -- then we 're going to have to deal with the Libyan people and try to empower them to fight and win their own freedom . And giving them weapons has to be part of that . '' Will history come back to haunt us ? The Soviet Union fought a brutal war in Afghanistan in the 1980s . The U.S. , strictly opposed to the move by the `` evil empire , '' as former President Ronald Reagan called it , tried to tilt the balance by arming the Afghan mujahadeen against the Soviets . Though in the short term it helped the mujahadeen drive the Soviets out , some of those same weapons were used years later against the U.S. during the war in Afghanistan -- the longest war in the country 's history . Rep. Mike Rogers , R-Michigan , said in a statement that he has deep concerns over such past efforts . `` We do n't have to look very far back in history to find examples of the unintended consequences of passing out advanced weapons to a group of fighters we did n't know as well as we should have , '' said Rogers , , who is chairman of of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence . `` We need to be very careful before rushing into a decision that could come back to haunt us . '' But former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said that sometimes arming opposition forces can work . `` We did a good job in Afghanistan -LRB- arming -RRB- the Northern Alliance and some of their militias in the south and they were very successful in driving al Qaeda out of Afghanistan and of changing the regime from the Taliban to the Afghan government , '' Rumsfield said . According to Adm. James Stavrides , the U.S. NATO commander , U.S. intelligence has detected evidence of `` flickers '' of al Qaeda and Hezbollah elements among the rebels -- though the influence appears to be minimal . Senior officials and White House Press Secretary Jay Carney seemed to downplay that notion , saying that the values being expressed by the rebels are `` antithetical to the purposes and ideals set forth by terrorist organizations . '' Rumsfeld , one of the key figure in taking the U.S. to war in Iraq , said there are concerns about terrorist groups such as al Qaeda and Hezbollah influencing the rebels . He said that there are still a great deal of questions as to who is involved in the rebel group and therefore `` you have to be careful about arming rebels . '' Rep. Dan Burton , R-Indiana , asked Thursday : `` How many of these citizen-soldiers fighting against Gadhafi -- how many are people who are tied into terrorist organizations in Iraq and Afghanistan and do we know who they are ? Do we have any idea ? '' He added that it 's `` a heck of a situation when we go into a conflict and we do n't know who we are supporting . '' What 's it going to cost ? While NATO has taken over the military operations in Libya , the U.S. still has committed itself to support , which could result in billions of dollars in aid going forward . Meanwhile in Washington , the battle in Congress is over cutting spending , reducing the deficit and passing a 2011 budget . There is no doubt that critics on both sides of the aisle will grill administration officials on why the U.S. should add money the country does n't have -- and whether the operation could stretch the already overstretched U.S. military .

CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : It is Friday , April 1st -- no foolin ' -- and you 're watching CNN Student News ! I 'm Carl Azuz . First up today , we 're heading to the North African nation of Libya . AZUZ : But a top ranking official from that country is heading out ! Libya 's foreign minister turned up in London yesterday . His name is Moussa Koussa , and he told the government in London that he had resigned his position in Libya . Koussa is someone who , just a month ago , was defending the Libyan government . British officials say Koussa 's resignation is a serious problem for Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and his authority in Libya . U.S. military commanders have said that Libya is not a `` boots on the ground '' operation , meaning they are n't planning to send ground troops into the country . We 've heard President Obama say that , too . But the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency -- the CIA -- is on the ground in Libya . A source told CNN that operatives from the agency are gathering intelligence and sometimes connecting with rebel fighters . NATO -- the North Atlantic Treaty Organization -- has taken command of the coalition military operation in Libya . Now , when we say that NATO has taken command , so what ? What does that mean ? Well , NATO is an organization that 's made up of 28 countries from North America and Europe . The United States is a key member . So are the United Kingdom , France , Germany . NATO does n't have its own unique troops . NATO forces are made up of troops from those member countries . So U.S. forces , British forces , French forces : They 're still very much a part of this operation in Libya . AZUZ : In Japan , officials are worried about the levels of radiation in the ocean water near the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant . Officials say those levels are skyrocketing , and there 's no clear idea of what 's causing the spike or how to stop it . Samples taken on Wednesday show that the levels of one radioactive isotope in the water are more than 4,000 times higher than the limit that 's approved by regulators . But one official said the seawater radiation does n't pose a risk to people eating seafood , at least , not yet . MEGAN CLOHERTY , CNN CORRESPONDENT : In response to rising gas prices , President Obama outlined a plan to expand offshore oil and natural gas drilling to provide short-term relief and other steps that would allow the nation to transition to cleaner and cheaper sources of energy . U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : We consume about 25 percent of the world 's oil . We only have two percent of the reserves . CLOHERTY : Obama said the demands of global oil consumption and the instability in the oil market leave America with no other choice but to act now to establish its energy independence . OBAMA : We 've got to discover and produce cleaner renewable sources of energy that also produce less carbon pollution , which is threatening our climate . And we 've got to do it quickly . CLOHERTY : The president said that despite fears raised by the nuclear plant emergency in Japan , he is not abandoning nuclear power as an alternative to oil . While Obama 's plan to increase offshore drilling may upset the environmental lobby , his energy secretary emphasized the drilling is a short-term fix . U.S. SECRETARY OF ENERGY STEVEN CHU : Ultimately , what this is about is diversifying our supply of energy . CLOHERTY : Republican leaders charged the president 's program wo n't do much to make things better for Americans anytime soon . SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL , -LRB- R -RRB- MINORITY LEADER : The president 's target is decades from now , but Americans should be able to expect action now . CLOHERTY : While the president 's efforts to reduce oil prices bring motorists relief at the gas pump , the administration plans to raise fuel efficiency standards for car makers this fall , which could result in an increase in sticker prices . Megan Cloherty , for CNN , Washington . TOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : What 's the word for when something on the internet spreads very quickly ? AZUZ : The video about bullying that 13-year-old Alye Pollack posted on YouTube went viral . Within two weeks , nearly 50,000 people had seen it . Alye sat in front of the camera and held up pieces of paper introducing herself and sharing some of the names bullies have called her . There 's been a lot of talk recently about the internet giving bullies more ways to pick on people . Alye turned the tables , going online to speak out against it . And she says her video is making an impact . ALYE POLLACK , MADE ANTI-BULLYING VIDEO : I 've had a lot of people come up to me and say , `` Now I know not to say bad things . I think before I do say something . '' And that 's just amazing , because people are actually being affected by my video . EUNICE YOON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT , HONG KONG : It 's 4:00 in the afternoon , rush hour . Most people in China are starting to go home from work . But for the people of Qingyanliu village , their day has just started . This tiny village near the manufacturing hub of Ewu sets its clock by the online habits of China 's shoppers . Until five years ago , this place was a rural backwater . Now , its 10,000 residents generate $ 120 million in sales thanks to a popular e-retailing site called Taobao . E-commerce chief Liu Wengao says the village has grown five-fold , and is now a base for entrepreneurs looking to make it rich off online stores . LIU WENGAO , LOCAL E-COMMERCE CHIEF -LRB- TRANSLATED -RRB- : `` There are hundreds of millions of people in China and tens of millions on the internet , '' he says . `` We will never run out of customers . '' YOON : When China 's shoppers place their orders on Taobao , Chin Yao Moon 's merchants fill them at shops like this . Liu Jin has inventory of his own . But if he does n't have what his customers want , someone else in this town will . LIU JIN , ONLINE MERCHANT -LRB- TRANSLATED -RRB- : `` We are over here picking up what we need to fulfill their order , '' Liu explains . YOON : Once his basket is full , he is off to start packing the evening shipments . The entire village is alive with vendors like Liu . Express trucks come and go seemingly nonstop into the wee hours . Thousands of parcels are stacked daily , emerging from underground warehouses . These basements have a mind-boggling array of goods , everything from the practical to the strange . The government keeps rents in these buildings low , so people like Lin Saila can get started investing only in a room and a computer . Today , she received over 3,000 orders . LIN SAILA , STORE MANAGER -LRB- TRANSLATED -RRB- : `` Every year , there 's a lot of growth , '' she says . `` Each year is better than the last . '' YOON : Nearly all of this stuff is made right here in Ewu , so it 's convenient and it 's cheap to get . So , what vendors do is that they take orders online , and then they package everything up and ship it right across the country . Liu has been to Beijing and Shanghai , but now this farmer 's son can stay closer to home . LIU -LRB- TRANSLATED -RRB- : `` I make money , '' he says . `` It gives me more freedom . '' YOON : The express truck is about to leave . Liu hustles to make sure his customers get what they want on time . LIU -LRB- TRANSLATED -RRB- : `` Every day is this hectic , '' he says . `` We 'll be back at it tomorrow in the town the Internet built . '' YOON : Eunice Yoon , CNN , Qingyanliu , China . AZUZ : Weird is how a lot of you describe yesterday 's `` TVs watching you '' story , when information about what people watch is shared with advertisers . Sam does n't see a problem with it , writing `` it 's important for advertisers to locate a demographic to help them with their research . '' Sadam can see how it would be better if ads were more relevant , but feels this is a major invasion of privacy . `` Random companies seeing what we watch on TV is not their business ; it 's ours . '' Levi states `` it 's not like they are watching you get dressed or anything ; they 're just trying to do business . I think they have every right to . '' From Brenna : `` It allows you to watch ads for things you 're interested in , instead of things you do n't even care about . '' But Natalie writes `` the idea is n't foolproof in any way . If it 's some sort of setting that can be turned off , though , it could help us greatly . '' And Kaylee , who says our privacy is being violated , adds it should either stop , or the companies could ask customers if they 're comfortable being monitored . Great comments , y ' all ! AZUZ : Some guys need to work up a lot of nerve to ask someone to prom . Jason here did n't seem to have that problem . He wrote a song , roped his buddies into being a back-up band , got the whole class in on the idea . And all for one simple question . Sure , he put her on the spot , but you know she said yes . We 're just glad someone was recording the whole thing and posted it on YouTube . AZUZ : That way we can prom-ote Jason 's impressive proposal . You might think a video like that would prom-pt us to make some jokes . But we prom-ise not to . We do promise that we 'll be back on Monday . Hope you have a great weekend .

Gerges , Special to CNN Almost two weeks of intense bombings and the enforcement of a no-fly zone in Libya by Western-led forces have neither broken the will of Col. Moammar Gadhafi nor subdued his followers . Instead , the past couple of weeks have proved that Libya is much more divided than the world had feared . The major challenge facing the opposition now will be in reaching out to tribal supporters of Gadhafi -- and skeptics and bystanders -- to allay their fears . This kind of reconciliation will be the only means to avert a protracted , costly civil war that could allow Gadhafi to regain some degree of control . The coalition 's airstrikes have indeed severely degraded Gadhafi 's military infrastructure and paved the way for the rebels to recapture , at least for a time , a number of coastal communities and important oil installations , including Ras Lanuf , Brega and Bin Jawad . But loyalist forces pushed them out in recent days -LRB- Ajdabiya and Uqayla still appear to be in rebel hands at the moment -RRB- . According to Pentagon spokesman Vice Adm. Bill Gortney , any military gains made by the rebels will be tenuous because of their lack of organizational structure . Two high-level Libyan officials , Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa and Ali Abdussalam el-Treki , did defect this week . Despite this , Gadhafi 's entourage is fiercely defending the cities and towns recaptured from the rebels . That they continue to persevere in the face of international force should not come as a surprise , given the tribal structure of Libyan society and Gadhafi 's manipulation and co-opting of tribal divisions and allies . What is even more alarming is that Gadhafi 's forces have managed to insert themselves into urban areas across Libya . To defeat these loyalists will necessitate boots on the ground fighting a long , bloody , guerrilla-style war . Civilians would undoubtedly become targets . Even if the Western-led coalition arms and trains the rebels and dislodges Gadhafi from power , the morning after will likely be messy , costly and even less certain . Libya appears to be sliding into a prolonged conflict with no light at the end of the tunnel .

'' Coined by author Chalmers Johnson , it is now often referred to specifically as the unintended consequence of the U.S. decision to arm the non-Afghan Arab fighters -- or ` mujahideen ' -- in their fight against the Soviets . Little did the CIA know that the very same fighters would one day form the backbone of al Qaeda . Yet in contrast to `` Charlie Wilson 's War '' in Afghanistan , and indeed other CIA missions throughout the Cold War -- particularly in Latin America -- the current decision is being debated in the open . On whether or not to arm the rebels , President Obama announced : `` I 'm not ruling it out but I 'm also not ruling it in . '' Why such a cautious tone ? Primarily , arming a rebel force carries with it a clear moral predicament in facilitating the act of killing . This is something to be carefully debated by all of the Libya coalition partners . Furthermore , since the start of the Cold War , the U.S. has garnered quite a tarnished reputation for propping up unsavory dictators on the one hand , and giving arms and materiel to opposition groups , on the other . Notwithstanding , since the start of the intervention , the U.S. and its allies have had to seriously consider the option of arming the Libyan opposition , in the event that the conflict becomes a stalemate between a loosely-organized rebel group and Gadhafi 's well-equipped loyalist forces . But the resounding questions are : Who are the rebels , and do they represent a coherent democratic alternative to Gadhafi 's regime ? Or , will arming the opposition fuel a tribal conflict ? A case could be made that Gadhafi 's autocratic rule is comparable to that of Marshal Tito in the Balkans : Only a dictator could hold different tribes or nationalities in place in one political entity . When Gadhafi came to power by military force in 1969 , he united three separate territories , divided by the former king Idriss I -- hence , the argument goes , a representative democracy could n't hold them together again . However , there are reports of a considerable population of the Warfalla and Tarhuna tribes -- those loyal to the Gadhafi regime -- residing in the east of the country , as well as many Benghazis living in the west . If they form some sort of united front against Gadhafi and in the name of democracy -- spearheaded by the rebels -- there may be hope for change . Yet how quickly could a new government become stabilized -- especially in a region rocked by Islamist revolt ? How long might that government stay in power ? With hindsight , what national interest might justify supplying arms to rebels in a volatile and unstable region ? The longer an armed conflict continues , the longer the country can be used as a launch-pad for opportunists seeking to wield non-state power , and accordingly , the more time afforded for such groups to raid arms depots or caches potentially provided by the West . After all , the Kalashnikovs and M-16s used during the Soviet war in Afghanistan have remained serviceable for decades -- and are even employed against ISAF forces today . Looking back to CIA 's support of the mujahideen , `` Charlie Wilson 's War '' was somehow justified by the national interest of containing the Soviets -- by ensuring their military defeat in south Asia , we might have hastened their ideological defeat in Europe . Yet with hindsight , what national interest might justify supplying arms to rebels in a volatile and unstable region , populated by spin-off groups from the al Qaeda franchise , ready to capitalize on a potential civil war ? In what way can this befit any national security interest of a coalition partner ? Therefore , even more than the moral dilemma of giving arms to groups , the option at hand may pose a greater strategic dilemma , with unintended consequences for decades to come . These questions merit serious consideration in the coming days -- before any option is `` ruled in . '' The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alexis Crow .

The man on the plane was Moussa Koussa , Libya 's foreign minister and former intelligence chief , and he was defecting from the regime of Moammar Gadhafi , the highest-ranking official yet to do so . Koussa was a stalwart defender of the government as recently as a month ago . But in recent weeks , his demeanor has visibly changed . At one recent media briefing , he kept his head down as he read a statement and left early . He did not tell the Libyan government he was planning to quit before he arrived in Britain , Libyan government spokesman Mousa Ibrahim said Thursday . Hoekstra : What may be next in Libya Libyan opposition speaks out on tactics Anderson : Gadhafi opposition badly armed But Ibrahim downplayed the defection itself , saying Moussa was an old man in poor health who had not been able to handle the pressure of his job . `` We gave him permission to leave , '' Ibrahim said , less than 24 hours after Libyan government denials that Koussa had defected , and insisted he was coming back . The British Foreign Office announced late Wednesday that Koussa had resigned and come willingly to the United Kingdom . There 's debate about whether his departure from Tripoli will weaken Gadhafi , with some saying it will be a signal to other doubters around Libya 's leader that it 's time to jump ship . `` It could potentially have a devastating impact on morale within the Gadhafi regime , '' said Noman Benotman , a former Libyan militant now with the Quilliam Foundation , a counter-extremism think tank . `` Strategically , this move attacks the center of gravity within the regime , '' Benotman said . `` I hope other senior figures within the regime now realize that they too need to be part of the solution and not remain part of the problem . '' But others say that Koussa was never in Gadhafi 's innermost circle and that his departure is a significant blow but not a critical loss to the regime . Whether his defection precipitates further crumbling of the government in Tripoli or not , Koussa may be able to shed light on Libya 's exact role in events like the Lockerbie bombing in 1988 and the killing of a British policewoman in 1984 . `` Let 's remember , Moussa Koussa is the single most important Libyan official who was responsible for the intelligence service , the planning and execution of -LRB- the bombing of -RRB- Pan Am 103 , '' CNN national security contributor Frances Fragos Townsend said . He was also a key player in Libya 's decision to give up its weapons of mass destruction program , said Townsend , who was a homeland security adviser in the George W. Bush administration . `` He was the single individual who had to approve or disapprove my going forward to meet with Gadhafi . And so he really does have secrets to tell , '' she said , adding that Libya 's leader confided in Moussa and relied on him . British intelligence will be questioning him and passing information to Americans , she anticipated . And she 's certain he arranged everything carefully before he boarded the plane for Britain . `` His finances , his immunity from prosecution and his freedom from extradition process -- he would have worked that all before he left , '' she said . British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Wednesday that Koussa had not been offered any immunity . On Thursday , Hague reiterated calls for senior members of the Gadhafi government to step down . Koussa 's defection provides evidence `` that Gadhafi 's regime ... is fragmented , under pressure and crumbling from within , '' he said . Koussa is voluntarily speaking with officials in the UK , he said . The International Criminal Court , which has opened an unprecedented investigation into possible crimes against humanity during the ongoing Libya civil war , said Thursday that Koussa is not a suspect . `` We have no individuals under investigation , and we will see where the evidence leads us , '' ICC prosecution spokeswoman Florence Olara said . She said she did not know whether Koussa had been in touch with prosecutors seeking immunity or offering testimony . But Scottish prosecutors want to question him about the Lockerbie bombing , the government there said Thursday . Scottish officials said they have informed the Foreign Office in London that they want to speak to him . `` The investigation into the Lockerbie bombing remains open and we will pursue all relevant lines of inquiry , '' the government said in a statement . The only person convicted in connection with the bombing , Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi , was freed from prison in Scotland in 2009 and sent home to Libya on the grounds that he had terminal cancer . CNN 's Nic Robertson , Anderson Cooper , Ben Wedeman , Richard Allen Greene and Carol Jordan contributed to this report .

Bakshi , CNN Chris Strohm over at the National Journal lays out five reasons to arm Libya s rebels , and another five reasons not to . Five reasons for arming the rebels include : -LRB- 1 -RRB- it may level the playing field ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the UN Resolution authorizes all necessary measures ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- it may stymie al-Qaeda ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- regional stability is at stake ; and -LRB- 5 -RRB- other countries can provide the arms . Five reasons against arming the rebels include : -LRB- 1 -RRB- we don t know who they are ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- it may not be needed ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- it may not be legal ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- it may stir up a hornet s nest ; and -LRB- 5 -RRB- it may cost too much . Below I ve highlighted a few takes from people on both sides of the debate , and their reasons . Fareed argues that arming the opposition is a low-cost policy with a high rate of success , necessary for leveling the playing field against Gadhafi . Over the past five decades , the U.S. has had very mixed results when it has intervened , by air or land , in other people 's wars . But it has done pretty well when it has helped one side of the struggle . Arming rebels in Afghanistan , Central America and Africa has proved to be a relatively low-cost policy with high rates of success . Giving arms , food , logistical help , intelligence and other such tools to the Libyan opposition would boost its strength and give it staying power . Once Gadhafi realizes that he is up against an endless supply of arms and ammunition , he will surely recalibrate his decisions . Fareed further argues that a genuine rebel army could pressure Gadhafi toward some kind of exit : Now that we have tied ourselves to their -LRB- the Libyan rebels -RRB- fate , we certainly need to help them more substantially . The arms embargo , which applies equally to Gadhafi and the opposition , will have to be circumvented . A genuine rebel army would put further pressure on Gadhafi , who would know that he faced death at its hands , and would push him toward some kind of exit . Max Boot adopts a more aggressive stance , saying the U.S. end goal ought to be removing Gadhafi from power , and arming the rebels is a vital step in that direction . Given that we already have Western agents on the ground helping them -LRB- the rebels -RRB- , and that Western aircraft are actively bombing Gadhafi s forces to bring about his defeat , it seems disingenuous to claim we are not involved in regime change . The only question now is whether that regime change will be swift or protracted . I believe it is in our interest to do everything possible to bring about Gadhafi s downfall as rapidly as possible and then to help Libya stabilize itself in the aftermath . The lesson Max draws from Afghanistan in the 1980s is : If the U.S. is involved in toppling a regime , whether directly or indirectly , we must not walk away afterwards . Otherwise our aid can backfire . Now according to Reuters and the New York Times , President Obama has signed a secret finding authorizing the C.I.A. to provide arms and other support to the Libyan rebels , although reportedly debate continues within the administration on whether to actually follow through on arming the rebels : Several weeks ago , President Obama signed a secret finding authorizing the C.I.A. to provide arms and other support to Libyan rebels , American officials said Wednesday . But weapons have not yet been shipped into Libya , as Obama administration officials debate the effects of giving them to the rebel groups . The presidential finding was first reported by Reuters . Blogger Andrew Sullivan is outraged that President Obama may get the U.S. involved in regime change in secret : To say that this is a betrayal of his candidacy and his supporters would be an understatement . It makes George Bush 's request for a vote from Congress before committing the US to war in Iraq look like a model of democratic accountability . How dare this president commit this country to an open-ended involvement in a foreign country 's civil war - in secret , with no real public debate and then presented as a fait accompli . And now we are told there is a debate within the administration over whether to follow through on its preparation and actually arm the rebels . How can that be possible ? If we are not there for regime change imposed by foreign powers , as the president has insisted , on what grounds is this even being discussed ? Andrew further argues that arming the rebels would undermine the Arab Spring : This secret shift to full-on entanglement is also , to my mind , a well-meant but ill-conceived undermining of the Arab Spring . Regime change by force of foreign arms is not a democratic revolution ; it is the imposition by foreign powers of their agenda in the service of groups we do not know or understand -- and will never know and never fully understand . Bruce Riedel warns of a slippery slope : You can t just give them weapons . They need to be organized and disciplined to go from being an armed mob to a force capable of dealing with Gadhafi s troops . That means sending trainers and advisers , which means putting boots on the ground . Alexis Crow echoes common concerns about the makeup of the rebels : But the resounding questions are : Who are the rebels , and do they represent a coherent democratic alternative to Gadhafi 's regime ? Or , will arming the opposition fuel a tribal conflict ? And Josh Felter and Brian Fishman warn that arming the rebels could simply fuel a deadly civil war , which could allow for a niche jihadi group to flourish : The more likely scenario than a clean rebel victory , however , is also more dangerous : that either military stalemate or internal divisions among rebel groups will lead to a chaotic civil war in which a small jihadi faction can flourish amid lawless conditions . History shows us that even a small band of determined extremists , if well led , armed , and equipped , can wreak havoc and challenge efforts to bring stability and order to a weakened state . Algeria suffered a decade of terribly brutal civil war at the hands of extremists such as the Armed Islamic Group and its splinter faction the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat . Other examples include the Abu Sayyaf group in the southern Philippines , Jemaah Islamiyah in Indonesia , and Islamist extremist groups that fuel the insurgency in Chechnya . And al-Qaida in Iraq still kills on a scale that would be deemed completely unacceptable in any country where the recent past was not so tremendously violent . The debate rages on . Spencer Ackerman notes that NATO is all over the place on the question of arming the Libyan rebels : The international community does not seem to have resolved the question of whether or not to arm the rebels . In Brussels , the alliance s civilian leader firmly backed off that option in an interview with CNN . We are not in Libya to arm people , said Anders Fogh Rasmussen , but to protect people . That contradicted the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , Susan Rice . We ve not , certainly , ruled that out , Rice told ABC s George Stephanopoulos , who said that the U.S. has an important interest in seeing Gadhafi step down . President Obama is obviously a man of conscious and the fact that he has refused to sit on his hands in the face of the happenings across Northern Africa and surly now events building in the Middle East demands that the U.S. needs to forge new policy . The U.S still being a super power with responsibilities that come with the title , is obligated to lead not only in forming needed new international policies for America but also by example set the bar for all nations of the world to follow . Because of our fundamental democratic believes , believes in freedoms , the rule of law , equality , and most importantly truth ; our policy makers now find themselves in a vary difficult position . These countries around the globe with their populous demanding change and hopefully desiring to move towards a system similar to our own ; are now forcing us to evaluate our own policies in dealing with dictators that all the nations of the world have had relationships with for decades . Its time for the U.S. to begin the process of coming clean or the face the consequences ; that we can no longer continue this business as usual practices with murderous dictators . If America and the nations of the civilized world continue trade relations with such dictators we not only promoting but also empower the vary behavior that we deplore . The closest thing we have to a globe committee is the United Nations and honestly we all known the dysfunctional qualities of committee rule . Getting things done under such constraints are merely impossible , thus the other strong reason why America and currently the Obama administration needs to and has to take on these issues as impossible as they may seem . The U.N. mandate 1973 is surly only the beginning of a conversation that all the nations of the world need to begin . That if the nations of the world are going to come together in consistent policies that effect the populous of the world now is the time . If our policy makers don t lead the way ; we are no better than an individual who buys stolen goods , from a murder . March 31 , 2011 at 2:29 pm | Reply It is a pity that the 70 % of the US population whose IQ are below average influence the decisions made by the remaining 30 % whose IQ are over and above the average . Is it a problem with democracy ? March 31 , 2011 at 11:49 pm | Reply Not that your comment warrants a response , but if the response of the elites is merely to criticize roll your eyes around and offer no meaning full response . Then I guess you honestly don t understand how freedom of expression or democracy works . April 1 , 2011 at 10:05 am | Wow ! It 's difficult to grasp most of your points because your writing is nearly incoherent . You seem to suggest that President Obama is correct to take unilateral action on his own without regard to opinions of the US people -LRB- through their elected representatives in Congress -RRB- or the world opinion -LRB- the United Nations -RRB- . I suppose you would also support the Obama administration taking any unilateral action it chooses without consulting with anyone . That sounds like dictatorship to me . April 1 , 2011 at 8:01 am | Reply I do not suggest war or police actions I suggest that removing most favorable trade status from the likes of dictators who don t care to advance the interest of their own people . Further those nations that ignore trade embargos be added to the same list . April 1 , 2011 at 9:21 am | For the last 40-50 yrs our policy has been to support dictators at the cost of the people of those countries . In part this is what helped create al-Qaeda and terrorist mind sets against the then super powers of Russia and USA . The government which we the American people fund is directed by corporate American , and other international big bucks powers . Their minds sets are protect the Oil , protect their profits protect our energy needs . In the case of Libya its Italian , French , and British Oil interest that s being defended and the new Obama Doctrine forced on to him by the recent events in Egypt and across the Arabic countries . The revolts by this people were inevitably going to happen you can only suppress truth for a short time in the new information age . The promotion of Democracy is currently being forced on U.S. policy makers . Lest they be seen as hypocrites and the general populous of Americans the same , So if we the American people truly believe in freedom we need to put our money were are mouths are or quit buying Oil from these dictators . April 1 , 2011 at 9:37 am | Reply '' ... democratic believes , believes in freedoms ... '' believes is the key word , exactly ! With 676 thousands dollars of debt per family you are very `` free '' comparing with the Lybians those had almost no debts under Gaddafi 's rule April 2 , 2011 at 7:21 pm | Reply The only right thing the U.S. can do is to do nothing at all . This country has absolutely no business sticking it 's nose into Libya 's civil war but the right-wing thugs in Washington are adamant on doing so through their own arrogance and self-righteousness . No wonder this country 's in the trouble it finds itself ! March 31 , 2011 at 4:22 pm | Reply Actually , Arab league , France and UK were much more adamant about it than these `` right-wing thugs in Washington '' . March 31 , 2011 at 5:50 pm | Reply This policy of do nothing sends a clear message to the dictators and the people of the world that life under their regimes . That the Americans are comfortable with the actions of these dictators ; all we care is that they continue to sell us their Oil . Americans and the nations of the world will continue to buy your goods so that the dictator can continue to dictate and Americans can t quite grasp why the people of other nations have doubts about the Americans . April 1 , 2011 at 10:37 am | Reply Please do n't arm the freedom fighters , they have to succeed on the ground , now they have covert c.i.a. ops , no more should be needed . We should start wrapping up our operations by July or sooner . In and out and the freedom fighters will respect the U.S. more . March 31 , 2011 at 4:57 pm | Reply I ponder at times that our government may actually convince themselves that the general public who actually is aware of our involvement in other countries , is not happening at all ... did I make sense ?????? CIA involvement is and always will be `` covert '' . Thus , since we have a `` habit '' of getting involve ... let , s accept the fact that the only solution is to simply go ahead and do the best we can . Yes , there are parameters , but the simple solution is in this case is to arm the rebels , get Gaddafi out , and take it from there . March 31 , 2011 at 4:59 pm | Reply What the U.S. needs to do is to break it 's `` habit '' of getting involved and overcome it 's arrogance and self-righteousness . We have absolutely no right to be there at all !!! March 31 , 2011 at 7:22 pm | Reply Is n't arming the rebels how Afghanistan wound up under Taliban rule ? The rebels became the oppressors . March 31 , 2011 at 5:15 pm | Reply Obama wants Libyans saved from Gaddafi 's savage forces but does not care two hoots about the Afghans dying violent deaths at the hands of the US troops . Is it because he considers the lives of civilians in oil-rich Libya more valuable than those of poor Afghans ? April 1 , 2011 at 12:37 am | Reply this is why we going broke . given out to much to others you dont see them helping us . March 31 , 2011 at 5:28 pm | Reply I find it strange that the U.S. sees no qualm to arm the rebels , while the Gaddafi forces get no reinforcement from outside due to arms embargo . Even if the rebels were armed with sophisticated weaponry , it is no guarantee that they would beat the government forces . On the battlefield artillery does n't always help if one lacks experience and training . March 31 , 2011 at 5:47 pm | Reply No followup on March 20 French airstrike and failure of rebel militia to assess , see : BENGHAZI : AIRSTRIKE ASSESSMENT -LRB- EYES ONLY -RRB- You ca n't change horses in the middle of the stream . We backed them and should see it through . We should n't write them off so quick . Democracy takes time and education , and eventually they will get there . At this point , anything is better than Gadhafi . March 31 , 2011 at 6:40 pm | Reply WE HAVE ALWAYS DESERTED OUR ALLIES ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE . This is nothing new April 1 , 2011 at 12:58 am | Reply North Korea , Saudi Arabia , Iran , China , Venezuela , Cuba , ... ... ... None of these countries are a democracy either should NATO enforce no fly zones over all of these countries so their citizens can revolt . Think about it ... ... We should arm the `` rebels '' with nuclear war heads with triggers set to go off as soon as they are armed ... Problem solved . That is the only way to end fighting and blood shed in these backwards countries . March 31 , 2011 at 6:43 pm | Reply Your comments prompt me to ponder why American education has incubated so many nuts like you ? April 1 , 2011 at 12:08 am | Reply We did n't back anybody . We created a no-fly zone to protect civilians from being slaughtered by the thousands . Republicans were for it , until Obama did it . Arming the rebels is something that should not be taken lightly . We armed the Afghan mujahideen in their fight against Soviet occupation . Research that , and see what the consequences were . We do n't need to make another mistake like that . March 31 , 2011 at 7:31 pm | Reply BS we were n't protecting citizens . We are engaged in a full scale war , killing people and breaking things April 1 , 2011 at 1:00 am | Reply Arming the rebels may not be the best idea , but it is certainly better than the alternative . Just imagine instead of a Civil War in Libya that the headlines were more along the line of a genocide by Gadhafi killing all his protesting citizens . The `` No Fly Zone '' however in my opinion is a clear sign of international unification against Gadhafi and for him to be tried for his crimes . It also allowed the rebels to be doing as well as they are but I do agree with the `` Obama Doctrine '' that we need only interveen to protect our intrest , it does however seem to me like it allows us to pick and choose our battles which can help us in the future if we 're ever faced with a situation like the one in Libya . March 31 , 2011 at 7:59 pm | Reply The so-called `` Obama Doctrine '' will end up doing far more damage than any good . Besides , I get sick and tired of hearing all this Western propaganda about pro-Qadaffy forces killing `` civilians '' . After all , they 're killing `` rebels '' who are trying to take over Libya . Without Western interference , this conflict would have ended by now . March 31 , 2011 at 8:18 pm | Reply The constant bombardment of Gadhafi ` s supporters will cause them to bow to the wishes of the coalition . A human can not take the noise of exploding shells for more than a month . They will kiss arse for some quiet . March 31 , 2011 at 8:06 pm | Reply Ai n't that just like a Democrat : Blame Republicans for intervening in other country 's affairs , pass laws so that America ca n't interfere with other country 's affairs , then go right ahead and intervene in other country 's affairs . I 'm flat out disgusted with partisan politicians and the mindless morons who vote for them . Ai n't that just like a Democrat : use doublespeak to conjure up a rationalization for Libyan involvement -LRB- when no valid reason exists -RRB- , depend on the partisan lemmings to regurgitate it , as if it is Holy and above question , engage in a push-button attack , then turn tail and hand the op over to France . What was it the Democrats had against Operation Iraqi Freedom again ? March 31 , 2011 at 11:35 pm | Reply The helter-skelter advance and retreat of the Libyan rebels is how Arabs fight when they are not trained by western powers . Mostly it 's alot of shouting and bluster , firing off rounds in the general direction and falling back to regroup and find enough courage to advance again . One guy who 'd been studying in America came and brought his own rifle which he did not know how to load -LRB- or clean -RRB- . Very emotional , not logical . Hope the CIA sent Arab speakers because they wo n't listen to you otherwise and translating battlefield tactics and small weapons handling is tedious thru translators . Everyone will want to be a general but no one will know how to lead . If Obama is too squeamish to get in he needs to take the head off the opposition quickly . That means a sniper or close-in assassin to take out Gadhafi and his sons . There are people who can do this and its alot cheaper in lives and money than a civil war fought by civilians . The Europeans are the ones who use Libyan oil so let them do it . March 31 , 2011 at 11:44 pm | Reply April 1 , 2011 at 1:16 am | Reply Not to bring up folks ' dirty laundry but , it was Biden and Obama , among other Democratic leaders and followers , who suggested that Bush should be impeached because he convinced the Congress to grant him war powers . Obama got the UN to agree but , that is n't what the Constitution requires . We do n't NEED ANY OTHER COUNTRY to declare a war when it 's in our national interest . But , we DO NEED THE CONGRESS TO AGREE . You 're spending huge amounts of money every time you fire those cruise missles and even the cost of small arms can soar if you do n't have fire discipline on the line -LRB- such as your allies firing weapons in the air for fun -RRB- . If they wanted to take the leader of Libya out they had adequate reasons without ANYONE but us agreeing to it . When is he going to seek Congressional approval for this escapade ? They run the budget and every day of this stupidity cost this nation and YOU your taxes and inflation due to debt . Obama is trying to criple the US economically to please his patron , Soros , and he 's losing the fight on spending in Congress . He 's hoping by pulling this it works out several advantages for him . He wants this exercise so he can appear to be a leader -LRB- about like the Ceasar in Gladiator -RRB- . He wants this to force Congress in approve spending -LRB- which always has `` goodies '' for his party buried in them -RRB- . He wants this because he 's trying to boost the union dues by trying to create more of a need for union labor . Yes , they build a lot of the stuff we use . There 's no down side for him except the very real grounds for impeachment for violating his oath of office . And , yes Martha , he did . April 1 , 2011 at 12:20 am | Reply This is about oil and nothing else . Gadhafi anounced in November he was going to give the Russian and Chinese companies the contracts and cut out Spain 's Repsol , France s Total , and Italy s Eni , Germany s Winstershall a unit of BASF and OMV of Austria . The American companies involved are Occidental Petroleum , and Waha Oil , a joint venture with American oil companies ConocoPhillips , Marathon and Hess . So boys , as you lay in the stinking desert dying for world corporate powers you can comfort yourself with the lie about freedom and democracy . There has n't been a war about freedom and democracy since world WW II . April 1 , 2011 at 1:07 am | Reply You 've laid the oil interest out very well . The Europeans are being squeezed out by Russia and China . Wars have started over alot less . And all it took was that one lone Tunisian fruit seller to light the fuse !

So , what is the solution to preventing another Afghanistan ? Arming Afghanistan 's rebels against the USSR led to Somalia , the Taliban , Lashkar E Taiba , and possibly even groups such as Abu Sayaf in the Phillipines , April 1 , 2011 at 3:17 am | Reply Libya is TOTALLY different situation . Libyans have clear goals and inherently peaceful people that hate wars and conflicts . Just looking for decent life and be on good terms with the rest of the world . They were forced to defend themselves after seeing massacres committed against unarmed civilians . The moment Gaddafi goes they will drop arms and build their countries .

April 1 , 2011 at 9:30 am | Reply I find it amusing that the US is involved in Libya . If the US is the country that protect human rights why is it not involved in Bahrain , Qatar , Yemen and Egypt ? This is the double standard that the International powers play everyday . Oil in Libya is the key issue in this involvement . Can the US stand up pride with pride to what it have done in Iraq ? Is the people of Iraq free from violance ? In fact what this Libyan involvement will do is to destabiise the country so that it can be easy for this so called `` superpower '' can loot Libyan Oil .

You guys have armed kadafi so why not arm these `` freedom fighters '' too ? April 1 , 2011 at 11:35 am | Reply Is this topic is like the others surrounding the Libyan fiasco it is probably already moot as well . The rebels are already getting supplies of munitions and equipment . Yesterday they were cheering as flat bed trecks hauled new quadruple mount AA guns toward Brega . Would n't they have wanred those when Ghaddafi was bombing Benghazi last week ? Just like CIA covert operations and the Presidential approval for ` recognizing and assisting the rebels ' , supplying them with weapons is well underway already . All part of ` the plan ' , boys and girls . The only part of the plan that 's indistinct at this time is how it 's all going to end up ? For those ` rebels ' are ` Islamicists ' , Ghaddafi is n't and , as we 're told , Islamicists are a big part of ` world terror ' .

April 2 , 2011 at 2:53 am | Reply Its not great idea to arm the rebel . At the end of the war all these rebel might be turn in to Al-Queada which will be threat to other world . Secondly these rebels enjoys to fire the weapon in to sky and show the Victory sign rather than fight to pro Quaddafi force . First they need to be trained , disciplined and after that they might armed under strict monitoring . After the war arms should be ceased .

April 3 , 2011 at 11:02 am | Reply Jesus Christ ! Americans , do you ever learn any history ? Or you think that your example set in the 18th century would be true and applicable for everybody else ? Let me try to explain myself : there are two types of revolutions and therefore revolts around the world . One is caused by intellectuals the other one by plebes . So far the revolution by intellectuals occurred only in the US , which led to real changes and improvement on human rights -LRB- i.e. let me remind you , this is why you are celebrating July 4th each year -RRB- . The revolution caused and conducted by plebes , on the other hand , is the type that almost all other revolutions throughout the history can be attributed to . You want a list ? It 's going to be a long one -LRB- but i 'll try to shorten to the key events in the world history -RRB- : French Revolution , Russian Bolshevik Revolution , Islamic Revolution in Persia . What do they all have in common ? Instead of making the lives of common people better , they ended up in large massacres : the reign of terror in France and thousands guillotined , the persecution of thousands of people in Russia by Lenin and Stalin and camps such as Gulag , the discrimination of killing of Bahais and people from other congregations in Iran . One more example needs not to be forgotten is the war Afghanistan between Soviets and Taliban , where you , sweethearts , out of total stupidity and lack of any understanding of the situation , empowered Taliban , which eventually came back to bite you in the arse on 9\\/11 . So go ahead , support the rebels , bring disorganized plebes and eventually Al-Qaeda to power , but then do n't complain and moan when you have another skyscrapers blown up and get your hands dirty with blood of lots and lots of civilians who will be beheaded because of the refusal to follow the Sharia law just like it happened in in Soviet Union in camps or public executions in Afghanistan . P.S. And if you really count on democratic elections there , remember the human psychology first and note the following facts : in the past years in Iran such leaders as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad came to power in an absolutely democratic way in Iran , Hamaz was also elected democratically in Gaza and the most notable example is Hitler , whose party was supported in 30 's by an overwhelming majority .

I would not be surprised if Turkey interfered with effective air campaign . We see propaganda shots of Turkish humanitarian evacuations which do not help insurgents in the long term . If this stalemate continues , Turkey status as regional power will increase and NATO will be tarnished . Because of decisions by consensus there is nothing that can be done about it within NATO structure . The way around it is to provide effective ground weapons to insurgents .

A witness said he fears a `` massacre '' in Misrata A U.S. presidential finding authorizes CIA operations in Libya , a source says White House : Libyan foreign minister 's defection shows pressure is `` having an effect '' Tune in to `` AC360 '' at 10 ET Thursday night for an exclusive interview with The New York Times journalists who were captured , then released by the Libyan regime . Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- From the halls of Congress to the shell-pocked streets of Libyan cities , intertwined themes rang clear Thursday : Leader Moammar Gadhafi is determined to prevail , and the opposition needs more training and allied air strikes to have a chance . `` Gadhafi will `` kill as many -LRB- people -RRB- as he must to crush the rebellion , '' Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen told the House Armed Services Committee . The rebels , who were regrouping after several setbacks , pinned their hopes on more coalition air power , which will likely increase as weather improves . `` We want more to bring a speedy end to this , '' Col. Ahmed Omar Bani , an opposition spokesman , told CNN . `` A strike is not a strike unless it kills , '' he said . Rare view inside Misrata 's war zone Wounded pregnant woman shares story Gadhafi 's son had a U.S. internship Libyan foreign minister flees country CIA operatives have been in Libya working with rebel leaders to try to reverse gains by loyalist forces , a U.S. intelligence source said . The United States , insisting it is now fulfilling more of a support role in the coalition , shifted in that direction as NATO took sole command of air operations in Libya . The ferocity of this month 's fighting and Gadhafi 's advantage in firepower was clearly evident in Misrata , which has seen snipers , significant casualties and destruction . A witness told CNN Thursday there `` is utter madness '' and Gadhafi 's men are going door-to-door evicting and terrorizing people . `` I am afraid it will be one big massacre here in Misrata '' if the international forces `` do not do more , '' he said . CNN did not identify the witness for security reasons . Saddoun El-Misurati , a spokesman for the Libyan opposition in Misrata , described intense fighting and casualties in the city . `` We managed to get two shipments , so far , of badly needed medical supplies to the hospitals . But obviously we still need more supplies in dealing with the day-to-day casualties and the situation on the ground , '' he said . Gadhafi 's military capabilities had been steadily eroded since the onset of U.N.-sanctioned air strikes , U.S. officials have said . But the dictator 's forces outnumber the rebels by about 10-to-1 in terms of armor and other ground forces , Mullen noted . Defense Secretary Robert Gates , also speaking before the House committee , warned that the Libyan rebels still need significant training and assistance . `` It 's pretty much a pickup ballgame '' right now , he said . Anderson : Gadhafi opposition badly armed Libyan opposition speaks out on tactics U.S. and British officials say no decision has been made about whether to arm the opposition . Dianne Feinstein , head of the Senate Intelligence Committee , told CNN 's `` The Situation Room '' she opposes doing that . The Democratic senator cited failures of such a move in other conflicts . Bani -- asked whether he is open to the idea of ground forces from outside Libya joining the rebels ' effort -- responded that `` all options are open to us . '' `` It has been very hard the past few days because the freedom forces have been facing heavy tanks and artillery weapons with very light weapons , '' the spokesman said . While some members of the Libyan military reportedly defected to join the opposition , the rebels include many volunteers who have not been trained . Over the weekend , CNN reported that rebels had taken al-Brega , Ras Lanuf and Bin Jawad , and reached a town just east of Sirte . But in the past three days , opposition fighters have been pushed back eastward . CNN 's Ben Wedeman , reporting Thursday from near al-Brega , said the rebels , armed with light mortars and machine guns , have displayed no strategy in their running battles with loyalist troops . Gates reiterated the Obama administration 's promise that no U.S. ground forces will be used in Libya , telling committee members that the rebels had indicated they did n't want such an intervention . But the United States does have CIA personnel on the ground . A U.S. intelligence source said the CIA is operating in the country to help increase U.S. `` military and political understanding '' of the situation . A former counterterrorism official with knowledge of U.S. Libya policy said there is a presidential finding authorizing the CIA to conduct operations in support of U.S. policy in Libya , including assessing the opposition and determining their needs . Specific activities by CIA officers will be determined by conditions on the ground and would need further approval from the White House , the source said . A former senior intelligence official said officers `` might be advising -LRB- rebels -RRB- on how to target the adversary , how to use the weapons they have , reconnaissance and counter-surveillance . '' Presidential findings are a type of secret order authorizing some covert intelligence operations . The CIA has had a presence in Libya for some time , a U.S. official told CNN earlier this month . `` The intelligence community is aggressively pursuing information on the ground , '' the official said . The CIA sent additional personnel to Libya to augment officers on the ground after the anti-government protests erupted , the official said , without giving details . CIA officers assisted with the rescue of one of two U.S. airmen whose fighter jet crashed in Libya on March 21 , a knowledgeable U.S. source said . NATO emphasized Thursday that the U.N. resolution authorizing action in Libya precludes `` occupation forces . '' NATO Adm. Giampaolo Di Paola , chairman of the NATO Military Committee , indicated that the presence of foreign intelligence personnel does not violate U.N. Security Council 1973 , which authorized action in Libya . Rebel forces have been demanding an end to Gadhafi 's nearly 42 years of rule in Libya . They have faced sustained attacks by a regime fighting to stay in power and portraying the opposition as terrorists backed by al Qaeda . Rebel forces have lost Bin Jawad and the key oil town of Ras Lanuf and are backed up to the al-Brega area , Bani said Wednesday . Ajdabiya , which is east of al-Brega , will be prepared as a `` defense point '' if the withdrawal continues farther east , he said . Amid the setbacks faced by rebels , a significant crack in Gadhafi 's armor surfaced when Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa fled to London on Wednesday and told the government there that he has resigned , the British Foreign Office said . Koussa -- a former head of Libyan intelligence -- was a stalwart defender of the government as recently as a month ago . But in recent weeks his demeanor had visibly changed . At one recent media briefing , he kept his head down as he read a statement and left early . British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Koussa had not been offered any immunity . Koussa 's defection provides evidence `` that Gadhafi 's regime ... is fragmented , under pressure and crumbling from within , '' said Hague , adding that Koussa is voluntarily speaking with officials in the United Kingdom . Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said Thursday that Koussa did not tell the government he planned to resign before he flew to Britain . Ibrahim said Koussa asked for sick leave and the government gave him permission to leave the country and receive intensive medical care . The government had another setback Thursday , with news that an official who was picked as Libyan ambassador to the United Nations has defected . A relative and an opposition leader said Thursday that former Foreign Minister Ali Abdussalam Treki was in Cairo .

Bullets have made Swiss cheese of buildings . Wreckage litters streets that are empty save opposition fighters desperately defending their city against Moammar Gadhafi 's heavy armor . The Libyan leader laid siege to the nation 's third largest and most prosperous city after opposition fighters took control here . Just two hours east of Tripoli , it was the final rebel stronghold in the West . Now it is a city of fear , uncertainty and human suffering . International reporters had not been able to access central Misrata and many of CNN 's reports were cobbled together from interviews with witnesses and doctors . That was until Wednesday , when CNN journalists were able to reach the city by boat . The fishing trawler was commissioned by two wealthy Libyan businessmen to carry 150 tons of food , medicine and other basic supplies .

Gadhafi 's foes say they are outgunned and fight back with the few weapons they possess , including rifles and rocket-propelled grenades . They provided CNN with a video of a man disabling a tank with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher . Despite the weapons disparity , the opposition has held onto an enclave in the city for several weeks . It 's difficult , day to day , to know where the battlefront will be .

They are from places like Niger , Ivory Coast , Ghana and Egypt . They have nothing but the bread people bring them to feed their aching bellies , says Masahudu Idris , 29 , of Ghana .

Eman al-Obeidy will `` hopefully '' be visited by two or three female journalists by Saturday , Mousa Ibrahim said . He added that he did not know where she was Thursday . `` The only place she will be other than her family house '' is a shelter for women who have been raped , kidnapped , or otherwise victimized , he said . `` Maybe she is there . '' But al-Obeidy 's mother , Aisha Ahmad , told CNN Thursday that she still has not heard from her . Ahmad said she is concerned the government will portray her daughter in a negative light . Gadhafi 's son had a U.S. internship Libyan foreign minister flees country Ahmad said she no longer fears Gadhafi . `` If I were to see his face , I would strangle him , '' she told CNN in a previous interview at her modest home in the eastern coastal city of Tobruk . It was on Saturday that al-Obeidy , a 29-year-old law school graduate , burst into the Rixos Hotel as foreign journalists were having breakfast . Her face and legs were bruised . She showed reporters blood on her right inner thigh . She said she had been held against her will for two days and raped by 15 men . Her visible injuries appeared to support her claims , but CNN could not independently verify al-Obeidy 's story . `` Look at what Gadhafi 's brigades did to me , '' she said . `` My honor was violated by them . '' Al-Obeidy displayed what appeared to be rope burns on her wrists and ankles . Government officials tried to subdue her , but she persisted . Even a member of the hotel 's kitchen staff drew a knife . Another staffer tried to throw a dark tablecloth over her head . One government official who was there to facilitate access for journalists pulled a pistol from his belt . Others scuffled with reporters and wrestled them to the ground in an attempt to take away their equipment . Some journalists were beaten and kicked . CNN 's camera was confiscated and smashed beyond repair . As security forces dragged her away , al-Obeidy warned : `` If you do n't see me tomorrow , then that 's it . '' The Libyan government first said al-Obeidy was mentally ill and drunk . Officials called her a prostitute . Later , the government changed its story and said al-Obeidy was sane enough to withstand legal proceedings . Libyan government spokesman Mousa Ibrahim said the men accused of raping al-Obeidy are being investigated , but the suspects , in turn , have filed countercharges for slander . Ahmad said she received a call Sunday from a man who offered her a bribe to reject al-Obeidy 's claims and persuade her daughter to change her tale . She stands by her daughter , she said . So does her entire family and tribe . To show their support , the family held an in-absentia engagement ceremony for al-Obeidy at a mosque in Tobruk on Monday . The attempt to discredit al-Obeidy as a promiscuous , un-Islamic woman ties into the idea of sexual shaming in a conservative Muslim society where it 's commonly believed that a woman who has been raped has lost her honor , said Mona Eltahawy , a columnist on Arab and Muslim issues . For a woman in such a society to come forward to claim she has been raped is no small thing . `` No one would do that unless they were raped , and especially in a conservative society , '' Eltahawy told CNN on Tuesday . Al-Obeidy 's act ended up being as significant as that of the discontented fruit vendor in Tunisia who set himself afire and sparked revolt in the entire region , Eltahawy said . The way al-Obeidy spoke out was unprecedented and she has already been hailed as a hero on social networking sites . Ahmad challenged Gadhafi to air video of her daughter on state television as proof of her well-being . She also said she was worried about her other daughter , with whom al-Obeidy was living . A group of lawyers and human rights activists tried to approach al-Obeidy 's sister 's house Monday , but were blocked by security forces . The sister 's mobile phone has apparently been turned off , a source with the opposition in Tripoli told CNN . Al-Obeidy 's story raced around the world after she stormed into the Rixos Hotel as international journalists were having breakfast Saturday morning . Ahmad said she has not been able to stop crying . She has n't slept or eaten . She sees only her daughter 's distress shared so publicly at a pivotal moment of her nation 's history .

Send your pictures , video to iReport . Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Battles raged in Libya on Friday as mixed messages of peace put forth from several corners brought no guarantees of an end to the bloody conflict . In the rebel stronghold of Benghazi , Libyan opposition leader Mustafa Abdul Jalil laid out conditions for a cease-fire with Moammar Gadhafi 's forces . Among them were the removal of snipers , mercenaries and militias from western cities , an end to the sieges laid on cities such as Misrata and freedom of expression for the Libyan people . But ultimately , he said , the opposition 's goal remains regime change in Libya . Jalil spoke at a podium with the United Nations special envoy to Libya , Abdelilah al-Khatib , who had carried the opposition 's message to Tripoli the day before . Rebels discuss cease-fire with Gadhafi Al-Khatib reiterated that the U.N. objective is to achieve a cease-fire and end the loss of civilian lives but he did not mention regime change , highlighting the discrepancy between the stated objectives of the Libyan opposition and the international community . Meanwhile in Tripoli , Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told reporters that the rebels are not `` really serious '' about the offer of a cease-fire , which he said was tied to `` silly conditions . '' `` They are asking us to withdraw from our own cities and open our cities to people , who are holding up arms , who are tribal , violent , no unified leadership , al Qaeda links , and no one knows who they are . If this is not mad , then I do n't know what it is , '' he said . `` We will not leave our cities . We will not stop protecting our civilians . '' Ibrahim added that the Libyan government is ready for peace . Sources close to Gadhafi told CNN that political solutions are still possible but that the Libyan leader would relinquish power only to others within his inner circle . They said there is still time for dialogue but expressed doubts about who would represent the opposition . Any transition , they said , would involve Gadhafi 's second son , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , and for such a transition to take place there would first have to be an end to the fighting . The sources added that there is an emerging consensus within the regime that the old guard must prepare to give way to a younger generation of leaders . Citing unnamed British government sources , the Guardian newspaper reported Friday that a senior adviser to Saif Gadhafi was in London for secret talks with British officials . That adviser , Mohammed Ismael , told CNN earlier this week that he would be traveling to London for family reasons . Calls placed to his mobile phone by CNN on Friday were not answered . Asked about the Guardian report , a British Foreign Office spokesman neither confirmed nor denied it . `` We are not going to provide running commentary on our contacts with Libyan officials , '' the spokesman said . `` In any contact that we do have , we make it clear that Gadhafi has to go . '' Ibrahim , the Libyan government spokesman , said he did not know where Ismael was and declined to comment on what he might be doing . The Libyan sources told CNN that for now , Gadhafi remains confident the regime can withstand any challenge from the rebels . Bad weather for the last two days forced a hiatus in international airstrikes , and in that time , rebel forces retreated from areas they had gained . But in a fresh offensive Friday , Libyan opposition forces led by army units that have defected from Gadhafi 's forces were able to pushed back Gadhafi 's troops , rebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah said . Rebels were fighting with newly refurbished rocket launchers and artillery delivered to the frontlines Thursday night by the army units that switched sides , Abdulmolah said . Fighting raged at the western gates of the oil town of al-Brega , which has changed hands six times in as many weeks under the dramatically shifting circumstances of Libya 's civil war . In the west , witnesses reported more explosions and fierce urban warfare in the besieged city of Misrata , once the final rebel stronghold in the western part of the country . Gadhafi 's heavily armed forces continued their pounding Friday amid a series of political setbacks . Observers said the surge in firepower reaffirmed the regime 's message : Gadhafi is determined to prevail , and the defections of some of his high-profile allies are making him nervous . `` You 're certainly getting evidence that there are a lot of tensions , '' said Anne-Marie Slaughter , a professor of international affairs at Princeton University . `` Each person that leaves , that makes it a little scarier for the people that are still remaining , '' she said . `` And you may , at some point , get a tipping effect . '' On Thursday , word emerged that Gadhafi 's pick for U.N. ambassador , former Foreign Minister Ali Abdussalam Treki , had defected to Egypt . The day before , the latest foreign minister , Moussa Koussa , fled to London and told the government there that he had resigned . U.S. officials claim Gadhafi 's military capabilities have been steadily eroded since the onset of U.N.-sanctioned airstrikes . But the dictator 's forces still outnumber rebels by about 10-to-1 in terms of armor and other ground forces , Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Navy Adm.

U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates , also speaking before the House committee , warned that the Libyan rebels still need significant training and assistance . `` It 's pretty much a pickup ballgame '' right now , he said . U.S. and British officials say no decision has been made about whether to arm the opposition . CNN 's Frederik Pleitgen , Ben Wedeman , Nic Robertson , and Reza Sayah contributed to this report .

The seeming discrepancy is part of a delicate diplomatic posture by the Obama administration on the complex overseas operation that involves a U.N. Security Council resolution , a multinational military force and the symbolism of presidential statements and actions . With the military mission shifting Thursday to a new phase of full NATO control after initial U.S. leadership , divisions among alliance partners and within Congress became more evident , exacerbated by the administration 's differing military and political goals . President Barack Obama continues to insist that arming the Libyan rebels remained an option under consideration , while NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen and French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet ruled it out . At House and Senate committee hearings , Republicans grilled Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen on the U.S. role in Libya . `` To say this is not about regime change is crazy , '' said Republican Rep. Mike Coffman of Colorado . `` Of course this is about regime change . Why not just be honest with the American people ? '' Obama has said the motivation for launching military action on March 19 was to prevent a massacre of civilians by Libyan military forces descending on the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . Kucinich : Only Congress can declare war Libya hearings aplenty on the Hill Since then , airstrikes carried out mostly with U.S. planes and missiles have taken out much of Gadhafi 's anti-aircraft capability and destroyed ground forces and supply lines . While Gadhafi 's forces have pulled back from Benghazi , they reclaimed territory from the rebels in recent days , leading to fears of a prolonged stalemate without stronger military support for the rebels . On Thursday , White House spokesman Jay Carney noted the United States turned over control of the Libya mission to NATO that morning -- 12 days after it began -- to fulfill Obama 's pledge to the nation that U.S. leadership would end within `` days , not weeks . '' While Carney said the United States and its allies would keep up pressure on Gadhafi 's government , he acknowledged that it was impossible to say when the mission would end . Regardless of when , he said , `` the scope of the U.S. involvement will be limited '' and Obama continues to reject any possibility of sending in U.S. ground troops . At the same time , a former counterterrorism official confirmed the existence of a presidential finding that authorizes the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct operations supporting U.S. policy in Libya . A presidential finding is a type of secret order authorizing some covert intelligence operations , and a former senior intelligence official said such operations could include `` advising on how to target the adversary , how to use the weapons they have , reconnaissance and counter surveillance . '' Top administration officials distinguished between the military mission charged with protecting Libyan civilians and the other non-military efforts -- including sanctions , freezing assets and CIA operations -- aimed at hastening Gadhafi 's departure . `` Does the United States have the capacity to unilaterally with military force produce regime change in Libya or another country ? We probably do , '' Carney told reporters . `` Is that a desirable action to take when you have your eye on the long game here in terms of Libya 's future , the future ... interests of the United States and the region ? No. '' Obama 's dual-track policy , with the military coalition protecting Libyan civilians while the United States pursues `` as a political , diplomatic and economic policy '' the end of Gadhafi 's rule , is the best fit for the Libya situation , Carney insisted , citing the international backing for the military mission through a U.N. Security Council resolution and Arab League support . Critics complained that it is both dishonest and a mistake for the military objective to differ from the policy objective . At a House Armed Services Committee hearing , Rep. Chris Gibson , R-New York , said the mission 's `` military and political goals are not harmonized , '' while Coffman called it `` just the most muddled definition of an operation probably in U.S. military history . '' On the Democratic side , liberal Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio challenged Obama 's legal power to commit U.S. forces to a combat role without congressional authorization . `` This is a clear and arrogant violation of our Constitution , '' Kucinich declared on the House floor . `` Even a war launched ostensibly for humanitarian reasons is still a war and only Congress can declare a war . '' Sen. John McCain of Arizona , the unsuccessful Republican presidential nominee in 2008 , warned that pulling U.S. forces back to a supporting role under NATO control undermined the military mission at a key moment . `` For the United States to be withdrawing our unique offensive capabilities at this time sends the exact wrong signal both to our coalition partners as well as to the Gadhafi regime , especially to those Libyan officials whom we are trying to compel to break with Gadhafi , '' McCain said at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing . `` I need not remind our witnesses that the purpose of using military force is to achieve policy goals , '' McCain told Gates and Mullen . `` But in this case , not only are our military means out of alignment with our desired end of Gadhafi leaving power , we are now effectively stopping our strike missions all together without having accomplished our goal . '' While Obama administration officials have described the continuing U.S. role in the military mission as supportive -- involving refueling , intelligence , surveillance and communications -- Gates said Thursday that U.S. strike aircraft such as A-10 and AC-130s could still be made available to NATO . However , he added that he believed NATO allies had the capacity to take out Libyan ground forces as necessary under the mission 's mandate of protecting civilian populations . Appearing before both the House and Senate panels at separate hearings , Gates said the no-fly zone had been established and now needed to be sustained , but acknowledged `` you could have a situation in which you achieve the military goal but do not achieve the political goal .

'' Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- To recap : The United States and its allies are scrambling to defeat Moammar Gadhafi 's forces in Libya . There 's a no-fly zone , a freezing of assets , threats about prosecution in international courts and an arms embargo . We 're trying to get Gadhafi to surrender -- and , hopefully , leave . And , by the way , the president has secretly ordered the CIA to try to figure out just who the rebels are -- and whether they 're a dependable enough crew , worthy of our money or our arms . `` We have n't ruled out arming the rebels , '' a senior administration official tells me . `` But there are a lot of questions that need to be answered first -- including whether they are even trained to use what we might give them . '' If the policy sounds , er , improvisational , that 's because it is . Naturally , any form of ad-hoc-ism is not exactly comforting , especially when it comes to foreign military intervention . Most often , intervention works this way : When we are attacked , we respond . When people plan to attack us , we try to prevent it . Presidents are asked to consult with Congress , provide a mission , goals , timetables and endgames . We like to know how we 're getting out before we get in . We are understandably war-weary . Yet when the president proposes an alternative to the now unpopular all-or-nothing-go-it-alone military interventions of Iraq and Afghanistan , it 's still somehow unsettling . We do n't want to go it alone . Yet we 're not sure we trust others to take the lead . View from Libya 's ` shaky ' frontline Gates : Obama followed War Powers Act Kucinich : Only Congress can declare war When the president says , as he did in his speech Monday , `` We should not be afraid to act -- but the burden of action should not be America 's alone , '' we get it . But we also start wondering : What happens if we 're not driving the car ? We always drive the car . Truth is , we like to drive . And when we 're not driving , we think it 's easy -- even likely -- for the coalition to veer off course . So here 's the conundrum : We do n't want to go it alone . Yet we 're not sure we trust others to take the lead . And that 's where the Republican political play is right now . And it 's easy : Sidestep the entire question of intervention , while either -LRB- a -RRB- saying Obama took too long to do it or -LRB- b -RRB- he did it in a wimpy -LRB- and possibly self-defeating -RRB- way -LRB- spelled `` coalition '' -RRB- . In other words , do n't lead . Just say Obama ca n't lead . Consider Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour , who recently complained to a local radio station that `` The Obama administration 's position has been to say , ` You know , we 're just one of the boys . We 're not going to try to be the leader . ' And we see that when you do n't have strong leadership from the strongest country in the world , then everybody else scatters out and breaks up . '' So , um , what 's the right thing to do ? `` I 'm not saying ` Do this , do that , ' '' he told WFMN radio in Jackson , Mississippi , going on to say we need to make sure we have the resources we need to accomplish the mission . Now is that clear ? Mitt Romney says he supports military action , but says Obama is taking orders -- from the Arab League and the UN -- rather than giving them . And then there 's Newt Gingrich , who was for an intervention before he was against it -- at least the way Obama did it . Republicans can get away with the Obama-doesn ` t-believe-in-American-exceptionalism stuff for awhile because the public itself is ambivalent . In fact , a Pew poll taken on the eve of the president 's speech showed that only 47 % of Americans believed that the airstrikes in Libya were warranted . And when asked about whether there is a clear goal , the public also seemed largely unconvinced . Most notably , independent voters said there 's no clear goal , by a 57 % to 35 % margin . The president deserves props for the immense coalition he put together , not to mention a successful vote in the UN Security Council against Libya . Yet Obama has succeeded in making no one completely happy : Those who wanted unilateral intervention quickly say Obama has dithered , caring more about building a coalition than saving the Libyan people . On the other end of the spectrum , those worried about intervention without a clear exit strategy consider Obama to be too hasty . So he ca n't win . If Gadhafi goes , Obama 's a hero . And all of that improvisation will suddenly look like a well-constructed sonata . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger .

The feeling was never stronger than when the soldiers hovered over Lynsey Addario , Stephen Farrell , Tyler Hicks , and Anthony Shadid with automatic weapons as they lay on the ground . `` I think we all had that -- that very sinking feeling that this was it , '' Shadid said on CNN 's `` AC360 Thursday . `` And I remember on my stomach looking up and I remember him being a tall soldier and him saying , ` Shoot them . ' '' The four journalists were released this month after being held for about a week . Addario recalled that physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her captors started almost immediately . Journalists taken by Gadhafi 's forces `` I remember I was sitting in the car and I 'm bound , and they had bound my hands so tight they were starting to go numb , '' Addario told CNN 's Anderson Cooper . `` And I was sitting there , sort of blowing the wisps of hair out of my face , and this guy came up next to me . And my instinct was that , ` Oh , he 's going to help me , ' and he just punched me in the side of the face . '' `` Then I started crying because I thought , ` It 's only going to get worse , '' she said . `` We 're in the first 15 minutes . This could last months , you know ? ' '' Addario said the man who punched her in the face laughed afterward , and , as the only woman , she also had to deal with sexual assault . `` They came and groped me ... I 've never been touched like that in the Muslim world , and I 've been working 11 years in the Muslim world , '' she said . `` That 's when I said , `` Oh , God , I just do n't want to be raped . '' The four colleagues initially thought they were safe as they began `` pulling back slowly '' from Ajdabiya , a northeastern Libyan city as Gadhafi 's troops advanced , Hicks said . They had escaped a firefight between the opposing sides . But their retreat from the area was going too slowly , Shadid recalled . `` It must have been seconds , but it felt like minutes , '' he said . `` We saw the green military uniforms , the military vehicles . And then almost -- I mean almost instantly -- you realized that you were actually at a government checkpoint and that we had ... pretty much no options at that point . '' Fleeing was not an option , Addario said . `` You ca n't turn around and go back because they 'll open fire . I mean , you would assume they would open fire , '' she said . `` You look more suspicious if you try and run away . '' Addario said their driver moved on to Plan B , telling the soldiers the people in the car were journalists . But Gadhafi 's troops were not swayed by that argument . That was n't working , '' Farrell remembered . Tarhouni : Oil to fund the Libyan rebels `` We were put on our knees first and there was a lot of ... slapping , '' Shadid said . `` There was emptying our pockets . And I remember one of the soldiers was yelling at me , ` You 're the translator . You 're the spy . ' '' It was soon after then that one of the soldiers threatened to kill them . But `` another soldier said to him , ` You ca n't . They 're Americans . ' '' That did seem to hit a chord , '' Farrell said . Shadid added , `` I think the idea of executing three Americans and a British journalist would have had implications ... There was going to be repercussions of basically executing us there at a checkpoint . '' While the abusive during captivity was n't limited to Addario , it often focused on her . In prison , one man tried to drag her out of her cell , but quit after she put up a fight . In the back of a Land Cruiser , she had to deal with another `` twisted '' scenario . `` A guy reached over from the front seat and started caressing my hair either like a mother would a son or a daughter , '' Addario said . `` And then he started touching my face , very sort of gently and saying this phrase over and over , '' she said . `` And I sort of tried to put my head down . `` And he picked it up and just kept caressing me in this weird sort of tender way . And he was saying this phrase over and over , '' she said . `` And I said to Anthony , I said what 's ` Mort ? ' And Anthony said , ` He 's telling you you 're going to die tonight .

Regarding Libya there is no infrastructure , poor education and poor health care . Poverty and not respecting human rights and I think it was enough that waste the country money for 42 years .

Benghazi and Derna is a base Libyan Islamic Fighting Group -LRB- LIFG -RRB- , which in 2007 formally merged with al-Qaeda . Benghazi -- the center of the region Serenaika , over the past two centuries , successfully fought against the influence of the central government in Libya . Ethnic differences of Arabs living in Tripolitania , and Arabs living in Serenaiku have their roots in the 11 st century . Real power in Serenaike for decades belonged to the representatives of the Sufi Order Sanussi , founded in 1842 in Al-Bayda . The Order is exceptionally rigid , conservative and anti-Western interpretation of Islam . The first king of independent Libya , Idriss , Qaddafi deposed in 1969 , was head of the Order . That is why the banner of the current `` rebellion '' , which you can see an infinite number of times in the reports of Al-Jazeera became the royal flag . In the mid-90 's in Benghazi and Derna Islamist uprising broke out against the `` heretics '' Qaddafi . Benghazi was blocked , the telephone was cut .

Over 75 % France 's power is nuclear so oil should not be that big of a factor . If you also recall , the countries that had a major stake in Libya 's oil market such as China , Italy , and Germany were very reluctant to help the Libyan people . The main drawback of arming the rebels is also training them which will probably take weeks or months . Factor in that the US involvement needs to be limited and the Obama administration is faced with an FP problem never faced before by an American president . But he should follow through with the implicit goal of getting rid of Gaddafi using all available options apart from sending in US armed forces .

From Derna and Benghazi is the largest number of militants of Al Qaeda , per capita 1 to 1500 population . The report 's authors point to West Point : `` The vast majority of Libyan fighters -- come from the coastal cities of Benghazi and Derna on the north-east of the country . Both cities have long characterized the dominant ideology of militant Islam , both served as the center of the uprising of radical Islamists against Gaddafi in the mid-90 years . Benghazi and Derna is a base Libyan Islamic Fighting Group -LRB- LIFG -RRB- , which in 2007 formally merged with al-Qaeda . Benghazi -- the center of the region Serenaika , over the past two centuries , successfully fought against the influence of the central government in Libya . Ethnic differences of Arabs living in Tripolitania , and Arabs living in Serenaiku have their roots in the 11 st century . Real power in Serenaike for decades belonged to the representatives of the Sufi Order Sanussi , founded in 1842 in Al-Bayda . The Order is exceptionally rigid , conservative and anti-Western interpretation of Islam . The first king of independent Libya , Idriss , Qaddafi deposed in 1969 , was head of the Order . That is why the banner of the current `` rebellion '' , which you can see an infinite number of times in the reports of Al-Jazeera became the royal flag . In the mid-90 's in Benghazi and Derna Islamist uprising broke out against the `` heretics '' Qaddafi . Benghazi was blocked , the telephone was cut . The uprising was suppressed -- perhaps because in the 90 's , there were no Al-Jazeera and the Internet .

The rebels are individuals whose ideologies may be questioned by many , although I have no doubt about their aspiration for freedom and democracy , I suggest to arm the national army instead of arming the rebels . April 3 , 2011 at 7:40 pm | Reply Good idea . . although can not emphasize enough that there are NO suspicious elements amongst the opposition . There is no evidence of that nor it is acceptable by those fighting for freedom . It is Gaddafi who bluntly threatened the west of terrorism . April 3 , 2011 at 8:19 pm | Reply No suspicious elements inside the opposition ? Here is an article about that , with sources like the 2007 West Point Study and numerous others , all stated at the end of the article which you can read fully on the link below the excerpt `` Rebel Leaders Jalil and Younis , Plus Most of Rebel Council are Members of the al Qaeda-linked Harabi Tribe The result of the present inquiry is that the Libyan branch of Al Qaeda represents a continuum with the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group centered in Darnah and Benghazi . The ethnic base of the Libyan Islamic fighting group is apparently to be found in the anti-Qaddafi Harabi tribe , the tribe which makes up the vast majority of the rebel council including the two dominant rebel leaders , Abdul Fatah Younis and Mustafa Abdul Jalil . The evidence thus suggests that the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group , the elite of the Harabi tribe , and the rebel council supported by Obama all overlap for all practical purposes . As the late Foreign Minister of Guyana Fred Wills , a real fighter against imperialism and neo-colonialism , taught me many years ago , political formations in developing countries -LRB- and not just there -RRB- are often a mask for ethnic and religious rivalries ; so it is in Libya . The rebellion against Qaddafi is a toxic brew compounded of fanatical hatred of Qaddafi , Islamism , tribalism , and localism . From this point of view , Obama has foolishly chosen to take sides in a tribal war . When Hillary Clinton went to Paris to be introduced to the Libyan rebels by French President Sarkozy , she met the US-educated Libyan opposition leader Mahmoud Jibril , already known to readers of Wikileaks document dumps as a favorite of the US .16 While Jibril might be considered presentable in Paris , the real leaders of the Libyan insurrection would appear to be Jalil and Younis , both former ministers under Qaddafi . Jalil seems to be the primus inter pares , at least for the moment : Mustafa Abdul Jalil or Abdul-Jalil -LRB- Arabic : , also transcribed Abdul-Jelil , Abd-al-Jalil , Abdel-Jalil or Abdeljalil ; and frequently but erroneously as Abud Al Jeleil -RRB- -LRB- born 1952 -RRB- is a Libyan politician . He was the Minister of Justice -LRB- unofficially , the Secretary of the General People s Committee -RRB- under Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi . Abdul Jalil has been identified as the Chairman of the National Transitional Council based in Benghazi although this position is contested by others in the uprising due to his past connections to Gaddafi s regime . 17 As for Younis , he has been closely associated with Qaddafi since the 1968-9 seizure of power : Abdul Fatah Younis -LRB- Arabic : -RRB- is a senior military officer in Libya . He held the rank of General and the post of Minister of Interior , but resigned on 22 February 2011 . 18 What should concern us most is that both Jalil and Younis come from the Haribi tribe , the dominant one in northeast Libya , and the one that overlaps with al Qaeda . According to Stratfor , the Harabi tribe is a historically powerful umbrella tribe in eastern Libya that saw their influence wane under Col. Gadhafi . The Libyan leader confiscated swaths of tribal members land and redistributed it to weaker and more loyal tribes . Many of the leaders now emerging in eastern Libya hail from the Harabi tribe , including the head of the provisional government set up in Benghazi , Abdel Mustafa Jalil , and Abdel Fatah Younis , who assumed a key leadership role over the defected military ranks early in the uprising . 19 This is like a presidential ticket where both candidates are from the same state , except that Libya s ferocious tribal rivalries make the problem infinitely worse . The Rebel Council : Half the Names Are Kept Secret ; Why ? This picture of a narrow , sectarian tribal and regional base does not improve when we look at the rebel council as a whole . According to one recent version , the rebel council is chaired by the well-spoken former justice minister for Libya , Mustafa Abdul Jalil , -LRB- and -RRB- consists of 31 members , ostensibly representatives from across Libya , of whom many can not be named for security reasons . The key players on the council , at least those who we know about , all hail from the north-eastern Harabi confederation of tribes . These tribes have strong affiliations with Benghazi that date back to before the 1969 revolution which brought Gaddafi to power . 20 Other accounts agree about the number of representatives : The council has 31 members ; the identities of several members has not been made public to protect their own safety . 21 Given what we know about the extraordinary density of LIFG and all Qaeda fanatics in northeast Libya , we are authorized to wonder as to whether so many members of the council are being kept secret in order to protect them from Qaddafi , or whether the goal is to prevent them from being recognized in the west as al Qaeda terrorists or sympathizers . The latter seems to be a more accurate summary of the real state of affairs . Names released so far include : Mustafa Abduljaleel ; Ashour Hamed Bourashed of Darna city ; Othman Suleiman El-Megyrahi of the Batnan area ; Al Butnan of the Egypt border and Tobruk ; Ahmed Abduraba Al-Abaar of Benghazi city ; Fathi Mohamed Baja of Benghazi city ; Abdelhafed Abdelkader Ghoga of Benghazi city ; Mr. Omar El-Hariri for Military Affairs ; and Dr. Mahmoud Jibril , Ibrahim El-Werfali and Dr. Ali Aziz Al-Eisawi for foreign affairs .22 The State Department needs to interrogate these figures , starting perhaps with Ashour Hamed Bourashed , the delegate from the terrorist and suicide bomber stronghold of Darnah . How Many al Qaeda Members , Veterans , or Sympathizers are on the Rebel Council ? Seeing as clearly as we can in the fog of war , it looks like slightly more than a dozen of the members of the rebel council have had their names officially published in any case , not more than half of the reported 31 members . The US and European media have not taken the lead in identifying for us the names that are now known , and they above all have not called attention to the majority of the rebel council who are still lurking in the shadows of total secrecy . We must therefore demand to know how many LIFG and\\/or al Qaeda members , veterans , or sympathizers currently hold seats on the rebel council . We are thus witnessing an attempt by the Harabi tribe to seize dominance over the 140 tribes of Libya . The Harabi are already practically hegemonic among the tribes of Cyrenaica . At the center of the Harabi Confederation is the Obeidat tribe , which is divided into 15 sub-tribes .23 All of this might be of purely academic ethnographic interest , were it not for the fact of the striking overlap between the Harabi tribe and the LIFG and al Qaeda .

The libyans will remove him with a little help from the US April 3 , 2011 at 7:58 pm | Reply Absolutely . At least the U.S. can officially recognize the TNC and help them by giving positioning information of Gaddafis troops in the battle field using satellites and ofcourse giving them modern communication equipment . The U.S. should recognize the freedom fighters as official allies and simply help them by giving them precious info about Gaddafis troops and build a straight communication line between them and the fighters . Gaddafi is trying to whipe out the remaining resistance in western part -LRB- The whole mountain area from Nalut to Yefren and Misrata -RRB- so he can have the whole western part for himself and so he can something to negotiate with . Or maybe even rule the remaining half of the country . Sadly NATO has n't done anything for the western part and this is giving a clear message to Gaddafi to continue .

The Rebels are , on the whole , undisciplined and untrained and will need to be trained in many of the sophisticated weapons that the coalition could supply . There is no guarantee that they would overwhelm Gaddafi forces even with better weapons . Strike and counter strike in civilian areas would inevitably lead to civilian deaths , just the thing UN res 1973 was trying to stop . Gaddafi is already using kidnap and kill squads that have infiltrated the Rebel held cities and if Gaddafi feels he is going to loose he will sponsor a counter insurgency with terrorist tactics like car bombs . Weapons to the rebels will not help against car bombs . Splits in the Coalition and UN would inevitably occur if it was obvious that the arming of the Rebels was to effect regime change by proxy . A preferable solution would be for the coalition special forces to covertly locate and kill Gaddafi and his sons together with close members of the regime and by any means available . This would involve some civilian deaths as Gaddafi will use them as human shields . Despite the overwhelming hatred of Gaddafi by the Libyan people , there are still a number of his supporters in Tripoli who may get caught in the cross-hairs . The civilian casualties would however be small compared to that produced by months or even years of a civil war . The only people to benefit from arming one side or another is arms manufacturers . The arms could be captured by Gaddafis men and then used against the Rebels in much the same way that the Rebels have attacked Gadaffi forces with captured Gadaffi weapons . Finally we have to consider what will happen to the arms after Gaddafi is deposed . They could well find their way onto the black market and into the hands of terrorists .

April 3 , 2011 at 9:27 pm | Reply Here is the problem with arming the rebels . What type of arms do you give them ? Even US soldiers need extensive training on US weapons before they are ready for combat . US-made weapons are quite complex , and they take a lot of maintenance . In the dust and grim of the battlefield , particularly in Libya , these weapons would be useless unless there is adequate training and maintenance . Right now the rebels are using Soviet\\/Russian-made weapons captured from the Gaddafi forces . RPG-7 's , AK-74 's , 12.7 mm -LRB- .50 cal -RRB- heavy machine guns , Katyusha and Grad rocket launchers . These weapons systems are robust require far less training to use . They are `` point and shoot '' weapons , which the rebels have mastered in short period of time . They also require far less maintenance than US-made weapons . We should arm the rebels , but what do we do ? Should we buy Russian-made or -LRB- gulp -RRB- Chinese-made weapons . That seems to be the logical choice , but it wo n't set well with the US taxpayer . Also Russia and China both have distanced themselves from the Libyan intervention , though I am sure they will hold their nose and take the money , then deliver the weapons in unmarked ships to the NATO ports .

He does that now where we live and it did n't harm anyone and will not harm anyone . He almost died with the 1200 people who died all together in one day or two .

This entire problem is caused by powers such as and almost entirely by the U.S. and now they 're going to arm the people ? Is this an Iraq all over again ? I scratch my head when I see all of this going on . If NATO was anything like it was 20 years or so ago , we would be sending in the `` blue helmets '' ensuring peace and bringing both parties to the table to discuss reasonable ways of resolving the problem , but that would require this situation to have to be about internal politics , and it 's really only all about OIL . I dream of the day when mankind will learn that profiteering and non renewable resources will be the source of our demise . The U.S. has armed the Libyan army for three decades , and now will arm the rebels . Either way , the Libyan people will lose in all of this , because the interests of the U.S. will prevail . What really needs to happen is the U.S. population needs to wake up and demand transparency and honesty from its government and to quit meddling in other countries affairs , but that will most probably never happen because people would rather raise the flag way above their heads then to be aware of the horrific truth .

Some nations may be able to turn a blind eye to atrocities in other countries . The United States of America is different . And as president , I refused to wait for the images of slaughter and mass graves before taking action . This from the Great Moral Leader who every day murders civilians in Afghanistan and Pakistan and Yemen and Somalia and now Libya and who turns a blind eye when the great democracy in the Middle East , Israel , murders more Palestinians . The American president , whose drones and air force slaughter civilians every day of the year went on to say Libya stands alone in presenting the world with the prospect of violence on a horrific scale . Obviously , Obama thinks that one million dead Iraqis , four million displaced Iraqis , and an unknown number of murdered Afghans is just a small thing . April 4 , 2011 at 6:20 am | Reply On September 1 , 1969 the pro-western regime that had ruled in Libya was overthrown by Colonel Muamar Gaddafi and his officers . At the time , Libya was home to the largest US Air Base -LRB- Wheelus Air Base -RRB- in North Africa . Agreements between the USA and Libya signed in 1951 and 1954 granted the USAF the use of Wheelus Air Base and its El Watia gunnery range for gunnery and bombing training and for transport and bombing stopovers until 1971 . During the Cold War the base was pivotal to expanding US military power under the Strategic Air Command , and an essential base for fighter and reconnaissance missions . The Pentagon also used the base - and the remote Libyan desert - for missile launch testing : the launch area was located 15 miles east of Tripoli . Considered a ` little America on the shores of the Mediteranean ' , the base housed some 4600 US military personnel until its evacuation in 1970 . With the discovery of oil in Libya in 1959 , a very poor desert country became a very rich little western protectorate . US and European companies had huge stakes in the extremely lucrative petroleum and banking sectors , but these were soon nationalized by Gaddafi . Thus Libya overnight joined the list of US ` enemy ' or ` rogue ' states that sought autonomy and self-determination outside the expanding sphere of western Empire . Further cementing western hatred of the new regime , Libya played a leading role of the 1973 oil embargo against the US and maintained cooperative relations with the Soviet Union . Gaddafi also reportedly channeled early oil wealth into national free health care and education .

April 4 , 2011 at 7:58 am | Reply Numerous press reports over the weekend add to the evidence that the Libyan rebels fighting the regime of Muammar Gaddafi are under the direction of American intelligence agencies . Despite the repeated claims by Obama administration officials that the rebels are a largely unknown quantity , it is becoming increasingly clear that key military leaders of the anti-Gaddafi campaign are well known to the US government and have longstanding relations with the CIA . For better than two weeks there had been a virtual ban in the US media on reporting the name of Khalifa Haftar , the long-time CIA collaborator who was appointed chief rebel commander March 17 , on the eve of the US-NATO bombing campaign against Libya . Only the regional McClatchy Newspapers chain reported Haftar s appointment , and ABC News ran a brief interview with him on March 27 . Otherwise , silence prevailed . This de facto censorship abruptly ended April 1 , when a right-wing US think tank , the Jamestown Foundation , published a lengthy study of Haftar s background and record , which was cited extensively by Reuters news service , and then more widely in the US and British media . The Jamestown Foundation report declared : Today as Colonel Haftar finally returns to the battlefields of North Africa with the objective of toppling Gaddafi , his former co-conspirator from Libya s 1969 coup , he may stand as the best liaison for the United States and allied NATO forces in dealing with Libya s unruly rebels .

April 4 , 2011 at 7:12 am | Reply NATO announced on Friday that the first 24 hours of their command over the Libyan War has resulted in 178 sorties and 74 air strikes . NATO warships also stopped two ships in the Mediterranean Sea near Libya , but did not board them . At least some of the strikes hit a small village called Zawia el Argobe , near Brega . The village doctor said the strike hit a truck carrying ammunition , and the subsequent explosion killed seven civilians and wounded 25 others . Among the dead were children as young as 12 . Though NATO and the US have been shrugging off most reports of civilian killings in their strikes , they have come under renewed scrutiny since a top Catholic official in Tripoli said that his city alone lost 40 civilians in the bombing campaigns . The US was keen to push for a NATO takeover of the Libyan War , and much is being made of the 16 NATO members participating in the war . The reality , however , is that the US and France are still contributing a large majority of the attack force .

Darnah , with one terrorist fighter sent into Iraq to kill Americans for every 1,000 to 1,500 persons of population , emerges as suicide bomber heaven , easily surpassing the closest competitor , which was Riyad , Saudi Arabia . '' '' ... But since the Al Qaeda personnel files contain the residence or hometown of the foreign fighters in question , we can determine that the desire to travel to Iraq to kill Americans was not evenly distributed across Libya , but was highly concentrated precisely in those areas around Benghazi which are today the epicenters of the revolt against Colonel Gaddafi which the US , Britain , France , and others are so eagerly supporting . As Daya Gamage of the Asia Tribune comments in a recent article on the West Point study , alarmingly for Western policymakers , most of the fighters came from eastern Libya , the center of the current uprising against Muammar el-Qaddafi . The eastern Libyan city of Darnah sent more fighters to Iraq than any other single city or town , according to the West Point report . It noted that 52 militants came to Iraq from Darnah , a city of just 80,000 people -LRB- the second-largest source of fighters was Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , which has a population of more than 4 million -RRB- . Benghazi , the capital of Libya s provisional government declared by the anti-Qaddafi rebels , sent in 21 fighters , again a disproportionate number of the whole . 4 Obscure Darnah edged out metropolitan Riyadh by 52 fighters to 51 . Qaddafi s stronghold of Tripoli , by contrast , barely shows up in the statistics at all . -LRB- See chart from West Point report , page 12 -RRB- '' You can find the West Point study here to download , or read excerpts . The only way to get ready of international terrorism is by eliminating the power and reach of all tyrants like GADDAFY from the face of this plant .

Google the front s name plus CIA and you will find hundreds of references . The Wall Street Journal in a Feb. 23 editorial wrote that The U.S. and Europe should help Libyans overthrow the Gadhafi regime . There is no talk in the board rooms or the corridors of Washington about intervening to help the people of Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or Bahrain overthrow their dictatorial rulers .

The U.S. intervened to prevent condemnation of the Zionist settler state . Imperialism s interest in Libya is not hard to find . Bloomberg.com wrote on Feb. 22 that while Libya is Africa s third-largest producer of oil , it has the continent s largest proven reserves 44.3 billion barrels . It is a country with a relatively small population but the potential to produce huge profits for the giant oil companies .

Mummar has took every thing from them and now he is taking their SOULS April 6 , 2011 at 3:34 pm | Reply At this point , however , it must be asked who is the opposition in Libya . The opposition is not a monolithic body . The common denominator is the opposition to the rule of Qaddafi and his family . It has to be said that actions of opposition or resistance against an oppressor and an opposition movement are also two different things . For the most part , the common people and corrupt Libyan officials , who harbor deep-seated hate towards Qaddafi and his family , are now in the same camp , but there are differences . There is an authentic form of opposition , which is not organized , and a systematic form of opposition , which is either external or led by figures from within the Libyan regime itself . The authentic people s internal opposition in Libya is not organized and the people s actions of opposition have been spontaneous . Yet , opposition and revolt has been encouraged and prompted from outside Libya through social media networks , international news stations , and events in the rest of the Arab World . The leadership of the internal opposition that is emerging in Libya is coming from within the regime itself . Corrupt officials that have rebelled against Gaddafi are not the champions of the people . These opposition figures are not opposed to tyranny ; they are merely opposed to the rule of Colonel Qaddafi and his family . Aref Sharif and Al-Yunis are themselves Libyan regime figures . It has to also be considered that some Libyan officials that have turned against Qaddafi are doing it to save themselves , while others in the future will work to retain or strengthen their positions . Abdel Moneim Al-Honi , the Libyan envoy to the Arab League in Cairo , can be looked at as an example . Al-Honi denounced Qaddafi , but it should be noted that he was one of the members of the group of Libyan officers who executed the coup in 1969 with Qaddafi and that later in 1975 he himself tried to take power in a failed coup . After the failed coup , he would flee Libya and only return in 1990 after Qaddafi pardoned him Al-Honi is not the only Libyan diplomat to resign . The Libyan ambassador to India has also done the same . There is an intention on the part of these officials to be members of the power structure in a Libya after the ouster of Qaddafi : Libyan Ambassador to India Ali al-Essawi told the BBC that he was quitting , opposing his government 's violent crackdown on demonstrators . Mr. Al-Essawi was reported to be a Minister in Tripoli and could be an important figure in an alternative government , in case Libyan President Muammar Qadhafi steps down . The second Libyan diplomat to put in his papers was Tripoli 's Permanent Representative to the Arab League Abdel Moneim al-Honi , who said in Cairo that he had quit his job to join the revolution in his country . I have submitted my resignation in protest against the acts of repression and violence against demonstrators , and I am joining the ranks of the revolution , said Mr. Al-Honi . The Second Secretary Hussein Sadiq al Musrati , announced his resignation from China , in an interview with Al-Jazeera , and called on the Army to intervene in the uprising . The leadership of the internal opposition that is emerging in Libya is coming from within the regime itself . Corrupt officials that have rebelled against Gaddafi are not the champions of the people . These opposition figures are not opposed to tyranny ; they are merely opposed to the rule of Colonel Qaddafi and his family . Aref Sharif and Al-Yunis are themselves Libyan regime figures . Any way everybody want to be Master of free -LRB- OIL -RRB- dom ... but they forget that is only one president can be in one country . You can see on this map -LRB- down -RRB- only Libya is free ... I can not understund why somebody want to be Lord of the world ? What is necessary and the time is enough for human life ?

TODAY Libya will be ruined , and Libyan oil wii be CAPTURED , and tomorrow the target of aggression can become any other State . Open letter from Russian doctors in Libya to President of the Russian Federation from citizens of Ukraine , Belarus and Russia , working and living in Libya March 24 , 2011 , Tripoli , Libya Dear Mr Medvedev and Vladimir Putin , Citizens of the former Soviet Union refer to you . Today we are citizens of different Slavonic countries -- Ukraine , Belarus and Russia . Despite this , we all believe that Russia is a successor to the USSR and is the ONLY protector of interests of our countries and security of our citizens . Therefore , we call to you for help and justice . It s clearly an outrageous AGGRESSION of the USA and NATO against the SOVEREIGN STATE Libya . And if anyone has doubts , it s clear for us , because all this is happening beneath our eyes , and the actions of U.S. and NATO threaten lives of not only Libyan civilians , but of all human beings on Lybian territory . We are outraged by the barbaric bombing of Libya , which is currently carried out by coalition of U.S. and NATO . The bombings of Tripoli and other cities in Libya are aimed not only on military targets and Libyan army , but on civilian infrastructure as well . Today , 24 March 2011 , NATO and U.S. aircraft were bombing a suburb of Tripoli -- Tajura -LRB- where , in particular , is Libya 's Nuclear Research Centre -RRB- trough all night and early afternoon . Air Defense and Air Force facilities in Tajura were destroyed during the first 2 days of air strikes . There are much more military facilities in the city but today Libyan army barracks were targeted . Moreover there is a high density inhabited area around it . Air strikes also damaged the largest Libyan Heart Surgery Centre . Civilians and doctors could not imagine that residential areas will be attacked by fire as well , so none of the residents or hospital patients was evacuated . Bombs and missiles struck residential houses , some dropped near the hospital . The windows in the Cardiac Centre building were shuttered , and the wall and part of the roof of the building of the maternity ward for pregnant women with heart disease collapsed . This lead to a ten miscarriages , the women are now in intensive care , doctors are fighting for their lives . We and our colleagues are working seven days a week to save people . A consequence of falling bombs and missiles in residential buildings is dozens of deaths and injuries , which are now being treated by our doctors . Enormous number of killed and injured only for one day . By the way those horrible figures are much higher than during all the riots all together . And this is being called `` protecting the civilian population '' ? With full responsibility as witnesses and participants of what is happening , we state that it is a genocide carried out by the United States and its allies against the Libyan people -- as it already happened in Yugoslavia , Afghanistan and Iraq . These are crimes against humanity , carried out by coalition forces are similar to those committed by fathers and grandfathers of today 's Western leaders and their henchmen in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan and in Dresden in Germany , where civilians were also killed for seeding terror , to break the will of the people to resist -LRB- Germany remembers it , and therefore refused to participate in the new mayhem -RRB- . Today they want to make the Libyan people to give up their leader and the legitimate government and calmly surrender their national wealth to the countries of the coalition We understand that appealing to the `` international community '' to save the people of Libya and us living in Libya , is useless .

You will be a slave to the Great Investing Cartels of the West , as we all are . Here in Greece , in a beautiful touristic area where I live , the Foreign companies -LRB- with Roth ... d hands in them -RRB- have gained the government approval to dig for gold in a place near to the source of the only river in the area . It has been proven by the scientists and the doctors that this could be highly dangerous for the area , because of high % of Arsenic , Cyanide and Sulfur that are released in the area . But because those cartels are financing both political parties that hold the majority of seats in the parliament , and the scientist get paid to shut up , we are now facing something that could destroy our water supply , agriculture , honey production and tourism . And that for only about 1.5 t. of gold they believe they can extract . What do you think they have in store for you with so much oil ? Oh , and the reason I did n't finish the name of one of the investors , is that one men dared to state the name of the Mining company in connection with the potential danger , and got sued for it , they are now asking him to pay 1.000.000,00 EUR as a fine !!!!

If you were in Libya doing this , you would be kidnapped , tortured , raped and killed or just shot outright . I know this is true because I live in Benghazi , Libya . I am not in Benghazi now or I would n't be able to write this . There is no internet allowed in Libya except for a minority of people who have some very unusual resources . I grew up in America and I was taught that Americans believe that the rights and freedoms that they enjoy are universal and all the people of the world should have the same rights and freedoms . Now in Libya , very brave people have stood up to a dictator who has ruled them mercilessly for over 40 years . These people have been threatened by their government to be hunted out inch by inch , house by house , room by room , alley by alley and person by person and destroyed because they are rats and germs . Last March 19th this despot very nearly carried out this threat against Benghazi , but the coallition led by France , Britian and America stepped in and prevented a massacre . Right now many other cities in Libya are under heavy artillary fire by Ghaddafi 's forces . Men , women and children are being killed and injured every day . The people in Libya are begging for NATO air strikes against these forces . The oil fields of Msala and Sireer were completely destroyed today by missiles from columns of tanks . There are many ancient sites in Libya some UNESCO world heritage sites . Will NATO be there if Ghaddafi decides to destroy them ? The people in Libya are being shot with the same weapons which should be used to protect them . These weapons were bought and paid for with the wealth of the nation that should have been used for the benefit of the people . Libya has no defensive army . It has instead a highly armed `` palace guard '' designed to protect Muammar Ghaddafi and his family . Neither American or Libyan people want American solders on the ground in Libya . What the pro-democracy fighters in Libya do need is some support form NATO and training and weapons . The United States is very good at verbally encouraging the spread of democracy and condemning the abuse of human rights . In Libya right now , The United States has a unique opportunity to prove that it can do more than just talk the talk . The pro-democracy movement in Libya is grass-roots and genuine . Libya is an example for other governments in the region who repress their people . If the Libyan people are not given support in real tangible ways , like air strikes and weapons , other dictators will be confirmed in their beliefs that all The United States does is talk . But , if America gives the pro-democracy fighters real support now , it will prove that America is more than just talk . America walks the walk , America stands behind the pretty words about freedom , democracy and human rights . I am proud of my Libyan brothers and sisters fighting for freedom . I hope that I can be proud of my American brothers and sisters for standing behind what they believe and doing what should be done when it counts . April 4 , 2011 at 6:41 pm | Reply Genocide or Armed Civil War Unlike all ongoing mass popular Arab uprisings , the Libyan conflict began as an armed insurrection , directed at seizing power by force . Unlike the autocratic rulers of Egypt and Tunisia , Gaddafi has secured a mass regional base among a substantial sector of the Libyan population . This support is based on the fact that almost two generations of Libyans have benefited from Gaddafi s petroleum-financed welfare , educational , employment and housing programs , none of which existed under America s favorite , King Idris . Since violence is inherent in any armed uprising , once one picks up the gun to seize power , they lose their claim on civil rights . In armed civil conflicts , civil rights are violated on all sides . Regardless of the Western media s lurid portrayal of Gaddafi s African mercenary forces and its more muted approval of revolutionary justice against Gaddafi supporters and government soldiers captured in the rebel strongholds , the rules of warfare should have come into play , including the protection of non-combatants-civilians -LRB- including government supporters and officials -RRB- , as well as protection of Libyan prisoners of war in the areas under NATO-rebel control . The unsubstantiated Euro-US claim of genocide amplified by the mass media and parroted by left spokespersons is contradicted by the daily reports of single and double digit deaths and injuries , resulting from urban violence on both sides , as control of cities and towns shifts between the two sides . Truth is the first casualty of war , and especially of civil war . Both sides have resorted to monstrous fabrications of victories , casualties , monsters and victims . Demons and angels aside , this conflict began as a civil war between two sets of Libyan elites : An established paternalistic , now burgeoning neo-liberal , autocracy with substantial popular backing versus a western imperialist financed and trained elite , backed by an amorphous group of regional , tribal and clerical chiefs , monarchists and neo-liberal professionals devoid of democratic and nationalist credentials and lacking broad-based mass support .

April 4 , 2011 at 7:40 pm | Reply This is an appeal from the Libyan citizens both inside and outside Libya . We are deeply concerned about the current situation in Libya and the war crimes and atrocities that have been committed by the Gaddafi fascist regime since February 15 , 2011 . INTERPOL-UN Special Notices are designed to allow INTERPOL to assist the UN directly in making its sanctions effective . Since the Gaddafi regime has lost its legitimacy as the representative of the Libyan people , we urge you to express your solidarity with the Libyan citizens and abide by the UN Security Council resolution and INTERPOL that forbids aiding and abetting this criminal regime . The citizens of Libya urge you to : Discontinue the broadcasting of all of the Gaddafi regime s satellite channels , in particular the Jamahirya satellite channel , and alshababia that are being broadcast by your satellites because it is mainly broadcast lies , threats , promote hatred , and genocide . The illegitimate Gaddafi regime has been using your satellite services to spread its terror propaganda to the Libyans citizens and people around the world . Furthermore , there have been reports from Libya that coded messages have been disseminated to Gaddafi s mercenaries and security forces via Al-Jamahirya satellite TV channel . It is imperative for us -LRB- the Libyans -RRB- to notify all organizations\\/companies that are providing communication logistics for the survival of this fascist regime that their continued support is a violation of the UN resolution .

April 5 , 2011 at 1:16 pm | Reply According to some news items , arming supporters of the Transitional National Council to counter the violence against civilians is considered a legal possibility by some of the coalition . Such legality is debatable in light of point 9 in Resolution 1970 concerning the arms embargo on Libyan Arab Jamahiriya . So , if there are any dissenting voices coming from any of the UN Member States over providing arms to the regime s opponents , I would say it is time for the United Nations to clarify what is meant by an arms embargo on Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , and have member states vote again on a reworded resolution . In view of past humanitarian disasters , I think it is vital that nobody in the coalition proceed with action where its legality is debatable .

Libya has been accused of having committed numerous acts of terrorism in the past , but many of these have been perpetrated by foreign intelligence agencies as false flag operations -- the Lockerbie bombing being a prime example . The report represents a severe blow to the attempts by Washington and its NATO allies , backed by the overwhelming majority of the Western media , to dismiss the Libyan government s claims of civilian casualties as propaganda and portray the continuous air raids as a humanitarian defense of the population . The so-called humanitarian air raids have taken the lives of dozens of civilians in various areas of Tripoli , Bishop Giovanni Innocenzo Martinelli , the Apostolic Vicar of Tripoli told Agenzia Fides , the Vatican news service . Of particular concern , in the district of Buslim , a building collapsed because of the bombing killing 40 people , he said Yesterday I reported that the bombing had affected some hospitals , albeit indirectly . I can now confirm that one of these hospitals is in Misda , a town about 110 miles south of Tripoli . The Euronews television channel reported that a bombing raid on an ammunition dump in Misda had caused damage to the hospital and nearby homes , wounding at least 13 civilians .

Not only did the CIA set up the LNA but they created a training camp in Virginia where members of the group were taught counter-insurgency and destabilization tactics by the U.S. government . A spokesman for the counter-revolutionary rebel grouping , Colonel Ahmed Bani , told Reuters in Benghazi on March 24 that Hefta would head the rebel army .

April 5 , 2011 at 9:18 am | Reply unsoundness , what madness are you talkking about ? do you mean this : How was Libya doing under the rule of Gadaffi ? How bad did the people have it ? Were they oppressed as we now commonly accept as fact ? Let us look at the facts for a moment . Before the chaos erupted , Libya had a lower incarceration rate than the Czech republic . Libya had the lowest infant mortality rate of all of Africa . Libya had the highest life expectancy of all of Africa . Less than 5 % of the population was undernourished . In response to the rising food prices around the world , the government of Libya abolished ALL taxes on food . People in Libya were rich . Libya had the highest gross domestic product -LRB- GDP -RRB- at purchasing power parity -LRB- PPP -RRB- per capita of all of Africa . The government took care to ensure that everyone in the country shared in the wealth . Libya had the highest Human Development Index of any country on the continent . The wealth was distributed equally . In Libya , a lower percentage of people lived below the poverty line than in the Netherlands . How does Libya get so rich ? The answer is oil . The country has a lot of oil , and does not allow foreign corporations to steal the resources while the population starves , unlike countries like Nigeria , a country that is basically run by Shell .

April 5 , 2011 at 10:37 am | Reply If not to prevent genocide , grab the oil or promote democracy -LRB- via Patriot missiles -RRB- , what then is the driving force behind the Euro-US imperial intervention ? A clue is in the selectivity of Western military intervention : In Bahrain , Saudi Arabia , Yemen , Jordan , Qatar and Oman ruling autocrats , allied with and backed by Euro-US imperial states go about arresting , torturing and murdering unarmed urban protestors with total impunity . In Egypt and Tunisia , the US is backing a conservative junta of self-appointed civil-military elites in order to block the profound democratic and nationalist transformation of society demanded by the protesters . The junta aims to push through neo-liberal economic reforms through carefully-vetted pro-Western elected officials . While liberal critics may accuse the West of hypocrisy and double standards in bombing Gaddafi but not the Gulf butchers , in reality the imperial rulers consistently apply the same standards in each region : They defend strategic autocratic client regimes , which have allowed imperial states to build strategic air force and naval bases , run regional intelligence operations and set up logistical platforms for their ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as their future planned conflict with Iran . They attack Gaddafi s Libya precisely because Gaddafi had refused to actively contribute to Western military operations in Africa and the Middle East . The key point is that while Libya allows the biggest US-European multi-nationals to plunder its oil wealth , it did not become a strategic geo-political-military asset of the empire . As we have written in many previous essays the driving force of US empire-building is military -- and not economic . This is why billions of dollars of Western economic interests and contracts had been sacrificed in the setting up of sanctions against Iraq and Iran with the costly result that the invasion and occupation of Iraq shut down most oil exploitation for over a decade . The Washington-led assault on Libya , with the majority of air sorties and missiles strikes being carried out by the Obama regime , is part of a more general counter-attack in response to the most recent Arab popular pro-democracy movements . The West is backing the suppression of these pro-democracy movements throughout the Gulf ; it finances the pro-imperial , pro-Israel junta in Egypt and it is intervening in Tunisia to ensure that any new regime is correctly aligned . It supports a despotic regime in Algeria as well as Israel s daily assaults on Gaza . In line with this policy , the West backs the uprising of ex-Gaddafites and right-wing monarchists , confident that the liberated Libya will once again provide military bases for the US-European military empire-builders .

April 5 , 2011 at 9:36 am | Reply what gives me the right ? education : How was Libya doing under the rule of Gadaffi ? How bad did the people have it ? Were they oppressed as we now commonly accept as fact ? Let us look at the facts for a moment . Before the chaos erupted , Libya had a lower incarceration rate than the Czech republic . Libya had the lowest infant mortality rate of all of Africa . Libya had the highest life expectancy of all of Africa . Less than 5 % of the population was undernourished . In response to the rising food prices around the world , the government of Libya abolished ALL taxes on food . People in Libya were rich . Libya had the highest gross domestic product -LRB- GDP -RRB- at purchasing power parity -LRB- PPP -RRB- per capita of all of Africa . The government took care to ensure that everyone in the country shared in the wealth . Libya had the highest Human Development Index of any country on the continent . The wealth was distributed equally . In Libya , a lower percentage of people lived below the poverty line than in the Netherlands . How does Libya get so rich ? The answer is oil . The country has a lot of oil , and does not allow foreign corporations to steal the resources while the population starves , unlike countries like Nigeria , a country that is basically run by Shell .

The report represents a severe blow to the attempts by Washington and its NATO allies , backed by the overwhelming majority of the Western media , to dismiss the Libyan government s claims of civilian casualties as propaganda and portray the continuous air raids as a humanitarian defense of the population . The so-called humanitarian air raids have taken the lives of dozens of civilians in various areas of Tripoli , Bishop Giovanni Innocenzo Martinelli , the Apostolic Vicar of Tripoli told Agenzia Fides , the Vatican news service . Of particular concern , in the district of Buslim , a building collapsed because of the bombing killing 40 people , he said Yesterday I reported that the bombing had affected some hospitals , albeit indirectly . I can now confirm that one of these hospitals is in Misda , a town about 110 miles south of Tripoli . April 5 , 2011 at 5:32 am | Reply Libyan civilians are being killed Not by gadafi but the US . Despite this , we all believe that it is Russia as successor to the USSR , which is our SOLE safeguard for the interests of our countries and the security of our citizens . Therefore , we appeal to you for help and justice . Today , there is blatant external aggression of USA and NATO against a sovereign country Libya . And if anyone can doubt this , then we say this obvious fact is well known , because all this is happening before our eyes , and the actions of U.S. and NATO threaten the lives of not only the citizens of Libya , but to us who are on its territory . We are outraged by the barbaric bombing of Libya , which is currently carried out by a coalition of U.S. and NATO . The bombing of Tripoli and other cities in Libya is aimed not only at the objects of air defense and Libya s Air Force and not only against the Libyan army , but also the object of military and civilian infrastructure . Today , 24 March 2011 , NATO aircraft and the U.S. all night and all morning bombed a suburb of Tripoli Tajhura -LRB- where , in particular , is Libya s Nuclear Research Center -RRB- . Air Defense and Air Force facilities in Tajhura were destroyed back in the first 2 days of strikes and more active military facilities in the city remained , but today the object of bombing are barracks of the Libyan army , around which are densely populated residential areas , and next to it the largest in Libya s Heart Centers . Civilians and the doctors could not assume that common residential quarters will be about to become destroyed , so none of the residents or hospital patients was evacuated . Bombs and rockets struck residential houses and fell near the hospital . The glass of the Cardiac Center building was broken , and in the building of the maternity ward for pregnant women with heart disease a wall collapsed and part of the roof . This resulted in ten miscarriages whereby babies died , the women are in intensive care , doctors are fighting for their lives . Our colleagues and we are working seven days a week , to save people . This is a direct consequence of falling bombs and missiles in residential buildings resulting in dozens of deaths and injuries , which are operated and reviewed now by our doctors . Such a large number of wounded and killed , as during today , did not result during the total of all the riots in Libya . And this is called protecting the civilian population ? With full responsibility as witnesses and participants of what is happening , we state that the United States and its allies are thus carrying out genocide against the Libyan people as was the case in Yugoslavia , Afghanistan and Iraq . Crimes against humanity , carried out by coalition forces akin to those crimes committed by the fathers and grandfathers of today s Western leaders and their henchmen in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan and in Dresden in Germany , where civilians were also being destroyed in order to deter , to break the will of the people to resist -LRB- Germany remembers it , and therefore refused to participate in this new slaughterhouse -RRB- . Today they want in such ways to make the Libyan people surrender their leader and the legitimate government and meekly lay down their national oil wealth for the countries of the coalition . We understand that applying to the international community to save the people of Libya and we were living in Libya , is useless . Our only hope is Russia that has the right of veto in the UN , and specifically its leaders the President and the Prime Minister . We still hope for you , as hoped in the past , when we took the decision to stay in Libya , and to help its people , medical duty playing its role in the first place . After an abortive coup attempt in late February , the situation calmed down in Libya and the government had successfully restored order . To everyone in Libya , it was clear that without American intervention the country would soon return to normal life . Convinced that Russia , which has veto power , would not allow the aggression of the United States and its allies , we decided to stay in Libya , but were mistaken : Russia , unfortunately , believed the false assurances of Americans and did not oppose the criminal decision of France and the U.S. US-NATO air strikes on Tripoli and other Libyan cities have claimed growing numbers of civilian victims , according to the Vatican s top representative in the Libyan capital . The report represents a severe blow to the attempts by Washington and its NATO allies , backed by the overwhelming majority of the Western media , to dismiss the Libyan government s claims of civilian casualties as propaganda and portray the continuous air raids as a humanitarian defense of the population . The so-called humanitarian air raids have taken the lives of dozens of civilians in various areas of Tripoli , Bishop Giovanni Innocenzo Martinelli , the Apostolic Vicar of Tripoli told Agenzia Fides , the Vatican news service . Of particular concern , in the district of Buslim , a building collapsed because of the bombing killing 40 people , he said Yesterday I reported that the bombing had affected some hospitals , albeit indirectly . I can now confirm that one of these hospitals is in Misda , a town about 110 miles south of Tripoli . The Euronews television channel reported that a bombing raid on an ammunition dump in Misda had caused damage to the hospital and nearby homes , wounding at least 13 civilians . In an interview with Euronews , Bishop Martinelli said that the scores of casualties had been confirmed to me by people who have lost loved ones because of these bombings . He cited another incident in which an air strike hit a munitions warehouse located in close proximity to a civilian neighborhood . This building was exploding for three , four hours , he said , claiming more victims . If it is true that the bombings appear to be very targeted , Martrinelli told the Fides news agency , it is also true that they are hitting military targets which are in the midst of civilian neighborhoods , thus the local people are also affected . The bishop added : The situation in Tripoli is becoming more difficult every day . The fuel shortage has worsened , as evidenced by the queues of cars at petrol stations . Describing the military conflict as an impasse , he urged a diplomatic solution to end the bloodshed between Libyans , giving Gaddafi a dignified way out . NATO , which formally assumed command of the US-led war against Libya Thursday , said it was investigating the reported casualties . Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard , the Canadian officer heading the NATO command in Libya , described the bishop s account as a news report and insisted that NATO was operating under very strict rules of engagement and within the legal mandate of our United Nations mandate . Echoing similar statements issued by the NATO command in response to the continuous killing of civilians in Afghanistan , he added , I appreciate the source of this report , but it is worth noting that I take every one of those issues seriously . In a separate incident , the Associated Press interviewed the family of an 18-month-old toddler , Sirajuddin al-Sweisi , who was killed when an ammunition dump near their home in the village of Khorum , about 55 miles south of Tripoli , was attacked by US-NATO warplanes . The young boy s mother said that their house was rocked by the blast at about six in the morning , with debris piercing the wall of the family s home . She found her son , who was sleeping , with a piece of hot metal embedded into the side of his face . His blood was streaming down my arm , she said weeping . He was crying out , Mama , Mama , reaching out with his hand to me . The family rushed him to the hospital where he was treated for burns and broken bones , but he died the same night . Neighbors said that the explosions caused by the air raid injured a number of other people and damaged houses in the area . Washington and its allies have claimed legitimacy for their imperialist assault on Libya by invoking United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 , which authorizes all necessary measures to protect civilians from attack . It has become increasingly evident that these measures include the slaughter of the very civilians that are supposedly being protected .

Airstrikes hit several rebel vehicles and killed at least 13 rebel fighters , spokesmen for the Libyan opposition said Saturday . Seven others were wounded . NATO was investigating the incident , a spokeswoman said Saturday . `` NATO takes any reports of civilian casualties very seriously , but exact details are hard to verify as we have no reliable sources on the ground , '' NATO 's Oana Lungescu said . `` Clearly , if someone fires at one of our aircraft , of course they have the right to defend themselves . '' Rebel spokesman Abdul Hafiz Ghoga said opposition fighters had retaken al-Brega after a night of heavy fighting with Moammar Gadhafi 's forces . But it was not immediately clear who commanded control Saturday of the coastal city that has now changed hands six times in as many weeks under the dramatically shifting circumstances of the Libyan war . Meanwhile , in Misrata , east of Tripoli , two mortars landed at a medical clinic Saturday evening , causing one death and numerous injuries , said a medical official with the city 's main hospital . The doctor , who was not identified for security reasons , told CNN the clinic that was attacked had evacuated patients because of recent attacks , but was being guarded by opposition `` fighters and young people . '' One person was killed and 15 injured , said the doctor , who was caring for the wounded . Five had serious injuries , including head and chest trauma , he said . Forces loyal to Gadhafi showed no signs of backing down after officials spurned an opposition cease-fire proposal . Government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told reporters in Tripoli on Friday that rebels were not `` really serious '' about the offer , which he said included `` silly conditions . '' `` They are asking us to withdraw from our own cities and open our cities to people , who are holding up arms , who are tribal , violent , no unified leadership , al Qaeda links , and no one knows who they are . If this is not mad , then I do n't know what it is , '' he said . `` We will not leave our cities . We will not stop protecting our civilians . '' His comments came after Libyan opposition leader Mustafa Abdul Jalil laid out cease-fire conditions that included freedom of expression for the Libyan people and the removal of snipers , mercenaries and militias from western cities . Ultimately , he said , the opposition 's goal remains regime change in Libya . Ghoga sought to clarify the opposition 's position Saturday . `` There is no , and was no , negotiation on a cease-fire with Colonel Gaddafi 's dictatorship , '' he said at a Bengahzi news conference . He repeated the opposition demands that Gadhafi halt all military action , end the sieges laid on cities like Misrata and allow free speech and assembly . Sources close to Gadhafi told CNN that political solutions are still possible but that the Libyan leader would relinquish power only to others within his inner circle . They said there is still time for dialogue but expressed doubts about who would represent the opposition . Any transition , they said , would involve Gadhafi 's second son , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , and for such a transition to take place there would first have to be an end to the fighting . The Libyan sources told CNN that for now , Gadhafi remains confident the regime can withstand any challenge from the rebels . U.S. officials claim Gadhafi 's military capabilities have been steadily eroded since the onset of U.N.-sanctioned airstrikes . The dictator 's forces , however , still outnumber rebels by about 10 to 1 in terms of armor and other ground forces , according to Navy Adm. Mike Mullen , the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman .

In two telephone interviews with CNN 's `` AC360 , '' al-Obeidy spoke about her alleged abuse . At times in tears , at other times defiant , she recalled men pouring alcohol into her eyes and repeatedly using rifles to sodomize her . Al-Obeidy said has since been stopped trying to leave Libya and that she has nightmares . `` My life is in danger , and I call on all human rights organization ... to expose the truth and to let me leave now . I am being held hostage here , '' she said . `` They have threatened me with death and told me I will never leave prison again , if I go to the journalists or tell them anything about what 's happening in Tripoli . '' Al-Obeidy said she spent 72 hours under interrogation after being dragged away from the Tripoli hotel where she tried to tell journalists about her alleged abuse . Interrogators poured water on her face and threw food at her during the relentless questioning , which ended only after she was examined by a doctor to prove she had been raped , al-Obeidy said . `` And when the test came , it verified that I was raped and tortured ... then I was freed . '' She said the public statements from a state TV anchor and government officials , who initially called her mentally ill , drunk and a prostitute , have ruined her reputation . Al-Obeidy said her spirits and morale are low and that she has nightmares now . `` They did not give me a chance to respond , '' she said . The attempt to discredit al-Obeidy as a promiscuous , un-Islamic woman ties into the idea of sexual shaming in a conservative Muslim society where it 's commonly believed that a woman who has been raped has lost her honor , said Mona Eltahawy , a columnist on Arab and Muslim issues . Woman alleges rape by Gadhafi forces Libyan woman speaks out about rape For a woman in such a society to come forward to claim she has been raped is no small thing . `` No one would do that unless they were raped , and especially in a conservative society , '' Eltahawy told CNN . Al-Obeidy burst into the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli on March 26 while international journalists staying there were having breakfast . She told reporters she had been taken from a checkpoint east of Tripoli , held against her will for two days and raped by 15 men . `` They had my hands tied behind me , and they had my legs tied , and they would hit me , while I was tied and bite me in my body . And they would pour alcohol in my eyes so that I would not be able to see and they would sodomize me with their rifles , and they would not let us go to the bathroom . We were not allowed to eat or drink , '' she told CNN 's `` AC360 , '' speaking through a translator . `` One man would leave and another would enter . He would finish and then another man would come in , '' al-Obeidy said . She said another woman being held captive was able to untie her hands and feet , allowing al-Obeidy to escape . When CNN saw her in March , al-Obeidy 's legs and face were bruised and she had blood on her right inner thigh . Her visible injuries appeared to support her allegations , but CNN could not independently verify her story . Government officials tried to subdue her , scuffling with reporters in the process and eventually dragged her away . Al-Obeidy said she is no longer in government custody and has spent time with her sister . But she said she can not leave the house where she is staying as officials from the police or army will pursue her . She said that when she tries to leave the house , officials chase her down and take her to a police station . But police do n't know what to do with her since she is not charged with a crime , and she is released . Al-Obeidy said she has been abducted by Gadhafi forces three times -- the first time from the hotel , the second time when she tried to escape to Tunisia last week and a third time on Sunday . She said the abduction Sunday and accompanying threats were an effort to prevent her from taking her complaints to a police investigations unit . In spite of the danger , al-Obeidy said the most important thing to her is that her voice reaches the world . `` I would like to direct a word to all the people watching us in America that we are a peaceful people and we are not members of al Qaeda . We are a simple people and moderate Muslims -- not extremists -- and we are not asking for anything expect for our freedom and dignity and the most basic human rights which are denied to us , '' she said . Her father said Monday he has still not spoken to his daughter and begged the international community to come to her aid . `` What is happening to her is wrong . What can I do ? I have no power to do anything . I urge the human rights organizations and all international humanitarian movements to get involved and help us , '' said Atiq Al-Obeidy .

The deadly battles in Libya forged ahead Sunday as pro-government forces shelled a medical clinic in the city of Misrata , killing one person and wounding 15 others , a hospital source said . The source , a doctor who was not identified for security reasons , told CNN two people were injured by an initial mortar blast . The rest of the injured were wounded by a second mortar blast when they went to the scene of the first attack to help victims . Zakaria debriefs former Libyan jihadi Mourning a voice for freedom One of the injured is a 14-year-old child who suffered a fractured skull and is in a coma , the doctor said Sunday . The clinic that was attacked had evacuated patients because of recent attacks , said another doctor at a Misrata hospital that received the patients . But it was being guarded by opposition `` fighters and young people '' who were injured . Elsewhere in the city , the sound of heavy shelling was heard coming from the port area , a resident said . He said troops supporting Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi surrounded the city , with snipers perched on rooftops of buildings . Misrata 's port is under the control of the rebels and is considered the main site of aid for the people in the embattled city . A bombing in the port area could prevent aid ships from reaching Misrata . Sunday 's events are the latest in the struggle between forces loyal to Gadhafi and opposition members seeking an end to his nearly 42-year rule . Rebel fighters retreated east of the oil town al-Brega on Sunday . Fighters said there was some sort of ambush , they saw roadside mines and they needed to get more ammunition . They regrouped about 30 to 35 kilometers -LRB- 181\\/2 to 22 miles -RRB- east of al-Brega . NATO is leading international military operations in the country following a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing force and the enforcement of a no-fly zone to protect civilians . NATO airstrikes hit several rebel vehicles and killed at least 13 rebel fighters , spokesmen for the Libyan opposition said Saturday . Seven others were wounded . `` Based on the information we have , they -LRB- the opposition forces who were hit -RRB- heard the airstrikes and went ahead to see what the damage was , and that 's when they got hit , '' rebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah said . `` They were told to stay back , but they jumped the gun .

It was not immediately clear who had control of the coastal city , which has changed hands six times in as many weeks under the dramatically shifting circumstances of the Libyan war . A former Obama national security adviser said Sunday that the international coalition in Libya can not leave the country until Gadhafi leaves power . `` The problem is that while everybody wants to see Gadhafi leave , either be removed or leave on his own , that end state is not yet clear , '' Ret . Gen. Jim Jones said Sunday on CNN 's `` State of the Union . '' `` Unfortunately most people want perfect clarity in a situation where clarity does n't really exist yet .

The rebels have been hampered by a lack of organization and training on heavy weaponry when confronting the better-trained , better-armed forces of Gadhafi , who is under investigation for alleged crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court .

An opposition officer in al-Brega said Monday that rebel forces had the oil town surrounded from the north , east and west and had been bombarding the area with rockets for much of the afternoon . Maj. Miftah Omar Hamzah told CNN that 50 carloads of loyalist forces remained in al-Brega , but he insisted that the Gadhafi troops were on the defensive . New al-Brega , a suburban area of the homes of workers at a nearby oil refinery , was partially under rebel control . Opposition officers said they were still clearing the area of Gadhafi forces , and a resident fleeing the area told CNN that it is still unsafe . There have been no NATO airstrikes in the area for at least 24 hours , he said . The perceived lack of airstrikes enforcing a U.N. resolution to protect civilians from Gadhafi 's forces and enforce an arms embargo brought criticism from a rebel spokesman on Monday . `` You are supposed to be implementing this resolution and clearly it 's not implemented in Misrata , it 's not implemented in Zintan or Zahwiya , and we 're wondering where are they ? '' In Misrata , destruction permeated the city , which has been choked off by pro-Gadhafi forces . Rebels , Gadhafi forces clash in oil town Wounded treated on hospital ship The battle for medical aid in Libya How Libyan government treats media An opposition councilman in Misrata told CNN that a tank entered the outskirts of the city about 3 a.m. Monday and headed for the port area . Opposition fighters descended on the area and fought for two hours to force the tank to turn back , which it eventually did , the councilman said . The councilman said he could hear NATO jets flying overhead Monday afternoon for the first time in 36 hours . `` We need a lot of help in Misrata . There 's so much death there , '' said Mustafa Abdul Hamali , a 46-year-old taxi driver who lost half a leg . `` I was driving in my car with my wife , and my car just blew up . I do n't know what happened . '' On Monday , British Foreign Secretary William Hague ruled out his country from arming the rebels but said it would provide them telecommunications equipment , given the urgent need on the ground . `` We are prepared to supply nonlethal equipment which will help with the protection of civilian lives and the delivery of humanitarian aid , '' he said . Libyan rebels have been hampered by a lack of organization and training on heavy weaponry when confronting the better-trained , better-armed forces of Gadhafi , who is under investigation for alleged crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court . `` We were fighting with light weapons , but they had so much more , '' said Khalid Moteridi , 32 , a businessman who was fighting with the rebels when , he said , he was shot twice in the legs by a sniper . `` Artillery , mortars , rocket-propelled grenades , anti-tank rockets -- that 's how they were fighting back . '' While Hague 's statement seemed to rule out the United Kingdom from arming the rebels , U.S. officials have yet to say whether they will do so . Both countries participated in airstrikes to weaken Gadhafi 's military resources before NATO officially took command of the international operation . Due to poor weather conditions in recent days , the United States approved a request by NATO to extend the use of some U.S. strike aircraft , NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said Sunday . `` This is a short-term extension , which expires on Monday , '' Lungescu said . Moteridi said the situation in Misrata has turned dire . `` It 's a tragedy by all means , '' he said . `` No electricity , no food , no water . We 're trapped from all sides by the Gadhafi forces . '' A doctor in Misrata told CNN that government forces shelled a clinic , leaving one dead and 15 injured Sunday . Last week , a hospital official said 398 people have been killed since the Libyan conflict began last month . He feared there were more deaths that his hospital did n't know about . Diplomatic efforts to end the crisis seemed no closer to success Monday . Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini on Monday said proposals outlined by an envoy whom Gadhafi sent to Greece were `` not credible '' and said his country would become the third to recognize the rebel Libyan National Transitional Council as the legitimate international representative of Libya . France and Qatar previously granted the rebel council similar status . The nature of the message delivered by Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelati Obeidi was not immediately known . `` From what the Libyan envoy said , it is clear that the administration is looking for a solution , '' Greek Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas said after the meeting . He said Obeidi is expected to continue talks in Turkey and Malta . Some rebels from Misrata got a bit of a reprieve Sunday when a Turkish hospital ship picked up more than 300 of the wounded fighters . Their injuries included amputated limbs , broken bones and shrapnel wounds . The ship is destined for the Turkish port of Cesme , where the patients will receive medical attention , opposition officials said . It made a stop in the rebel capital of Benghazi to pick up more patients and supplies , and was greeted by cheering supporters of the opposition . Men wearing head bandages and eye patches waved back at the crowd . West of Benghazi , the tug-of-war for control continued in al-Brega , which has changed hands six times in six weeks between government and opposition forces . Rebel fighters retreated east of al-Brega on Sunday , reporting an ambush , roadside mines and a need for more ammunition . Over the weekend , opposition spokesmen said 13 rebels were killed when NATO airstrikes hit several vehicles . `` Based on the information we have , they -LRB- the opposition forces who were hit -RRB- heard the airstrikes and went ahead to see what the damage was , and that 's when they got hit , '' rebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah said . `` They were told to stay back , but they jumped the gun . '' Lungescu , the NATO spokeswoman , said Saturday that NATO was investigating the incident . `` NATO takes any reports of civilian casualties very seriously , but exact details are hard to verify , as we have no reliable sources on the ground , '' she said . Despite the unyielding conflict , Moteridi , the rebel fighter who was shot twice in the legs by a sniper , said he wo n't give up . `` I 'll go back to Misrata when I get better , God willing , and ... Gadhafi and his gangs will be defeated .

Situations in both Libya and Ivory Coast have prompted international intervention Some analysts say Libya is more of a strategic priority for West because of oil U.S. involvement seen unlikely , as Obama struggles to sell intervention to jaded public -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Violence is escalating in the west African nation of Ivory Coast , where president-elect Alassane Ouattara is trying to oust incumbent Laurent Gbagbo , who refused to leave office after losing an election . But the international response -- limited to a U.N. peacekeeping force already deployed there -- has paled by comparison with the U.S. and NATO air strikes targeting forces to Moammar Gadhafi in Libya to prevent attacks on rebels and civilians . Ivory Coast : Search for justice Ivory Coast 's Gbagbo negotiating way out Reported massacre in Ivory Coast Are there any similarities to the situation in Libya ? Analysts say that there are sharp differences in the problems facing the two countries , with Ivory Coast 's problems evolving over a period of years before coming to a boil in recent weeks compared to Libya 's relatively recent turmoil . But , they say , there are humanitarian concerns over the violence in both countries . `` The two conflicts are very separate , but what is similar is the potential threat to the civilian population , '' says Phil Clark , a lecturer in Comparative and International Politics at London 's School of Oriental and African Studies , who points out that global intervention in both countries has been focused on protecting hundreds of thousands of people at risk rather than on regime change . But , says Gilles Yabi , a West Africa analyst with the International Crisis Group , the situation on the ground is vastly different with Gbagbo -- whom the United Nations and the United States have urged to stand down -- having no access to planes and helicopters like those initially deployed by Gadhafi . `` We have to be quite prudent about making comparisons , '' he said . What are the differences in international response ? Again there are similarities , with both situations prompting U.N. Security Council resolutions mandating international military intervention , albeit on different scales . In Libya , aircraft were deployed to attack Gadhafi 's air defenses and to protect opposition rebels and civilians from government troops . In Ivory Coast , extra troops were authorized earlier in the year increasing the size of the U.N. peacekeeping force to 11,000 , while France has dispatched 300 military personnel . Tom Cargill , an Africa expert at the Chatham House think tank , says U.N.-sanctioned air strikes in the Ivory Coast conflict are unlikely . `` The situation has moved quickly with the rebels moving into built up areas , so there has n't been time to get a mandate from the U.N. , but because they are in built-up areas , that kind of intervention probably wo n't be something air forces would consider . '' Analysts disagree on the reasons . Cargill says the two can not be compared since Ivory Coast has endured years of crisis and a sustained international engagement aimed at finding a political solution . Others like Clark point to more strategic factors , not least the fact that Western countries feel over-stretched by Libya and are unwilling to commit to the same level of action in Ivory Coast . `` I think Libya has in a sense acted as a kind of deterrent to collective action , '' says Knox Chitiyo , head of the Africa program at the UK 's Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies . `` In terms of escalation , -LRB- Ivory Coast -RRB- has been unfortunate in terms of timing , as the world 's attention has been focused on the Middle East and particularly Libya , so the Ivory Coast , which has been a slow-burning crisis , fell off the radar . '' Yes , say some analysts . As a major oil producer , Libya 's strategic significance is far greater than cocoa - and coffee-producing Ivory Coast , says Clark . Libya 's potential as an incubator for Middle Eastern democracy is also an attention-grabber for Western countries , he says . `` There is significant concern over Libya 's oil and what that would mean for Western strategic interest and there 's a sense that Libya fits into this wider pattern of democratization and the falling of draconian regimes in North Africa and the Middle East . '' Knox adds : `` Oil is seen by the West as a more strategic commodity than cocoa if we 're to be quite blunt . '' Is America likely to get involved in the same way it has in Libya ? No , says Knox , partly because as he has shown with Libya , President Barack Obama is unwilling to take a leading role in multinational intervention . But , he says , this is also because Obama would find it tough to convince a public disillusioned by America 's experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan , particularly given Ivory Coast 's perceived lack of strategic significance . `` We 've seen that Obama has had a real problem selling -LRB- intervention -RRB- to the U.S. audience , '' he said . Why is France so involved ? As Ivory Coast 's former colonial ruler , France not only has experience of working in the country but also appears to feel a duty to do so , pressing for Security Council action and dispatching troops . This , says Yabi , creates its own problems as Gbagbo uses the French presence for his own benefit . `` Anti-colonial discourse is one of Gbagbo 's political weapons and he is trying to resuscitate that rhetoric against France . '' Knox adds that France 's involvement points to a broader campaign by Paris to inject itself into the international arena , as punctuated by President Nicolas Sarkozy -LRB- who is seeking re-election next year -RRB- taking a lead role in urging military action in Libya .

Gen. Marc van Uhm said Tuesday . Rebel leaders have criticized NATO 's efforts in recent days , saying civilians and rebel forces in Misrata and elsewhere have suffered under hellish attacks from pro-Gadhafi forces , with little evidence of NATO air power overhead . `` I am extremely sorry to say this , but NATO truly disappointed us , '' said Gen. Abdul Fatah Younis , the opposition 's top military official . `` If NATO wanted to free Misrata , they could have done that a few days ago . '' Five people were killed and 24 wounded in Monday clashes between pro-Gadhafi forces and rebels in Misrata , two sources told CNN . Gadhafi 's sons floating a deal ? Libyan rebels forced to retreat Libyan woman speaks out about rape Alleged Libyan rape victim speaks out Residents have said Gadhafi troops had choked off the city from electricity and access to food . `` Every day , life is getting more and more difficult , '' said one resident , who is not being identified for safety reasons . `` There are long queues of people for bread and fuel . '' Some are not leaving their homes for days at a time , he added . `` There are snipers shooting at anything that moves , '' the resident said . `` They are controlling the main road leading to outside the city . '' Younis said NATO 's concerns about collateral damage are unfounded . `` The region where the Gadhafi forces are is not inhabited by civilians . Anyway , civilians are being killed every day , including children , women and elderly , '' he said . `` If NATO will wait another week , Misrata will be finished . No one will be left alive . Do they want to wait , and watch them die , and let this crime be a shameful disgrace for the international community forever ? '' Van Uhm , chief of allied operations at NATO , defended the organization 's efforts , saying warplanes under NATO command flew 58 strike missions Monday , firing weapons and striking pro-Gadhafi targets on 14 of them . He did not immediately have figures for previous days , but NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said the warplanes had conducted 334 strike sorties since taking command of the mission on March 23 . `` I think you can safely say the operational tempo continues unabated , '' she said . In addition to using human shields and hiding equipment in populated areas , pro-Gadhafi forces have begun abandoning heavy military equipment in favor of the same kinds of cars and light trucks the rebels travel in , making it even more difficult for pilots to distinguish rebel convoys from those carrying forces loyal to the regime , van Uhm said . Since the effort to enforce the U.N. resolution began in mid-March , airstrikes have taken out about 30 % of Gadhafi 's military capacity , van Uhm said . Monday 's airstrikes hit an active rocket launcher in al-Brega , an air defense installation and military vehicles near Misrata as well as ammunition storage facilities , van Uhm said . But Gadhafi 's forces appeared to have the upper hand Tuesday in renewed fighting in al-Brega , where rebel forces were staging a panicked retreat under intense artillery bombardment , according to CNN reporters in the area . The setback is the latest for a ragtag opposition that has struggled to maintain ground against the better-trained and - equipped Gadhafi forces , and it comes less than a day after rebel commanders said they had the longtime Libyan leader 's forces on the defensive in al-Brega . With no end to the war in sight , a source close to the country 's leadership said a Libyan envoy is floating the idea of Gadhafi passing his power to a son -- a notion rebel leaders deem merely cosmetic . Under the proposal , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , 38 , would help to usher in reform , the source said . However , Saif Gadhafi has become one of his father 's most outspoken defenders since the start of the unrest despite once being perceived as a leading reformer in the Libyan government . A proposal to shift power from Gadhafi to his second-oldest son is `` a ridiculous offer , '' said Ali Aujali , a former Libyan ambassador to the United States who now represents the Libyan opposition in Washington . `` Libyan people , they decided , and they will not go back at all -LRB- to -RRB- Gadhafi or any member of his family , '' Aujali said . `` His sons , they are killers -- they 're just like their father . '' Aujali said rebels are willing to offer Moammar Gadhafi and his family safe passage out of Libya in an exchange for an end to the fighting -- but that 's as far as their offer goes . Though Gadhafi has shown no signs of appeasing the opposition or relinquishing his power to anyone outside his family , cracks in his armor have surfaced . His longtime confidant and foreign minister , Moussa Koussa , recently fled to London and announced his resignation from the Libyan government . On Monday , the U.S. Treasury Department lifted the freeze on Koussa 's assets following his split from Gadhafi . On Tuesday , Deputy Foreign Minister Khalid Khaim confirmed reports that Abdelati Obeidi is the nation 's new foreign minister . Rebel spokesman Mustafa Gheriani said while the conflict persists , he remains hopeful for a revolution . `` I think the Gadhafi regime is crumbling from within , '' he said . `` I think if you look at history , people will always win , and I think victory will be ours .

She said she is still recovering physically from the alleged assault and displayed faded bruises and rope burn marks on her wrists , Robertson said . But , she told him , she is unable to leave Tripoli and be reunited with her family and faces abuse whenever she leaves her house , he said . The Libyan government is insisting on a review of the interview by a government representative before transmission . The review was scheduled Wednesday night , but an apparently imminent airstrike postponed the review until Thursday morning .

I could n't understand a word because she was crying . She even made me cry . '' The two women spoke on Tuesday . Al-Obeidy told her mother that a court employee pulled a weapon on her when she went to a courthouse . The 29-year-old law school graduate burst into a Tripoli hotel last month to tell her story to journalists . Authorities rushed her away from the hotel , but she is no longer in custody . Still , she told CNN 's `` AC360 '' Tuesday she fears for her safety in Tripoli , which she called a `` large prison .

Al-Obeidy said she spent 72 hours under interrogation after being dragged away from the Tripoli hotel where she tried to tell journalists about her alleged abuse . She has said the public statements from a state TV anchor and government officials , who initially called her mentally ill , drunk and a prostitute , have ruined her reputation .

Weldon to urge Gadhafi to step down , calls for cease-fire Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As rebel and pro-government forces in Libya maneuvered on the battlefield Wednesday , Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi urged U.S. President Barack Obama to end the NATO bombing of his war-torn country . Gadhafi made the appeal in a letter to the American president , a senior administration official said . But the official said there was `` nothing new '' in the letter , the thrust of which was an appeal for an end to the alliance 's air operations . It contained no offers to negotiate or step down , and the official said the administration is n't taking the note seriously . Gadhafi asked Obama to stop the `` unjust war against a small people of a developing country '' and said those in the opposition are terrorists and members of al Qaeda , the official said . `` We have been hurt more morally than physically because of what had happened against us in both deeds and words by you , '' Gadhafi wrote , according to the official . `` Despite all this you will always remain our son . '' The strongman expressed hope that Obama wins re-election next year , the official added . And he wrote that a democratic society can not be built through missiles and aircraft . `` You are a man who has enough courage to annul a wrong and mistaken action , '' the leader wrote to the president . NATO accused of not providing support CNN talks to Libyan opposition leader Libyan rebels prepare to export crude Inside the mind of Saif Gadhafi Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the NATO strikes will stop when Gadhafi steps down and leaves the country . `` I do n't think there is any mystery about what is expected from Mr. Gadhafi at this time , '' Clinton said . The letter came amid diplomatic , economic and military developments in Libya , which remains in a deadly stalemate as pro-Gadhafi forces battle opposition fighters demanding democracy and an end to Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year-rule . A British airstrike hit an oil field in the eastern Libyan town of Sarir on Wednesday , causing damage to a main pipeline , Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told reporters . A tanker carrying crude oil left the eastern Libyan port of Tobruk on Wednesday in what was the first known export of oil by the fledgling opposition during the conflict , a sign of optimism for them . Rebel fighters and pro-Gadhafi forces have been pushing back and forth between al-Brega and Ajdabiya , while residents in the western city of Misrata are spending their days in fear . Also Wednesday , ex-U.S. Rep. Curt Weldon , who met with Gadhafi within the past decade , paid a visit to the Libyan capital with a cease-fire plan and a clear message to the embattled ruler that he must step down . Weldon , speaking in an interview with CNN affiliate WPIX-TV in New York , said he planned to meet with Gadhafi and Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim . `` It 's a very solemn time because there 's so much at risk here , '' said Weldon , who led a congressional delegation to Libya in 2004 and is visiting Tripoli at Gadhafi 's invitation . Weldon is a Republican who represented a suburban Philadelphia district . `` I 'm here to tell him face to face it 's time for him to leave . It 's time for him to step down , allow the people to take over the government of this country . '' There 's been seesaw fighting between pro- and anti-Gadhafi troops between al-Brega and Ajdabiya , CNN 's Ben Wedeman reported . On Tuesday night , Gadhafi forces moved 40 kilometers -LRB- about 25 miles -RRB- from al-Brega to Ajdabiya , and then Wednesday , the rebels pushed them back 10 kilometers -LRB- six miles -RRB- . At one point , rebels let loose with barrage of rockets , and they were answered by artillery and mortars . `` It moves back and forth , '' Wedeman reported . A CNN team saw equipment the rebels did n't have before such as night-vision goggles and two Milan anti-tank missiles . Fighters said they obtained the missiles from the transitional government in Benghazi but did n't know their origin . Rebel leaders have criticized NATO 's mission to help protect civilians in recent days , saying residents in Misrata and elsewhere have suffered under horrific attacks from pro-Gadhafi forces with little evidence of NATO air power overhead . `` I am extremely sorry to say this , but NATO truly disappointed us , '' Gen.

NATO is operating under a Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect Libyan civilians . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is `` deeply concerned about the deterioriating situation facing civilians in Libyan cities under military attack , '' according to a statement . Conditions in Misrata are `` especially grave , '' the statement said , `` with reports of the use of heavy weapons to attack the city , where the population is trapped and unable , as a result of heavy shelling that has continued over several weeks , to receive basic supplies , including clean water , food and medicines . '' But residents in Misrata said this week that Gadhafi forces have trapped the city , with snipers shooting indiscriminately . Access to food has been hampered . `` Normal life is a luxury that we do n't have , '' one resident said . `` I have n't taken my family out for four weeks now . All schools are closed , my children did n't go to school since the 19th of February . All government offices are closed . Even dead people are buried without death certificates . '' After weeks of relentless fighting , a military victory for either side seems remote . A political or diplomatic solution might be the only way to end the crisis . Weldon said that in addition to his proposals for Gadhafi 's stepping down , a cease-fire on both sides and the withdrawal of government forces from key cities , he is calling for a halt in further advances by rebel forces ; the creation of a joint interim government run by Libya 's current prime minister and the opposition leader ; unfettered humanitarian access ; and the establishment of a parliamentary commission that would include U.S. , Middle Eastern , European and African politicians helping to establish a new parliament in Libya . As for the Gadhafi family , Weldon 's proposals also suggest a possible title for Gadhafi as honorary chairman of the African Union and allowing his second-oldest son , Saif , to stand in elections . On the economic front , the tanker with crude oil that left Tobruk was sailing to Qatar , where the oil will be refined , CNN confirmed . Final destination of the export is not known at this time . The civil war in Libya has severely curtailed oil exports from the North African nation , which produced some 1.6 million barrels per day last year . This move symbolizes the opposition 's intent to manage the country 's affairs . The U.S. Treasury has frozen more than $ 32 billion in assets held by Gadhafi and members of his regime . Asked whether the opposition should be able to have access to those funds , State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the United States `` is well aware there is an urgency , that the Transitional National Council does need funding if it 's to survive , and we 're looking at ways to assist that . '' But Toner said he did not know the status of the $ 32 billion .

Half -LRB- 50 % -RRB- say the United States and its allies made the right decision in conducting airstrikes in Libya , while 37 % say it was the wrong decision - a balance of opinion virtually unchanged from a week ago . `` However , despite President Obama 's speech to the nation explaining the justifications for military engagement last Monday , an increasing percentage say that the military action lacks a clear goal - 57 % today , up from 50 % a week ago . And by an overwhelming 66 % - to-25 % margin , most say they would oppose the U.S. and its allies sending arms and military supplies to the anti-government groups in Libya .

April 10 , 2011 at 1:16 pm | Mr Huskinson , I do not think that Americans owe it to the young Arabs to support their effort for freedom and a life beyond the criminal Gadaffi by supplying them with guns and bombs ! The Libyans themselves owe it to themselves . If you can tell me , will the Americans always be there to sort out for the Libyans whatever goes wrong in the future as it is surely to be ? And who designated America the global policeman ? America never learns from its past mistakes -- arming the mujaheddin in Afghanistan to fight out the Russians will leave to haunt you for ever . It is these same guns\\/arms that the terrorists -LRB- Bin Laden and co. -RRB- are using to kill and maim American servicemen & women on duty who are sent there to sure death . These deaths and injuries are destroying the lives of Americans . There are now hundreds if not thousands or widows and orphans courtesy of chauvinistic tendencies of some American leaders ! I can tell you , when the dust finally settles down and the fighting is over -LRB- whether Gadaffi is defeated or killed -RRB- , America and the West will still remain ENEMY NUMBER ONE OF EXTREMIST ARABS !! Arm the Libyans now , but remember , these arms will be used against you in future . Let the Libyans sort out their problem themselves . Some of the so called freedom fighters of today whom you want to support , were working with Gadaffi just yesterday ! The world can only justifiably give out moral and humanitarian support to Libyans , BUT NOT ARMS ! April 7 , 2011 at 6:35 am | Reply It is precisely this kind of interference by the west that earns them the hatred of the arabs and others .

There are three weapon systems that are state-of-the-art -LRB- so much so they could turn things around in Misrata -RRB- . None of them is American . They can be smuggled in . Their inherent nature does n't lend itself to re-deployment anywhere against any US force anywhere they 'll be either used-up or cheaper variants are already readily available world-wide . Also , the general public should be aware that munitions and ordnance have a limited shelf-life . Weapons being faced by ISAF are not 1980 's vintage American military hardware that still works . The allies face new Russian , Chinese and third-country-variant made armament . They systems I strongly recommend now for the Mistrata defenders are : Non-lethal but essential kit includes personal armor with shoulder and neck protection to NIJ IV , Ballistic aramid facemasks and ballistic aramid helmets to NIJ IIIa . Ballistic shields may useful for MOUT and ballistic blankets may help protect clinics and hospital . Finally , there are 3G NGVs .

It was irresponsible of those rebels to start a war , risking lives and ki , lling , , , yes ! killing innocent people trapped between their ambitions and those of the government , without proper logistics . War is not a game , and we of all people shouldn ' t give other countries and their citzens that the war route is better than the ballot box . cutting handicaped , elderly and the help for those in need in our country to `` help '' rebels in other countries is stupid .

I would rather work to reform the system . It 's hard work , even more so where democracy is not a regular thing . Oppositions in new countries or non democratic countries what ever that is , are impatient . They want to change things yesterday . Those who voted for Obama , Blacks who marched with Martin Luter King , ... Slaves , nerver saw the Justice and equal opportunity they wanted . They are still not fighting America .

April 10 , 2011 at 3:43 am | We know who Gadhafi is , but we do n't know who the opposition is supporting , however , the two sides mirror one another . So I 'm not entirely sure why we 're creating and\\/or supporting another Afghanistan . Supporting and protecting protesters is necessary and essential , but supporting and arming rebels , which in itself is undemocratic , will hurt Libyan civilians who truly want peace and democracy . This can only end badly for the Libyan people , and more of the same April 10 , 2011 at 11:25 am | Reply I totally agree with you . I do n't know how they conducted their poll which stated that the majority of Americans oppose supplying arms to the opposition . When asked to vote in the CNN poll , I voted for supplying them and 85 % of the respondents agreed with my vote . I do n't think the American public wants Daffy Duck oppressing and killing his own That 's funny , your polls indicated the exact opposite here showing the vast majority in favor thereof . I 'm against it because it 's simply the wrong thing to do . We most soarly need a laissez-faire foreign policy which we do n't have right now . People who are in favor of it are mostly ignorant in the first place as they know practically nothing about the Middle East .

Today those same weapons are being used to kill a people who are sick and tired of tyranny , therefore the question answers itself readily , Yes , Yes and Yes , the rebels of Libya need to be armed and helped right now and not a moment later . Added to that the air cover so crucial needs to regain its full momentum , at the end of the day the aim is still to save countless lives . All I need to remind the US is this point : A couple of weeks when a US plane was downed in rebel-held territory , did anyone pay attention to what the people called you Americans ? They called you Brothers , for once , the US is seen as the good guys , please , for once , let not Oil be thicker than blood , a people want freedom . They are capable of doing the ground work , just give them air cover and weapons , and freedom will happen in Libya .

April 12 , 2011 at 5:13 pm | Reply We have already proved our ignorance in out initial military intervention , arming the rebels will be another step which will arm terrorists who will eventually target the US . Unfortunately , the current government does not have anyone with enough knowledge foreign culture to negotiate the matter . We are approaching this conflict without insight and understanding of the consequences of our actions . We needs to carefully withdraw from military intervention and negotiate an end to this conflict . If an armed rebelion occured in the US , I doubt that our government would step asside and let the rebels take over . With this being the case , should we expect the same in other countries ? April 6 , 2011 at 6:02 pm | Reply I agree we ca n't blindly go in there and be stupid , but assisting with things like training , communications , securing sea access for Misurata -LRB- to allow aid to get in -RRB- and channels for the rebels to sell oil and such might be a good idea . Rebels can buy weapons themselves so I do n't even know this is being discussed . I find the idea rather stupid . The only reason for the US in particular to give away weapons is if we 're going to give away high-tech US military hardware that is difficult to find elsewhere . Even if its not the high tech stuff its just a bad idea politically and in every other way . Let Egypt and other countries worry about sale of arms to the Rebels and the US can help facilitate this transfer but it should n't be directly giving them away . With that being said , I am growing less and less concerned about US\\/European image in the world because everyone needs to see that the interests of countries ' leaders and the interests of the people are NOT the same . This is just as true in the US as in the middle east . I do n't advocate violence against the government or anything -LRB- unless the military started shooting peaceful protesters like it did in Libya , Egypt , Tunisia , Yemen , Bahrain , etc -RRB- but I do think our government needs to get its act together because it is currently not representing its regular citizens ... especially when it comes to the economy . A country that uses government contracts as a way to funnel billions of dollars to campaign supporters ; lets executives triple their salaries while sending jobs overseas and cutting benefits and gutting R&D and customer service and other pillars of their own company ; and allows Wall Street to grow rich off irresponsible practices that crash the economy is NOT FAIR . This is NOT the responsibility of regular citizens to pay for this in lost jobs , wages and government services and a government that does this is no more legitimate than the governments were in Egypt and Tunisia . So I therefore do not care about the US image and hope citizens follow the example of Egypt and Tunisia and realize that such positive change can happen in the US too with the departure of our elite .

I agree totally on campaign finance reform , but unfortunately I no longer have any hope for even something as simple as that without our entire government stepping down and regular people WHO DID N'T RECEIVE CAMPAIGN FUNDS taking control . I personally find the belief that votes actually matter and that they listen to us and that someday the government is going to get someone who represents us incredibly naive and wishful thinking . These people in power do n't represent us , are never going to represent us , and if confronted like Egypt and Tunisia are going to use everything short of live ammunition to protect the economic interests they represent . The entire system runs off corruption and pushing for a constitutional reform through legitimate channels is a total waste of time with these people . Hate to say it , but protest to the level of Egypt and Tunisia is the ONLY way our country can get back to level footing .

As much as some people want to see the libyan rebels tote our guns and boot Gadhafi out of office , we could be playing with a double edged sword , because what if someone is put into office WORSE than Gadhafi . And for some obscure reason they decided to ... oh try to secure more oil reserves in the middle east , and we would have to do something about that , but they 'd just be using . . our weapons ... against us ... so in all reality i think that arming the rebels would just be more of our tax money going into , a rather dangerous toliet . Gadhafi is practically begging us to stop the bombing . I think that that small skirmish we got into i decisively over .

But I have to say I am really tired of my Great Country always being the international police force for these 3rd world countries . I do understand their difficulties and issues , but these are warring clans that date back to biblical times , and there is nothing we can really do to assist . Take advantage of the situation and make a profit . It sounds horribly brutal , but the simple matter of the fact , is these folks are not going to quit shooting at eachother regardless of what the USA wants . So I say fund them with weapons , and let them duke it out , and may the better party win . Our own Country 's history started in much the same manner , and it puzzles me as to what the `` Civilized World '' really expects these developing countries to really do except have a Civil War , and settle their differences . Are their civilians who are going to be injured or even killed ? Yes , most certainly ! However , there is not one war on this planet that has ever occured where the civilian populations were NOT effected by the wars . They 're effect in one of two ways . If the country is not invaded , -LRB- World War II -RRB- , the meat for the grinder is supplied from the population via draft to supply the Military Forces with the necessary personnel to get the Missions completed . The second way is the destruction and collateral damage from War itself . So the harm in supplying the weapons for war ? I just do n't see the issue . US Troops , need to be pulled out of these situations , and returned to our protectorates and to our home shores . If these warring clans want the iron of war then I say supply it , improve our own internal economy , and put Americans back to work . Yeah , yeahm I know we would be profiting by the horrible circumstances within those territories . But at least we would not be over there trying to dictate peace terms , and let them fight it out .

The West obviously is quite sick of this combined with the usual taunts of imperialism even in the process of handing over weapons to these ungrateful dangerous wretches who think Freedom is Freedom to subjugate others without mercy .

And that might cause the international coalition forces with NATO 's military operations `` Odyssey Dawn '' 's objectives compromise as well as UNSC resolutions 1970,1973 too .

Al-Obeidy told Aisha Ahmad that a court employee pulled a weapon on her when she went to a courthouse . Al-Obeidy , who burst into a Tripoli hotel last month to tell her harrowing story to journalists , told CNN 's Anderson Cooper in an emotional phone interview that the administrative court employee threatened her life . `` The people came and started pulling him , '' said al-Obeidy , who related the incident to her mother , also on the phone . `` The whole day in the court they were saying we are going to kill this failure who reports on our brigades . '' A car took her home , al-Obeidy said . `` They do n't want me to go to the court at all . '' CNN could not independently verify the 29-year-old law school graduate 's claims . Al-Obeidy , who is no longer in custody after authorities rushed her away from the hotel , said she still fears for her safety in Tripoli , which she called a `` large prison . '' Alleged Libyan rape victim speaks out Facing threats , al-Obeidy speaks out She told `` AC360 '' that Gadhafi forces took her passport and would not let her cross the border into Tunisia . Her mother , Aisha Ahmad , who lives in the eastern coastal city of Tobruk , urged al-Obeidy to return to her parents `` before they kill you . '' `` You have Allah with you , you have Allah with you , you have Allah with you , '' Ahmad said . `` Do not change your statement . '' Ahmad tried to comfort her distraught daughter , saying , `` they lie in the Libyan media . '' `` I dream of them trying to kill me , '' said al-Obeidy , who has spent time with her sister and is concerned about the health of her father back home . Ahmad told al-Obeidy the world is praying for her and not to be afraid . `` I 'm not afraid , '' the daughter replied . `` The one thing that really bothers me is that I 'm far from you . Nobody is standing by me here in Tripoli . '' Asked by Cooper if she were still trying to leave the capital , al-Obeidy said , `` How can I possibly get out of Tripoli when Tripoli is under siege ? There are only two ways to get to my family , by way of Tunisia or through the eastern zone and they 're both under siege . '' Al-Obeidy , who was encouraged by Ahmad to pray and keep her faith , was grateful for the opportunity to speak with her family . `` We 'd like to thank the American people and every person who tried to make my voice heard , '' she said . In two previous telephone interviews with Cooper , al-Obeidy spoke about her alleged abuse . At times in tears , at other times defiant , she recalled men pouring alcohol into her eyes and repeatedly using rifles to sodomize her . Al-Obeidy said she spent 72 hours under interrogation after being dragged away from the Tripoli hotel where she tried to tell journalists about her alleged abuse . She has said the public statements from a state TV anchor and government officials , who initially called her mentally ill , drunk and a prostitute , have ruined her reputation . Al-Obeidy burst into the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli on March 26 while international journalists staying there were having breakfast . She told reporters she had been taken from a checkpoint east of Tripoli , held against her will for two days and beaten and raped by 15 men . When CNN saw her in March , al-Obeidy 's legs and face were bruised and she had blood on her right inner thigh . Her visible injuries appeared to support her allegations , but CNN could not independently verify her story . CNN 's `` AC360 '' spoke with al-Obeidy Sunday , Monday and Tuesday .

We had been trying since then to interview her in person and were finally able to speak to her Wednesday , against the explicit wishes of the Libyan government . `` You should not be allowed to do this , '' government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told me . The interview with al-Obeidy was facilitated by Gadhafi 's son Saadi and was subject to a government review . We asked al-Obeidy if she would be willing to come to Saadi Gadhafi 's office . She agreed and Gadhafi sent a car to pick her up . She and Gadhafi met privately before our interview , the first time the two had met . Gadhafi appeared shocked afterward . He commented on her strong character and willingness to challenge him when they disagreed . He and his press assistant sat in on the 30-minute CNN meeting . Some of the time , we were alone with her . She came dressed in ornate black robes and with her head covered . She called herself an ordinary citizen , a good Muslim who is conservative in her social outlook . She spoke with clarity and exuded strength through the conversation , adamant about clearing her name she said Libyan state media had smeared . Al-Obeidy interview ` did n't come easy ' Al-Obeidy : Tripoli is a prison `` Everything they said about me is a lie , '' she said . `` I am well-educated unlike the way the Libyan TV portrayed me . I come from a good family , regardless of what they said , I am also not mentally challenged like they said . Just because I raised my voice and talked to the media they blamed me and questioned my sanity . Nonetheless , I want my rights , even without the media . '' She spoke of her abduction , of how she was taken to one of the residences of Moammar Gadhafi 's soldiers . They were drunk , she said . They tied her up , beat and raped her . Her bruises had faded , but I could still the see the evidence of her agony around her wrists . She said in the height of her trauma , she took pictures with the camera on her mobile phone , lest people should not believe her later . `` People have blamed me for showing my body , '' she said . `` I was depressed and there was no way to show people how I was tortured . I was brutally tortured to the point of them entering weapons inside me . They would also pour alcohol in my eyes . '' She said the men who tortured her are still free , without punishment . Later Saadi Gadhafi told me : `` The people responsible for raping her should face charges . She is a strong woman . '' Al-Obeidy , a law school graduate , spoke her mind in Gadhafi 's presence and gave no indication that she was intimidated by him , even when she accused the Libyan authorities of lawlessness , brutality and lies . `` I wanted to defend myself because they did not even give me the right to respond , '' she said . I wanted to defend myself because they did not even give me the right to respond . That Saturday , when she tried to speak to journalists at the Rixos Hotel , she was dragged off the property . She was beaten and thrown in jail . Her phone was confiscated . At one point , al-Obeidy told her fellow citizens in eastern Libya and the besieged western city of Misrata to be strong . After the interview was over , Gadhafi objected to that line . Al-Obeidy agreed to Gadhafi 's request that it be cut from the video , but only with full disclosure that those 10 seconds had been removed . Ibrahim , the government spokesman , reviewed my interview and objected to its tone , to the questions I asked and to the overall content . But Saadi Gadhafi overruled his objections . We were asked not to broadcast the interview until another government representative was able to look at it . At the insistence of the Libyan government , we delayed transmission of the video for 18 hours , waiting for word . But the review never came and in the end we were cleared to air almost all of al-Obeidy 's words with the exception of the 10 seconds that she agreed to cut . She was thankful for Saadi Gadhafi 's efforts to make the interview happen . `` He was a humble and understanding man , and he treated me well , '' she told me . `` He said that he will take my case and help me . '' She had asked for three things -- that she be allowed to clear her name , that her abusers are prosecuted and that she be reunited with her family in the eastern city of Tobruk . Al-Obeidy took the first steps to getting one of her wishes . She is counting on Saadi Gadhafi to help her with the other two .

Documents show Moammar Gadhafi waged PR campaign to burnish his image The Monitor Group , a Boston-based consulting firm , was paid $ 3 million a year Monitor senior partner : `` We were not working for Gadhafi , we were working for Libya '' Other U.S.-based firms were hired by Gadhafi -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Just a few years before becoming embroiled in fighting a rebellion , Moammar Gadhafi was spending millions of dollars a year to wage a PR campaign to burnish his global image as a statesman and a reformer , confidential documents show . The mercurial leader hired The Monitor Group , a Boston-based consulting firm , to execute a public relations strategy that included paying think-tank analysts and former government officials to take a free trip to Libya for lectures , discussions and even personal meetings with Gadhafi starting in 2006 . According to a 2007 memo from Monitor to Gadhafi 's intelligence chief , the campaign was to `` enhance international understanding and appreciation of Libya ... emphasize the emergence of the new Libya ... -LRB- and -RRB- introduce Muammar Qadhafi as a thinker and intellectual . '' The price : $ 3 million a year , plus expenses , for work that included consulting , briefings , analyses , and a steady stream of high-profile visitors to Libya -- at least one a month . The memos were posted online by the National Conference of the Libyan Opposition . Eamonn Kelly , senior partner at Monitor Group , is heading an internal investigation at the company . He said the visitors program was only a small part of a wider campaign to help build civil society there . The vast majority of the work , he says , was bringing leadership training and expertise to the country , aimed at `` promoting reform , improving the economic prosperity of the country and the people , modernizing the government and helping to heal the very broken civic society . '' Working in a war zone `` We were not working for Gadhafi , we were working for Libya , '' Kelly said . After one year 's work , a 2007 memo from Monitor touted the results , including a dozen high-profile visitors , ranging from interviewer David Frost to eminent professors such as Francis Fukuyama , fellow at Stanford University . Monitor also took credit for positive media coverage and also highlighted a half-dozen positive articles written by some of the participants they sponsored . For example , Benjamin Barber wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post entitled , `` Gaddafi 's Libya : An Ally for America ? '' and Andrew Moravcsik wrote a piece for Newsweek called , `` A Rogue Reforms . '' Although the firm had vowed to `` provide operational support for publication of positive articles on Libya , '' there is no indication any of the pieces were written at Monitor 's behest . Instead , participants in the program who were reached by CNN say they believed they were being paid for the lectures they gave and the coaching they offered . They said they agreed to go because they were curious about Libya at a time when the regime had taken several positive steps toward the West and appeared to be open to change . Barber points out that , starting in 2003 , Libya `` came out of the cold , thanks to Bush administration overtures : rejoined the West , made war on al Qaeda , started imprisoning al Qaeda warriors , paid -LRB- Lockerbie -RRB- reparations of $ 1.3 billion , and yielded their weapons of mass destruction . '' Barber , an academic whose books on political theory include the best-seller `` Jihad vs. McWorld , '' says he now wants to see Gadhafi driven out . But at the time , Barber tells CNN , `` we thought -- and I think Monitor thought -- it was an opportunity to work at internal reform . '' Another distinguished academic , Harvard 's Joseph Nye , said he accepted the paid trip because `` Gadhafi appeared to be changing his policy -- and introducing new ideas could further reform . '' After he met with Gadhafi , Nye wrote an op-ed for The New Republic that contained both praise and criticism of the dictator . Several other program participants , including Fukuyama and Harvard 's Michael Porter , did not reply to inquiries . Some of the visitors who met with Gadhafi later briefed American officials , according to Monitor 's memo , including `` senior officials in the White House '' and `` senior government officials '' at the State Department and the Department of Defense . The Monitor Group claimed that after they sponsored two trips to the country by former Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle , `` he briefed Vice President Dick Cheney on his visits to Libya . '' Cheney did not reply to an inquiry , but Perle told CNN he did not `` brief '' Cheney on Libya and that it was mistaken to suggest he had done any lobbying for Libya . Still , the possibility that paid visitors later briefed government officials has Paul Blumenthal at The Sunlight Foundation , a watchdog group that has reported on the subject , saying the firm should have registered as lobbyists for a foreign country . `` They really wanted these intellectuals to be able to influence policy on Libya , '' says Blumenthal , to talk to `` people in the State Department and the Defense Department , and really convey the sense that Libya was this great new open place . '' The Monitor Group has received an inquiry about their work from the Justice Department , according to Kelly . Monitor also offered , in a letter to Gadhafi 's intelligence chief , a 22-page proposal for a book about Gadhafi , to be produced for $ 2.9 million in fees and expenses . The book would cover Gadhafi 's `` ideas on democracy , '' the outline said , `` so that the West gains a more accurate and balanced understanding of his actions and ideas . '' The book project never reached fruition , and Monitor said in a statement the proposal was `` a poor decision '' that the firm seriously regrets . But overall , said Kelly , Monitor stands by its main body of work . `` We were working in a very different period , a period of promise , and we are heartbroken that that period clearly has ended . '' Monitor was n't the only U.S. firm that Gadhafi 's regime engaged . In 2008 , as Monitor 's work was coming to a close , Libya retained a more traditional lobbying firm , The Livingston Group , led by former U.S. Rep. Bob Livingston , R-Louisiana . The firm lobbied State Department officials and members of Congress for Libya in 2008 and 2009 , introducing Libya 's U.S. ambassador to dozens of members of Congress . Libya initially paid the firm $ 200,000 a month , but after a year , the billings had dwindled to just $ 30,000 a month . Livingston declined an interview with CNN , but he told CNN affiliate WVUE that he ended the contract shortly after Gadhafi gave a hero 's welcome to Lockerbie conspirator Abdelbeset al Megrahi upon his release from prison in Scotland . `` That was just a bridge too far , and we had to fire the client , '' he said . And before Livingston and Monitor , starting in 2004 , Gadhafi 's government engaged lobbyist Randa Fahmy Hudome during its effort to get Libya accepted in the international community and taken off the State Department 's list of nations who sponsor terrorism . Libya paid her firm more than $ 3 million over the course of three years , she said . `` It certainly was not about money , '' Hudome said . `` It was about national security principles at the time . '' "}, {"uid": "43", "dct": "2011-04-07", "dates": [null, null], "text": "Testifying before Congress on Thursday , General Carter Ham , the head of U.S. Africa Command affirmed that the situation in Libya is grinding toward a stalemate . The Libyan rebels are not an organized fighting force , but Moammar Gadhafi can not mobilize a major offensive against them because of NATO airstrikes and dwindling support within his own army . So what lies ahead ? Military analysts and Libya experts articulate three main possibilities : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a prolonged stalemate , -LRB- 2 -RRB- a negotiated settlement , or -LRB- 3 -RRB- total victory for one side . Prolonged stalemate : The situation could remain much as it is now with the opposition controlling Benghazi , Ajdabiya and some of the coastline . Moammar Gadhafi would control the rest . Zachary Hosford and Andrew Exum at the Center for a New American Security recently described what this might look like : A stalemate in Libya would effectively result in a de facto partition of the country with a severely under-governed and disorganized safe haven in eastern Libya for the rebels that could provide refuge for various militant and criminal groups capable of exporting violence and instability to other countries in North Africa and the Middle East . Max Boot , a national security fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations -LRB- CFR -RRB- , describes the worst case scenario in which this stalemate drags go on for years much as Saddam Hussein clung to power for a decade after the First Gulf War . Middle East scholar Juan Cole illustrates a more hopeful scenario in which - after weeks , months or perhaps a year - a negotiated settlement is reached . He noted that the 1995 Dayton Accords were signed more than a year after NATO started bombing in Bosnia . Negotiated settlement : Many analysts argue that time is not on Gadhafi s side . NATO strikes wear down his forces while other nations supply the rebels with weapons and training . The rebels are gaining access to oil money and potentially to Gadhafi s frozen accounts , while sanctions squeeze Gadhafi and his associates . Unable to pay his mercenaries and losing control , Gadhafi might ultimately feel forced to negotiate , or former loyalists may oust him and negotiate in his stead . In either event , the outcome of a negotiation is an open question . They could lead to the establishment of an interim council , paving the way for parliamentary elections , or , if the stalemate lasts for many years , potentially the partition of Libya . Total victory for one side or the other : Gadhafi s regime could collapse . This is the scenario many are hoping for . This could occur if Gadhafi s army breaks in the face of continued NATO bombing or if Gadhafi s deputies defect en masse . Tripoli would then be open to the rebels . Having the rebels forcibly overthrow Gadhafi would be much more difficult . As Libyan journalist Fadel Al-Ameen explains , I don t imagine that the rebels in the East will be capable of driving all the way to Tripoli . Even if they do , just to invade Tripoli would be a humanitarian catastrophe because Gadhafi and his forces would wreak havoc on the civilian population there . The opposite possibility is that Gadhafi defeats the rebels and reasserts control over all of Libya . This is the nightmare scenario , but it is also extremely unlikely . The world s attention would have to shift away from Libya entirely to allow Gadhafi to amass the requisite force . Most analysts agree that sooner or later - whether weeks , months or years -- Gadhafi has to go , leaving open the question of what happens next . As James Lindsay of CFR notes , Part of the problem is we re talking about what happens on day one . The crucial question is what will be happening in the fall and next year . The same is true if the rebels take it all . That is only the first chapter of the book . Exum worries because most post-conflict states go through a stage where external aid exceeds the government 's capacity to effectively administer it , creating conditions ripe for corruption . In Libya 's case , you will have a similar situation with both -LRB- a -RRB- a lot of government oil revenues and -LRB- b -RRB- very little bureaucracy capable of redistributing resources within the society . But there is also reason for optimism . As Al-Ameen says , Libya s level of education is high . We re not looking at a country like Afghanistan , which is a tribal society without leadership or government . Nor is Libya like Iraq with so many sectarian differences . Libya also has economic resources that will help it survive and prosper . The future doesn t look too bad . '' There 's only one good scenario for the future of Libya and that 's the total victory of the forces loyal to Mohammar Qaddafy . The fall of Qaddafy would spell the end of Libya 's independence and pave the way for the West to get their grimy hands on Libya 's oil which would be tragic at best . April 7 , 2011 at 6:15 pm | Reply Very well said , Onesmallvoice . Like you said , the only good scenario is the total victory for the Qaddafy forces .

Libyan problems are best solved by Libyans . Tea party protested Pres. Obama for years until they were elected in the congress and turned tame . Why didn ' t nato intervene ? Why do n't we shut the H up for once and kill some babies to pay the debt ? I bet you , Kadafi would n't have hesited to raise taxes on the rich and raise food stamps for the poor in his country . He does it all the time . Remember American and Italians used to mine it like they farm cocoa in Ivory coast . Until Kadhafi came and chased them out . Kadhafi may have bragged that he supported bombing Panam , but I also convinced that he simply boasted about it , because he did n't like colonial power , and the bombing of an american Panam represented a blow to American pride . April 10 , 2011 at 3:15 am | Total nonsense . Libyans consider Ghaddafi 's rule as occupation . No respect for basic rights , no freedom . If you like Ghaddafi , you can vote him for your district and enjoy being raped by his security forces if that is what you like . April 8 , 2011 at 9:17 am | Reply Rim , have you ever lived in Libya , how do you know about Libya , you only dirty minds of the imperialists influenced April 8 , 2011 at 9:30 am | This is a personal libyan matter and let them decide it , who are we to pick sides in this fight . Would you like someone from the outside coming and telling you how you should run your country and who your president should be . let them fight and who wins wins . If you want ties then good , if not do not . For the last night analyst on AC360 from John Hopkins to say that we need to show leadership , he is a hypocrite . When we help they are the same people who burn the american flag , When they need they come running otherwise americans are bad and occupation country . I would let them burn and then see what happens . if he really wants to help then he should go and do it . Nothing is every good enough for Arabs , as we do not do the lying they do on the Quaran . I would say let it burn and burn and what is left , they can sift and sell oil to build again . April 8 , 2011 at 10:01 am | right , if you think that you know everything , then get elected as president and run the world so flawlessly as you see it . since you all out there know so much about everything and have the only opinions that matter then please , by all meand , stop the freaking complaining and go out there and get involved , or just leave , no one is making you stay in America , if you have so much problems , either help bring positive change or leave , either way , state your opinion respectfully , or shut your mouth . there is a reason why alot of people are not in charge . and its because there about as sharp as a lolly pop , so you there fred , of course there is issues with this whoe situation , but if they elected you as any elected senior official , you would probably have a stroke and soil yourself . that goes the same for all you other hippie rediculous liberal super creampuffs out there , please leave and live in these places and THEN tell me how you feel on the subject before you think you know what your saying . April 8 , 2011 at 10:50 pm | you are a total ignorant fellow Mr. Ream . life in libya is the ideal life that every muslim dream . US , NATO and UN -- they will surely reap what they sow ... April 10 , 2011 at 5:13 am | I agree on what is presented Ones , in fact should Libyan leader Muammar Kadhafi remain in control , its people prospered under his leadership , the school up to S3 in the free , profit on oil sales people are also in profit April 8 , 2011 at 9:25 am | Reply Its high time the western world should know that Africa is not a playing ground for there machine guns toy ... American should pray for a good source of income by nature and not getting themselves involve in nation whose mineral resources is high and they needed to benefit from it . yes there is a conflict in Libya , Quadaffi and is people . what is any country business with that ... they should send there troops to Sudan and Somalia who have been suffering tribal war for a very long time . I guess they would n't be there , you American should shut the fuck up and go pay your debt in the world bank . Am so so surprise that America as the world power were the one owing most in the world bank . they should concentrate on building there country and paying there debt instead of analyzing other countries conflict . April 8 , 2011 at 12:01 pm | Wow , do you folks even know what you are talking about ? I 'm a Libyan , born there , raised in Canada , my father left Libya , running for his life , left his whole world behind , just took his wife and kids and fled , all in one night , 32 years ago . Because he spoke against Gadhafi , , now please tell me about the prosperity Libyan people are experiencing . I 've lived in Canada and the US for over 30 years and I know at least a million Libyans who would cut off their right arm to trade places with me , and to be quite honest with you , I wish that were not the case , I wish I had grown up in my beautiful home land with my people , a place where I can get a good education , good health care , be able to share opinion freely , and just be my father 's daughter . But we could n't , instead we had to move to a strange new land and assimilate in order to succeed , which is what we did , but sadly , they had to do the same thing back home , Libya , has been a strange land where many people have to do strange things to assimilate with their dictator . It has been sickened , and the people are SICK AND TIRED of it ! I say go get that poor excuse for a human being and all his thugs and be done with them . Then my father can return and do right by his home land , my father , not afraid to speak his mind and will never , and has never taken money from Gadhafi to be one of his dirty players . My father , a man who is greatly respected for his intellect and his morals , would never have survived in Gadhafi 's regime . My father is a good man , and many people know it .

April 8 , 2011 at 12:37 pm | Reply April 9 , 2011 at 8:43 am | Yes the worst scenerio is actually the best scenerio . Libya would be shaken and regime will adapt and tight up the security at the same time . It will start to look for friends in Arab world , Fundamentalists will be controlled too . It will focus on more economics , jobs and allow controlled democracy . It will be similar to what happened in China when they crashed Tianmen square protestors . It is an unfortunate incident that results both sides to think and 30 years of double digits growth . There will always be dissidents and unhappy people -LRB- as in China -RRB- . But rather than risk years of turmoil and many losses of life simply because some dissidents are unhappy , it is better to have a stable evolution . Everyone is adapative and surival instinct is there for everyone . Noticed Algeria is supposedly a more repressive regime than Egypt and Tunisia . But they are not doing anything because they learned the hard lessions of revolutions as Chinese did . At end of the days of a revolution after many deaths and turmoil , the future is too unpredictable and often much worse than before -LRB- French revolution is a case in point -RRB- April 8 , 2011 at 3:41 pm | Reply The main reason the the so-called `` revolution '' at the Tienmien Square failed Jesus , is that most of the Chinese people did n't want to lose their long awaited prosperity for some kind of bourgeois `` democracy '' . After all , just how many Americans are willing to endure years of joblessness and hard times just for the right to vote ??? Not too many , I presume . April 8 , 2011 at 8:00 pm | poor analysis , you are thinking of your own safety in regards to unstable Libya , if the George Washington listened to you he wouldn ` t had liberated the American soil against the British . and raised the democracy in America . you were born in democratic state and you do not know any thing about dictatorship or living as slave for a tyrant .

April 8 , 2011 at 6:48 pm | Reply Yes , I agree totally . It seems that every time the US is involved somewhere in the Middle East , the typical reason is `` Oil '' -- The oil belongs to the country in question and not the US ; just like Iraqi oil , and for that matter any other critical resources to protect .

Gaddafi go to hell , his days are numbered and those who are paid by him will regret their mistake when they see our beloved Libya after he 's gone April 8 , 2011 at 9:11 pm | Reply i am not surprised about some of the comments you people are passing here . libya is the best country in africa , they have it all , money , scholarships , housing , electricity , water and what have you . i can tell you that majority of africans are living in bad conditions because of corruption and bad governance . Ghana for one , i can tell you it is the people that have decided to live in peace and harmony but not that it is all well . A lot of ghanaians wish the people of libya would experienc what it feels like to live in other part of africa then , they will appreciate what they have . They will live to regret like Ghana is regretting about the over throwing Dr. Kwame Nkrumah now . i love America very much but , they should try hard to be fair in the way they pick the countries to help . April 9 , 2011 at 3:49 am | You could n't have said it any better . Kaddafi has n't done much for his people over the last 40 years ... -LRB- except for the one 's close to him -RRB- in terms of improving their living standards , etc. etc. . The question is who is the next one in line to change things around for the better ? I also think that Kaddafi , maybe all of his sons , and others should be held accountable when this is over ... soon I hope .

Those , like Erdoghan , who are trying to make a compromise , do not realize that if Gaddafi or his sons stay , they will commit massive retaliation massacres against Libyans . Gaddafi has killed us for 42 years . I thnik it is enough to know the brutality and stupidenss of this man and his regime .

The only tragedy is and has been Gadaffi using Libyan money to kill Libyan people . April 10 , 2011 at 5:19 am | Reply A small population and large oil reserves make Libya of strategic importance to the Western super powers . But the unspoken prize is the enormous Libyan desert which can be used to dump billions of tons of nuclear waste . The importance of the desert has recently became apparent with the nuclear tragedy in Japan . Infinite tons of contaminated water can quickly be absorbed by the dry sands of the Libyan desert , turning it into a Garden of Eden with no visitors . April 7 , 2011 at 6:48 pm | Reply Idiocy ... No one needs their desert for that . Plenty of other places vitrified waste could be stored if need be . Other African countries have been doing this for years when suitably bribed .

And let assure you , Ghaddafi is presence is the best fertilizer for extremis -LRB- force breeds counter force -RRB- . The selfish westerners can make a choice . April 8 , 2011 at 9:13 am | Reply It 's a waste of time to get mad at other for your own shortcomings . Westerners did not make Gadhafi the crazy man he is , nor did it make him kill his own people and suppress the rest . Westerners did not make him bomb planes or discos or any other terrorist activity he got involved in . Arab men can be a little off , and it 's time now for them to take a good hard look in the mirror , and not go around calling Westerners greedy , because that 's silly , EVERYONE IS GREEDY . Look at the way many Arab men treat woman , is that not greed ? April 8 , 2011 at 2:16 pm | how arab men treat women ??? why dont you take a look at mid west or central states of US and see how the red necks treat their women . no race or color can define how men treat women . just because you see or hear certain things in the news does not mean all middle eastern treat their women badly . but I guess you are a white trash with a small brain . ignorant piece of trash April 8 , 2011 at 5:19 pm | The rebels will keep advancing until they run into a squad of soldiers and then they will be begging for NATO air support . This `` war '' has about 1500 rebels of which 1\\/4th are al Qaeda . The U.S. military-industrial complex needs targets so they can keep selling cruise missles at $ 1 million a pop to blow up mud huts and kill civilians . Then they will want the American taxpayers to rebuild the country to put money in Halliburton and Dick Cheney 's pocket . Americans should vote Ron Paul and repudiate the debt owed to the politician war-profiteers and the Federal Reserve . We can declare bankruptcy on them ! They took us to war for lies so they could profit . Let them eat the losses ! The money that is owed is owed to those who took us to war for lies in order to profit from slaughter . Vote Ron Paul and file for bankruptcy on the Federal Reserve . Their business is funding wars and government debt , and business is good . But , it is turning the middle class into wage slaves with low-paying jobs . War is increasing our GNP , but destroying liberty and middle class wealth .

This weapon was supposed to be used to stop wars quickly and it worked amazingly to end WWII . It does n't have to be a huge one , just a nuclear bomb that lets everybody know we can and will use them if they keep pulling this SH \\*\\* T all over the world . Quite frankly , I 'll even say to be fair , drop leaflets over the enemy areas for a few days before bombing . The good people will get the F out . The crazies will stay and fight and then we know where they are and who they are . Some crazies will flee in terror and we can catch them along the road out of town .

If it were n't for the US there would be NO humanity . April 8 , 2011 at 9:33 am | Reply Too naive . how many conflicts and wars has the west initiated in the last 70 + years ?? We are trying to help the libyans by using depleted uranium munitions ???? I suppose there was no humanity before the USA ? Instead of tying to help everyone how about just helping ourselves for once and help the citizens of the USA durning this depression . Military spending is in the hundreds of billions a year . One fraction of that could save all the municipality about to default in the USA . Bring our boys home , that alone would bring down substantially world conflict .

April 8 , 2011 at 10:07 am | Reply I personally think that the US needs to send military troops into Libya to stop this . This is causing gas prices to reach record prices and it is going out of control . Gadhafi has made it clear that he is not going to step down . Even if the rebels do reach Tripoli , Gadhafi has nowhere to run , unlike bin Laden has , because basically every country hates him and will not be willing to keep him within . Now if Tripoli does get surrounded , I predict another Adolf Hitler scenario where he kills himself . But America needs to make a move herself and not just with the NATO airstrikes . April 8 , 2011 at 9:51 am | Reply Sorry folks , I never posted that idiotic statement above . The U.S. has a moral obligation not to interfere in Libya 's civil war .

Kind of like an African version of the koreas . Only time will bring one Libya to all ! It seems this will be the most acceptable version at this time .

UN brokered a ceasefire and DMZ that has barely worked and only for the fact that 50,000 American troops still sit there holding the 2 idiotic countries apart .

April 8 , 2011 at 12:36 pm | The UN has no troops and if the U.S. will not provide then then no one will provide them . Obama will never send troops no matter what happens . Since this is a civil war , the U.S. should never have gotten involved in the 1st place . If civilians need to be protected then the other Muslim nations should have provided the protection of THEIR brothers and sisters . There is no national or strategic interest for the U.S. in Libya . As to `` protecting civilians '' we have had no problem with millions being killed by other dictators and we ca n't protect all the civilians in the world .

April 8 , 2011 at 12:27 pm | Reply Actually , while the the organized rebel army is small , the passionate civilian opposition to the Gadhafi regime is widespread , east and west , and in the majority in Libya . The ring of mountain towns to the south of Tripoli are all in opposition , and are defending themselves . Towns Gadhafi claims to control are controlled at the point of a gun , not by the peoples support . Tripoli is under lockdown . The regime 's ministers and their families have had their passports confiscated , and are under guard in the govt . compound lest they defect . Gadhafi 's own govt . Tripoli is simmering under this oppression . The most likely and immanent scenario is that Tripoli will explode and liberate themselves . Gadhafi 's inner circle is getting smaller and smaller . Not so much because of what the `` West '' has done , but becuase of utter disgust of what Gadhafi has done . April 8 , 2011 at 11:55 am | Reply yes , it was said that the Minister of Defense became physically ill after giving the hired guns his last order , the order was to kill anything that moved , man women or child , go into their homes , rape pillage and kill . After that he became ill and had to `` seek treatment '' , in London . But there remain many dangers , Gadhafi has many friends in Tunisia and they are helping him get supplies into Libya , so while he is down he is truly fighting until the end , , he is a man of his word . April 8 , 2011 at 1:47 pm | Reply Yeah , this stalemate is looking temporary . Seems that the Libyans are not going to turn back now . And if supplies are smuggling in from Tunisia I 'm guessing that NATO will eventually target them . I 'm sure that the Libyans are looking at the long term , we just have to learn to do the same and be patient right now . The conflict is n't going to stay this way anyway . April 8 , 2011 at 4:03 pm | Reply One logical outcome , considering the apparent stalemate on the ground , is a UN brokered ceasefire ; the establishment of a Korean style DMZ , manned by UN troops , which will allow the two sides time to settle at the negotiation table . Not the ideal solution , but one which I think will be the outcome in the near future . April 8 , 2011 at 11:56 am | Reply If Libya were partitioned between East and West , the population in the east would flee or be killed , because they all hate Gadhafi too . Only his family would be left , and then they would set upon each other . Saif and Muttassim are already at each others throats . If Daddy Daffy dies , these brothers will launch a bloody battle between them for power , and East Libya will be in it 's own civil war . This is what will happen with partition .

That being said , I have no idea why the USA is , or is expected to be , the world 's social worker and enforcer . Yes Ghaddafi is a despot , but he is not the worst . It was difficult for me to accept , but Libya is more a war for oil , water and M-I complex than any other purpose ; Mostly about the stability of M-I Complex and the instability of Africa . Afrique should be rich . 1500 years ago she was rich and verdant . The water aquifer is not very deep , and may be the best aquifer in the world . There is a slight chance that he was unifying Africa , and TPTB , were feeling threatened that he might actually pull it off , without having a policy acceptable to EU , much less a succession plan .

And these are only declared warheads , the number of undeclared ones is said to be triple or fourfold -LRB- again , in each country -RRB- . The small number and poor technological level of Chinese missiles make American and Russian air defense systems almost impenetrable for them . But even if we go away from the US and Russia , who 's firepower is obviously superior to the Chinese , we 'll see that , for example , French armed forces can fully handle with China . France 's got approximately 500 warheads -LRB- and not so poor-leveled missiles as Chinese ones -RRB- . This is the first point . However , if China decides to hit France with its missiles , they 'll eminently intercepted by Russian or American air defense systems , because it is impossible to reach France from China without breaking into either Russian or American airspace . This is the second one . An the third thing is the fact that French soldiers -LRB- especially the Foreign Legion -RRB- are incomparably better trained than the Chinese .

When the Libyans revolted peacefully against oppression and injustice they did not consult the NATO or the west about the possibility of succeeding , because they believe in their cause . Of course , the rhythm of the revolution in terms of the battles on the ground seems slower , but the coming days will bring pleasant surprises to the freedom fighters . Gaddafi is clinically dead , exactly like Sharon of Israel . His son is still attempting for less humiliating exit for the family of the dictator .

This is not hard to figure out . Almost everyone will vote for the parties of islam . So , the mullahs will come to power , just as they did in Iran , and we see the results there . Un-fortunately , there can be no Liberty in any of these countries . After the mullahs are in charge in all of these countries , there is a much greater danger of war with the west . There will only be bondage . Where the spirit of the lord is , there is Liberty .

What exactly are they saying is their honest reasons for dissociating themselves from a leader they loyally served for 4 decades ? If this was not the most immoral sign of self preservation to avoid reprisals against them then I do not know what it was . So , did they all of a sudden grow brains and realized they were backing a wrong man ? They were appalled by the crack down on protesters so they said . Oooh , please move over ! These people who took to the streets of Libya should be called what they really are , anarchists , pure and simple . They were not peacefully calling on the government to discuss changes they wanted made as a matter of urgency . What they wanted was a sudden and disorderly removal of a regime by any means necessary . This is what I find rather disturbing and the West and everyone is unanimously in support of such actions . Is this the culture we are truly advocating all disgruntled nationals to employ whenever they are unhappy with their leaders ? It is clearly undeniable that the western powers are not entirely being driven by their morality in dealing with what is happening in the Arab world particularly in Libya . What they failed to achieve through the many years of isolating Libya , they have most definitely found a necessary primer to try again in the current crisis to push this agenda .

April 10 , 2011 at 8:56 pm | Reply Ultimately , the success of the mission in the end is going to depend on whether or not Gaddafi retaliates because the entire rationale for arming\\/supporting the rebels -LRB- after preventing the humanitarian crisis in Benghazi -RRB- was that a Libya with Gaddafi still in power would not fly and to prove to other leaders that Gaddafi 's model of response would not work . If there is a negotiated settlement , will Gaddafi in the future build up his arms and try to attack again ? And if he does will the international community respond in a similar way ? There should be no surprise that the opposition forces will not agree to anything that includes a Gaddafi in power . As Fareed pointed out earlier , if anything is going to break Gaddafi , it is going to be economic pressure and defections of his inner circle . In this sense , the best outcome is somewhere between 2 and 3 . To accomplish this , NATO should continue with its operations , continue to train\\/arm the rebels , and also provide them with humanitarian aid if needed . Meanwhile , the African Union should work to convince Gaddafi to gracefully step down from power so as not to anger the supporters in Tripoli . This brings up another important question : how will Gaddafi s most ardent supporters in Tripoli view the rebels if\\/when they try to form a new government in the name of Libya ? There is nothing wrong with arguing , protesting , or yelling at each other to achieve political power and compromise , but I do not know how attached to Gaddafi Libyans in Tripoli are . If they decide to reject the rebels interim government and the contention devolves into another civil conflict then the coalition will have no choice but to pull out .

Aircraft fired missiles on a rebel formation between al-Brega and Ajdabiya on the eastern Libyan battlefront , witnesses told CNN Thursday , an act that left the opposition wondering whether NATO aircraft conducted mistaken airstrikes on the forces they are trying to protect . It 's unclear whether Libyan aircraft or NATO fired the missiles , but there have n't been Libyan air force planes in the skies for some time because NATO aircraft have established a no-fly zone . NATO said it 's looking into the strikes but did n't say who carried it out . In a statement , it said that hostilities between al-Brega and Ajdabiya have `` been fierce for several days . The situation is unclear and fluid with mechanized weapons traveling in all directions . '' `` What remains clear is that NATO will continue to uphold the U.N. mandate and strike forces that can potentially cause harm to the civilian population of Libya , '' NATO said . Gen. Abdul Fattah Yunis , commander of rebel forces , told reporters of the `` unfortunate setback . '' Working in a war zone The planes fired on 20 rebel tanks near al-Brega Thursday morning , Yunis said . Gadhafi 's troops moved forward after the attack , causing the opposition to pull back . Several of the tanks were destroyed . The general said he wanted some answers from NATO on whether it or Gadhafi planes made the strike . If the latter , Yunis said , NATO should have prevented that by enforcing the no-fly zone . He added that the rebels had notified NATO of the tank movement and of their presence . `` There is no tension between us and NATO ; this is a war situation and we understand that mistakes are made , '' Yunis said . Two soldiers and two medics died in the airstrike . Fourteen people were injured and six are missing , Yunis said . Witnesses said the rebel fighters saw an airplane and thought it was from NATO , CNN 's Ben Wedeman reported . Later , the plane returned and fired several missiles and then made another strike . Ambulances responded , and the injured people were taken to a hospital in Ajdabiya . A few hours after the strikes , civilians and rebels , fearing an approach by pro-Gadhafi forces , retreated from Ajdabiya , with hundreds of civilian cars and trucks loaded with rocket launchers and ammunition headed out of town in the direction of the opposition headquarters in Benghazi . Tanks were reportedly part of the column of vehicles . The Gadhafi regime 's persistence in the face of NATO forces has frustrated and angered opposition leaders , who say they are not getting traction despite the alliance 's no-fly zone and air cover . NATO said weather conditions and tactics by the Gadhafi regime , such as using human shields and hiding equipment in populated areas , have hindered its efforts . If the latest bombing run were a NATO strike , rebels said it would have been the second in a week 's time . Last week , airstrikes hit rebel vehicles and killed at least 13 rebel fighters in the al-Brega area , a spokesman for the Libyan opposition said . The strikes come amid a deadly stalemate between pro-Moammar Gadhafi forces and rebel fighters , diplomatic maneuvering to end the conflict and blunt doubts about the potency of the opposition forces . Asked whether rebel fighters can push into Tripoli and oust Gadhafi , Gen. Carter Ham , U.S. Africa Command 's chief , told senators at a hearing Thursday , `` I would assess that as a low likelihood . '' Also Thursday , a senior Libyan government official said four detained journalists are in government hands and are safe . They will be brought to Tripoli and released , but the timing is uncertain , the official said . GlobalPost , an international news website , said pro-Gadhafi forces detained one of its freelancers and three other journalists . They had been taken Tuesday night on the outskirts of al-Brega , said Peter Bouckaert , director of emergencies for Human Rights Watch . On the diplomatic front , a former U.S. lawmaker who has been trying to meet with Gadhafi told CNN `` The Situation Room '' that Friday will be his last opportunity . Curt Weldon has said he will tell the leader to step aside and take other measures to end the bloodshed . A former Republican U.S. House member from suburban Philadelphia , Weldon has been to Libya before in his work as a congressman . He said he came to the country this time with `` a small private delegation . '' Weldon said he has met with other Libyan officials , including the prime minster and Gadhafi 's son , Saadi , conveying the Obama administration 's stance on the crisis and reinforcing the importance of an immediate cease-fire monitored by the United Nations to protect civilians . `` I 'm here only because I want to avoid war , '' Weldon told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer . `` I do n't want to see American soldiers killed , and I do n't want to see more innocent Libyans killed , '' he added . Fighting has raged across the country . Rebel fighters and pro-Gadhafi forces have been pushing back and forth between al-Brega and Ajdabiya . In the capital , Tripoli , four explosions were heard , and two aircraft could be seen overhead Thursday . Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim described the Thursday airstrikes as heavy and `` really intensive . '' He said the strikes hit `` military academies around Tripoli where students and teachers work . '' A British airstrike hit an oil field in the eastern town of Sarir on Wednesday , causing damage to a main pipeline , Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told reporters . But NATO 's operation in Libya denied responsibility , saying such blame reflects the desperation of the Gadhafi regime . `` We are aware that pro-Gadhafi forces have attacked this area in recent days , which resulted in at least one fire at an oil facility north of Sarir , '' said Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard , commander of NATO 's Operation Unified Protector . `` We have never conducted strike operations in this area because his forces were not threatening civilian population centers from there , '' Bouchard said . `` The only one responsible for this fire is the Gadhafi regime , and we know he wants to disrupt oil getting to Tobruk . '' Meanwhile , violence continues in the western city of Misrata . Ham said the `` regime has a significantly degraded ability to continue to attack civilians '' and Misrata is a `` notable exception . '' `` The opposition forces have held an area in the northeastern portion of the city , in the port . And frankly , the port has been operating to get some relief , '' he said . `` But the regime forces are and remain active in the city against civilians . '' U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said conditions in Misrata are `` especially grave , '' citing `` reports of the use of heavy weapons to attack the city , where the population is trapped and unable , as a result of heavy shelling that has continued over several weeks , to receive basic supplies , including clean water , food and medicines . '' The World Food Programme said one of its humanitarian vessels loaded with food , medical supplies and doctors has reached the port of Misrata , providing what it called a `` lifeline '' for trapped civilians . `` This is a breakthrough for the U.N. humanitarian operation in Libya and allows us to reach tens of thousands of people who are caught in one of the fiercest areas of conflict , '' said WFP Executive Director Josette Sheeran . `` It is vital that we get these relief supplies to the vulnerable .

That was the grim assessment in congressional testimony Thursday by General Carter Ham , the U.S. commander who led the initial phases of the operation ... Ham 's testimony made clear that if they wanted to topple Gadhafi 's regime - a stated objective of the key players in the military campaign , Britain , France and the U.S. even if not necessarily through the military campaign - NATO powers , first and foremost the United States , would have to invest more military resources than they are currently doing . Ham acknowledged that it would probably require the insertion of foreign ground forces to decisively turn the tide right now - the rebels have proven no match for Gadhafi 's forces , who have them largely pegged back in their eastern strongholds . He said the U.S. would have to consider whether to send in troops . But escalating Western direct involvement in Libya remains unlikely , at best , for a number of reasons : 1 . It 's patently clear , by now , that Libya is in the throes of a civil war - even if the majority of Libyans detest Col. Gadhafi , it 's patently clear that a sizable minority is passionately committed to his regime and willing to fight for it . The strength of the regime on the ground has been underestimated , and the power of the rebellion overestimated . There 's no quick and easy military solution here . The U.S. has until now made clear that it sees limited national interests at stake in Libya , envisaging its role as that of supporting a European-led intervention . But the Europeans appear ill-equipped to escalate the air war , much less launch a ground war to topple Gadhafi . The `` pottery barn rule '' still applies : If it took a Western ground invasion to topple Gadhafi , the Western powers would be forced to own the outcome , which could be extremely messy . The dynamics among and between the various armed groups that would survive a regime collapse - from pro Gadhafi militias , tribal formations , and various factions of a rebel army that is anything but coherent - are barely understood , and there 's no real state left with institutions that could absorb and reconcile these groups . It may have been recognized by Italy , France , Qatar and Kuwait as the sole legitimate government of Libya , but the Transitional National Council based in Benghazi does not even pretend to be a truly representative national body . Knocking out the regime now through the application of Western military force would create a vacuum that would very likely suck in foreign troops to maintain order and oversee the building of a new Libyan state from scratch . Sure , President Obama would take some licks domestically if he fails to decisively topple Gadhafi , but he hardly wants to run for reelection having committed U.S. troops to a third nation-building mission in the Muslim world . UN Security Council Resolution 1973 , which provides the legal authority for foreign militaries to protect Libyan civilians , ca n't be translated into a regime-change operation without jeopardizing the alliance . Key NATO members such as Germany and Turkey oppose escalation , and Ankara is pressing hard for a cease-fire . Stretching the permissions afforded by Resolution 1973 would also jeopardize future international cooperation on humanitarian interventions . -LRB- Russia and China may not have voted for this , but they enabled it by refraining from wielding their veto power at the Security Council ; if they believe NATO used the authorization as a pretext to pursue regime-change , they may not easily be persuaded to allow future humanitarian interventions . Whatever Arab support exists for the current operations is likely to rapidly erode if it involved sending in foreign troops - remember , even the rebels themselves loudly opposed that idea in the early days of the rebellion . What the West needs to do is meet it 's moral obligations and withdraw completely from Libya 's civil war and let the chips fall where they may even if that means a victory for Qaddafy 's forces .

That would include rebel tanks or other rebel armor . NATO should replace the equipment destroyed plus better communications gear , instantly if possible .

I base my facts on the self-evident truth that all men and women of this world basically want to be free . April 8 , 2011 at 6:36 pm | Reply Thank you , Eugene . Your comment is very enlightening since even I did n't know that but I still firmly believe that the `` rebels '' are aspiring to replace Mohammar Qaddafy some pro-Western stooge . April 8 , 2011 at 7:52 pm | Reply What Nato need to do is create a no-mans-land between Benghazi and Tripoli for a period of say 5 years ... nothing can enter that no-mans-land during that period of time . At the same time apply continued rigid sanctions against the Qaddafi regime and let the East freely trade and grow . Insist that the East creates a government and a new constitution and holds free and democratic elections . If Eastern Libya complies , then the no-man 's zone is maintained until they ask for it to be removed . a no-fly-zone would also be maintained over the west . This would pretty much force Qaddafi 's hand . And no NATO ground troops would enter Libya . April 8 , 2011 at 6:28 pm | Reply We do n't know the degree of repression that the Libyans are currently experiencing under Qaddafi so it is imposable to estimate the percentage of those Libyans under Qaddafi 's rule that would prefer to be free of him . April 8 , 2011 at 6:45 pm | Reply I think we should let the opposition have some aircraft and helicopters with attack capability and replace the tanks and rocket launchers , that have been destroyed , since the conflict began , and replace them as they are lost due to hostile action . This could include training , to use the equipment and communication equipment to talk to NATO aircraft to reduce friendly casualties . They have trained helicopter pilots that could learn to fly a Huey Cobra in days in some cases , weeks in others . Older model , A10 's flown by Libyan 's could be just what they people of Libya need to level the playing field . I 'm sure that these older , yet serviceable aircraft could be used to get effect against the Moammar Qaddafi military . Most of which are mercenaries and former criminals or committed criminal acts against the civilian population since Qaddafi took over in a coup 42 years ago . The opposition deserves the chance to succeed and the world needs to assist them in their endeavor , freedom from tyranny does not come without loss of life . America , fought for 4 years with the loss of thousands of lives both military and civilians , to win it 's freedom from England .

Negotiations remained under way Sunday night between Gadhafi and the African Union delegation . Details of the agreement were not available , though it is believed to include an immediate ceasefire in the nearly two-month long war between Gadhafi 's forces and those fighting to unseat him . In his comments , Zuma also discussed an end to NATO airstrikes aimed at enforcing a no-fly zone and targeting Gadhafi 's troops . After staying overnight in Tripoli , the African Union delegation will fly Monday to the Libyan rebel stronghold of Benghazi to meet with opposition leaders there . Gadhafi visits school in Tripoli New NATO airstrikes in Libya The African Union 's special committee on Libya is represented by Mauritania , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Mali , Uganda as well as Zuma 's South Africa . As Gadhafi left one meeting at his compound in Tripoli , he made a rare public appearance for international media before riding off in a car as he waved to supporters near his tent . The leader then entered a second meeting with the delegation . Earlier Sunday , Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz told journalists that the meetings `` will discuss the ways to resolve the crisis in Libya , and our main goal is to stop the military operations and find adequate solutions for the problem between our Libyan brothers , '' according to a Mauritanian news agency . After a series of setbacks driven by the advances of pro-government forces , Libyan rebel fighters this weekend recaptured the besieged city of Ajdabiya after apparently holding off Gadhafi 's better-equipped forces . In a hospital , witnesses told CNN on Saturday that three of Gadhafi 's fighters who were killed were carrying identification cards from Syria , Algeria and Chad . Meanwhile , in Misrata , NATO airstrikes hit parts of the city overnight and Sunday , an eyewitness told CNN , who did not want to be named for security reasons . At least eight people were killed and 22 injured from Saturday 's fighting between the pro-Gadhafi forces and the rebels , according to medical sources in the city . On Sunday , two rebel fighters died as they attempted to hunt down pro-Gadhafi snipers near the city center , another eyewitness said . The rebels were able to recover the bodies of 15 such snipers shot earlier Sunday . The snipers took positions on top of residential and commercial buildings , the eyewitness said . NATO airstrikes on Sunday hit various positions in and around the city , destroying 14 tanks , the eyewitness said . Sporadic fighting continued Sunday , but had decreased from recent days as the airstrikes kept pro-Gadhafi forces busy . Some youths , captured in recent days by rebels , said they were teenagers and secondary-school students who had been forced to leave their homes in nearby towns and villages and undergo mandatory weeklong military training before fighting in Misrata , according to the second eyewitness . Pro-Gadhafi forces continued shelling parts of the city Sunday morning , the eyewitness said . A steel mill near the port was targeted but the port is now under rebel control , eyewitnesses said . However , the port still holds about 4,000 foreign workers who are trying to leave the city . Civilians living in the western sections of Misrata have been forced to leave their homes and have gathered in schools and friends ' and relatives ' homes near the city center , eyewitnesses said . In a statement Saturday , NATO said its aircraft destroyed pro-Gadhafi ammunition stockpiles east of Tripoli that were supplying troops shelling Misrata and other cities . The alliance also made attacks on armored vehicles near Misrata and Ajdabiya , NATO said . Opposition spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah told CNN that rebels flew two attack helicopters from Tobruk to join the fighting in Ajdabiya . `` There were some 50 regime pickup trucks with machine guns and rocket launchers that attempted to enter Ajdabiya , '' Abdulmolah said . `` The helicopters destroyed several of the trucks , and the rest took off . '' Abdulmolah did not know what kind of helicopters the rebel forces used in Saturday 's attack and could not confirm whether rebel forces coordinated the operation with NATO . NATO is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect Libyan civilians from attack . The United Nations said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will travel to Cairo Thursday to head meetings on Libya at the Arab League headquarters . Among the participants will be Catherine Ashton , the representative for foreign affairs and security for the European Union . While Gadhafi has largely stayed out of the public eye in recent days , state TV aired images Saturday of the leader visiting what appeared to be a primary school in Tripoli . The anchor said the school was a target of international airstrikes and was going to be attacked . But NATO said in its statement that Gadhafi 's forces continue to use civilians as human shields . `` We have observed horrific examples of regime forces deliberately placing their weapons systems close to civilians , their homes and even their places of worship , '' said Lt. Gen. Charlie Bouchard , commander of NATO 's Operation Unified Protector . `` Troops have also been observed hiding behind women and children . This type of behavior violates the principles of international law and will not be tolerated .

His face was gaunt and sunburned . Ticks , fleas and lice covered his body . Before battle , his lips would quiver and his body went numb . When the shooting started , some of his comrades burst into maniacal laughter . Others bit the throat and ears of their enemy . And some were shattered by shells so powerful that tufts of their hair stuck to rocks and trees . Take a tour of a Civil War battlefield today , and it 's difficult to connect the terrifying experience of an average Civil War soldier -- described above from various historical accounts -- with the tranquil historic sites where we now snap pictures today . But you do n't have to tour a battlefield to understand the Civil War . Look at today 's headlines . As the nation commemorates the 150th anniversary of its deadliest war this week , some historians say we 're still fighting over some of the same issues that fueled the Civil War . `` There are all of these weird parallels , '' says Stephanie McCurry , author of `` Confederate Reckoning , '' a new book that examines why Southerners seceded and its effect on Southern women and slaves . `` When you hear charges today that the federal government is overreaching , and the idea that the Constitution recognized us as a league of sovereign states -- these were all part of the secessionist charges in 1860 , '' she says . They point to four parallels : The disappearance of the political center If you think the culture wars are heated now , check out mid-19th century America . The Civil War took place during a period of pervasive piety when both North and South demonized one another with self-righteous , biblical language , one historian says . One of the biggest debates during the Civil War was how far should governments go in dictating our lives . We still debate those politics . -- William Blair , Civil War historian The war erupted not long after the `` Second Great Awakening '' sparked a national religious revival . Reform movements spread across the country . Thousands of Americans repented of their sins at frontier campfire meetings and readied themselves for the Second Coming . They got war instead . Their moral certitude helped make it happen , says David Goldfield , author of `` America Aflame , '' a new book that examines evangelical Christianity 's impact on the war . Goldfield says evangelical Christianity `` poisoned the political process '' because the American system of government depends on compromise and moderation , and evangelical religion abhors both because `` how do you compromise with sin . '' `` By transforming political issues into moral causes , you raise the stakes of the conflict and you tend to demonize your opponents , '' Goldfield says . Contemporary political rhetoric is filled with similar rhetoric . Opponents are n't just wrong -- they 're sinners , Goldfield says . `` The erosion of the center in contemporary American politics is the most striking parallel between today and the time just before the Civil War , '' Goldfield says . In the lead-up to the war , political campaigns were filled with religious fervor . Political parties paraded their piety and labeled opponents infidels . `` Today 's government gridlock results , in part , from this religious mind set that many issues can be divided into good and evil and sin and salvation , '' he says . A Union artillery crew poses before battle . Each side underestimated the opposing army , historians say . How much power should the federal government have ? Nullification , states ' rights and secession . Those terms might sound like they 're lifted from a Civil War history book , but they 're actually making a comeback on the national stage today . Since the rise of the Tea Party and debate over the new health care law , more Republican lawmakers have brandished those terms . Republican lawmakers in at least 11 states invoked nullification to thwart the new health care law , according to a recent USA Today article . It was the kind of talk that led to the Civil War , historians say . `` One of the biggest debates during the Civil War was how far should governments go in dictating our lives . We still debate those politics , '' says William Blair , director of the George and Ann Richards Civil War Era Center at Pennsylvania State University . The Southern answer to that question ignited the war . When they seceded , their leaders said that they were protecting the inherent rights of sovereign states . They invoked the 13 Colonies ' fight for independence . We wanted to be left alone . What actually caused the war was Lincoln 's insistence that , no , we ca n't let these people go . -- H.W. Crocker III , Southern historian Civilians reenacting war as a hobby Budget threatened Civil War anniversary H.W. Crocker III , author of `` The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Civil War , '' says Southern secessionists were patriots reaffirming the Founding Fathers ' belief that the Colonies were free and independent states . `` If the Southern states pulled out of the union today after , say , the election of Barack Obama , or some other big political issue like abortion , how many of us would think the appropriate reaction from the federal government would be to blockade Southern ports and send armies into Virginia ? '' He says men such as Jefferson Davis , the leader of the Confederacy , are American heroes . `` Jefferson Davis was not trying to force anything on the people in the North , '' he says . `` We wanted to be left alone . What actually caused the war is Lincoln 's insistence that no , we ca n't let these people go . '' Slavery caused the war , says McCurry , author of `` Confederate Reckoning , '' and most historians . Southern slaveholders invoked the Revolution while trying to build an antidemocratic slave state `` dedicated to the proposition that all men are not created equal , '' McCurry says . They also did n't want to lose the tremendous wealth generated by slave labor , she says . `` They felt confident because they were the biggest producers of cotton in the Western world at the height of the Industrial Revolution . '' Unleashing the dogs of war During the run-up to the Iraq War , former Vice President Dick Cheney famously declared that American troops would be welcomed as `` liberators '' in Iraq . Cheney made the mistake that political leaders have been making for ages -- he did n't know the enemy , says Emory Thomas , author of `` The Dogs of War , '' which examines how ignorance on both sides led to the Civil War . `` Cheney thought it was going to be France in 1944 , but it ended up Georgia in 1864 , '' Thomas says . Civil War leaders made the same mistake , Thomas says . Northern leaders like Lincoln did n't really think ordinary Southerners who had no slaves would fight in defense of slavery . Southerners did n't think Northerners were willing to go to war to preserve the Union , he says . And few on both sides expected the war to be so bloody and long . `` America in 1861 did n't realize what the hell they were doing , '' he says . `` They just were n't willing to think of unpleasant possibilities . '' We risk the same mistakes when we commit to `` limited '' military campaigns in places such as Iraq and , most recently , Libya , Thomas says . When President Obama announced a limited air bombing campaign in Libya , Thomas thought about the political leaders before the Civil War . Each incrementally committed to various military provocations , thinking events would n't spiral out of control . `` Once you commit to war , you do n't have any control over how it ends , '' Thomas says . `` It 's amazing how that sounds like Libya now . We may blunder into success , but we do n't know who these guys -LRB- Libyan rebels -RRB- are . '' The battlefields are quiet and even tranquil today , but the average Civil War soldier faced horror and exhaustion . Barack Obama is n't the first black president , according to some Southern secessionists . That would be Abraham Lincoln . He was called a `` black Republican '' and the `` Great Dictator . '' There was a reason a large number of Americans despised Lincoln during the war . Think of the nation 's recent `` War on Terror . '' Some Americans thought Lincoln used the war to ignore the Constitution and expand the powers of the presidency . Lincoln suspended habeas corpus -LRB- it gives a person who is jailed the right to challenge their detention in court -RRB- during the war and used military courts to arrests thousands of civilians . How do we treat American citizens caught attempting to bomb U.S. cities ? How do we clamp down on American citizens who preach overthrowing the government ? What rights do Guantanamo Bay prisoners possess ? `` It 's not just what does a president do against an enemy , '' says Blair , the Civil War historian . `` It 's what do you do against your own citizens to determine loyalty . That 's a big debate today . '' Lincoln skillfully addressed that debate , says Brian McGinty , author of `` Lincoln & the Court . '' He says Lincoln confronted unprecedented problems : The South was in rebellion , the nation 's capital was in real danger from rebels in Virginia and their sympathizers in Maryland . At one point , a mob blocked passage of Northern troops through Maryland to defend Washington . `` His oath of office required him to ` preserve , protect and defend the Constitution ' and he believed that the best way to do that was to preserve the Union , '' McGinty says . `` What good would the Constitution be if the country itself was lost ? '' McGinty does n't think Lincoln became a dictator . He says he allowed the presidential election to take place in 1864 . He worked with Congress . He asked military officers to arrest disloyal persons sparingly , and he never tolerated abuse of prisoners . Lincoln said his actions would ultimately be subject to the review of the American people , not the courts , McGinty says . `` He called the people ` The Great Tribunal ' and said that they would have the final word on constitutional issues . In the end , The Great Tribunal approved of what he had done . So , for the most part , has history . '' The Great Tribunal , however , has yet to render a unanimous verdict on the Civil War . A century-and-a-half after the war ended , people still clash over the causes and meaning . Blair says they still clash because the war does n't fit many Americans ' image of themselves or their past . `` The American story of our past has been a hopeful , helpful narrative , '' he says . `` But it 's hard for us to understand that there was a time in this country when the Constitution protected slavery , and it was actually legal . `` How do you insert the story of slavery into that ?

Rebel leaders Mustafa Abdul Jalil and Abdul Hafiz Ghoga said they would not agree to any plan that fails to include Gadhafi 's removal . The African Union plan , which Gadhafi agreed to in principle , does not provide any solution to the violence against the Libyan people , Ghoga said . Cheers erupted from supporters when the announcement was made . The leaders said the opposition remains open to any other proposals the African Union may make . Gadhafi had agreed in principle to stop all hostilities in his North African nation and allow outside forces to help keep the peace , his government and African Union mediators said Monday in a joint statement . Libya : Rebels hopeful with NATO 's help Wife of abducted Briton in Libya speaks Graffiti artist killed in Libya Gadhafi visits school in Tripoli The announcement came the same day UNICEF , the United Nations children 's agency , released a statement saying that at least 20 children -- some as young as 9 months old -- have been killed by shrapnel or bullet wounds in the city of Misrata . Ramtane Lamara , the African Union 's commissioner for peace and security , read the agreement with Gadhafi early Monday , flanked by Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim . -- An immediate end to all fighting . -- Libyan authorities ' cooperation `` to facilitate the diligent delivery of humanitarian assistance . '' -- The protection of foreign nationals in Libya . -- The start of talks involving various Libyan authorities , including opposition figures , with the aim of setting up `` an inclusive transition period '' to adopt and implement `` political reforms necessary for the elimination of the causes of the current crisis . '' The agreement , which the statement said Gadhafi had signed off on , states that the final resolution must consider `` the aspirations of the Libyan people for democracy , political reform , justice , peace and security , as well as social ... development . '' No timetable was spelled out as to when and if a cease-fire might take effect or the political transition might take place . In the agreement , Gadhafi does voice support for the `` deployment of an effective and credible monitoring mechanism . '' `` Leader Moammar Gadhafi expressed his full confidence in the African Union and its ability to successfully carry out the peace process in his country , '' the statement said . Gadhafi 's government has announced unilateral cease-fires before , only to continue to attack the opposition . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Monday that Washington is still `` waiting to get a full readout '' from participants in the African Union 's peace mission in Libya . NATO : No apology for Libya deaths `` These terms are non-negotiable , '' Clinton said . She also reiterated the U.S. position that Gadhafi needs to step down from power . The African Union 's special committee on Libya has representatives from Mauritania , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Mali , Uganda and South Africa . Gadhafi has been a strong supporter of the African Union and has channeled large sums of money its way . Libya also holds a seat on the 15-member Peace and Security Council , which Lamara heads . As such , opposition leaders had voiced doubt that any mediation involving that multinational group would end the conflict in a way that would satisfy their goals , which include Gadhafi 's ouster . The talks come as violence continues in the North African nation , where pro- and anti-Gadhafi forces have been engaged in bitter fighting since February . In Misrata on Monday , at least five civilians -- including two toddlers , a 75-year-old man and an Algerian worker -- were killed and more than 20 people injured in mortar attacks , two eyewitnesses said . Libyan state TV reported that `` colonial crusader enemies '' hit civilian and military positions in al-Jufra district in central Libya . After a series of setbacks driven by the advances of pro-government forces , Libyan rebel fighters recaptured the besieged city of Ajdabiya over the weekend after apparently holding off Gadhafi 's better-equipped forces . Amnesty International said Monday that it had fresh evidence of extrajudicial executions apparently committed by forces loyal to Gadhafi near Ajdabiya in recent days . Researchers of the rights groups reportedly saw the bodies of two opposition soldiers who had been shot in the back of the head after their hands had been tied behind their backs . In Misrata , NATO airstrikes hit parts of the city over the weekend , destroying 14 tanks , said a witness who did not want to be named for security reasons . NATO is operating under a U.N.

After WW2 all the German scientists , except for a handful who went to Great Britain , came to the U.S. and assisted us in our quest to go to space , whereas the Russians had no such assistance . I 'm still quite amazed . Although the US took the lion 's share of the scientists and records from Germany , Russia got their share of spoils in the way of scientists and records . Helmut Gr ttrup from Germany 's V-2 rocket program was moved to Russia after WWII is the first name to come to mind . Dimitri Ustinov Korolyov is the mastermind of the former Soviets ' space program , who developed the technology from captured German records with the help of Gr ttrup . Russia , just like every other major power following WW2 , used captured -LRB- not stolen , since it 's considered spoils of war -RRB- technology to get them where there are today . Good post , George . Do n't let these right-wing propagandists here fool you . Remember Operation Paper Clip ? That 's when the FBI went into Germany after WW2 to give some of these German scientists and engineers who were war criminals phoney IDs to get them out of Germany and over here to assist in our space and weapons programs . In fact , if Germany chose to to start a Manhatten project of their own before WW2 they would have been the first to have a nuclear weapon .

Of COURSE Kennedy gets one , thats where we LAUNCH from ! I think houston should get Endeavour , Kennedy is getting Atlantis , and Discovery should go to the Smithsonian . I believe sending a shuttle to the Smithsonian was a given . Giving one to Kennedy Space Center also another no brainer . But just as obvious was leaving one at Johnson Space Center in Houston ... the Space City . The space program is so engrained and entrenched in the fabric of Houston and JSC that the city adopted the nickname in the 60 's . Our basketball team is the ROCKETS ; the baseball team is the ASTROS ! If politics was the basis for this short-sighted decision , better political capital could have been gained with at least sending it to Ohio ... a swing state in the forthcoming election . This momentous day -LRB- 50th anniversary of manned space flight & 30th anniversary of the shuttle launch -RRB- is now sullied . This just shows the fraud about this invasion cnn keep calling civil war . Uk and Paris planned on invading libya on November 2 , 2011 . And did did with the US and UN helps ! I KNOW THIS POST MIGHT BE EXTINCT BECUASE I 'm monitored . But stop these lies about civl war because it is an invasion for oil ! It 's very sad and a tragic injustice . Good post , TOMAS .

NEW : Leading rebel official calls on international community to help Libyan civilians At least 10 killed in Misrata shelling , doctor says France and Britain call for intensified NATO attacks Ex-Foreign Minister Koussa flies to Qatar ahead of an international meeting Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Moammar Gadhafi 's military machine pounded the western city of Misrata again Tuesday as France and Britain called for beefed-up NATO airstrikes to stop such attacks on the Libyan people . Witnesses reported heavy shelling in central Misrata , besieged for weeks and the scene of some of the worst fighting in the Libyan conflict . At least 10 people were killed and 30 others wounded in the heavy shelling , a doctor operating in two central clinics told CNN . The doctor , identified only as Dr. Hakim for safety reasons , said medical teams are exhausted from treating the wounded . Rebel fighter Moaath al-Misrati told CNN the shelling came after rebels killed several of Gadhafi 's snipers . `` We are expecting a ground offensive by the Gadhafi forces any time now , '' he said . Opposition leaders : We want Gadhafi out Libya : Rebels hopeful with NATO 's help Al-Obeidy : ` Please do not forget me ' What drove Koussa to leave Libya The witnesses said all telephone communications , including mobile service , had been cut . British Foreign Secretary William Hague and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe both called Tuesday for NATO to get more aggressive in Libya , and a rebel leader issued a plea for the international community to carry out the U.N. Security Council resolution of March 17 , which calls for `` all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack '' in the North African country . Hague told reporters in Brussels , Belgium , that `` a huge amount has been achieved in Libya , but clearly there is more to be done . '' Juppe said NATO needs to fully embrace the role it accepted -- to protect Libyan civilians from Gadhafi 's forces . `` NATO wanted to take charge of the military operations , we accepted it , '' Juppe said on France Info radio . `` It has to carry out its role today , which means to prevent Gadhafi from using heavy weapons to bombard the population . '' Specifically , Juppe mentioned the attacks on Misrata , where on Monday at least five civilians -- including two toddlers , a 75-year-old man and an Algerian worker -- were killed and more than 20 people wounded in mortar attacks , according to witnesses . In Benghazi , Abdel Hafiz Ghoga , the deputy chairman of the Transitional National Council , issued an `` urgent statement '' calling on the international community `` to intervene and stop the massacres that Gadhafi promised in Misrata , and to implement the UN resolution in any possible means . '' Ghoga told CNN that the opposition has submitted a wish list of military equipment to Qatar and France . He said the list was compiled by rebel military leaders and he did n't know exactly what was being requested . Last week , when asked by CNN 's Reza Sayah which countries were providing rebels with weapons and training , Ghoga said , `` We are in communication with our brothers in Qatar and also with our brothers in the Egyptian republic and with our friends in Italy and France . '' He indicated in the interview that the weapons were on their way to Libya . Meanwhile , Libya 's most high-profile defector flew from Britain to Qatar Tuesday for talks on how to break the deadly impasse in his nation . Former Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa flew to the Qatari capital , Doha , to meet with government officials and Libyan opposition leaders ahead of the first meeting Wednesday of the Libya Contact Group , formed in London last month and charged with implementing United Nations resolutions . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will also attend . In a news conference in Benghazi , Ghoga did not explicity reject the idea of opposition leaders ' meeting with Koussa in Doha , but said such a meeting was `` not on the agenda . '' In an earlier interview with the BBC , Koussa had expressed concern that the situation in Libya was spiraling downward into a grinding war , in the mold of the conflict in Somalia . Koussa , who fled Libya last month and sought safe haven in Britain after resigning his post in Gadhafi 's regime , urged all parties to avoid plunging Libya into a civil war . `` This will lead to -LRB- much bloodshed -RRB- , and Libya will be a new Somalia , '' Koussa told the BBC . Koussa , a longtime Gadhafi confidant and a former Libyan intelligence chief , also told BBC , `` The solution in Libya will come from the Libyans themselves through discussion and democratic dialogue . '' did not explicitly reject the idea of meeting with Libya 's held a press conference on Tuesday and when asked if the opposition would be open to a meeting with Moussa Koussa - Libya 's former Foreign Minister - in Doha , the Deputy Chairman of the Transitional National Council did not explicitly reject the idea . He told reporters a meeting with Moussa Koussa in Doha `` was not on the agenda . '' An African Union attempt at forging peace fell flat when Ghoga and fellow rebel leader Mustafa Abdul Jalil rejected it on grounds that it did not provide any solutions to violence against the Libyan people . Gadhafi had agreed in principle to stop hostilities and allow outside forces to help keep the peace , his government and African Union mediators said Monday in a joint statement after a meeting in Tripoli . The African Union plan announced Monday did not address whether Gadhafi will step down , nor is it binding . According to the memorandum detailed by Ramtane Lamara , the African Union 's commissioner for peace and security , the plan had four elements : -- An immediate end to all fighting -- Libyan authorities ' cooperation `` to facilitate the diligent delivery of humanitarian assistance '' -- The protection of foreign nationals in Libya -- The start of talks involving various Libyan authorities , including opposition figures , with the aim of setting up `` an inclusive transition period '' to adopt and implement `` political reforms necessary for the elimination of the causes of the current crisis . '' U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Monday that Washington is still `` waiting to get a full readout '' from participants in the African Union 's peace mission in Libya . `` We 've made it very clear that we want to see a cease-fire , '' Clinton said . But she said there also must be , among other things , a resumption of water , electricity and other services to Libyan cities that have been `` brutalized by Gadhafi 's forces . '' She also reiterated the U.S. position that Gadhafi needs to step down from power . Ghoga , the Transitional National Council 's deputy chairman , on Tuesday said rebel forces were `` fighting in the direction of Brega '' from the western gate of the `` completely liberated '' city of Ajdabiya . `` Gadhafi 's forces still have some elements in Brega , '' he told reporters . `` We added more security personnel to protect the oil fields in the city because the regime is trying to strand us economically . '' `` The situation in Tripoli is very dire , '' Ghoga continued . He said fuel and food there were depleted `` because all fuel is being for the Gadhafi forces ' need -LRB- s -RRB- . '' Ghoga also claimed that `` thousands of demonstrators '' opposing the regime were arrested in the capital and that `` a large number of them were executed in the Saladin military academy , '' but did n't provide further details . CNN could not independently confirm those claims . He added that on Monday , `` there was a massive demonstration in Fashloum in Tripoli , and the majority were hiding their faces , fearing arrest . '' CNN 's Amir Ahmed , Reza Sayah and Ben Wedeman contributed to this report "}, {"uid": "392", "dct": "2011-04-12", "dates": [null, null], "text": "In this Q&A , CNN 's Fareed Zakaria reminds us that a de facto partition of Libya is better than a Gadhafi-ruled country , and he explains why foreign policy can not be applied consistently across vastly different countries . Amar C. Bakshi : How do you see us getting out of the stalemate in Libya ? Fareed Zakaria : I think that the mistake would be to say we re in a stalemate and the way we re going to get out is by keeping ratcheting up military force , because that just gets us more deeply and deeply committed in an area and with an issue where everyone agrees our interests are limited . How do we get out of the stalemate ? We keep the pressure on : We push for diplomatic and political solutions . This is not a great life for him . And so you ve got to hope that at some point he realizes that . Worst case scenario : the status quo is not so bad for the United States . It s not particularly expensive . We maintained a much more robust no-fly zone over Iraq for 10 years or so . People say , Well , it may mean the de facto partition of Libya ? Well , so be it . I mean , it s not particularly clear to me why a partitioned Libya is worse than a Libya run by a Gadhafi . If you want to be very cynical , you could say for a consumer of oil like the United States having lots of little oil producing countries is better than having a few big ones . On GPS this past Sunday you talked with former U.S. Secretary of State and Treasury James Baker about the U.S. intervention Libya -LRB- see video above and transcript here -RRB- . What struck you most about this interview ? What I was struck by was how uncomfortable James Baker was with the Libyan operation but how he seemed to recognize that he probably would have found himself backed into the same position Obama was . Here s a guy who was really a pretty steely-eyed realist who was very uncomfortable with the idea of an open-ended humanitarian intervention . But when we talked about how the Libyan opposition begged for it , the Arab League surprisingly and for the first time in 60 years endorsed it , the UN approved it with the Russians and Chinese abstaining , and the Europeans - France and Britain - pleaded with the Americans to help , it would have been pretty tough to say no. . And so it just gave me a sense of the dilemma that Obama is in . It s all very well to say - as Richard Haass has said on GPS - that Obama should have just stuck it out and said `` No , no , no. '' But when you re in that situation and it s your closest allies there that are asking and the Arab street is asking for it - even James Baker sort of ended up saying , yeah , I probably would have had to go in , but let s keep it very limited . And I think that is what Obama is doing . He went in clearly reluctantly and he s trying to keep it very limited , so I think that the trick will be in maintaining that discipline of staying limited while all of us in the media are going to clamor for action to solve the problem and win against Gadhafi because we view it as a game of chicken . We want to see Gadhafi blink . Violence is mounting in Syria . What should the United States do in Syria ? I think that in the case of Syria , it is n't such a bad thing for there to be instability . It is n't such a bad thing for the regime to be on edge . There is n't an easy path for the United States to do anything . I think when people say we have to be consistent everywhere , this is nuts . You re never consistent in foreign policy . You ca n't be . The circumstances are different . Each country is different . In the case of Libya , you had a Libyan opposition that had wrested control from Gadhafi of several key cities , had tried to create a kind of alternate government and was requesting a limited form of Western military intervention . None of that is happening in Syria . What you have is street protests that are being put down . Now if something similar were to happen in Syria where one part of the country was somehow to effectively try to secede and would be under the control of rebel groups and they were to come to the West and ask for some help - that would pose an interesting and difficult dilemma . I would say that in all of these cases my attitude has been we should support them economically , politically - we should stand with them - but using military power is a very , very dangerous game . You re inserting yourself into these very complex political struggles and you start taking ownership for the resulting political situation in those countries . You start taking ownership for those countries . Colin Powell s great line about the Pottery Barn Rule - you break it you buy it - there s some truth to that . The more you insert yourself militarily in these countries , the more you have to accept responsibility for the outcome . I should point out by the way that Pottery Barn insists that they do not have a rule like that and that , you know , people should feel free to To break what they want ? Well , if people do break things they are not going to be forced to buy them in the Pottery Barn . I ve never tested that theory . Probably now the partition of Libya is the best thing that can happen as long as it stops the bloodshed , thanks to NATO ! The West also has a moral obligation to drop it 's demand for a regime change there ! April 12 , 2011 at 3:42 pm | Reply Moral obligation ? Tell me the honest truth here -- have you seen what Gaddafi has done -- as has been reported in the international media , not just on CNN ? Do you really think \\* any solution \\* that allows that thug to keep power will be `` moral '' ? April 12 , 2011 at 3:45 pm | Reply April 12 , 2011 at 6:33 pm | Kevin is correct . Convicting the leader of a country of a crime and killing him without ever having a trial is atrocious morally , ethically , politically , socially and spiritually . That is what was done to Saddam Hussein . That is what is about to be done to Moammar Qadhaffi . The `` world community '' ca n't find enough evidence of wrongdoing to bring the Coloonel to an international court . They are therefore trying to get rid of him the old fashioned way -- assasination . This approach to foreign policy makes the people of Libya `` collateral damage '' as George W. would say . Ironic that we have killed more Libyans , by far , by establishing a `` no fly , creep , walk , drive or crawl zone , '' than we could possibly show have died had we not done so . We are killing off Libyan soldiers for defending their country . We are killing off Libyan civilians because we don ; t care if they die , as long as we can get their resources for our friends . April 13 , 2011 at 4:08 pm | Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , B.A. , J.D. `` The size of the lie is a definite factor in causing it to be believed , Ghadaffi has learned that the bigger the lie , the better the lie . Captured Ghadaffi soldiers tell how they were told that Israel and Al Quaida had invaded their country . Sounds like more fun than a conspiracy between Jewish bankers and the Communists ! Herr Hitler wrote : `` For the vast masses of a nation are in the depths of their hearts more easily deceived than they are consciously and intentionally bad . The primitive simplicity of their minds renders them a more easy prey to a big lie than a small one , for they themselves often tell little lies , but would be ashamed to tell big lies .

All this ignorance is getting repulsive to say the least !!! April 12 , 2011 at 11:51 pm | How about a real partition for Iraq ?? A trillion dollars down the drain , with nearly 5000 US lives lost , not including countless Iraqis . Three countries out one , before we spend another trillion dollars trying to keep the place whole . April 12 , 2011 at 9:50 pm | Reply I have been saying the same thing all along . Iraq does need to be partitioned into three different states , giving the north to the Kurds , the south to the Shiites and west to the Sunnis . The problem is that the right-wing thugs in Washington do n't see it that way !!! April 12 , 2011 at 11:45 pm | Here 's an idea , stop getting involved in a country that is having a civil war just because you want the oil to flow to Europe . Strange how the UN and US did nothing when North Korea killed innocent people on the ship they hit with a torpedo or the people they shelled on South Korean land . Oh yeah , no oil there . Also nothing was done with Iran who is building nukes and said they will take out isreal with it and kill everyone . Oh yeah , we do n't start with tough ones . Or China cracking down on protesters , killing them , and having tons of human rights violations . Oh yeah , we will send them an angry letter . In Africa they are killing each other by the thousands and even in Mexico but no oil there . However , in Libya we have to get this ruler out . I guess it was ok to blame Bush for going for oil in Iraq even though Sadam used poison gas to kills tens of thousands and this guy only killed a few hundred . This is for humanitarian purposes and wake up people , the `` UN '' is made up of like 40 % US forces . It is our troops and planes doing the shooting not just NATO . How stupid is this country ? April 12 , 2011 at 11:36 pm | Reply you know you should really research the whole situation before opening your mouth . If you launch a war against NK because of those incidents the ensuing war would result in the destruction of both NK and SK because of their close proximity . Also you do realize that even with the military capacity of the US it still cant be everywhere at once . Mexico we attempt to deal with but with a semi-failed government there is n't much that can be done short of invasion . The bloodshed in the other African countries did n't really spark Arab league request for UN support nor did they spark requests for US support . It is just plain ignorant for you to assume it 's about oil , if we were there for oil why are n't the US ground troops in yet ? Why are we supporting rebel groups that are rumored to have affiliations with Al-Queda ? It 's not always so black and white you ignorant prick . April 13 , 2011 at 2:38 am | No , what 's strange is your glaring omission that N. Korea possesses nuclear weapons and has no qualms about retaliating against SK by using them . In case you have n't noticed , it 's been the USA 's stance to not attack nations with nuclear weapons , since , oh , say , they were invented . April 15 , 2011 at 3:48 pm | NATO has caused the vast majority of bloodshed . Without NATO , the rebels would have given up weeks ago ; there would be far fewer dead and the people of Libya would be getting back to their lives instead of dreading continuing bloodshed . This is not a game . These are people 's lives . America , UK , French or Zakaria expediency justifies the loss of a single life . Far more have died because of NATO and UN interference than anyone can show would have died otherwise . If Qadhaffi kills a lot of people it is wrong . If we kill a lot of people trying to get rid of Qadhaffi , it is worse . Not only is Fareed not on the moral high ground , he seems to have forgotten what moral means . April 13 , 2011 at 4:13 pm | Reply to drive and to be happy about a partitioned Libya is like saying '' OK , Gaffy can mess up half of the Libyan '' . And if the West is really happy about this , then it 's like saying '' OK , we are happy about a stable supply of the half of your Libyan Oil '' . I can not believe Fareed was posing that '' Half is not that bad '' proposition . If we are true about helping the LIBYAN People , the end game is to drive a process leading to a CAPABLE DEMOCRATIC system in LIBYA , and if under a cleanly run election people can elect their wish , and if strangely one of the Goofdaffies got elected , so be it ... it 's a system we could help to establish , with the LIBYAN as input , a proper process , it 'll dictate the OUTPUT , which is not out forever handholding job !

In point of fact , neither NATO 's UN mandate nor its military actions encompass regime change . True , the US has called for regime change , but abet not via the current military operation . I think that most would agree that it would be best for Libya and the world in general if Gadhafi and sons did in fact go away , one way or another , if you catch my drift .

If anything is going to break Gaddafi it is going to be economic and diplomatic pressure . What sense then does it make to get jumpy and start partitioning things ? Perhaps the UN should ask the African Union to put more economic and political pressure on Gaddafi to convince him to `` gracefully step down '' . Would they not be seen much more favorably in the eyes of the Libyan people then ? And nobody has considered the issue of the Libyans in Tripoli who still support Gaddafi . How willing are they to accept a new interim government ? Will they be forced to move the capital ot Libya to Benghazi ?

We should have sent in special forces to lase and designate mobile targets , so the warplanes would know where and what to hit without collateral damage . This was fully-covered by the UN Resolution that said `` all necessary means to protect the civilian population , but no occupation '' . It would have been a very limited and short-term `` boot-on-the-ground '' operation that would have taken out Gadhafi 's military forces and allowed the opposition to take over and run things .

It murders trade , family connections , tourism , fragile medical supplies and makes life miserable for everyone in the country in unimaginable ways . Please do n't brush these things off as if they did n't have an effect on the people of the country . It causes hardships that give birth to deeper issues such as hate and revenge . It would be better to solve this crisis by using our brains instead of one thousand pound bombs or seeking quick fixes such as no fly zones . April 12 , 2011 at 5:55 pm | Reply Deryk .

Both parties -- the regime and the rebels -- are not interested in a divided country . The U.S. has done enough - Obama said it was a limited action . So you get out and take care of your finances instead . April 12 , 2011 at 5:55 pm | Reply Dividing Libya is not possible . One , all the people there are very unified in wanting Gaddafi gone . And Gaddafi is very insistent on killing anyone who wants him gone . Is the proposal to let Gaddafi kill off half the six million people in the country ? Saying to divide the country , without even mentioning any possible demarcation lines , does make the writer of such a suggestion look quite unaware of what is going on in Libya . Where would the dividing lines be ? You have Tripoli itself , which was mostly in demonstration against Gaddafi -- and is now being terrorized by Gaddafi 's mercenaries to a horrific extent . You going to give Tripoli to Gaddafi -- and let him finish off the population at his leisure ? Then you have Zawiya , a suburb just to the west of Tripoli . Zawiya has underwent some of the most brutal repression yet in Libya -- with not only countless dead and injured in weeks of fighting , but in thousands of kidnappings -LRB- followed often by torture and death in a retention area -RRB- There are still some people alive in Zawiya -- does the writer propose to let Gaddafi kill the last of the people off in Zawiya ? Beyond Zawiya , further yet to the west of Tripoli , lies Zuwara . Zuwara has seen lots of suppression , with at least a thousand kidnappings . Still people alive there too . More people that this writer apparently wants to just let get killed . To the south and south west of Tripoli lies many cities and towns in the hills there . And these cities and towns are all undergoing shelling by Gaddafi 's forces to some extent . So far , Gaddafi 's forces have not been able to get to the population for eradication -- but they sure are trying . Does this writer not care about these people ? And just to the east of Tripoli lies Misrata . A city of 300,000 . Hundred have died there from shelling of residential areas with over a thousand injured . A thousand kidnapped there too . Misrata is just barely holding on -- and the people have huddled up against the sea and ca n't move any further away from the shelling . 300,000 people is lot to just let die . 7 of the 8 largest cities rebelled against Gaddafi . Sirte , Gaddafi 's hometown has not rebelled -- but then again Gaddafi has the news of what is going on cut off there . So again , I ask how do you propose to partition Libya ? Give Gaddafi downtown Tripoli and Sirte ? While everything else around them , and all the east of Libya -- goes to the opposition . Let this writer give his own suggestions -- or do not write such a suggestion again . April 12 , 2011 at 6:08 pm | Reply Very well reasoned and articulated . I have no fault with it whatsoever .

He backed himself into a corner by not displaying that little thing we expect of a President : leadership . April 12 , 2011 at 6:46 pm | Reply I agree . What we should have done from the beginning is to use the early Afghanistan model -LRB- what we did when we brought down the Taliban gov ' t in 2002 -RRB- . We should have sent in special forces to lase and designate mobile targets , so the warplanes would know where and what to hit without collateral damage . This was fully-covered by the UN Resolution that said `` all necessary means to protect the civilian population , but no occupation '' . It would have been a very limited and short-term `` boots-on-the-ground '' operation that would have taken out Gadhafi 's military forces and allowed the opposition to take over and run things .

The civil war in Libya has been going on for less than two months . The important thing is to keep targeting stockpiles and supply lines , and seal up the borders so that Gadhafi ca n't import arms and fighters . At least keep it to a trickle . After a while , his army will simply run out of enough bombs and weapons to adequately fight . Meanwhile , let 's make sure the CIA trains up the rebels in basic combat skills . The opposition 's victory might not happen this month or next , maybe not even for a year , but as long as we give them the support outlined here I doubt they 'll give up .

Furthermore , your assertion that Syria should be left as it is does reflect the undertone of what the US has been doing for the whole time - it has been pursuing foreign policy that suits its own interest , in the guise of spreading democracy . At this time , it would be unwise for the US to engage in the MENA region . There are more important things , like providing insurance to the 48 million Americans who are uninsured or getting the 20 million illterate Americans on the path to education or providing more employment . In my view , the developed countries should start delegating military operations to an organization like the NATO or create a war council in the UN which will take care of such operations so that individual countries like the US does not need to get unnecessarily and unwillingly involved in others ' affairs .

How about finding facts before attacking , and giving time for any nation for correction , before we start bombarding ? So you are saying the NATO bombarding for humanitarian mission is successful , and not stalemate ? Do you think such mission of 10 years of no - fly zone , and 10 years of warzone of mass murder is good for our nation , or humanitarian ? Breaking the back of our country for what ? Is it worth to risk our nation s strength for killing one Saddam Hussein or for teaching one Gadhafi a lesson , or for their regime change ? We have to have better goal than leveling and fighting with these developing small nations ? You know , it doesn t have to be billion dollars elected president or seasonal power and money grabbing Prime-ministers in small and developing countries . One size doesn t fit everywhere . England may have luxurious Queen without performing , some may have president , and some may have established rulers as long as the majority of the people are willing to live with it . That is beauty of the world , a real freedom and democracy . I don t think , majority of Libyan people are ready to trust these unfamiliar rebellions than to Gadhafi . So the outside selection of a leader for any nation will only bring clash and death , and disaster to human sufferings . War is not like giving a candy to please kids , so even if these Europeans France and Britain pleaded with Americans to bombard , our nation must have preserved tolerance in its wisdom . However the fact is quite opposite . We have carefully witnessed the persuasive effort of Mrs. Clinton : the relentless flight for overseas , the unbreakable hand shaking with these European leaders until she pulled them to agree for her mission . And the action was taken like Tsunami , in no time creating disaster , without giving to express our opinion . In my view US interest must be focused on American s betterment than war making into Middle East . This is costing our nation more than we would have to pay for gasoline without war or bombarding . This reckless behavior is not recipe for humanitarian , but a contributor to our rising national debt . This is sad that even intelligent people like you hesitate to speak for the truth and supporting for long conflict . Let support for no-fly zone at all than for more robust no-fly zone . Let try that way and see how the sky will fall over our head ! Let not make war on hypothetical calculations . It wouldn t cost for humankind this much even if we proceed 100 times for peace without thinking than for war even after 100 times thinking over it . As important our life and my family is for us , it is that important for other too . So we should always pause and think before heading for mass destruction and casualties . I agree , war might boost media business temporarily , but if the nation plunges into downturn , it will be bad news for everyone and everything . Besides , we must not abuse other nation s freedom . We can condemn with words but not with bombarding ; moreover our call for moral must be maintained with the standard means to all the nations .

Delegates agree to set up a funding mechanism for the opposition The Doha meeting convenes as civilian casualties mount Ban Ki-moon : As many as 3.6 million people could need help in the Libya conflict The rebels have asked for arms Doha , Qatar -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Delegates representing Arab and African nations and NATO coalesced behind the Libyan rebels at a summit in Qatar on Wednesday , promising more humanitarian aid and money channeled through a temporary trust fund of sorts . Members of what is called the Libya Contact Group agreed that a temporary financial mechanism could provide a way to get money to the Libyan opposition . German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said participants in the Qatari capital , Doha , were discussing the possibility of using frozen Libyan assets for the fund . `` I think this discussion about the trust fund is very interesting , '' he told reporters . `` And we will look into it because the frozen international money belongs , if it 's government money , to the people of Libya . '' Abdel Hafiz Ghoga , deputy chairman of Libya 's National Transitional Council , the country 's opposition body , said Wednesday night that international delegates had agreed to make the funds available . Libyan rebels plea to NATO Al-Obeidy : ` Please do not forget me ' Ghoga said more than $ 100 billion in regime funds would be unfrozen and made available to the opposition , though he did not say which country or countries would release the funds , or when . He also said rebels requested that NATO intensify its airstrikes and protection of the civilian population . The funding decision came amid a grim assessment of the humanitarian fallout from the Libyan conflict and reports of mounting civilian casualties . United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the delegates that in a worst-case scenario , as many as 3.6 million strife-affected people could eventually require help , and that the money to provide that help has been slow in coming . So far the United Nations has seen only 39 % of the $ 310 million it requested in emergency funding , `` clearly insufficient given the prospective need , '' Ban said . `` It is critical that the international community act in concert , that we speak with one voice , and that we continue to work in common cause on behalf of the Libyan people , '' he said . The international delegates were meeting with Libyan opposition leaders in an attempt to work out a peaceful end to the deadly impasse in the North African nation . Despite a NATO-led aerial campaign and rebels fighting on the ground , leader Moammar Gadhafi has shown no signs of acquiescing . Among the high-profile attendees in Doha is Gadhafi 's former intelligence chief and foreign minister , Moussa Koussa , who fled to Britain last month . Ghoga said Koussa was not invited to any of the meetings , however . `` Nobody from the National Transitional Council even considered meeting up with him , '' Ghoga said . `` It is our belief that Moussa Koussa was seeking to get residency in Doha , or future residency . '' Rebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah had said the opposition was open to meeting with Koussa if he first made clear , in writing , what he has to offer . The Libyan Contact Group was formed after a London conference on Libya last month . The first meeting in Doha comes as civilian casualties continued to mount . The besieged western city of Misrata has been especially vulnerable . Gadhafi 's tanks have been pounding the city , where several more people were killed Wednesday , Abdulmolah said . Tuesday , a doctor told CNN , at least 10 people were killed and 30 were wounded . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday that Gadhafi 's forces have reportedly destroyed crucial food supply warehouses in Misrata and cut off water and power to the city `` in an apparent attempt to starve -LRB- residents -RRB- into submission . '' Snipers have targeted Misrata residents seeking medical attention , she said . A military official said on state-run television that NATO `` airstrikes hit Misrata 's main road of Tripoli Street , resulting in civilian casualties . '' The official said the towns of al-Sbai ` ah , Aziziyah and Sirte were also hit by `` the colonial crusader enemy . '' U.S. fighter jets have continued to fly bombing missions in the NATO-led campaign , Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan said Wednesday , although U.S. officials had previously indicated in public comments that the U.S. mission had become limited to providing support , including refueling and electronic jamming . Lapan said the U.S. aircraft assigned to NATO are ordered to defend the pilots who are enforcing the no-fly zone , and nothing more . NATO , he said , must still request U.S. strike aircraft should they want them for offensive operations . British Foreign Secretary William Hague and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe both called Tuesday for NATO to get more aggressive with the airstrikes in Libya , and opposition members urged the international community to implement the U.N. Security Council resolution that calls for `` all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack . '' Libyan National Transitional Council member Ali Issawi said the rebels should be supported with military supplies . He said the Libyan people ought to have the right to defend themselves . Ghoga said the opposition has submitted a wish list of military equipment to Qatar and France . He said the list was compiled by rebel military leaders , but he did n't know exactly what was being requested . `` I do n't think there 's going to be a problem in getting military equipment in , '' Ghoga said . Qatari Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani , a co-chair of Wednesday 's meeting , said the opposition 's international allies will consider the needs . `` Of course we will look at it and make things available for the Libyan people to defend themselves , '' he said . Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim accused Qatar late Wednesday of providing rebels in eastern Libya with Milan anti-tank warheads , but he did not say when . There was no immediate response from the Qatari government . A week ago , a CNN team in eastern Libya saw the rebels with Milan anti-tank missiles , which they did n't have before . Fighters said they obtained the missiles from the transitional government in Benghazi but did n't know where they came from . MBDA , the multinational missile manufacturer that makes the Milan missile , says it is in service in 43 countries around the world . It does not list those countries , but the military analysis site GlobalSecurity.org says the Milan missiles are used by the Qatari armed forces . `` The message to Gadhafi is clear , '' the Qatari prime minister said . `` He should use his head and those who are around him should advise him that it is in the interest of Libya , and if he is interested in Libya , then he should relinquish power and leave the Libyan people to decide their own destiny . '' Hague said arming the rebels would not necessarily mean violating an arms embargo imposed on Libya . `` We understand the resolutions to mean the arms embargo applies to the whole of Libya , but that in certain circumstances it is possible , consistent with those resolutions , to provide people with the means to defend the civilian population , '' he said . The Doha meeting follows an effort earlier this week by the African Union to forge a peace plan that had been accepted in principle by Gadhafi . Ghoga and fellow rebel leader Mustafa Abdul Jalil rejected it on grounds that it did not provide any solutions to violence against the Libyan people . Meanwhile in Germany , the foreign ministry said it had summoned the Libyan ambassador to inform him of the expulsion of five Libyan diplomats . They will have to leave Germany within seven days because of accusations that they intimidated Libyan citizens in Germany .

Hopes for a Libyan cease-fire were raised briefly this week when it was announced that longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi had agreed , in principle , to the African Union 's `` road map '' proposal for peace . Gadhafi 's opposition later rejected the proposal , but its leaders said they would be open to any other proposals the African Union might make . African Union delegates join an international conference on Libya 's future on Wednesday . Could the African Union be the key to peace in Libya ? What is the African Union , anyway ? Here 's what you need to know : 1 . The African Union is relatively new . The African Union was formed in 2002 , replacing the Organization for African Unity , which had been in place since 1963 . Its membership is composed of every African nation except Morocco , which withdrew from the OAU in 1984 because it took exception to the OAU 's inclusion of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic . `` The main overriding idea was to give more prominence to Africa , to make it an organization that had real teeth , that could push Africa on the international stage , that gave it a more unified voice to Africans , '' said Richard Downie , deputy director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies . The diplomatic boost is just one of the reasons the African Union was created . Economic prosperity was another -- the African Union is working toward the formation of a central bank and its own currency similar to the euro -- and there was a desire for Africa to be able to respond to its own security crises with peacekeeping troops and humanitarian aid . `` The idea going forward is that the AU will take more of a lead in trying to come up with solutions to Africa 's security problems rather than relying on the international community or the United Nations , '' Downie said . The African Union has been more effective than its predecessor . The African Union seems to have taken a much more active role than the Organization for African Unity ever did , implementing policies to reduce poverty and corruption .

Emir says `` it 's possible '' rebels have received Qatari weapons Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Moammar Gadhafi 's forces Thursday pounded the strategic port of Misrata , his sole daughter defied the coalition and the three leaders of that alliance declared the Libyan leader `` must go and go for good . '' To the west , in Tripoli , antiaircraft fire followed several thunderous explosions , and Libyan state television reported civilian casualties from NATO airstrikes . The attacks came as the alliance chief asked for more precision fighter jets in order to avoid civilian deaths . At a NATO summit in Berlin , Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters that NATO has the necessary assets to continue aerial strikes , but the tactical nature of the fight has changed . `` Now they hide their heavy arms in populated areas , where before many targets were easier to get to , '' Rasmussen said . `` To avoid civilian casualties , we need very sophisticated equipment . So , we need a few more precision fighter ground-attack aircraft for air-to-ground missions . '' With the conflict at a deadly impasse , Britain and France have been pressuring NATO to step up airstrikes . In a joint op-ed that will appear Friday in three European newspapers , U.S. President Barack Obama , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron wrote about their vision of Libya 's `` pathway to peace . '' Is NATO doing enough in Libya ? Libyan rebels plea to NATO `` We are convinced that better times lie ahead for the people of LIbya , '' they wrote . They likened the fighting in Misrata to a `` medieval siege . '' The White House released text of the opinion piece , which called on the Libyan troops to return to their barracks . `` Our duty and our mandate under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 is to protect civilians , and we are doing that . It is not to remove -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- by force . But it is impossible to imagine a future for Libya with -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- in power , '' the three wrote . `` The International Criminal Court is rightly investigating the crimes committed against civilians and the grievous violations of international law . It is unthinkable that someone who has tried to massacre his own people can play a part in their future government . '' Gadhafi 's daughter , Ayesha , speaking to a cheering crowd in Tripoli , said the United States tried to kill her and other children in 1986 . `` In 1911 , Italy attacked my country and killed my -LRB- great - -RRB- grandfather , '' she said . `` Now in 2011 , they 're trying to kill my father . '' `` My father once said that ` if the Libyan nation does n't want me , then I do n't deserve to live , ' '' Ayesha Gadhafi said . `` The Libyans answered him in a united voice : ` Those who do n't want you do n't deserve to live ! ' '' Ayesha Gadhafi also said rebel forces were being wrongly portrayed . `` Who are those civilians that you 're trying to protect while killing us ? Are they those who hold RPGs and other weapons ? '' The emir of Qatar , meanwhile , told CNN `` it 's possible '' weapons provided by his state have reached Libyan rebels in the past two days . Hamad bin Khalifa told `` The Situation Room '' that the opposition first must be trained in use of the weapons . Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim accused Qatar late Wednesday of providing rebels in eastern Libya with anti-tank warheads , but he did not say when . A week ago , a CNN team in eastern Libya saw the rebels with anti-tank missiles , which they did n't have before . Rebels near Ajdabiya were beginning to show signs of discipline and have received new equipment , CNN 's Ben Wedeman reported . Despite the enhanced organization , they were not ready to take the offensive . In Misrata , at least 23 people were killed and more than 100 were wounded in the dawn attack at the port and a nearby residential area , said the director of one of the four clinics open in the city . He said at least 700 people have died since the violence erupted in Misrata in February The attacks Thursday destroyed a cement factory and cargo containers at the Misrata port , where a medical aid ship was expected to dock , residents said . `` If people do not die here from shelling , they will die from starving since Gadhafi is preventing aid from arriving to the port , '' said Mohammed , a medical assistant . He said the shelled port had reopened and did not sustain major damage . Misrata residents interviewed by CNN did not want to be identified because of security reasons . CNN could not independently verify the reports but the International Organization for Migration said it chartered an 800-person-capacity boat to evacuate at least 6,000 stranded migrant workers in Misrata , many of whom have been living in warehouses with little food and a lot of fear . The organization said the boat was carrying hundreds of tons of medical aid to Misrata and was en route to the port . `` From reports on the ground , this rescue mission can not come soon enough , '' an IOM worker on the boat said in a news release . `` It is going to be heartbreaking not being able to take everyone out at once . '' Misrata has been under siege for weeks . Reports of civilian casualties streamed in Tuesday and Wednesday . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that in addition to Misrata , the situation also is particularly grave in the cities of Zintan and al-Brega because of critical food and water shortages . Rebels have pushed back the battle lines in the east from the war-weary city of Ajdabiya toward al-Brega . `` We are also deeply concerned with the fate of third-country nationals who are trapped in the areas of fighting , '' Ban said at an Arab League meeting on Libya in Cairo . `` As the fighting rages , the situation will only get worse and the more distant a political solution . '' International delegates attending a meeting on Libya Thursday in Qatar again urged Gadhafi to step down immediately . But the Libyan strongman has shown no signs of backing down . State-run television aired video Thursday of Gadhafi hanging out of the sunroof of a sport utility vehicle and waving to other cars and people on the streets .

NEW : Libyan government denies the charge Most nations have banned cluster munitions Opposition demonstrators in Benghazi say they may fail without more NATO support Rebels say they are advancing toward al-Brega Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi have fired cluster munitions into residential areas in the besieged western city of Misrata , Human Rights Watch said Friday . A spokesman for the Libyan government denied the charge . The organization said in a statement that it had seen three cluster munitions explode over the el-Shawahda neighborhood of Misrata on Thursday night . Researchers inspected debris from a cluster submunition and interviewed witnesses to two other apparent cluster munitions strikes , the statement said . HRW inspected the submunition , which it said had been discovered by a New York Times reporter , and determined that it was a Spanish-produced MAT-120 120mm mortar projectile , which opens in the air and releases 21 submunitions across a wide area . The submunitions explode on contact , disintegrating into molten metal that can strike people and penetrate armored vehicles , it said . `` It 's appalling that Libya is using this weapon , especially in a residential area , '' said Steve Goose , arms division director at Human Rights Watch . `` They pose a huge risk to civilians , both during attacks because of their indiscriminate nature and afterward because of the still-dangerous unexploded duds scattered about . '' Most nations have banned their use through the Convention on Cluster Munitions , which became international law in August . NATO : Give Gadhafi 's assets to rebels `` Libya needs to halt the use of these weapons immediately , and take all steps to ensure that civilians are protected from the deadly remnants they have left behind , '' Goose said . Human Rights Watch said cluster munitions were used about a kilometer from the battle line between rebel and government forces and appear to have landed about 300 meters from Misrata Hospital . But the organization , citing security concerns , said it could not inspect the impact sites and had not determined whether any civilians were hurt . A spokesman for the Libyan government said the charge was not true . `` We would never use such weapons against Libyan people , '' Musa Ibrahim said . `` Also , the world is watching , so we just could not do it . '' The charge came as Western leaders described a `` medieval siege '' Friday on Misrata , which has been pounded for days by Gadhafi 's mortar and artillery rounds . Some 1,200 of the more than 8,000 migrants stranded in the besieged city were rescued Friday by the International Organization for Migration -LRB- IOM -RRB- . The group chartered a boat to pluck them from the war-torn port city and deliver them to the Libyan rebel stronghold of Benghazi in the eastern part of the country . The aid group said the migrants were from various nations and included women and children . All were weak and dehydrated . Medical agencies set up a small hospital on deck . The IOM identified 8,300 migrants living in the open around the Misrata port without adequate food or medical care as the city came under regular fire . The group hopes to send back the chartered boat to evacuate a second round of people if it receives enough donations . `` This is a terrible situation , '' said Pasquale Lupoli , the group 's Middle East representative . `` They are the forgotten victims of the crisis and should n't be . '' In Benghazi , about 2,000 anti-Gadhafi demonstrators held up signs and shouted slogans that made it clear they are still fighting for Gadhafi 's removal . `` Gadhafi Go to Hell , '' read one . `` Thanks for USA and NATO and France and UK , '' read another . But several participants voiced concern that the NATO efforts were not enough , telling CNN that without more support , they may fail . `` They did n't do anything , the NATO , '' one man said . `` We want more support from the United States of America , more power , more support for our people , '' said another . The military deadlock in Libya between Gadhafi 's forces and rebels shows little sign of resolution . Western powers have said repeatedly that airstrikes were intended to fulfill a United Nations mandate to protect civilians . However , in a joint opinion piece that appeared Friday in three European newspapers , U.S. President Barack Obama , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister David Cameron wrote about better times once there is a regime change . `` Our duty and our mandate under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 is to protect civilians , and we are doing that , '' they wrote . `` It is not to remove -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- by force .

'' The leaders likened the fighting in Misrata to a medieval siege and called on Libyan troops to return to their barracks . `` We are convinced that better times lie ahead for the people of Libya , '' they wrote . Opposition forces kept up the fight Friday , saying they had pushed west from Ajdabiya to the town of al-Brega , which has changed hands several times and appears to remain under the control of Gadhafi loyalists . Warplanes were heard Friday over Ajdabiya , but CNN could not independently verify the rebel advance . The debate over NATO 's strategy in Libya buzzed at high-level meetings this week in Europe as well as in Qatar , host of the first gathering of the international Libya Contact Group , charged with mapping out peace for Libya .

In the city under siege from Moammar Gadhafi 's forces and mostly inaccessible for journalists , other than those on government-organized tours , residents reported disturbing new developments Saturday . An opposition council member told CNN that loyalists were using bombs that look like perfume bottles . Photographs suggested they were shells fired from a grenade launcher that either did not explode on impact or were deliberately masked and placed in populated areas . Either way , they were proving lethal . The council member said Saturday that people have had their limbs blown off and children have been killed . Gadhafi accused of using illegal weapons The report comes a day after Human Rights Watch reported its members saw three cluster bombs explode Thursday night over Misrata 's el-Shawahda neighborhood . Researchers with the activist group inspected debris and interviewed witnesses about two other apparent cluster bombings , the report said . `` We hear explosions that sound like one big explosion followed by many smaller ones . We were told this is a cluster bomb , '' said the council member . He , like many other Libyans , did not want to be identified for safety reasons . The Libyan government has denied the use of such bombs , which are banned internationally because of their indiscriminate nature and ability to harm civilians even after a conflict ends . Ahmed Hassan of the Misrata opposition council said at least five people were killed and 44 others were wounded Saturday , after one witness saw a hail of rockets fall on the central Libyan city . Gadhafi 's forces also bombed several food and dairy production factories , including ones that produce milk and oil , Hassan said . Terrified residents are going out in groups of 20 or 30 to fetch bread . They are too scared to venture out alone . `` No one and nowhere is safe in Misrata , '' Hassan said . Medecins Sans Frontieres said Saturday that it had evacuated nearly 100 people by boat from Misrata . Most were suffering war-related injuries . The boat arrived in Zarzis , Tunisia , on Saturday . The international medical humanitarian group -LRB- known as Doctors Without Borders in English -RRB- said ongoing fighting has cut off people from medical assistance and hospitals and clinics are overwhelmed with casualties . `` For weeks now , health structures have been struggling to cope with the influx of patients , '' said Dr. Morten Rostrup , an MSF doctor who participated in the evacuation . `` With the latest heavy bombardments in Misrata , the situation is worsening as hospitals have to discharge patients before their treatment is completed in order to treat those wounded by fighting , '' Rostrup said in a statement . The International Organization for Migration said Saturday that a chartered boat filled with hundreds of tons of humanitarian aid was heading to Misrata . The group 's first boat rescued 1,200 migrant workers and their families who had been stranded around the city 's port , which has been bombarded daily by Gadhafi 's forces according to witnesses . Deeper inside the city , witnesses for weeks have reported dire conditions , including food shortages and the persistent fear of pro-Gadhafi snipers taking aim at anyone walking on the streets . A clinic director told CNN at least 700 people have died since the violence erupted in Misrata two months ago . Meanwhile , a Misrata opposition council member accused Gadhafi of using Libyan state television as an effective command-and-control center after NATO airstrikes damaged lines of communications and made troop control difficult . The council member said Gadhafi has been sending orders to his troops through coded messages aired on state television and the rebels have been trying to decode them in order to defend themselves . He gave these examples : -- An anchor claimed that a bird laid a green egg in an area of Benghazi . The anchor hailed this as a miracle and a sign of an upcoming victory for Gadhafi 's forces . The next day that exact area was attacked by what the councilman described as sleeper cells in Benghazi . -- During the weather forecast , a map indicated a large storm over the port area of Misrata . No storm ever appeared , but the next day Gadhafi 's forces attacked Misrata by sea . -- An anchor claimed that a honey bee spelled out Moammar with honey in Darnah . Once again , it was hailed as a miracle and a sign of an upcoming victory for Gadhafi 's forces . The next day , sleeper cells in Darnah launched an attack . Despite weeks of aerial bombardment by international fighter jets , Gadhafi has shown no signs of acquiescing . He remains as defiant as ever despite calls this week again from global leaders attending a Libya conference in Qatar and a sternly worded newspaper opinion piece by U.S. President Barack Obama , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister David Cameron . But how to protect civilians has become an increasingly complex question . At a news conference in Benghazi , the deputy chairman of Libya 's Transitional National Council appealed to the international community to help prevent further tragedy . He said 1.5 million Libyans were under attack every day . `` We already have warned before that the regime was threatening real massacres against innocent civilians , '' Abdul Hafiz Ghoga told reporters . `` The international community is now witnessing what this regime is capable of . The destruction in Misrata and other cities is unacceptable . '' In Tripoli , four thundering explosions were heard Saturday evening -- believed to have been caused by NATO airstrikes -- followed by about 30 minutes of sustained anti-aircraft fire . Later that night , hundreds gathered outside Gadhafi 's compound in the capital , with some saying they 'd be willing to act as `` human shields '' as long as NATO warplanes targeted the manpower and infrastructure being used in support of the Libyan leader . `` Everyone here will die for Moammar Gadhafi , '' one young man told CNN . On the eastern front lines of the battle , rebels were still fighting to regain control of the oil town of al-Brega , which has changed hands several times already . `` We need weapons to defend our people , '' Ghoga said . NATO has said it needs more precision fighter jets because loyalist maneuvers have made airstrikes much more difficult without harming civilians . `` Now they hide their heavy arms in populated areas , where before many targets were easier to get to , '' said NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen earlier this week . `` To avoid civilian casualties , we need very sophisticated equipment . So we need a few more precision fighter ground-attack aircraft for air-to-ground missions . '' A witness in Misrata said NATO planes were flying overhead Saturday , but he had not seen evidence of bombing .

There is no hospital , '' said the spokesman , who wanted to be identified only as `` Mohammed '' for safety reasons . He said 23 people were killed and 104 were injured in shelling Sunday in Misrata . Another person was killed and nine were injured Monday , Mohammed said . `` The shelling and destruction by Gadhafi 's forces has not stopped since yesterday , '' he said . `` They are shelling mortar shells , cluster bombs and splinter mortar shells . The splinter mortar shells explode and throw lethal shrapnel , which has caused most of the tragedies . '' Conflict continues in Misrata , Libya Gadhafi accused of using illegal weapons The shelling was happening around residential and industrial areas of Misrata , the witness said . Monday 's shelling also fell on the city 's critical port area , Misrata 's lifeline to humanitarian aid . With a city hospital taken over by pro-government forces , makeshift clinics have popped up to treat the wounded . And in a city where access to food , water and electricity has been scarce , Mohammed said , people have been using cell phones for light during surgery .

Gadhafi 's forces are not threatened by NATO anymore . The NATO planes are circulating as the destruction continues . '' As the battle between pro-Gadhafi forces and rebels demanding an end to Gadhafi 's four-decade rule forges ahead , a United Nations official said Monday that her meeting with Gadhafi regime members did not end with a promise to stop attacks . Valerie Amos , U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator , spoke to reporters Monday in the Libyan rebel stronghold of Benghazi . She said she visited Gadhafi regime officials in Tripoli on Sunday . `` Let me be absolutely clear . I got no guarantees with respect to my call for the overall cessation of hostilities to enable people to move , to enable us to deliver supplies , '' Amos said . `` I did get an assurance from the government to carry out a needs assessment in Misrata . '' She added , `` I have to say , in that instance , we got no guarantees at all that the violence would cease . '' Britain will help 5,000 people trapped in Misrata `` escape the besieged city and will provide vital medical assistance to those who remain in towns across western Libya , '' the UK Mission to the United Nations announced Monday . The evacuations `` will get foreign workers who have managed to reach Misrata 's port safely out of the town , '' the mission said in a statement . Meanwhile , a British official met with U.N. leaders Monday to discuss the humanitarian crisis in Libya . `` Agencies working inside -LRB- Misrata -RRB- report shortages of critical supplies and attacks targeted against civilians and medical facilities , '' according to a statement from the UK 's Department for International Development . The statement said International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell would travel to the United Nations for `` urgent talks '' Monday . Misrata is n't the only city deluged by violence . On Sunday , forces loyal to Gadhafi shelled the city of Ajdabiya from 40-50 kilometers -LRB- 25-31 miles -RRB- away , Libyan rebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah said . The loyalists who were targeting the city `` have no problem with the weather conditions there , '' referring to unconfirmed reports that NATO airstrikes were halted in the area due to weather conditions . Gadhafi 's forces were using missiles and mortars , `` and sometimes we feel that NATO wants to use any excuse out there so they do n't carry out their duties , '' Abdulmolah said . `` We ca n't understand -LRB- NATO 's -RRB- excuses . We want to save our population from being murdered by -LRB- Gadhafi 's -RRB- merciless death squads , '' he added . NATO did not immediately respond to a CNN inquiry about its operations Sunday . Earlier , however , the NATO press office said that it does not discuss ongoing operations and would not confirm or deny any reports . An official report from NATO said the alliance conducted 142 sorties on Saturday , of which 42 were strike sorties . NATO is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect Libyan civilians . The alliance has said Gadhafi 's forces started hiding resources in civilian areas , making airstrikes much more difficult to carry out without harming civilians . Misrata remained in control of the rebels Sunday , Abdulmolah said , though they were fighting about 200 to 300 Gadhafi troops inside the city . Rebel fighters pushed Gadhafi 's squads back to a shoe factory , from where they were shelling residential areas in the city , he said . NATO refused to bomb the shoe factory because it is a civilian facility , he said . In the end , the rebels pushed the loyalists out of the shoe factory , which they burned . Despite the incessant struggle , Abdulmolah said he was optimistic the rebels could overcome Gadhafi 's forces . `` We are confident that we will be able to liberate the city completely and rescue our civilians who are being targeted by the madness of Gadhafi 's death squads , '' he said .

Plans for increased Western involvement surfaced as Moammar Gadhafi 's forces shelled Misrata again Tuesday . Residents and refugees rescued from the city described a terrifying situation in the ravaged western city that continues daily to pay a heavy price in the Libyan war . `` The situation is very dangerous , every day the shelling is increasing , '' said a resident who was not identified for safety reasons . `` They are using more types of weapons , and people are wondering why NATO is not doing anything . '' The number of casualties was unclear Tuesday but at least 24 people have already died in Misrata his week , an opposition spokesman told CNN Monday . He said another 113 were injured . Rebel-compiled figures estimate that more than 10,000 people have been killed so far in the Libyan conflict and more than 55,000 have been injured . Medics overwhelmed by Misrata misery With a humanitarian disaster looming , the EU said it is ready to respond , but not without the blessing of the United Nations . An EU official , who asked not to be identified , said it is unclear how many troops would be deployed , though he said the number would be `` definitely less than 1,000 . '' The Council of the European Union agreed to the operation -- called EUFOR Libya -- earlier this month . If requested , EUFOR Libya would `` contribute to the safe movement and evacuation of displaced persons '' and support humanitarian agencies in their activities , the council said in a written statement . And Britain said it is sending a contingent of experienced military officers to the rebel stronghold of Bengazhi in an advisory role . The team will work with Libya 's Transitional National Council on how the opposition can improve military organizational structures , communications and logistics , the British Foreign Office said . It will also assist in the delivery of critically needed aid . `` This deployment is fully within the terms of UNSCR 1973 both in respect of civilian protection and its provision expressly ruling out a foreign occupation force on Libyan soil , '' Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Tuesday . `` Consistent with our obligations under that resolution , our officers will not be involved in training or arming the opposition 's fighting forces . Nor will they be involved in the planning or execution of the NTC 's military operations or in the provision of any other form of operational military advice . '' The moves raise questions of whether a greater international military involvement on the ground could emerge . The Center for Strategic and International Studies ' Stephen Flanagan said the British stance is another step up the level of military engagement . He said he thinks that the British forces are trying to give `` more coherence '' and `` greater capacity '' to the efforts of the rebels to provide their own defense and that the alliance is trying to find more ways to keep up the pressure . But he does n't think using ground troops to get in the middle of intense urban conflict and civil war is on the allies ' minds right now . Keeping the pressure on Gadhafi and letting his forces know that the coalition is well intact is the hope , even if the allies do n't want to fight house to house themselves , Flanagan said . At the same time , he said , `` it 's hard to speculate . If Misrata fell would there be a turn ? '' Another analyst , the Brookings Institution 's Michael E. O'Hanlon , questions the hesitance of `` casualty-averse '' Western democracies to provide aid such as military training . He thinks more aid might turn out to be bolder and more helpful than keeping the forces they are supporting with air power at arm 's length . He said the allies should n't content themselves with `` incrementalism . '' `` We may wind up providing some of the things we 're skittish about , '' he said . Meanwhile , Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said Tuesday that the international Libya Contact Group , charged with helping map out Libya 's future , will discuss ways Libyan rebels can facilitate the sale of oil from rebel-held areas to international outlets when the contact group meets in Rome next month . Transitional National Council President Mustafa Abdul Jalil , speaking with Frattini , reminded the world again of Gadhafi 's indiscriminate attacks in population centers . Aid groups have been attempting to pluck desperate people from Misrata , which is hemmed in by Gadhafi 's forces on three sides . The only escape route is by sea . The International Organization of Migration chartered boats to evacuate stranded migrant workers and Britain said it will help another 5,000 people get out . Mohammed , an opposition spokesman who wanted to be identified only by his first name for safety reasons , said Misrata residents are disappointed with NATO , empowered by the United Nations to use force to protect civilians . But Misrata had not seen NATO airstrikes in several days , Mohammed said . `` Gadhafi 's forces are not threatened by NATO anymore . The NATO planes are circulating as the destruction continues , '' he said . NATO , however , reported progress in its mission . As of Monday , it had flown 771 sorties and 1,110 strike sorties . The NATO operation destroyed seven ammunition bunkers in the Tripoli area and four air defense radars in the Misrata area this week , the alliance said , along with equipment in the areas of Zintan and Sirte , Gadhafi 's hometown . NATO has said Gadhafi 's forces have started hiding resources in civilian areas , making airstrikes more difficult to carry out without harming civilians .

EU reveals it would launch military operation in Libya for humanitarian assistance Troops would `` contribute to the safe movement and evacuation of displaced persons '' City of Misrata under attack on three sides by forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The deployment of foreign troops on the ground in Libya could boost the NATO-led mission to protect civilians , though opponents of such a scenario from within the coalition may be difficult to convince , leading analysts say . On Tuesday the European Union revealed that it would be prepared to launch a military operation for humanitarian assistance in the war-torn North African country if it is supported by the United Nations . The mission , featuring `` definitely less than 1,000 '' troops , would `` contribute to the safe movement and evacuation of displaced persons '' and support humanitarian agencies in their activities , The Council of the European Union said in a statement . Separately , Britain , France and Italy also confirmed they would be sending military officers to Libya to advise the rebels , though French Defense Minister Grard Longuet ruled out sending ground troops to fight alongside them . EU boots on Libyan ground ? Forces loyal to the embattled Libyan leader have been shelling the rebel-held city of Misrata with artillery , resulting in the deaths of at least 27 people , according to an opposition spokesman . The city is surrounded by Gadhafi 's forces on three sides , with the port area the only lifeline for humanitarian aid -- and escape . Hundreds of migrant workers have been evacuated from the stricken city on charter boats . According to Alexis Crow , of London-based think tank Chatham House , air power can only do so much to protect civilians on the ground in these situations . `` The examples of Mogadishu in Somalia , Rwanda , Bosnia and Kosovo will have played quite heavily in the minds of European policymakers , '' she told CNN . `` In trying to stop a humanitarian disaster one thing that has been learned from these experiences is that you have got to have a ` hammer and anvil strategy , ' which is airpower combined with a compliment of ground troops in order to stop things like ethnic cleansing happening . '' NATO has said Gadhafi 's forces have also started hiding resources in civilian areas , making airstrikes more difficult to carry out without harming civilians . `` Troops on the ground would be able to get a more accurate fix on targets and call in what is known as ` close air support . ' This would make the air strikes more effective , '' said Paul Smyth , an ex-RAF Tornado navigator and former analyst with the Royal United Services Institute -LRB- RUSI -RRB- . While admitting his surprise that an organization he described as a little `` timid '' militarily had proposed the plan , he said the use of ground troops is bound to raise questions about the original UN mandate in Libya , in terms of what is or is not meant by occupying force . `` Some countries have been open in saying there should be no boots on the ground , though I think this EU force would be acceptable under the current mandate as it is not an incursion . `` But it would be interesting if they wanted to make this a permanent move in terms of creating a safe haven for carrying out humanitarian assistance . This is similar to what was created to protect the Kurds from Saddam Hussein 's forces in northern Iraq in the 1990s . `` It would then become a peace enforcement operation . To do that there might be a case for underlining it with an additional mandate from the UN . '' Resolution 1973 was approved by the UN Security Council in March and authorized member states `` to take all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country , including Benghazi , while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory . '' However the prospect of sustaining casualties on the ground from snipers or roadside bombs -- threats that can not always be neutralized from the air -- would make governments nervous about contributing to this force , said Smyth . `` So many nations appear to have gone public already , adamant that they are not putting any boots on the ground in Libya . '' He said it would also be politically difficult domestically for these governments to change their mind and perform a U-turn , even if their aim is a humanitarian mission . British Prime Minister David Cameron told Sky News over the weekend that the UN-backed mission was clear : to enforce a no-fly zone and destroy Moammar Gadhafi 's ability to threaten civilians . `` We are very clear we must stick to the terms of the UN Security Council resolution . We must keep the support of the Arab world and I think that is very important to make sure this is done the right way , '' he said . Crow said the EU plan was also constrained by two things : the burden of responsibility and time . `` It 's the age-old question of burden sharing , '' she said . `` Who supplies the troops ? And if you 're sending them using the term ` humanitarian assistance , ' how long do you give it ? `` There is no stomach for long-term campaigns among the voting public in coalition countries . It could easily turn into a conflict resolution or stabilization mission as the line between objectives becomes blurred . If this is the case , how long do you leave troops there ? This makes me nervous .

NEW : Photojournalists Chris Hondros and Tim Hetherington are killed in Misrata Secretary of State Clinton is recommending $ 25 million in non-lethal aid to rebels Announcements from Italy and France came as the rebel council president met in Europe Libya 's foreign minister calls Britain 's move a step toward confrontation Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- France and Italy announced Wednesday that they will send military officers to Libya to advise rebels fighting for the ouster of leader Moammar Gadhafi and his regime . Following a similar announcement by the British government Tuesday , French government spokesman Francois Baroin said a `` small number '' of French troops was being sent to advise the rebels ' Transitional National Council . French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet has ruled out sending ground troops to fight alongside the rebels . `` This is a real issue that deserves an international debate , '' he said , adding , `` We are working within the framework of the 1973 resolution , '' a reference to the U.N. resolution that authorized action in Libya . `` You can not please everyone all the time , '' he said . Italy will send military advisers to train the rebels in self-defense tactics , Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman Maurizio Massari announced . White House press secretary Jay Carney said President Barack Obama was pleased with the coalition decisions . `` The president , obviously , was aware of this decision and supports it , and hopes that -- believes it will help the opposition , '' said Carney . `` But it does not at all change the president 's policy on no boots on the ground for American troops . '' Britain said its contingent of military officers will be sent to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi to serve in an advisory role . The team will work with the Transitional National Council to help the opposition improve its military organizational structures , communications and logistics , the British Foreign Office said . It will also help deliver aid . `` This deployment is fully within the terms of UNSCR 1973 both in respect of civilian protection and its provision expressly ruling out a foreign occupation force on Libyan soil , '' Foreign Secretary William Hague said . The United States is not moving toward sending military advisers , according to a U.S. military official with knowledge of ongoing discussions within the U.S. military . The White House remains adamant there will be no U.S. ground forces in Libya , though U.S. intelligence operatives remain there , the source said . The official pointed out that U.S. military advisers ' record in past conflicts is mixed . Perhaps the most obvious example , the official said , dates to the Vietnam conflict , when the U.S. military 's role grew from an advisory one in the first years into a full-fledged conflict . If the United States were to send advisory troops to Libya , it would then have to provide security , transportation , supplies and other gear , and would have to have units on standby for emergency extraction if the advisory troops ran into trouble , the source said . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday she has recommended that President Barack Obama authorize the U.S. government to send up to $ 25 million in non-lethal commodities and services to support Libyan rebels , including the Transitional National Council . She defended the work of the opposition . `` It was not a group that had been planning to oppose the rule of Gadhafi for years ; it was a spontaneous response within the context of the broader Arab Spring , '' she said . `` These are mostly business people , students , lawyers , doctors , professors who have very bravely moved to defend their communities and to call to an end to the regime in Libya . '' In Libya , rebel spokesman Jalal al Gallal called Wednesday 's announcements by France and Italy `` positive . '' `` We are pleased with the results , and I think it 's a prelude to more cooperation , '' he said . `` The more advisers we have on the ground , the better coordination we 'll have on the battlefield . '' The announcements from the European nations came as Transitional National Council President Mustafa Abdul Jalil was in Europe for meetings with leaders . `` I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the Arabic countries , in particular Qatar and the United Arab Emirates . Every Arab country has its own issues and maybe some were later than others in giving their support but we would like to thank the Arabic countries and the European countries , NATO , the U.S. , Australia and Canada and all those countries that are supporting this Libyan revolution . '' Qatar and the UAE are among the countries contributing to the international effort in Libya . Libyan Foreign Minister Abdul Ati al-Obeidi on Tuesday blasted Britain 's announcement that it was sending military advisers . In an interview with ITN , he called it a step toward `` confrontation . '' In the besieged city of Misrata , four people were killed Wednesday as Gadhafi 's forces indiscriminately shelled residential areas , according to an opposition spokesman who wanted to be identified only as `` Mohammed '' for safety reasons . At least 27 people have been killed and 142 have been injured this week , Mohammed said . Tim Hetherington , a photojournalist who was nominated for an Oscar for a gritty and harrowing documentary about the Afghan war , was killed in Misrata , the president of the agency that represented him said Wednesday . And Getty Images Staff Photographer Chris Hondros died Wednesday of wounds , a spokeswoman for the photo agency said . `` Chris never shied away from the front line having covered the world 's major conflicts throughout his distinguished career and his work in Libya was no exception , '' said Manager of Public Relations Jodi Einhorn . `` He will be sorely missed . '' Two other photographers , Guy Martin and Michael Christopher Brown , were wounded , according to the New York Times . Libyan Foreign Minister al-Obeidi said the government would consider a cease-fire in Misrata if it was on both sides . `` I think the only way is give peace a chance '' through a general cease-fire , he told ITN . But Abdul Hafiz Ghoga , deputy chairman of the Transitional National Council , rejected the offer , which he said would have included an interim government , free elections in six months and reform that would include Gadhafi 's future role . `` Gadhafi 's forces are the one 's who 've been asked by UN Resolution 1973 to cease fire . When he asked for a cease fire , he asked for a cease fire from strikes that are destroying his military forces , and if he wishes to cease fire then we have no objections to a cease fire . And as far as a political solution with the Gadhafi family still in the political scene of Libya 's future , this is an impossibility . '' He added , `` They have already made a statement that Gadhafi is not willing to leave and that he will stay here and fight until the last drop of his blood , and if that is his choice and that is the case , then the Libyan people will hunt him down , find him and charge him with the criminal offenses he 's created against the Libyan people . '' The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Wednesday said some of the Libyan government 's attacks on Misrata could go beyond warfare . A statement from the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights , Navi Pillay , said she condemned `` the reported repeated use of cluster munitions and heavy weaponry by Libyan government forces in their attempt to regain control of the besieged city of Misrata , and said that such attacks on densely populated urban areas , resulting in substantial civilian casualties , could amount to international crimes . '' Libyan leaders have repeatedly denied targeting civilians and insisted that the rebels are criminals wreaking havoc on the country . UNICEF , the U.N. children 's agency , said Wednesday that 20 children have been killed and `` countless others injured '' in Misrata alone . Among rebels , calls for help have been increasing each day . Aid agencies are afraid to enter areas such as Misrata , which is being targeted by Gadhafi troops , opposition activist Mohamed Ibrahim said . `` Some of them , they come . But most of them , they come near ... they hear the shelling and everything and they go back , '' he said . Aid groups have been attempting to pluck desperate people from Misrata , which is hemmed in by Gadhafi 's forces on three sides . The only escape route is by the city 's port -- an area witnesses said has also been shelled by Gadhafi 's forces .

This is where MC Swat , 23 , has been writing scathing lyrics about the Gadhafi regime ever since Libya 's uprising began in February . Libyan musicians and artists probably have a right to be wary of strangers . For decades , they say , they feared agents and paid informants of Moammar Gadhafi 's repressive regime who reported to the government any work they deemed hostile to the state . When asked what would happen if he rapped his anti-regime lyrics prior to Libya 's uprising , MC Swat said , `` I would be shot to death like Tupac , '' referring to the American rapper killed in 1996 . But here in Benghazi , the opposition 's de facto capital , there 's no sign of Gadhafi 's loyalists anymore -- or the fear that kept artists like MC Swat quiet for so long . A newfound freedom of expression has sparked an explosion in revolutionary music and art . Much of it takes place in a five-story building -- a government building turned cultural center -- that is steps away from the Mediterranean Sea . The building 's hallways are covered with art and anti-regime cartoons , and the rooms are often buzzing through the wee hours of the morning with dozens of young revolutionary artists at work . `` Tomorrow we will take over our land , '' MC Swat raps in his second-floor studio , his DJ and machine gun-toting friend by his side . `` Moammar , we 're coming with a mass revolution . '' A few doors down , 26-year-old Saleh Dreisi sketches a giant caricature of Gadhafi . On the third floor , the rock band Guys Underground practices its latest song dedicated to the revolution . `` When you get in this building , you 're going to find yourself in another world , '' said Marrawan Gargoun , the lead singer for Guys Underground . `` It 's like being Alice in Wonderland . It 's an amazing feeling I 've never had in my life . '' `` It feels like we 're touching freedom , '' said MC Swat , who often sleeps overnight in his studio . The revolution 's young artists say they represent the real Libya , and they bristle at allegations that Libya 's rebels include elements of al Qaeda and Islamist extremists . `` You can find men with beards , but they 're respectful Muslims , '' MC Swat said . `` They 're not terrorists . You can see they have weapons , but they 're fighting for our freedom . They 're not al Qaeda . '' Gagoun said , `` We were buried for 42 years , but this is the true Libya .

The decision grabbed headlines , but it won t do much to change the course of the fighting . British Foreign Secretary William Hague justified the decision to send military trainers by saying : As the scale of the humanitarian crisis has grown , so has urgency of increasing our efforts to defend civilians against attack from Gadhafi forces . Washington has applauded its allies decision , but it is not following suit . The Obama administration is only offering the rebels $ 25 million in body armor , tents , uniforms , and other nonlethal equipment . The British , French , and Italian decisions are a tacit admission that the prospects for ousting Muammar Gadhafi have dimmed . The rebels have failed in their effort to retake key Libyan towns . Meanwhile , the situation in Misurata , Libya s third largest city , has grown increasingly grim as pro-Gadhafi forces continue to attack rebel positions . But deciding to do something is not the same thing as deciding to do enough . The British , French , and Italians are offering far less than the breathless news headlines suggest . The number of advisers headed to Benghazi is small a maximum of twenty British advisers and perhaps ten or so French and Italian advisers . These trainers will operate under strict limitations on what they can do . Even if NATO flooded Libya with military trainers the military balance on the ground would not change any time soon . Crack fighting forces aren t built over night . Just look at how long the United States has been at it trying to build the Afghan and Iraqi armies . Advisers and assistance probably won t make a difference in the long run either . Pro-Gadhafi forces are relatively well-armed and trained . They also have good reason to continue fighting : the reasonable fear that they will lose their privileges if not their lives if the rebels prevail . So the most likely outcome is that the fighting in Libya will drag on for months . Will the rising civilian death toll eventually spur NATO to send ground troops into Libya ? Libya is not Vietnam , where the introduction of a few military advisers in the late 1950s eventually grew into a commitment of half-a-million troops by the mid-1960s . Although Vice President Joe Biden insists that the traffic -LRB- at home -RRB- can bear politically more in Libya , the polls suggest otherwise . Neither Americans nor Europeans are eager to send their fellow citizens to fight , and possibly die , in Libya . This highlights the fundamental strategic flaw in NATO s military operations . Washington , Paris , and London decided that Gadhafi must go , but they are unwilling to pay the cost to make that happen . Libyan civilians , precisely the people the NATO mission is supposed to protect , are paying the price for this strategic incoherence . The views expressed in this article are solely those of James Lindsay . Like I said before , only a stupid , crazy , amoral fool would say the England , France and Italy have ant right to be in Libya at all . I say a Libya for the Libyans !!!

I agree that there could be a more effective roll out of plans to aid the rebels but then we 'll be condemned for our actions in the end anyway . Personally ...

Though NATO has already shown a willingness to exceed the UN mandate , making such disobedience obvious is not in the West 's interest . NATO has no business in this war , except to get rid of a throrn in the side of the West . But that is not good enough under , if we truly believe in the rule of law .

The media is showing a picture of an injured child , yet this is only 1\\/100 ,000 th of the death cause by Bush s Shock and Awe campaign in Iraq . The media never showed pictures of the limbless children from Bush s war of choice . Does the media think Americans are that stupid and irrational that they can now get us to fight a war over what Bush did 100,000 times over ? Then the media tried to play on our sympathy for a dead reporter , but Bush intentionally attacked Al Jazeera and mudered a handful of reporters and not a peep was mentioned . Now we should be up in arms becasue one got too close to the fighting . When Bush had the Al Jazeera reporters killed , they gave their coordinated to the American military so they would not be attacked , and Bush used those coordinates specifically to attack them . The rebels are a force of 1,500 . Many are al Qaeda . They are not wearing uniforms and are placing civilians at risk by hiding behind civilians . This is an international war crime as is hiding behind civilians and in population centers . Why won t they move into the open and fight like an army ? They are not an army , nor are they representative of the people . They will never consolidate power without foreign occupation . The rebels represent less than .005 % of the population . The advisors ought to tell the rebels to flee . That should be their advice . War for regime change is an international war crime .

It was Libyan Rebels who decided they did not want external military on the ground and insisted on the Keystone cops option of arming untrained citizens with guns and specialized weapons and said go that way to fight an urban war . Completely reckless attitude to fellow humanity -- which resulted in the although every brave and committed citizens running up and down hills firing over the top = not even cadet standard resulting in inevitable horrific casualties . Also the Libyan Rebels position meant there was not ` on time ' coordination possible with NATO . The deaths are attributable to the Libyan Rebel Leadership anyone who is aware war is not a video game knows this to be the case . The fact is apart from the ridiculous Libyan Rebel military strategy the absence of Arab special services in significant or any numbers meant military engagements would bog down now we are seeing external military on the ground as predicted the nature of the war will change significantly with the inclusion of expertise and greater effective communication the life blood of effective combat outcomes .

April 24 , 2011 at 7:40 pm | Reply Moammar Gadhafi is a despot , demented moron , and murderer - an international shame for the 21st century - and should be executed quickly by Libya s , or foreign , armed forces even for the sake of saving their skins if not solely to save Libyan lives , while at the same time taking over and installing a temporary military government that over a period of 2 years could bring things back to normal , including oil flows . Needless to say , in the process , the armed forces there should be purged of any of Gadhafi s cronies so that the `` revolution '' continues to the benefit of the Libyan population . The only political system that will last forever , so to speak , will be a western style-type democracy . Apparently this truth has been realized by a whole new generation of Libyans educated within and outside of that country . The internet has helped bridge the technological gap and to come to full realization that their young lives were meaningless and had no future with corrupt animals like Gadhafi , and his family , in power . However , Libyans will not have freedom and dignity for a long time . They have to work at it , together with their armed forces that must see their role as only temporary - 2 years - until the country s new institutional basis is set up so that political parties can prosper in peace and without fear . Once this is achieved , elections must be convened so that regional-party political representatives can be elected nationwide with a view to integrating a National Assembly to draft a new Constitution for the country . This would be the beginning of a new future for the Libyan population . Meanwhile , if captured alive , the military government should prosecute Gadhafi so that the death penalty can be brought to bear on this god forsaken animal , and his family . His own and family assets , in general , should be confiscated in Libya as well as outside of the country . Those monies belong to the people of Libya . But more than anything , the world must congratulate the Libyan population for acting with great courage , with their hearts and minds , to try to topple a ruthless and corrupt regime from the face of the earth . Needless to say many more countries will follow , not only in the Middle East mainly , Yemen , Saudi Arabia , Bahrain , Syria , Iran , etc. - but also in Latin America , especially in the case of those with presidential lunatics trying to emulate the Cuban political system which under the noses of the USA and the rest of the Americas has failed miserably , i.e. , Venezuela and his gorilla Chavez . In general , the combination of authoritarian rule , high unemployment , poor opportunities for social advancement , demographic youth bulges , low public investment in education and health and other public services , and anger at high levels of corruption , and outright thievery , in the Middle East and North Africa , and in Latin America , will prompt public uprisings that will topple their leaders . Chavez , Saleh , Bashar are definitely in this list after their close friend Gadhafi moves on to better pastures ! Needless to say , the Cuban government also needs to be overthrown ! Instead , Presidents from these poor , backward economies , that have not even approached the take-off stage in economic development should instead concentrate their public administration efforts in fighting corruption , reducing the size of their inefficient and corrupt public sectors , and increasing public\\/private investments with the help of the multilateral financial community - including in the strategic social sectors ; i.e. , education , health , and basic services to increase employment . The UN Security Council s mandate for NATO to intervene in Libya and\\/or declare a well enforced no-fly zone will stop the slaughter of innocent people and thousands of Libyans will not be assassinated without reason - except to want to live in democracy and in peace - by Gadhafi and his obedient and unscrupulous followers . More than TEN THOUSAND LIBYANS HAVE ALREADY DIED in their fight for LIBERTY ! By having provided military support , the West has started to make peace with the people of Libya ! While recognizing that imposing a no-fly zone is an act of war because it has required attacking Gaddafi 's air defense systems , not just anti-aircraft guns and missile batteries , but also radar and communications systems . Nevertheless , this resolute and timely action must last for as long as it takes to overthrow him , even if rebel forces themselves fail to do so . Afterwards , Libya could be invaded with ground troops from Arab League Nations , mainly , and topple a weak , murderous , and corrupt regime that has only brought shame , blood , and tears to the Libyan people . Western allies should not look for asylum for Gadhafi . He should either be killed or captured to stand trial for crimes against humanity .

You have heard ` Libya produces only 2 % of the world 's oil ' That 's obviously meant to mislead : Oil reserves in Libya are the largest in Africa and the ninth largest in the world ! Please watch the Doha Debates : very revealing : Arabs should stay out of the conflict in Libya and leave it to NATO -- passed While many write of stalemate , I see the continued degradation of Gadhafi 's forces , with a formerly missing support for the rebels slowly increasing . Europe sitting on the fence , waiting for others to do their job is increasingly polarized by Italy having Gadhafi contacts for commerce , Germany , Norway afraid of inflicting Gadhafi civilian collateral damage , France acting cowardly and the UK doin what it can facing political opposition . The rebels have some army defectors but for the most part are shopkeepers , workers , unemployed youth wanting their freedom at any cost , holding off the Gadhafi equipped forces with nothing more than fish bombs , molotov 's and small arms . Give them some tows , more satelite comm , AKs , combined with getting the C130s into the air and this will turn around very quickly .

Obama said Qaddafi must go , and the only one who went was Obama for the hills . Obama was more worried about his election than doing `` the right thing . '' And Gates should have been fired long ago . He is just another Republican retread kept on by Obama to placate the MIC Repugs . Obama has been shamed by the other countries and is now sending in drones to help . The others , like Italy , are stepping up because they know that what is happening now is not near enough to win this conlict .

Oscar nominee Tim Hetherington and acclaimed photojournalist Chris Hondros died Wednesday while chronicling the gritty violence in the war-torn city of Misrata in Libya , their agencies said . Two other photojournalists were hurt in the incident , according to news reports . The International Organization for Migration ship , called the Ionian Spirit , was greeted by a number of young Libyans and about 20 rebel fighters . At the port , people carried banners reading , `` US and UK with your loss , you shared with us the price of freedom '' and `` US and UK your blood was mixed with ours in Misrata . '' Friends of the journalists remembered them Thursday as brave men committed to finding and exposing the truth even in dangerous conditions . Hondros had written an e-mail Wednesday `` basically saying that everything was fine and stable and he was enjoying his assignment and getting some good photographs , '' his friend Greg Campbell , who recently traveled to Libya with Hondros , told CNN . Gallery : Chris Hondros ' final photos Photojournalist Hetherington killed in Libya Two photojournalists killed in Misrata `` Every time you 're in an environment like that , I think in the back of your mind you 've realized that you may not come out of there , '' Campbell said . He and Hondros covered conflicts in Sierra Leone , Kosovo , and Nigeria together , he said . Hondros `` was always very , very safe . He realized the risks and he tried to minimize them as much as possible . So when I was traveling with Chris , we would take as many precautions as we possibly could . '' `` There are times , unfortunately , when you just do n't know which decision is right or wrong . Unfortunately , that 's what Tim and Chris found themselves in . '' Hetherington received an Academy Award nomination this year for `` Restrepo , '' a documentary chronicling the deployment of a platoon of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan 's Korengal Valley . It was co-directed by journalist Sebastian Junger . Employed by Panos Pictures , Hetherington also worked with CNN in Afghanistan two years ago . CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen described Hetherington as humble , modest and a gentleman skilled in the taking of gritty photos of combat . '' ` Restrepo ' was a labor of love for Tim ; he had a great deal of empathy for the young soldiers he documented , '' Bergen wrote . `` The resulting film is not only the best documentary about war I have ever seen , it is simply one of the greatest of all war films , sharing the epic quality of movies like ` Apocalypse Now ' or ` Full Metal Jacket . ' It is also very beautifully shot , revealing Tim 's great sense of picture composition . '' Hetherington 's last Twitter entry appears to have been made Tuesday : `` In besieged Libyan city of Misrata . indiscriminate shelling by Qaddafi forces . No sign of NATO . '' The journalists were walking in the front-line area at the end of Tripoli Street on the western edge of Misrata when a rocket-propelled grenade exploded , according to a town resident who wanted to be identified only as `` Mohammed '' for safety reasons . The group was traveling with rebel fighters , he said . Vanity Fair magazine , where Hetherington , 40 , was a contributing photographer , described him as `` widely respected by his peers for his bravery and camaraderie . '' Its profile says he had dual U.S. and British citizenship . Vanity Fair released a statement from Hetherington 's family . `` Tim was in Libya to continue his ongoing multimedia project to highlight humanitarian issues during time of war and conflict , '' it said . `` He will be forever missed . '' Hondros , 41 , suffered a fatal brain injury , according to The New York Times , which had a reporter in the hospital who spoke to a colleague at a triage center . Getty Images , Hondros ' employer , said it was `` deeply saddened '' by his passing : `` Chris never shied away from the front line having covered the world 's major conflicts throughout his distinguished career and his work in Libya was no exception . We are working to support his family and his fiancee as they receive this difficult news , and are preparing to bring Chris back to his family and friends in the United States . He will be sorely missed . '' Hondros , born in New York City to immigrant parents , won the 2005 Robert Capa Gold Medal from the Overseas Press Club of America for coverage of Iraq . He was a 2004 Pulitzer Prize breaking news photography finalist for `` his powerful and courageous coverage of the bloody upheaval in Liberia . '' Hondros ' work is featured in a multimedia exhibit slated to open May 7 in Chicago that features war images and is called Conflict Zone . At a panel discussion on war reporting in 2006 put on by the International Reporting Project in Washington , Hondros -- who had been to Iraq nine times by then -- had little sympathy for journalists who complained about conditions on the ground . `` I can talk about how I wish it was , '' he said , `` but , to me , the most important thing is just figuring out the way to cover it , which is what war journalists do all over the world . '' 2010 : Photographer goes inside war 2009 : Images of Liberia 's civil war He said he was disappointed to hear that news organizations were having a hard time finding volunteers to go to Baghdad . `` I understand it from a human level , but it 's kind of surprising to me from a personal , journalistic one , '' he said . Guy Martin , a British citizen working for Panos Pictures , a photo agency , suffered shrapnel wounds to the pelvis and underwent vascular surgery Wednesday night , according to The New York Times . Mohammed said Martin was in critical but stable condition . Photographer Michael Christopher Brown suffered non life-threatening shrapnel wounds to his left shoulder . James Hider , Middle East correspondent for the Times of London , told CNN the four journalists were documenting fighting on Tripoli Street in Misrata . Hider said he was at a hospital and saw Hetherington die in a triage tent . `` It was shocking . '' The journalists , including Hetherington , had traveled Saturday by boat from Benghazi to Misrata , enjoying jokes and making sandwiches for refugees , Hider said . Martin and Brown remained hospitalized in Misrata , Human Rights Watch said . The office of the White House press secretary expressed concern about the safety of journalists in the country . `` The Libyan government and all governments across the world must take steps to protect journalists doing this vital work , '' it said in a statement . The office said , `` Chris 's tragic death underscores the need to protect journalists as they cover conflicts across the globe . '' The Committee to Protect Journalists said four journalists have died in the Libyan conflict . `` Two other journalists have been killed this year in the Libyan conflict . An unknown gunman killed Mohammed al-Nabbous , founder of the online Libya Al-Hurra TV , as the journalist was streaming live audio from a battle in Benghazi on March 19 . Cameraman Ali Hassan al-Jaber was shot when his Al-Jazeera crew was ambushed near Benghazi on March 13 , '' the group said on its website . CPJ has documented more than 80 attacks on members of the news media since unrest erupted in Libya in February , including `` numerous injuries , 49 detentions , 11 assaults , two attacks on news facilities , the jamming of two international television transmissions , at least four instances of obstruction , the expulsion of two international journalists , and the interruption of Internet service . At least six local journalists are missing amid speculation they are in the custody of security forces . One international journalist and two media support workers are also unaccounted for . '' `` Our hearts go out to family , friends , and colleagues of Tim Hetherington and Chris Hondros , whose work in some of the world 's most dangerous places has had a profound impact on how we understand and perceive war , '' said Joel Simon , CPJ executive director . `` Their deaths are another illustration of war 's cruelty and a reminder of how devastatingly difficult coverage of the Libyan conflict has become . '' After Hetherington 's death , Jalal al Gallal , a spokesman for the rebels , issued a statement saying , `` This is no longer the Gadhafi regime taking on Libya 's people . This is Gadhafi taking on the world . He has spared no one , not women , not children , not journalists . This is now everybody 's war . '' CNN 's Saad Abedine , Joe Sterling , Chelsea J.

Mahoney has worked as a reporter and bureau chief for Reuters , reporting on politics and economics . He has covered conflicts such as the civil war in Liberia , the Palestinian intifada , the Iraqi missile attacks on Israel and the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin . -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It is a bitter irony that Chris Hondros , the prize-winning photographer killed in Libya on Wednesday alongside Oscar-nominated photojournalist Tim Hetherington , was to due to speak in New York next week on the dangers of covering conflict . I felt honored to be invited to sit on the same panel as him at the International Center of Photography , with other veteran battlefield photographers and their editors . The question for the panelists was essentially , `` Covering conflict : Is it worth it ? '' Each generation of journalists finds its own answers to that deceptively simple question . Advances in picture and audio technology , coupled with warp-speed mobile communications , have transformed newsgathering . But the essentials of sketching out the first draft of history , whether in words or in images , are the same . The only way to capture the truth is to get close to it . Despite powerful telephoto lenses , conflict photographers still work much like Robert Capa , who used a simple Contax camera to capture the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s . Hetherington and Hondros , who won the Robert Capa Gold Medal for his work in Iraq , understood the catalyzing power of the still image . Their work freezes the flow of blood or tears on a human face , rendering the real cost of fighting in Afghanistan , the Middle East , Africa and the Balkans . They knew that a single image , like the napalmed Vietnamese girl running from her burning village , can crystallize a whole war . Their work freezes the flow of blood or tears on a human face , rendering the real cost of fighting . That is why they were in the thick of bullets and mortar bombs in Misrata . Now , unfortunately , they join a tragically high honor roll of journalists who have given their lives to bear witness . The Committee to Protect Journalists has documented the deaths of 861 journalists over the past two decades . In that period , 150 have been killed directly in combat . Of those , about half were photojournalists or camera operators . Last year , 40 % of journalists who died in the line of duty were killed in combat-related crossfire and in dangerous assignments such as street protests . And this year , because of the uprisings in the Middle East , 12 of the 16 journalists killed worldwide have died covering combat or on dangerous assignments . Libya , with four combat deaths and brutal detentions of journalists , is especially dangerous for the press . The fighting is chaotic , with fluid or nonexistent front lines . Irregulars , soldiers without uniforms , pro-Gadhafi forces moving among civilians and firing into populated urban areas , all make for a deadly maze through which unprotected journalists must thread a path . Unlike the U.S.-prosecuted wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , journalists in Libya are not embedded with any military . Hetherington and Hondros had worked as both `` embeds '' and unilaterals , the military jargon for those journalists who go it alone . It was extremely difficult , if not impossible , to cover the fighting in both U.S. theaters without the army . Hetherington turned this to his advantage brilliantly by co-directing the 2010 Oscar-nominated '' Restrepo , '' a film about a year spent on a forward operating base in Afghanistan with U.S. troops . Libya , with four combat deaths and brutal detentions of journalists , is especially dangerous for the press . Hetherington and Hondros knew from training and experience how to handle themselves in combat . As a photojournalist , you learn where to stand to shoot , what to wear , how to approach combatants , how to hire a driver , a fixer , an interpreter , how to choose a hotel , and on and on . Any journalist may wear a bulletproof vest and a helmet . But in the end , reporters are exposed . Mortar rounds and rocket-propelled grenades like those whizzing through the streets of Misrata are no respecters of Kevlar chest plates . Hetherington and Hondros were not alone . Two other colleagues with them on the street were wounded in the same attack . To the east , still other photographers and reporters are missing or in detention , grabbed by pro-Tripoli forces . In the eight weeks since this civil war erupted , the Committee to Protect Journalists has documented more than 80 attacks on the press , including the killing of a cameraman for Al-Jazeera and reporter for Libya Al-Hurra TV . As of today , 17 journalists are missing or in detention , among them three photojournalists : Spaniard Manuel Varela , European Pressphoto Agency ; South African Anton Hammerl , Christian Science Monitor ; and American James Foley , Global Post . We never will get to hear Chris Hondros ' thoughts on covering war next week at the International Center of Photography . He already gave his answer by venturing onto Tripoli Street in Misrata with his camera . "}, {"uid": "328", "dct": "2011-04-21", "dates": ["2011-03-01"], "text": "Explain it to me : CNN 's Nic Robertson on Libya 's revolution There was an expectation the military campaign in Libya would be quick But weeks into airstrikes , Moammar Gadhafi is holding strong Some say the war could drag on for weeks , months , or maybe longer Military advisers were seen by many as a sign of mission creep -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A desperate call for more help sounds from Libya almost every day . Libyans are disappointed , feeling let down by NATO , said one resident of Misrata , the western city under a vicious siege from Moammar Gadhafi 's forces . As blood flows on the battlefields that are Libya 's towns and cities , the optimism that surfaced at the start of the conflict is but a memory . The military campaign in Libya was expected to be quick and precise , using sophisticated aerial military technology optimized to reduce casualties . But it became apparent that Gadhafi was not going to fall quickly in the footsteps of his neighbors Zine El Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia or Hosni Mubarak of Egypt . He was not going to be the third data point , as it were , in the trend line of the Arab Spring . Now it seems the war could drag on for weeks , months or , by some troubling estimates , perhaps even years as NATO squabbles over strategy and Gadhafi camouflages his forces within civilian populations and , according to reports , is using banned weapons such as cluster bombs . Will NATO jets sway fight for Misrata ? Zawiyah is a ghost town Veteran photojournalist killed in Libya Libya rebels react to Hetherington death It can be perceived as a snub of Western military might . And the question now is whether any sort of political victory can be weaned from a seemingly struggling military campaign . How long before calm comes to Libya ? And how will Western powers , facing potential military embarrassment , respond ? `` They are trying to avoid losing , '' said military strategy scholar Michael Keane , a fellow of National Security at the Pacific Council on International Policy . `` But we 're not trying to win because we 're not sure what that means . '' Not sure because from the very beginning , U.S. President Barack Obama and his European counterparts have made it expressly clear that the Libyan campaign is not about regime change . The airstrikes began in mid-March under a United Nations mandate to protect civilians , and NATO has been cautious to operate under that threshold , even when three of its members -- Britain , France and Italy -- decided this week to send military advisers to Benghazi . The choice to act in Libya came when it appeared the opposition effort -- previously implausible in a nation that has known only the iron grip of Gadhafi for more than 40 long years -- faced a series of setbacks that made massacre seem imminent in Benghazi . Some now believe that had Western powers intervened earlier , when the rebels were high on momentum in their march westward , the situation might be different . `` Had they really kept the pressure on Gadhafi , I do n't think we would be having this debate , '' said analyst Jawad al-Anani , a former deputy prime minister of Jordan . `` Somehow there was a slack in the operation . '' A `` slack , '' perhaps due to Obama 's reluctance to get U.S. troops -- already deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq -- involved in a third war . Even this week , the White House remained adamant there will be no U.S. ground forces in Libya , not even any advisers . But al-Anani is sure no one in the Arab world believes that the West was not salivating at the idea of a Gadhafi-free Libya . `` It could have been done easily , '' he said . `` This should have been Grenada , not Vietnam . '' `` Vietnam '' was one of the words used this week as word of advisers came out . `` Quagmire '' and `` mission creep '' also surfaced in a flurry of opinion on Libya . ` Slippery slope ' in Libya mission Paris promises made to aid Libya rebels The alliance 's secretary general has asked for more precision fighter jets so as to avoid civilian casualties as the bombardment continues . France and Britain last week aired a desire to get more aggressive . The allure of precision bombing from the air is that it can reduce troop losses . It is `` an unusually seductive form of military strength , in part because , like modern courtship , it appears to offer gratification without commitment , '' former State Department adviser Eliot Cohen famously wrote after directing a U.S. Air Force Persian Gulf War air power survey . Its limitations were learned in other conflicts . `` The examples of Mogadishu in Somalia , Rwanda , Bosnia and Kosovo will have played quite heavily in the minds of European policymakers , '' said Alexis Crow of the London-based think tank Chatham House . `` In trying to stop a humanitarian disaster , one thing that has been learned from these experiences is that you have got to have a ` hammer and anvil strategy , ' which is airpower combined with a complement of ground troops in order to stop things like ethnic cleansing happening , '' Crow said . If the goal , however , is to establish a Libya without Gadhafi , then it seems likely that a greater military effort will be required , said Jon Alterman , director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington . `` But it 's hard to get international consensus that supports military force deposing a government , '' he said , citing the Iraq example . That was a $ 1 trillion effort that did not garner widespread international support , he said . The Europeans , Alterman said , have relied on U.S. leadership in the past . But with the White House playing a secondary role in this effort , they are struggling to mount a sustained campaign . It 's too early to speak in terms of Vietnam , Alterman said . But certainly , a key expectation is that the impasse will be broken soon ; that the rebels have to be a more effective fighting force . There are , of course , a host of different scenarios for Libya , which have been debated to no end by observers of this war . Gadhafi could fall soon , though it seems unlikely . He could hang on to power for weeks , months or maybe years , fueled by oil resources in southern Libya . Or the country could be split in two . `` Two weeks from now , Gadhafi will certainly be in power , '' said W. Andrew Terrill , a research professor at the Strategic Studies Institute of the U.S. Army War College . `` I do n't think major cities will exchange hands . It 's not going to be any major offenses . Neither side has enough combat power . '' Terrill said the threshold to trigger an invasion with troops on the ground has to be high and has not yet been reached in Libya . Gadhafi is killing his people but it 's not a genocide when you consider the number of deaths , reported in the hundreds in Misrata , which has half a million people , he said . `` That 's a tragedy , but we 're still not talking genocide , '' Terrill said . Political scientist Ali Ahmida said this week what he has said all along as he watches his homeland mired in conflict : `` It is not going to be easy . '' As much as he would like to see Libya prosper under freedom , Ahmida , a professor at the University of New England , said he can not support a NATO invasion . `` I am against any military intervention in Libya , '' he said . `` The people are wary of that . They had a horrible colonial experience and the generation of independence made a big mistake by aligning so closely with the United Kingdom and the United States . '' But NATO has already upped the ante with military advisers on the ground , Keane said . And history has proven , he said , that once you engage militarily , events take on a life of their own . In Misrata , urban warfare rages on and the death toll mounts . Acclaimed photojournalist and documentarian Tim Hetherington was among those killed this week .

CNN 's Fred Pleitgen , reporting from Libya , heard at least three major explosions . The alliance has issued a new warning to Libyan civilians to stay away from military areas , foreshadowing plans for attacks on targets seen as strategically significant in stopping the government 's attacks against civilians , a NATO military official said Thursday . The next phase will largely involve increased air strikes on key Gadhafi command , control and communications sites in and around Tripoli , although targets in other areas could be hit as well , said the official , who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter . Libyan official sorry journalists killed ` Slippery slope ' in Libya mission Zawiyah is a ghost town Veteran photojournalist killed in Libya NATO now has the use of armed U.S. Predator drones at its disposal . U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates disclosed that the drones saw their first use in Libya Thursday , but poor weather forced them to return . Unmanned aerial vehicles offer more precise targeting , because their low-flying capability allows for better visibility , `` particularly on targets now that have started to dig themselves into defensive positions , '' Gates said . The Predators bring `` capabilities to the NATO commander that they did n't have before , '' he said . President Barack Obama approved their use . Rebels , who have complained that NATO was not being aggressive enough to protect civilians , said Thursday they had gained control of a key border crossing into Tunisia . The crossing at Wazen , Libya , could prove key to access to the city of Nalut , under siege by Gadhafi 's forces for the past month . Thousands have fled the fighting through Wazen to the nearby Tunisian town of Dehiba , where temporary camps have been set up for the displaced . The Tunisian state-run news agency , TAP , also reported the rebel takeover of Wazen after early morning fighting . About 100 forces loyal to Gadhafi , including a high-ranking officer , fled across the border into Tunisia , said Mohammed Ali Abdallah , spokesman for National Front for the Salvation of Libya . He said the rebels detained 14 members of Gadhafi 's forces . TAP reported that 13 Libyan officers have been detained by Tunisian military authorities . Explain it to me : Libya 's revolution Paris promises made to aid Libya rebels Will NATO jets sway fight for Misrata ? Also Thursday , a third ship chartered by the International Organization for Migration made its way back from the besieged city of Misrata to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi in the east . More than 1,000 rescued migrants were on board , as were the bodies of photojournalists Tim Hetherington and Chris Hondros , killed in Misrata on Wednesday , the organization said . The ship also repatriated the body of an Ukrainian doctor . Several banners were displayed as the Ionian Spirit docked late Thursday in Benghazi . One read : `` We feel for the families of the deceased , your blood was mixed with us in Misrata and with your loss you shared with us the price for freedom . '' Another said , `` US and UK with your loss , you shared with us the price of freedom . '' Hondros was American and Hetherington had dual British and U.S. citizenship . Twenty rebel fighters stood in military formation as the vessel arrived . The reported rebel takeover Thursday of Wazen comes at a time when many are questioning whether a military victory over Gadhafi is possible . France and Italy announced Wednesday that they will send military officers to Libya to advise the rebels . After a similar announcement by the British government Tuesday , French government spokesman Francois Baroin said a `` small number '' of French troops was being sent to advise the rebels ' Transitional National Council . French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet has ruled out sending ground troops to fight alongside the rebels . `` This is a real issue that deserves an international debate , '' he said , adding , `` We are working within the framework of the 1973 resolution , '' a reference to the U.N. resolution that authorized action in Libya . `` You can not please everyone all the time , '' he said . Italy will send military advisers to train the rebels in self-defense tactics , Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman Maurizio Massari announced . Britain said its contingent of military officers will be sent to Benghazi to serve in an advisory role . The team will work with the Transitional National Council to help the opposition improve its military organizational structures , communications and logistics , the British Foreign Office said . It will also help deliver aid . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday she has recommended that Obama authorize the U.S. government to send up to $ 25 million in non-lethal commodities and services to support Libyan rebels , including the Transitional National Council . On Thursday , Clinton urged more patience from critics of the anti-Gadhafi campaign , noting that `` it is always a temptation in any conflict to -LRB- want -RRB- a resolution quickly . '' `` The opposition that rose up spontaneously was not a trained militia , '' she noted . The `` vast majority '' of insurgents `` had never participated in -LRB- any form of military -RRB- activity before . '' Clinton said Washington has `` a lot of confidence in NATO '' and is pleased with the performance of America 's allies in the conflict . In Libya , rebel spokesman Jalal al Gallal called Wednesday 's announcements by France and Italy `` positive . '' `` We are pleased with the results , and I think it 's a prelude to more cooperation , '' he said . `` The more advisers we have on the ground , the better coordination we 'll have on the battlefield . '' At least 27 people have been killed and 142 have been injured in Libya this week , according to an opposition spokesman who wanted to be identified only as Mohammed for safety reasons . Among them were the two acclaimed photojournalists . Hondros and Hetherington , who was nominated for an Oscar for a gritty and harrowing documentary about the Afghan war , both died Wednesday in a rocket-propelled grenade attack in Misrata . Mohammed said rebels have `` annihilated '' Gadhafi forces and have defeated snipers in the city in the past few days . Three loyalist tanks remain on Tripoli Street , he said . CNN could not independently verify his claims . The city 's hospital has reported nine deaths and 68 injuries . CNN 's Barbara Starr contributed to this report .

The visit from Arizona Sen. John McCain came a day after the United States said it was deploying predator drones to Libya . When we decide to use military force , we should make it short and decisive . Dragging it out is when more innocent people get hurt and killed and it gets exponentially more expensive . That is exactly what is happening now in Libya . In the long run , when America shows that we do n't waver on military comittments like we have been , diplomacy will also begin working much more effectively . That 's the ultimate goal . April 22 , 2011 04:25 pm at 4:25 pm | Is this really a surprise . John McCain never met a war he did n't like ... as long as he does n't have to serve again . April 22 , 2011 04:35 pm at 4:35 pm | It 's a civil war and we should not be involved ; especially since the rebels have ties to AQIL . And now , BHO is helping to arm those that would kill us . The only reason that the Euros were front and center so quickly was to protect their petroleum interests and nothing more . The only reason that US force is being used is to protect the petroleum interests of the Europeans . The Europeans and the rest of NATO do not have the capabilities that the US has for enforcing a no-fly zone -- Navy Air , Surface and Subsurface Arms and , now , drones . Ya know they do n't do anything for humanitarian reasons . And , they got all that favorable legacy media support . Do ya think the US would get the same favorable coverage if they had done the same in Kuwait\\/Saudi Arabia or Iraq ? Ya know they would n't and did n't . Remember all those placards of , `` No Blood For Oil !! '' And we still have n't been repaid by either country ; not just for the fiscal expenditures , but for the lost and disrupted lives . I was a regressive -LRB- aka liberal progressive -RRB- until I learned to read , got a job and was mugged by willful tax and spend regressives and acolytes ; i.e. , unions .

For a country that supplies 2 % of the world 's oil supply ? Maybe it really is about the massacre that Gadhafi was about to impart on dissenters of his own country . The timing of our intervention really seemed to indicate the latter . April 22 , 2011 05:04 pm at 5:04 pm | Ca n't we just send drones to hover around his compounds , wait for Gaddafi to show his face -LRB- hint : it 's the guy in the ridiculous daishiki and stunner shades -RRB- and shoot the drone 's missiles ? April 22 , 2011 05:09 pm at 5:09 pm | So now folks are concerned over all the `` fighting '' going on in Congress , and gas prices and all of a sudden they 're not feeling too good about the future and where our country s heading . We 've got a situation in Lybia involving a madman out to kill or suppres anyone against him . Oil prices are going to be impacted , go figure . We 've had a situation here at home where one team 's goal has been to do everything possible to keep the country in the toilet so that they could regain the White House . That 's going to cause some fighting , go figure . We 've got a national press that sees dollar signs for themselves for every negative story they can post or concoct out of misinformation or innuendo , regardless of its ' lack of journalistic integrity . That 's going to cause collateral damage perception wise , and in turn at the polls . We 've re-elected the same idiots to power that put us in the crapper ; and we did it because we believed their lies about geting us out of the crapper , and with jobs no less they said . Instead they are reneging , again , on their promises and sworn duty to us , go figure . April 22 , 2011 05:11 pm at 5:11 pm | Looks like McCain has jumped on board the bus President Bush was driving . God bless George for pointing the way with the war in Iraq to get this Democracy ball rolling . He knew that if we could get just some of those people to see what Freedom is all about , the rest would get jealous and want a taste of it as well and so , here we go . The Arab people are tired of dictators and religious zealots telling them what to do and finally they are going to have their own Crusade . Now the question is first the Democrats could n't justify killing Sadam , but are now targeting Kadafi , but not Assad in Syria . Pray tell , what is the difference with Assad killing hundreds of protestors almost daily . As a side bar , I notice the liberal media says little about the mass graves that keep turning up in Iraq . THe latest had over 800 bodies in it and were victiims of Sadam . So Bush went in because of WMD , but really did it for MIC or Murder of Innocent Civilians ... God Bless George . April 22 , 2011 05:17 pm at 5:17 pm | What a hypocrite John Mccain is , he was bad mouthing the President for aiding the rebels , and now he is there acting like their savior . Is there no low that the GOP wo n't stoop to . April 22 , 2011 05:20 pm at 5:20 pm | April 22 , 2011 05:21 pm at 5:21 pm | McCain please stop trying to ` bait and trip-up ' the President , you simpleton . If you want more $ $ $ upport for the rebels than sell off one of your many mansions and ship them the cash .

April 22 , 2011 05:22 pm at 5:22 pm | As you can see , if McCain were elected president , we probably would have had thousands of troops in Libya by now and ended up in another quicksand mess . Obama was smart to limit our involvement and let NATO and the allies pick up some slack . Yes , we are still involved -LRB- this is aimed at poster BeanerECMO -RRB- but some -LRB- like this poster -RRB- seems to ignore the fact that a prominent Republican is calling for MORE US involvement ! April 22 , 2011 05:32 pm at 5:32 pm | Its Good Friday , so I will try to be nice , but this little escapade of John McCain 's is totally disgusting . First he wants America to do more . We are doing enough , thank you very much . Then he says they should set up a Government with mainly the Europeans help because they are closer . Bet the Europeans a happy to be told what to do by this loser . Then , `` if he demands formal recognition of the rebels '' -- who is he to demand anything . I thought the rebels `` might '' be somewhat infiltrated by Al Quida . So who are we `` formally recognizing '' ? Then The lovely American Enterprise Institute chimes in because they are run by Cheney , et al , another war monger .

Musa Ibrahim said he had no information about the identities of the dead in the attack on the compound , called Bab el-Azizia . The attack , presumably from NATO forces , came shortly after Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Khaim announced that Libya 's army will withdraw from the besieged coastal city of Misrata and allow tribal leaders to attempt to deal with the rebels . `` The situation in Misrata will be eased and will be dealt with by the tribes surrounding Misrata , '' Khaim told reporters . `` You will see how they will be swift and quick and fast . '' He added that the residents of Libya 's third-largest city have been in the grip of the conflict . `` The tactic of the Libyan army is to have a surgical solution , but it does n't work , '' Khaim said . `` With the airstrikes , it does not work . We will leave it for the tribes and Misrata people to deal with the situation -- either to use force or negotiations . '' He added , `` The tribal leaders have issued an ultimatum to the military saying they will deal with the situation if the military can not do it . ... They will speak with the rebels and , if there is no solution , they will fight the rebels . '' In the rebel stronghold of Benghazi , in the east , rebel spokesman Ahmed Bani reacted to Khaim 's comments with laughter and derision . `` This only confirms that he wants to save face , '' Bani said of Gadhafi . `` This confirms that our rebels in Misrata have liberated Misrata and that Libya is still in one piece , not two , the way Gadhafi hoped . In regards to the tribes fighting the rebels ; how would you believe that a person will fight his brother ? And who are the tribes that are supporting Gadhafi , anyway ? '' He predicted that if Gadhafi forces leave Misrata , `` it will mean that this game is over . '' But he added that he did not necessarily believe they will . Earlier Friday , Bani said that Libyan rebels had wrested control of a key building in Misrata and made other advances in the city . `` This victory is quite important for us , and it shows that we are advancing and we are heading in the right direction , '' Bani told CNN about the rebels ' control of the National Insurance Building , which is on the main thoroughfare , Tripoli Street . Its height provided snipers with a clear view of surrounding streets . Bani said some fighters loyal to Gadhafi were negotiating to surrender their weapons to the rebels in exchange for the rebels ' assurances that they would not be harmed . But the carnage of recent days was on display at the city 's hospitals , where doctors were working long hours and beds were full . Gadhafi 's forces retain control of roads that lead to the seacoast city . But access by sea remains open , and on Friday another aid ship chartered by the International Organization for Migration left Benghazi for Misrata carrying food , medicine and other supplies . The organization said it hopes to rescue more casualties and stranded migrants from the city . `` Given the increasing number of casualties in Misrata and the thousands of lives that are in danger , we felt a responsibility to act , '' said Foreign Minister Eamon Gilmore of Ireland , which is helping fund the chartered vessels . `` Colonel Gadhafi 's forces have agreed to allow ships into the port to evacuate civilians and we have requested that the IOM undertake an emergency operation on our behalf , '' Gilmore said . At a news conference in Baghdad , America 's top military chief acknowledged a stalemate on Libya 's eastern front , around the oil towns of Ajdabiya and al-Brega , both of which have changed hands several times . `` The regime forces have changed their tactics , and changed it in a way where they essentially look like the opposition forces , so it 's become a much more difficult fight , '' U.S. Navy Adm. Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told reporters . `` And as I 've observed in recent days , essentially it is very much stalemate-like in the vicinity of Ajdabiya and al-Brega , '' Mullen said . He said the outcome -- toppling Gadhafi after nearly 42 years of rule -- is certain . But the timing , he said , is `` difficult to predict . '' Also Friday , Sen. John McCain made an unannounced visit to Benghazi , the rebel stronghold , where residents welcomed him . Some waved American flags , some chanted , `` Thank you John McCain ! Gadhafi go away ! '' The senator from Arizona 's arrival came a day after the United States said it was deploying drones to Libya . McCain , a proponent of beefing up U.S. efforts to oust Gadhafi , said the drones will increase NATO 's capability but not enough to break a `` significant degree of stalemate . '' Though he opposes sending U.S. ground troops to Libya , he said the international community needs to `` facilitate '' weapons and training for the rebels . McCain , the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Libya since the conflict erupted in February , challenged critics of intervention to tour Benghazi , as he did Friday , to see a `` powerful and hopeful example of what a free Libya can be . '' The top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee stopped by a hospital and suggested that Western powers are not doing enough for the rebels . `` Let 's face it : This is not a fair fight , '' said McCain , a decorated Vietnam veteran with clout in defense circles . `` Maybe we should be doing everything we can to help these people and maybe we 're not , and they 're dying . '' U.S. Predator drones were deployed Thursday in the North African nation as part of the NATO-led military efforts there . But as of Friday night , the drones had made no strikes , said a Pentagon spokesman , Navy Capt. Darryn James . U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said earlier that bad weather forced the deployed drones to return . Libya 's deputy foreign minister told reporters that the decision reflects poorly on U.S. President Barack Obama . `` He is involving himself in a dirty game , '' Khaim said . `` This is will be another crime against humanity committed by the American administration and I feel very sad for President Obama to be involved in such a thing .

BEN TINKER , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Hey there , everyone . Happy Monday , and thanks for tuning in to CNN Student News . I 'm Ben Tinker , filling in today for Carl Azuz , who 's got the day off . As we kick off the last week of April , we 're going to get things started today in the Middle East . TINKER : There 's a deal being discussed in the nation of Yemen that would remove that country 's president from power . That 's something protesters have been pushing for weeks . They 've been marching through the streets , demonstrating . And in several cases , those demonstrations have turned violent , with fighting between protesters and security forces . The protests are centered around this man : President Ali Abdullah Saleh , who 's been in power for more than 30 years . This deal , which was put together by a group of countries in that region , says that President Saleh has to step down within 30 days . It also gives him and anyone who served in his government complete immunity from prosecution . Thousands of Yemeni people are angry at the deal , especially because it offers immunity to Saleh . They also want him to step down immediately . But as of Sunday afternoon , President Saleh had not signed the deal , and government representatives insist he wo n't unless the opposition groups agree to it . TINKER : From Yemen , we move west to the North African country of Libya and the city of Misrata . The battle to control that city has gone on now for seven weeks . Hundreds of people have been killed in the fighting between Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's forces and the rebels who want him out of power . Over the weekend , Libyan officials said they stopped their operations in Misrata , but a rebel spokesman calls that a flat-out lie . CNN Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson , who 's been covering the conflict in Libya , explains how we got to this point and what some of the potential outcomes might be . NIC ROBERTSON , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , Libya 's had Moammar Gadhafi leading the country for almost 42 years , and there 's been a push to see democratic change there . Although Libya is on Tunisia 's borders , the revolution in Tunisia really came to its initial conclusion with the ouster of President Ben Ali , who took exile in Saudi Arabia . That really sparked the revolution that then took place in Egypt , on the other side of Libya . So really , it was these two events , on both sides of Libya , that then gave the confidence to the opposition . And people want the chance , now , to choose their own political leaders ; to have political parties ; in some cases , to have a voice in their own futures . It went from being a sort of an `` unarmed civilian against government '' situation that we saw in Tunisia and Egypt , into more of an armed rebel revolt against the government , which is where it is today . You have the rebels in Benghazi to the east . You have Gadhafi in his seat of power and with the support of a lot of the principle tribes of the country in Tripoli . And you have a siege around the town of Misrata , where rebels are surrounded by government forces and are being shelled . It 's reaching a stalemate of sorts , but behind the scenes , there are political back channel talks that are going on . The foreign minister has talked about the possibility of an interim solution , being an interim government that would last for six months before elections . But at the same time , Britain , France and Italy are talking about sending advisers for the rebels , which potentially will stiffen positions , stiffen the Libyan government 's position , and make it harder , potentially , to reach any kind of a deal . Two potential futures : one is that there is a cease-fire , troops on the ground to monitor a cease-fire , an interim government and , ultimately , elections . There 's been a lot of blood-letting so far ; it 's going to be hard to walk away from this situation right now without further bloodshed . The other scenario is that both sides dig in deeper , refuse to negotiate , and there becomes a much wider-spread civil war in the country . STAN CASE , CNN STUDENT NEWS : See if you can I.D. Me . I 'm a U.S. city that 's located on the Mississippi River . I was named after a French king . I 'm known as the Gateway to the West , and I 'm home to the Gateway Arch . I 'm St. Louis , Missouri , and I was first established in 1764 . TINKER : A tornado ripped across parts of St. Louis Friday night , and this is what was left behind . The twister and fierce winds were estimated at anywhere between 110 to 200 miles per hour . This thing damaged 750 homes , left tens of thousands of people without power . But incredibly -- thankfully -- there were no reports of any deaths or serious injuries . A local minister said `` buildings can be replaced , but lives can not . '' The tornado also hit the airport in St. Louis . No planes were able to fly out on Saturday , but this plane you 're looking at was one of the first to take off on Sunday . Our Dan Simon gives us an inside look at the incredible impact this storm had on the airport . DAN SIMON , CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Airport security cameras show what it was like inside the moment the tornado struck . Right now , everything appears fine . Then the lights go out , debris starts swirling , TSA officers run for cover . Another angle in front of a food stand . Watch as this guy on a cell phone looks behind him and sees things are not normal . Seconds later , it appears this whole concourse is swept up by the powerful wind . SIMON : The aftermath : a scene of broken windows and an airport that has to be quickly shut down . One arriving passenger says he saw the wind actually force a plane to slide 20 feet from the gate . ROSS TAYLOR , PASSENGER : By the time we got to the terminal , lights were out , there was glass everywhere , it was just open . There was blood everywhere from where people had been cut . SIMON : The tornado ripped through nine separate communities , destroying dozens of homes . But amid all the devastation , mostly just minor injuries . Authorities credit that to people heeding the warnings . WES BROWN , NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE : And that was not only because we had a 34-minute lead time from the National Weather Service , but because our media partners carried that warning immediately to the public , and thirdly , that the public did what we have told them to do . SIMON : Still , with so many dislodged from their homes , the Red Cross opened several shelters . Back at the airport , crews began the tedious process of boarding up windows . Any glass that had a crack was taken down . Airport officials say most operations will resume when the power is restored . While the airline traffic may resume , the cosmetic damage you see here may take months to repair . Dan Simon , CNN , St. Louis . TOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : It 's time for the Shoutout !

'' She said that at least 10 people had been killed and at least 30 others wounded . But figures were difficult to confirm ; CNN was not in the city . A resident of Misrata who asked to be identified only as Mohammed said Monday that six people were killed in the morning . Building frequented by Gadhafi hit A doctor at a hospital in Misrata put the number of dead Sunday at 16 , with 71 wounded . The indiscriminate shelling began after rebel forces routed forces loyal to leader Moammar Gadhafi from the city center early Sunday , Colvin said . The rout came after rebels moved from building to building along Tripoli Street , the main boulevard , ousting government forces , she said . Twenty-five rebels were killed in one day , and an undetermined number of Gadhafi soldiers were killed , she said . Asked about the rebel army , she laughed . `` We 're talking about an army of shopkeepers , engineers , car mechanics , '' she said . `` Very , very few trained military . '' At the fruit and vegetable market , government tanks that had been hidden under loading bays were set afire over the weekend . Their position there underscored the difficulty of NATO airstrikes in discriminating between government forces and civilians . Since then , stationed on the city 's edge , government forces have been firing shells randomly into residential neighborhoods of the city , she said . `` It 's a free-fire zone on civilians , '' she said from the hospital , where she said she had seen casualties that ranged `` from loss of limbs to an 8-year-old boy struck in the ankle by shrapnel . He 'll keep the foot , but he was in bad shape . '' Outside , a white tent served as a triage area ; a refrigerator truck was packed with bodies . When two people were killed in one house , the family got into a car , but it too was hit , killing a man and two children , she said . Almost all of the shops in the city were shut , she said . Along Tripoli Street , `` every single building has been hit by shells . '' Some bakery owners were giving away bread , and a few stores on the other side of town remained open , she said . As of Monday night , the seaside city remained surrounded on three sides , she said . Last week , Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Khaim said that Gadhafi 's military was withdrawing from Misrata and that tribal leaders would deal with the rebels . But rebel commanders told Colvin that there were no negotiations going on between them and tribal leaders , the reporter said . The government 's assertion that such talks were ongoing `` appears to be a fig leaf or Gadhafi trying to cover the fact that his troops have been defeated , '' Colvin said . Misrata has been the scene of some of the deadliest battles of the war as rebels attempt to oust Gadhafi , who has been in power for 42 years . At least 36 people were killed there Sunday , rebel spokesman Col. Ahmad Bani said Monday . In all , hundreds of people have been killed in the battle for the city , which has been under siege by Gadhafi 's forces for seven weeks . Its population of about 450,000 makes it the country 's third-largest city . But that number has been dropping as residents have sought to get out . On Monday , the International Organization for Migration said it had taken nearly 1,000 stranded migrants -- most of them from Nigeria -- and 17 civilian casualties from Misrata to Benghazi on Sunday , with more such efforts planned . The accounts of dire conditions in Misrata came as a government official said Gadhafi was well and in command of the country 's affairs , despite what the official called a NATO attempt to kill him by bombing his compound in the capital city of Tripoli . `` The message that was sent by NATO in the early hours of this morning was sent to the wrong address , '' Mussa Ibrahim said in a written statement . In a tour of the aftermath , Ibrahim said the flattened structure was a civilian office building . In a statement , NATO said the target was a communications center in central Tripoli that had been used to coordinate attacks against civilians . NATO is leading an international military operation in Libya that includes airstrikes targeting Gadhafi 's military resources . It is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect civilians . On Monday , Italy 's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi called U.S. President Barack Obama to tell him of his decision to provide additional military support by authorizing air-to-ground strikes on Libyan regime targets , the White House said in a statement . `` The two leaders agreed that additional pressure is necessary to strengthen the civilian protection mission , and the president emphasized that the best way to ensure the safety of the Libyan people is for Gadhafi to leave power , '' the statement said . Libyan state TV said military and civilian casualties resulted from the strike on Gadhafi 's Bab el-Azizia compound . `` We have no independent means of verifying reports of possible civilian casualties , '' NATO said in a statement on its website . NATO has been issuing warnings to Libyan civilians to stay away from military sites and equipment , especially around Misrata . Citing a military source , state-run Libyan TV reported late Monday that NATO ships struck an offshore fiber-optic cable , cutting communications to Sirte , Ras Lanuf and al-Brega . It also reported that air strikes hit targets Monday night in Zawiya and Ayn Zarah of Tripoli district , resulting in casualties . Since NATO took command of Operation Unified Protector on March 31 , its aircraft have flown more than 3,700 sorties and more than 1,500 strike sorties . Over the weekend , NATO aircraft destroyed multiple-rocket launchers , armored personnel carriers , bunkers and storage facilities in and around Misrata , Tripoli and Sirte , the alliance said . `` We are bringing all our capabilities to bear on all parts of the Gadhafi regime that remain intent on harming the civilian population , '' NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said in a statement . `` As decided by the foreign ministers of NATO and operational partners , we will keep up the pressure until all attacks against civilians have stopped , Gadhafi 's forces have withdrawn to bases , and full and unimpeded humanitarian access has been ensured . '' The rebels , under the umbrella of the Transitional National Council , received a pledge Sunday from Kuwait for about $ 180 million . The announcement came during council chief Mustafa Abdel Jalil 's visit to Kuwait , Kuwaiti state-run television reported .

Moammar Gadhafi . The U.S. and its allies have imposed a no-fly zone over Libya . Critics ask why U.S. military power has been used in Libya but not Syria Violence in Libya broke out before violence in Syria , one analyst notes International consensus on military action exists in Libya , but not in Syria , analysts say Assad has more friends and allies than Gadhafi -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two countries , two cases of extreme violence committed against citizens by their own government . In one case , the Obama administration responds with military force . In the other , it does n't . The question has been raised in response to the radically different U.S. reactions to the bloodshed in Libya and Syria . More than 400 people have been killed in Syria over the past several weeks as Damascus has cracked down on protesters seeking reform , according to the Syrian Human Rights Information Link , a prominent human rights group . The United Nations says it has information that 76 people were killed in that country last Friday alone , apparently during peaceful marches . President Bashar al-Assad 's regime has described the protesters as `` armed criminal groups , '' and shows no sign of letting up . President Barack Obama has condemned the violence `` in the strongest possible terms '' and is seeking ways to `` increase the pressure on the regime ... in a targeted way , '' according to White House Press Secretary Jay Carney . So far , however , the response has amounted to little more than talk . Over in Libya , however , the U.S. reaction was entirely different when strongman Moammar Gadhafi promised to show `` no mercy '' to residents of the rebel-held city of Benghazi . Washington worked furiously behind the scenes at the United Nations to win an international mandate for a naval blockade , a no-fly zone and a license to take military action to protect civilians . Obama promised no use of ground troops , but U.S. air power was used to devastating effect against elements of Gadhafi 's forces before control of the operation was handed over to NATO commanders . The White House says the two situations ca n't be compared . Why Syria different than Libya for U.S. Syrian protests spread despite violence Reporter in Misrata : ` We 're under siege ' Libya was `` a unique situation , '' Carney told reporters Monday . `` We had large portions of the country that were out of the control of Moammar Gadhafi -LRB- and -RRB- we had an international consensus to act . We had the support of the Arab League to act in a multilateral fashion . '' But Washington is `` pursuing a range of possible policy options '' in Syria , he stressed . The administration is looking at `` targeted sanctions to respond to the crackdown ... and to make clear that this behavior is unacceptable . '' American `` values and principles apply to all countries , '' Defense Secretary Robert Gates added Tuesday . `` Our response in each country will have to be tailored to that country , and the circumstances peculiar to that country . '' Part of the reason the Obama administration intervened militarily in Libya and not Syria is because `` Libya happened first , '' noted Danielle Pletka , vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute , a conservative Washington think tank . `` So the international community responded there first . '' Protests in Benghazi first broke out in mid-February . Protests in the Syrian city of Daraa started last month after a violent crackdown by security forces on peaceful demonstrators protesting the arrests of youths who scribbled anti-government graffiti . Second , there is `` nowhere near the consensus on Syria as there is on Libya , '' Pletka told CNN . Syria , as opposed to Libya , stands at the heart of the Arab world . Assad has more friends and allies to call on . `` Assad is a dictator , a sponsor of terrorism , -LRB- and -RRB- a thug , '' Pletka said . `` You could argue he 's worse than Gadhafi . '' But `` on Syria , the Arab League is not going to be nearly as forward-leaning . -LRB- They 're -RRB- much closer to Assad . '' Among other things , Gadhafi has been accused of trying to have then-Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah assassinated in 2003 . There 's a `` personal antipathy '' factor between Gadhafi and other Arab leaders , Pletka said . At the same time , Israel may have a hostile relationship with its neighbor , but the Israeli leadership is `` very comfortable with the devil it knows '' in Damascus . Obama , Pletka said , has shown an extreme reluctance to engage in unilateral military action . Ousting Assad would change the entire political dynamic in the Middle East to the benefit of the United States , she said , noting Syria 's close ties to Iran and organizations such as Hezbollah , Hamas and Islamic Jihad . But unless and until a firmer international consensus emerges , more concerted action is unlikely . Military action in Libya may also have became a priority partly due to fears of al Qaeda , according to Rick Nelson , a terrorism expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , another Washington think tank . Al Qaeda is `` good at using countries in chaos to carve out safe havens , '' Nelson said , noting that the second-highest number of foreign fighters for al Qaeda in Iraq came from Libya . As Libya became more unstable , it may have become a priority for Western powers to ensure the country does n't become more of a home for al Qaeda leaders . Nelson echoed Pletka 's point about the lack of an international consensus on Syria . `` People do n't want to be on Assad 's bad side , '' he said . If you attack Syria , `` you 're crossing a line that is changing the whole strategic calculus in the region in one move , '' he said . `` The stakes are a lot higher .

Misrata , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- We left Misrata with a human cargo of refugees and casualties on a ferry evacuating just a few hundred of the many thousands who would escape this port city if they could . We were heading for Benghazi , the Libyan rebels ' stronghold . Among those on board : hundreds of migrant workers and 30 medical cases with 50 relatives . We spoke to one migrant who left the city with just the clothes he was wearing . Like the majority of the 935 migrants on board , he was from Niger , one of Libya 's southern neighbors . He said he had spent three years working in Libya and was hopeful the future would be better . We left behind us a city that is front and center in the battle for Libya -- what the former shopkeepers of Misrata are calling a revolution for dignity . Homes destroyed in battle for Libya Are kids being trained to defend Gadhafi ? Libyan city looks like a wasteland It was a different atmosphere from that encountered during the apprehensive journey into Misrata after some 16-20 hours by sea from Benghazi , depending on the conditions . We were an hour away from Misrata when the shelling started and the city was again under fire . Our captain decided it was too dangerous to head into port , and there was no choice but to wait it out . The wait would be almost 24 hours . On board were humanitarian aid -- food and medical supplies - and aid workers eager to get into the city . As we waited , we could hear and see shelling and smoke rising . When we were finally able to land at Misrata port Wednesday morning , we saw one small office building destroyed after an alleged hit by regime forces . There was smoke rising from at least one other port location at but the location was not accessible and we could n't see what was hit . The office was hit by shells from Gadhafi 's forces on Tuesday night -- several days after a regime official said its troops had withdrawn from Misrata and suspended operations . Clearly , based on what we saw from the boat and during a trip into the city , that was not the case . The shelling seems to be an indication , a message from the regime that they are unwilling to give up this key city . There were many fighters on the streets but also some civilians . One father was driving his kids around showing them the destruction . His daughter , about five-years-old , was chanting `` Free Libya . '' He said he 'd told her Gadhafi was responsible for destroying their city . Most of the people we talked to had been shopkeepers or business owners a few weeks ago . They told us this was not a revolution for bread by the poor but for dignity , that they were sick of the Gadhafi regime . U.S. Ambassador to U.K. talks Libya Building frequented by Gadhafi hit Rebels described the overnight strikes as the most aggressive attack on the port area -- the city 's only lifeline to the outside world -- since this uprising began . Rebel officials said some of the rockets landed near refugee camps for migrant workers trapped in Misrata , and at least three people were killed and several others were injured . They also said the incoming rocket fire and shelling would have resumed if it were n't for NATO forces intervening . Several hours after the shelling of the port , NATO warplanes attacked Gadhafi 's ground forces outside Misrata . We heard and felt the vibrations of those air attacks . Misrata has been the most brutal theater in the war in Libya , and the frontline in the battle has been Tripoli Street . Some of the tallest buildings in Misrata are along Tripoli Street , and whoever controls those tall buildings owns the highest point in the city -- that 's an advantage in any battlefield and that 's why both sides were desperately fighting for it . Several days ago the rebels finally seized control of the last of those buildings from pro-Gadhafi gunmen . Tripoli Street is the major thoroughfare through the heart of town , and it used to be bustling with activity before the war , but the fighting has laid waste to much of it . We could n't find a single building that was n't damaged or destroyed . Inside one building -- until recently used by Gadhafi snipers to fire on the street below -- we saw empty shells on the floor and bullet holes in the walls . In one apartment people had left everything behind when it had been taken over by Gadhafi forces . The rebels may have won an important victory in capturing the main thoroughfare of Tripoli Street , but all indications are that there is more fighting to come here in Misrata .

Angry survivors told Marie Colvin of The Sunday Times that they and the victims were on the coast , east of a steel plant , when a NATO plane bombed them . There were no other planes in the sky , the survivors said . NATO spokesman Eric Povel said he knew nothing about the report and would likely not learn more for several hours . The incident occurred on a day in which pro-government forces launched the heaviest shelling yet on the port of Misrata , much of which appeared to be a wasteland , rebels said . `` I 'm looking around , I ca n't find a single building that 's not either damaged or destroyed , '' CNN 's Reza Sayah said from Tripoli Street , the city 's major thoroughfare . From the time NATO began its operation on March 31 until Tuesday , the organization had conducted 3,981 sorties , of which 1,658 were strike sorties , according to an update issued Wednesday . Ships chartered by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Organization for Migration -LRB- IOM -RRB- departed port Wednesday , carrying people intent on fleeing the violence . Are kids being trained to defend Gadhafi ? U.S. Ambassador to U.K. talks Libya Homes destroyed in battle for Libya The ICRC-chartered ship evacuated more than 600 civilians from the city , it said . The IOM-chartered ship was carrying about 935 migrants and Libyans en route to Benghazi , the organization said in a news release . Also aboard was a group of journalists , including a French journalist who was in intensive care after being shot in the neck , it said . In Washington , President Barack Obama on Wednesday authorized up to $ 25 million in nonlethal commodities and services to be made available to `` support key U.S. government partners such as the Transitional National Council in efforts to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas under threat of attack in Libya . '' The United States considers the Libyan opposition group the Transitional National Council worthy of U.S. support , but has not formally recognized the group , Ambassador to Libya Gene Cretz said Wednesday . But Cretz said the lack of formal recognition has not stopped the United States from aiding and supporting the opposition . A three-member panel arrived in Libya on Wednesday to begin a U.N.-ordered inquiry into reports of violence and human rights abuses . The team , led by Professor Cherif Bassiouni , an Egyptian jurist and war crimes expert , was sent by the Human Rights Council . Last month , the U.N. General Assembly suspended Libya 's membership in the Human Rights Council . The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Wednesday it has established an international aid presence in Tripoli , with humanitarian workers also in Benghazi and the neighboring countries of Tunisia , Egypt , Chad and Niger . Aid agencies are seeking about $ 310 million for relief operations and have received $ 129 million , the U.N. office said . Also Wednesday , government officials took reporters to the city of Tarhuna , south of Tripoli , where they said civilians were volunteering to be trained to defend Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi from NATO . At a training camp there , reporters observed civilians learning basic military skills . Some of the volunteers appeared to be as young as 15 years old , the reporters said . Building frequented by Gadhafi hit NATO is leading an international military operation in Libya that includes airstrikes targeting Gadhafi 's military resources . It is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing any means necessary -- with the exception of foreign occupation -- to protect civilians . Witnesses said three people were killed and several were wounded after government shells detonated Tuesday near a refugee camp in the critical port area . Thousands of migrants have been housed there as they wait for ships to carry them to safety . Opposition forces said they believe that , had NATO forces not intervened with air attacks Tuesday night , the shelling would have continued . NATO said six military vehicles , seven technical vehicles and a surface-to-air missile launcher were targeted on Tuesday in the vicinity of Misrata . Though Gadhafi 's regime said last week that it was going to suspend operations in Misrata and let tribes deal with the rebels , heavy shelling suggests pro-government forces are n't done with the city . As many as 1,500 migrants are believed to remain in Misrata in need of evacuation , IOM said . In recent weeks , nearly 626,000 people have abandoned Libya for Tunisia , Egypt , Niger , Algeria , Chad and Sudan , it said . Some 615,000 people , including large numbers of third-country nationals , have fled Libya , more than 10,000 from Misrata . Misrata , the third-largest city in the North African country , has been hemmed in on three sides by Gadhafi 's forces . Though rebels said they had gained control of the city 's center and had pushed government forces outside the city , they said Gadhafi 's forces were continuing to attack Misrata with heavy weaponry . The port has served as a crucial route of escape and as a lifeline to humanitarian aid .

Kenneth Harney of Lexington , Kentucky , and Capt. Tyler Stark of Littleton , Colorado , were the focus of nearly every U.S. service member in the Mediterranean Sea region . Nearly a dozen aircraft , a platoon of Marines and even Libyan civilians worked to rescue Harney and Stark after their F-15 crashed in eastern Libya . Most details about the mission , including their names , were a closely held secret by the military . But earlier this month , with little notice , their identities and details of their rescue came out during a welcome-home ceremony at their air base . For the first time , the men spoke publicly to a small group of friends , family and Air Force personnel . The Air Force public affairs office posted pictures and video of the event on its official website , even after U.S. military public affairs officers involved in Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya told CNN their names would never be made public . `` You feel the weight of not only the Air Force , but the entire military , focusing on you , making sure you get home , '' Stark said recently in a video prepared by the Air Force . At some point they ran into trouble .

Stark was found by Libyan civilians who protected him from possible retaliation by forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , and eventually he was taken safely back to Europe . Details of how he was taken out of Libya have yet to be disclosed . Harney 's rescue came more quickly . He stayed in communications with another F-15 pilot still in the air over Libya . Eventually an MV-22 Osprey carrying Marines who were part of a Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel , or TRAP , team landed near his position . `` As that back door opened , I see a group of young Marine recon units jump out , and that was probably the best feeling I 've ever felt in my entire life , '' Harney said . He was flown to the USS Kearsarge for a quick medical check then a short time later sent home with Stark to RAF Lakenheath , where friends and family welcomed them with hugs and a rendition of `` God Bless America .

NATO-led forces began bombing regime targets in Libya last month after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution authorizing any means necessary to protect civilians . It also came as Gadhafi 's forces were shelling Misrata in an attempt to re-enter the city after being pushed out by rebels . Misrata , the country 's third-largest city , has been hemmed in on three sides for weeks by Gadhafi 's forces , leaving the sea as the only escape route . At least nine people were killed and another 30 were wounded in Friday 's attacks in Misrata , said a doctor , who is a member of the medical committee in the city . `` There is an indiscriminate shelling now in Misrata , '' said the doctor , who asked not to be identified because he feared retribution by Gadhafi 's forces . Rebels accused Gadhafi forces of dismantling rocket launchers so they would escape detection by NATO forces during transport , and then reassembling for use in attacking civilians , a spokesman for the rebels said . Bittersweet victory for Misrata rebels Libyan city looks like a wasteland NATO personnel Friday stopped small boats carrying pro-Gadhafi forces who were laying anti-ship mines in Misrata 's harbor , NATO spokesman Brig. Gen. Rob Weighill told reporters during a briefing in Brussels , Belgium . NATO warships were in the process of disarming and clearing the mines that had been laid , he said . Meanwhile , Libyan state TV announced that the Libyan military had successfully suppressed operations of the port . `` We will not allow any ship to dock at the port without being inspected by the Libyan government , '' Musa Ibrahim , a Libyan government spokesman , told reporters in Tripoli . He said any aid to Misrata must be delivered through designated land routes . Elsewhere , a senior rebel member , Omar al-Jernazi , told CNN that rebels `` took complete control '' Friday of Wazin -- a key Tunisian-Libyan border crossing -- after forcing Gadhafi forces to flee into Tunisia . The Tunisian army allowed Gadhafi 's troops to return to Libya at another border crossing , the rebel said . Meanwhile , thousands more Libyans fled to Tunisia , stirring further concerns about a humanitarian crisis there , according to Tunisia 's state-run news agency TAP , which cited Tunisian security sources . The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees set up more tents in the Remada refugee camp , it said . CNN 's Frederik Pleitgen , Kareem Khadder and Saad Abedine contributed to this report .

She has been a professional military educator for the U.S. Department of Defense , chaired the Use of Force Committee of the International Law Association -LRB- 2005-2010 -RRB- and is a vice president of the American Society of International Law . -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Unmanned aerial combat vehicles , better known as Predator or Reaper drones , are sleek , small , flexible planes that look like gliders . They have capabilities that larger , heavier manned jet aircraft do not possess . Drones are cheaper to use than planes . If they are shot down , no U.S. pilot is killed or captured . And because they are unmanned , President Barack Obama uses them in places where , for political reasons , he does not want a significant U.S. military presence . Yet that is the fatal attraction of drones -- they may not seem like a weapon of war but they are . On Friday , CNN reported that the United States had begun using combat drones in Libya . CNN also reported that a drone attack in Pakistan had killed at least 25 people -- a third of them women and children . As this death toll demonstrates , drones are battlefield weapons . Predators and Reapers launch Hellfire missiles or drop bombs weighing up to 500 pounds -- firepower only permitted in armed conflict . The United States is not in an armed conflict in Pakistan ; it is not supposed to be in one in Libya . In Pakistan , despite continuous drone attacks since 2004 , the terrorism threat remains . In 2010 , the United States attacked more than 110 times , killing 600 to 700 people . Greg Miller of The Washington Post has reported that in all of those strikes only two people on a list of high-level terrorism suspects were killed . Top counterterrorism experts from the Rand Corp. to the Obama administration have said the use of military force , which includes combat drones , is counterproductive to the goal of ending terrorist groups . Bob Woodward revealed in his book , '' Obama 's Wars , '' that the president knows this : `` Despite the CIA 's love affair with unmanned aerial vehicles such as Predators , Obama understood with increasing clarity that the United States would not get a lasting , durable effect with drone attacks . '' Pakistanis protest U.S. drone action Bittersweet victory for Misrata rebels Fighting still raging in Misrata Drones are likely to be just as ineffective in Libya . The official U.S. aim there is civilian protection . U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 of March 17 says the use of `` all necessary measures '' is authorized `` to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in '' Libya . The resolution responded to the imminent rout of Libyan rebels from Benghazi , and the fear that Libyan armed forces would exact revenge on civilians left behind . The resolution did not authorize outside intervention in a civil war . Indeed , an earlier resolution , Resolution 1970 , imposes a weapons embargo on all of Libya . Resolution 1973 continues that embargo with an exception to establish a `` no-fly '' zone and take other steps to protect civilians . After defending Benghazi , the U.S. should have turned immediately to seeking a peaceful end of the crisis . The U.S. rejected out of hand the African Union peace initiative , thereby putting no pressure on the rebels to come to the table . Obama , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister David Cameron instead took the new position that Moammar Gadhafi must go as a condition of ending the use of force . In this case , such a position is unlikely to help the cause of peace -- it only backs Gadhafi further into a corner . Each day the war continues , civilians are killed or die as a result of the fighting . Just as the fighting seemed to settle into a stalemate that could only be broken by negotiations at last -- the drones arrive . Their deployment appears set to move the conflict even further from a peaceful settlement . Even if the unlikely occurs and Gadhafi and his sons leave or are killed , continued fighting or chaos are predictable . Perhaps the U.S. aim is not primarily civilian protection but regime change ? If so , drone attacks will be no more helpful to that aim than to civilian protection . Air attacks can keep the rebels in the fight but can not win the war for them . A civil war can only be won by control of territory , not control of the air . Controlling territory requires military and civilian leadership , organization , training and equipment to defeat the Libyan army and replace the government . The rebels have deficits in all of these categories . Even if air attacks could buy NATO time to try to organize and train the rebels , Resolution 1970 does not permit arming the rebels . Sending drones to Libya is unlikely to bring the rebels a military victory . Drones are likely to prolong the fighting and the deaths of civilians . Sending drones does not even help Obama keep his promise that NATO would take the lead . Drones controlled by the U.S. deploy major military force . Drones give the appearance of a sophisticated , high-tech policy , not involving a big U.S. military presence . What they really give us is death and destruction that will not lead to the end of terrorism in Pakistan -- or peace in Libya .

Gadhafi and his wife were in their son 's house when it was targeted , but they are in good health , government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told journalists . But the son , Saif al-Arab Gadhafi , and three of his children were killed , Ibrahim said . The Libyan government vowed to retaliate with death to `` invaders '' in the nation , and empty Western embassies were vandalized on Sunday , U.S. and Italian officials said . But CNN could not independently confirm the reported fatalities , and a spokesman for anti-Gadhafi rebels cast doubt on the claim even as it provoked celebratory gunfire in rebel-held Benghazi . Ibrahim slammed NATO after the airstrike , calling the attack an illegal act and a `` war crime . '' He said the 29-year-old son killed was a student in Germany , the sixth of eight children . The strike destroyed the house in Tripoli , leaving a massive crater . Saif al-Arab Gadhafi is one of two sons of the Libyan leader whose names begin with Saif . Another son -- Saif al-Islam Gadhafi -- had previously touted reform , but has emerged as one of his father 's most visible defenders in recent months . The commander of the NATO operation , Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard , said NATO was aware of `` unconfirmed media reports '' that members of Gadhafi 's family had been killed in an airstrike . `` We regret all loss of life , especially the innocent civilians being harmed as a result of this ongoing conflict , '' said Bouchard , a Canadian air force general . But he said all targets `` are military in nature and have been clearly linked to the Gadhafi regime 's systemic attacks on the Libyan population ... We do not target individuals . '' But Russia , which has criticized the allied campaign , said it had `` serious doubts '' about NATO 's assertion that it is not targeting Gadhafi and his family . `` The disproportional use of force , all the more so , beyond the mandate of U.N. Security Council Resolution No. 1973 , which in no way stipulates the replacement of the Libyan leadership , is leading to harmful consequences and the death of civilians , '' the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by the official RIA Novosti news agency . `` We are again calling for strict compliance with the provisions of the decisions made by the international community on the Libyan conflict , for an immediate cease-fire and the start of a political settlement without any preconditions . '' The airstrikes started March 19 , after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution authorizing the use of force to protect civilians demanding the ouster of the ruler , who has been in power for nearly 42 years . A senior official in President Barack Obama 's administration said the U.S. government is `` very aware '' of the reports of Gadhafi 's son 's death , but can not confirm who , if anyone , died in a strike until they see the evidence . Gunfire broke out around Tripoli after the news came out . A crowd of demonstrators gathered around the ruler 's compound . Images on Libyan state TV showed what appeared to be dozens of people chanting and waving flags . Protesters could be heard yelling , `` We want to redeem the martyr , '' and , `` Oh youth , this is time for jihad . '' They were joined at one point by Ibrahim , who told the demonstrators , `` Every one of you are Saif al-Arab . '' `` We will make Libya the grave of all invaders , '' he told the crowd . A spokesman for the Libyan opposition doubted the report of the death . `` In all honesty , we never heard of Saif al-Arab until the start of the uprising , '' said Hafiz Ghoga , deputy chairman of the Transitional National Council in Benghazi . `` We do n't believe this is true , '' Ghoga said . `` It is all fabrications by the regime in a desperate attempt to get sympathy . ... This regime constantly lies and keeps lying . '' Despite skepticism by some rebels , some opposition members celebrated the report of Saif al-Arab 's death in the streets of Benghazi . Revelers danced and sang overnight as the sound of celebratory gunfire pierced through the air . `` By God , we 're not supposed to rejoice anyone 's death , '' one man told CNN . `` But we want him to feel the pain and sorrow that we 're going through with our own people he killed . '' Many of the reported civilian deaths have come out of the western city of Misrata . On Sunday , a witness there described especially intense shelling by government forces in the country 's third-largest city and speculated that the intensified attacks were tied directly to reports of the death of Gadhafi 's son . This is not the first time the ruler has reportedly been at the site of an airstrike that killed one of his children . In April 1986 , his adopted daughter , Hanna Gadhafi , was killed when U.S. forces launched an airstrike that targeted his residential compound . At the time , U.S. President Ronald Reagan said the strikes were an act of self-defense following the bombing of a West Berlin , Germany , club that killed two American servicemen and injured several others .

The U.S. Embassy was attacked by what one U.S. official called an `` organized mob , '' along with the British , French , Italian and Qatari embassies , British and Italian officials told CNN . Meanwhile , pro-Gadhafi forces stepped up their shelling of rebel positions in Misrata after Libya 's government reported the deaths . `` It 's going to be like revenge , '' one eyewitness in the embattled coastal city of Misrata said . The eyewitness reported significant damage and some casualties in Misrata , the country 's third-largest city . The city remains in rebel hands , with no forces aligned with Gadhafi remaining in the city itself , he said . Another witness , who agreed to be identified only as Mohammed , said `` very heavy shelling '' targeted the coastal city 's port . `` I have been here during all days of the conflict , '' he told CNN . `` Last night was the worst . '' And a third man , who wanted to be identified only as Abdsalam , said the port was heavily bombarded . Electricity is out in nearly the entire city , and food and fresh water are running scarce , he said . `` They are using every every possible type of weapon , '' he said . The Libyan government said Sunday that Gadhafi 's son , Saif al-Arab Gadhafi , and three grandchildren died in the strike that destroyed the son 's home in Tripoli . The Libyan government identified the children as Saif al-Arab 's sons Gartaj Hannibal Muammar al-Gadhafi , age 3 , and 2-year-old Saif Mohammad al-Gadhafi , as well as Mastoura Hamid Abuzitaia , the daughter of the leader 's daughter Aysha . State TV aired video of two bodies , wrapped in white shrouds and draped with flags , one of which was reported to be the body of Gadhafi 's son . A funeral procession and burial for the fallen `` martyrs '' will be held on Monday , state TV said . The Libyan leader and his wife were in the house when it was targeted , but they are in good health , government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told journalists . The building was in a residential area of Tripoli that houses several embassies . Ibrahim called the bombing a `` war crime . '' The strike destroyed the two-bedroom , single-story house , leaving a massive crater in its place . CNN could not independently confirm the reports , and NATO said in a statement Sunday that the alliance was `` aware of unconfirmed media reports that some of Gadhafi 's family members may have been killed . '' `` We regret all loss of life , especially the innocent civilians being harmed as a result of this ongoing conflict , '' said Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard , commander of NATO 's military operations . However , Bouchard said , all targets `` are military in nature and have been clearly linked to the Gadhafi regime 's systemic attacks on the Libyan population ... We do not target individuals . '' But U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham , a leading supporter of the Libya campaign , called the elder Gadhafi a `` murderer '' and `` a legitimate military target . '' `` He 's not the legitimate leader of Libya , and the way to get this to end is to go after the people around him and his support system , '' Graham told `` Fox News Sunday . '' The South Carolina Republican is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee . In Benghazi , a hub for rebel forces and their transitional government , the news triggered celebratory gunfire even as a rebel spokesman dismissed the reported death as `` a desperate attempt to get sympathy . '' `` In all honesty , we never heard of Saif al-Arab until the start of the uprising , '' said Hafiz Ghoga , deputy chairman of the Transitional National Council in Benghazi , on Sunday . `` We do n't believe this is true ... This regime constantly lies and keeps lying , '' he added . Opposition members , citing witness reports , also warned that pro-Gadhafi troops in the town of Zintan , 50 kilometers -LRB- 31 miles -RRB- west of Misrata , and other nearby areas have been equipped with gas masks . The opposition figures say that suggests the government forces are preparing to use chemical weapons against rebel forces -- but the accounts lacked detail , and CNN could not independently confirm the reports . Ibrahim dismissed the allegations as `` all lies . '' `` Every time they come with a lie , they jump out to the next lie , '' he said . `` The media can not report from one side of reports . It is the same lie when they said we are using cluster bombs . '' Human Rights Watch reported in mid-April that pro-Gadhafi troops were firing cluster munitions into Misrata and displayed a portion of a Spanish-made mortar shell that releases 21 smaller bombs across a wide area . The Libyan government denies the allegation . Fighting also intensified Sunday near the rebel-held Djerba border crossing into Tunisia , witnesses and Tunisia 's state news agency reported . The TAP news agency said the flow of refugees out of Libya had slowed , possibly as a result . NATO began bombarding Libya on March 19 , after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution authorizing any means necessary to protect civilians demanding the end of Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule . The alliance said it targeted a `` command-and-control building '' in Tripoli on Saturday , as well as hit seven ammunition depots around the capital . According to a NATO military official , the airstrike that Libya says killed Gadhafi 's son involved four precision-targeted bombs , one of which failed to detonate . The official , who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter , said the alliance was certain the target was a command-and-control facility and said the building hit , although above ground , had reinforced portions . The official said NATO had `` no evidence '' that Gadhafi 's relatives had been killed . A photograph of the site showed the unexploded bomb , a 2,000-pound weapon designed to penetrate reinforced concrete , but NATO would not confirm what other types of ordnance may have been dropped . Nor would it disclose which nation 's aircraft carried out the strike , or what type of aircraft were used . Libyan officials attacked the U.S. Embassy compound in Tripoli Sunday , as well as the British , French and Italian missions , according to a senior U.S. official in Washington . All four NATO nations are taking part in the airstrikes . Mark Toner , a U.S. State Department spokesman , said he had seen reports of violence against the diplomatic facilities and that if true , `` we condemn these attacks in the strongest possible terms . '' Italian officials told CNN that the embassy of Qatar , a Gulf Arab state that supports the campaign and is supplying arms to the rebels , was also targeted . The senior U.S. official said Turkey , the protecting power for U.S. interests in Libya , is trying to keep an eye on the American compound -- but `` there is n't much they can do when you have an organized mob , as this appeared to be . '' In London , British Foreign Secretary William Hague expelled Libya 's ambassador to the United Kingdom after the attacks . Hague said the Tripoli government is breaching its international obligation to protect diplomatic missions by allowing the vandalism . `` The attacks against diplomatic missions will not weaken our resolve to protect the civilian population in Libya , '' Hague said . Ibrahim told CNN the attacks happened because `` the people were upset '' and that Libyan security forces stopped the attacks and prevented the embassies from being destroyed . `` There are embassies that have not been touched , '' he said . Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim said later the government deeply regrets the looting and violence at the embassies . Angry crowds simply overwhelmed police , he said . In addition , 12 U.N. international staffers left Tripoli because of the unrest and are in Tunisia , the world body said Sunday . Spokeswoman Eri Kaneko said the United Nations would not identify the staffers or their agencies for safety reasons . U.N. national staffers are still in the country and international staffers remain in Benghazi .

NEW : The U.S. is making available an additional $ 6.5 million for emergency assistance An International Criminal Court report cites `` reasonable grounds '' Arrests `` will contribute to the protection of civilians in Libya , '' it says The U.S. ambassador to the U.N. warns those around Gadhafi of tying their fate to his -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court said in a report Wednesday there are `` reasonable grounds to believe that crimes against humanity have been committed and continue being committed in Libya . '' The report highlighted the alleged commission of rape by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's government , as well as the deportation or forcible transfer of citizens during the civil war that continues to rage in that country . It also noted war crimes , including intentionally directing attacks against civilians not participating in the fighting . ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo issued a statement saying he will soon request arrest warrants against three individuals who are `` most responsible for the crimes committed . '' The individuals were not named . `` It is indeed a characteristic of the situation in Libya that massive crimes are reportedly committed upon instruction of a few persons who control the organizations that execute the orders , '' the report said . `` Arresting those who ordered the commission of crimes , should the judges decide to issue warrants , will contribute to the protection of civilians in Libya . '' In March , shortly after the International Criminal Court was asked to investigate the issue , a court spokeswoman said Gadhafi would probably face serious charges . But the prosecutor did not name the people against whom he had evidence . `` Even today , people in Tripoli are arrested illegally , tortured and they disappear , '' Moreno-Ocampo told CNN . `` We have evidence of that and we will show it to the judges . '' It is not clear if he plans to file charges against anyone on the rebel side , though the report mentioned `` alleged war crimes as well as other crimes against humanity '' appear to have been committed by `` different parties . '' He warned when he opened the probe two months ago that the rebels are subject to international law just as Gadhafi 's forces are . `` Now , there are people opposing Gadhafi with weapons . And also we would like to warn them , you can not commit crimes . Our business in Libya is -LRB- to -RRB- stop the crimes , '' he told CNN in March . Susan Rice , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , said the specter of ICC prosecution `` should warn those around Gadhafi about the perils of continuing to tie their fate to his . '' `` Gadhafi has lost any and all legitimacy to lead Libya , '' she said , remarking on `` widespread and systematic attacks '' against civilians by government forces . Her comments were later echoed by the acting deputy spokesman for the U.S. State Department , Mark Toner , who called on Gadhafi to cease hostilities and to `` allow the International Organization for Migration and other organizations to provide much needed relief and evacuation services to civilians caught up in the Libyan conflict . '' He said the United States is making available an additional $ 6.5 million for the migration organization 's operations in Libya . That means the United States now is shelling out a total of $ 53.5 million in emergency assistance `` to meet the humanitarian needs of conflict victims , vulnerable migrants , and others displaced by the civil unrest in Libya , '' he said . But the Russian ambassador to the United Nations said Russia is `` deeply alarmed by the growing number of civilian causalities and the destruction of civilian facilities as a result of the actions by opposing Libyan parties . '' `` Unfortunately it must be noted that actions by NATO-led coalition forces also lead to civilian causalities , '' said Ambassador Vitaly Churkin . `` This took place in particular during recent bombings in Tripoli . '' He warned against exceeding the mandate established by U.N. Security Council resolution 1973 , which allows military action in Libya to protect civilians . `` Any disproportionate use of force is unacceptable , '' he said . This is the first time the International Criminal Court has begun investigating possible crimes against humanity as they were occurring in wartime , Moreno-Ocampo said . Social networking websites such as Facebook were part of the reason that was possible , he said . `` This triggered a very quick reaction . The -LRB- United Nations -RRB- Security Council reacted in a few days , the U.N. General Assembly reacted in a few days . So , now because the Court is up and running we can do this immediately , '' he said . `` I think Libya is a new world , '' he added . `` How we manage the new challenge , that 's what we will see now . '' The United Kingdom used Wednesday 's meeting to support investigations in Libya , while also using the forum to urge Syria not to attack protesting civilians . `` The deteriorating situation in Syria is of increasing concern in this regard , '' said Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant . `` The violent repression there must stop immediately . '' Meanwhile , Gadhafi 's forces once again shelled Misrata 's port on Wednesday , leaving five people dead and dozens injured , a rebel spokesman told CNN . The shelling started around 1 p.m. `` This is the only terminal we have for the city and for humanitarian vessels to come in and take foreigners out , '' rebel spokesman Ahmed Hassan said . A few ambulances and private cars arrived on the scene to take the casualties away after the shelling stopped . The International Organization for Migration told CNN that it had one chartered vessel that entered Misrata 's port early Wednesday morning . Contact was made with the ship 's captain , and no one was injured on the boat . Some 840 migrants have boarded the boat , and more were being placed on board , the IOM said . The vessel , which had brought 180 tons of humanitarian aid to Misrata , was expected to depart in the afternoon . As the bloody battles in the North African country dragged into their fourth month , a U.N. official said the Libyan government and opposition members were trying to find a way for a cease-fire . Abdul Ilah al-Khatib , the U.N. 's special envoy to Libya , said both sides had told him that they were ready for a cease-fire . The only problem was that they disagreed on what conditions would be needed to lay down arms , the envoy said . The Libyan government wants an end to NATO aerial attacks ; the opposition wants Gadhafi to step down and will not negotiate with him or any of his family members , al-Khatib said . `` A real and credible cease-fire must be agreed upon to suspend aggressive actions and killing of innocent civilians , including women and children , '' al-Khatib told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday . `` A cease-fire must be declared either formally , or -- in a first step -- as part of an informal understanding between the opposing forces in Libya . '' NATO began bombing Libya on March 19 , after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution authorizing any means necessary , short of invasion , to protect civilians demanding the end of Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule . This weekend , Libyan authorities said one of Gadhafi 's sons and three of his grandchildren were killed by a NATO airstrike . This prompted an increase in pro-Gadhafi forces ' attacks in rebel-held cities and also in the beleaguered western port city of Misrata , witnesses said . An explosion rocked Benghazi Tuesday , the eastern city that is controlled by rebel fighters . The blast damaged several cars in Benghazi 's main square and a rebel spokesman blamed it on Gadhafi supporters who were somehow able to infiltrate the rebel-held city . CNN could not independently confirm that report . The continued fighting has sent people fleeing . More than 8,000 people -- most of them women and children -- fled into Tunisia over the weekend to escape the fighting between Libyan government troops and opposition forces , the U.N.

The big difference with our forces is that we are not targeting civilians , we are targeting military targets . May 4 , 2011 at 7:18 pm | Report abuse | Of course there should be more charges against the rebels then the Government ! Moammar is using his military whereas the rebels are recruiting child soldiers and using pirated weapons to fight off the legitimate military . The rebels had plenty of original support , but quite honestly each and every rebel is guilty of some form of war-crime . May 5 , 2011 at 8:14 am | Report abuse | Are we going back to having `` rules '' during war ? Just regular wars or war on Terror too ? Isnt it time we became civilized people with laws again ? Without religion clouding everything ? May 4 , 2011 at 11:08 am | Report abuse | Everyone keeps saying he is targeting his own civilians , yet in the same breath they say the Rebels Are the civilians . What exactly am I missing ? Oh the Rebels , nor any international combatants are by any means civilians . Both Ghaddafi and the rebels are in proximity to civilians . The distinction line gets drawn at the precision of combat . Accidental deaths and collateral damage happen . From what -LRB- granted , biased -RRB- reports are stating , Ghaddafi is using more indiscriminate cluster munitions when attacking near these civilian centers . That 's akin to using white phosphorous , WAY beyond the line of taking acceptable measures to avoid civilian casualties . It 's all a matter purely of how much care is taken to limit -LRB- not eliminate , which is unrealistic -RRB- these casualties . May 4 , 2011 at 11:20 am | Report abuse | Rebels are dressed same as civilian . How do you differentuate ?? May 4 , 2011 at 11:30 am | Report abuse | THAT , in a warfare scenereo such as this is hard . In close quarters combat , it 's nearly impossible given that the rebels are dressed in civvies -LRB- granted often carrying firearms -RRB- . The point a lot of people are trying to make is , when you 're approaching a city that you are A -RRB- 100 % certain has civilians in it , and B -RRB- 100 % certain is under rebel control , you do n't indiscriminately fire cluster and area denial weapons at the target without disregard to who you hit just `` because it 's under OpFor control '' . NATO is far from perfect ... it 's precision weapons -LRB- JDAMs , etc -RRB- have blast radii that given the infrastructure ARE going to cause collateral damage . BUT the NATO Equiliviant to what 's happening to the rebels would be for a heavy bomber to just fly over Tripoli and carpet bomb the city JUST because there 's targets of opportunity . May 4 , 2011 at 11:48 am | Report abuse | And the fact that the rebels are hiding amongst the civilians means nothing either right ? Does the term '' human shields '' come to mind ? May 4 , 2011 at 12:09 pm | Report abuse | Both sides are amongst civilians , and to varying degrees using `` human shields '' in cowardly attempts , and one reason why it 's good that US and NATO forces are hesitant to join the ground war -LRB- after all , not even NATO forces are 100 % certain what the rebels stand for right now -RRB- . Therefore , both Loyalist and Rebel factions are equally guilty on the human shield fascet . Should the Rebel forces conduct similar area denial shelling , I 'm sure the emotional environment for their cause would change drastically and they 'd risk losing support . Simultaneously , NATO forces do need to take more care in the deployment of precision munitions . -LRB- Even a precision strike in a residential area is a HUGE risk that should be weighed far more cautiously -RRB- . All in all , no one is REALLY sure who 's really the ` OpFor ' at this point because it 's gotten so f ` ed up . May 4 , 2011 at 12:22 pm | Report abuse | Creates quite a quandry , does n't it ? The rebels forces have taken to beheading their prisoners . does n't sound very humane to me . So it seems to me if they 're going to start trying people , it should be on an equal playing field . SpottedCat , I 've got to go now . Thanks for the conversation . Talk at you later . May 4 , 2011 at 12:40 pm | Report abuse | May 4 , 2011 at 12:46 pm | Report abuse | Here we go again , al-kida and it 's like meaning France and NATO are bigger criminals than Gadafi . It was his country we invaded and are attempting to impower crimnals who are well armed to over throw a established government . The crime is why was the US involved in a war for oil that 's costing us trillions so France can get the oil from lybia . The bombs that have been dropped have killed thousands but you only report the crimals losses and not the true lybians . What kind of sick joke is this that several countries team up on one because we do n't like there leader . Maybe trying NATO in court would be more approperiot . Or let 's try France for invading the Ivory Coast . Or try and save Mubarik who surrendered peacfully instead he will get death . Let lybia have it 's civil war by itself and not a France installed government . Park the drones and leave them to there own vices . The rebels are well armed because NATO has supplied them . May 4 , 2011 at 11:32 am | Report abuse | Police state in full effect at W I U !!! Riot police use sound weapons , tear gas on college students during annual street party . U tu be -LRB- mass arrests , tear gas , sound weapons , used on W I U students -RRB- . Libya is not a signatory to the ICC . Gadhafi 's forces should succome to those arrest warrants including all involved in the regime . You can not go after the people trying to stop an uncivilized leader who has been ruthlessly killing and displacing the people of Libya . You do not see NATO bombing Hospitals and and the civilian population , granted you have to take in that in no matter what the situation there will always be the possibility in civillian casualties . The situation could be resolved rather quickly and appropriately if Gadhafi is brought to justice . NATO just needs to help out the rebels from the air and let them take out Gadhafi 's regime and let them decide what their government shall become . Let the justice system get Gadhafi if the rebels were to fail from the campaign , so that either way the situation is resolved . Change it up , fake RUFFNUTT . It 's getting old . Are you trying to say Linari , that slaughtering women and children is acceptable as long as it 's being done by NATO aircraft ? That kind of reasoning is sick at best !!! May 4 , 2011 at 3:30 pm | Report abuse | Well , what I see from my perspective is nothin far from the fact that the US and France have conclusively resolved to topple Gadaffi 's regime . But funny thin is , the just do n't know how to openly tell the world that `` We are sick and tired of Gadaffi '' , cos from all indications now , It is the west who is seeking regime change and not Libyan People . The so called rebbels in Libya are jst a face to a body wholy made up of the west and their anger towards Gadaffi . I think it 's France & Sarkozy that want to topple Ghadaffi . We have just been asked to pay the piper in return for Iraq . Obama couldnt say no when he saw the killing of civilians . Sarkozy believes the Libyans took out that plane in 09 , they are pulling up all of the wreckage hoping to justify their actions against Libya . Maybe the black box -LRB- es -RRB- will give them that proof . Just my thoughts anyway . desgarrador el panorama de cruentas guerreas todo por tonterias de falsos profetas que se creen Dios is cnn seriously posting an article about whether or not gadaffi commited war crimes ? Didnt we already ask that question before we launched hundreds of missiles at him ? comon i want to hear something new Where there is no respect for human life that is a crime . I am all for any excuse for killing Arabs ... but my since of fairness over-whelms my lust for dead Arabs . If Nato is holding Libya 's Army at bay and not letting them go door to door to kill the enemy and the only weapon that have is non direct shelling ... then how can you hold them accountable for killing innocent people ? Also if Nato can bomb Libian forces and kill innocent people by accident -- how come they are not held to the same standard . A win for Libya -- because nato has removed the no flow zone and will let them fight the rebels up close . A win for the Rebels -- because nato is bombing Libya 's army up close . A win for the Hague -- because Libya 's army will be tried , convicted and killed in accordance with smart bomb law . A win for Me -- More Dead Arabs Now we need to apply this same concept with a country which is a real threat to the USA , IRAN . -LRB- required , but will not be displayed -RRB- CNN welcomes a lively and courteous discussion as long as you follow the Rules of Conduct set forth in our Terms of Service .

'' The report highlighted the alleged commission of rape by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's government , as well as the deportation or forcible transfer of citizens during the civil war that continues to rage in that country . It also noted war crimes , including intentionally directing attacks against civilians not participating in the fighting . ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo issued a statement saying he will soon request arrest warrants against three individuals who are `` most responsible for the crimes committed . '' The individuals were not named . `` It is indeed a characteristic of the situation in Libya that massive crimes are reportedly committed upon instruction of a few persons who control the organizations that execute the orders , '' the report said . `` Arresting those who ordered the commission of crimes , should the judges decide to issue warrants , will contribute to the protection of civilians in Libya . '' In March , shortly after the International Criminal Court was asked to investigate the issue , a court spokeswoman said Gadhafi would probably face serious charges . But the prosecutor did not name the people against whom he had evidence . `` Even today , people in Tripoli are arrested illegally , tortured and they disappear , '' Moreno-Ocampo told CNN . `` We have evidence of that and we will show it to the judges .

And also we would like to warn them , you can not commit crimes . Our business in Libya is -LRB- to -RRB- stop the crimes , '' he told CNN in March . Susan Rice , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , said the specter of ICC prosecution `` should warn those around Gadhafi about the perils of continuing to tie their fate to his .

Gadhafi must withdraw all forces from rebel cities they have entered , restore services to those cities , and allow humanitarian aid in , Clinton insisted . U.S. and NATO bombing of his forces will continue until he meets the terms , she said . `` As long as Gadhafi continues to attack his citizens , we will continue to strike his forces , '' she said . `` It is time for the violence to end . It is time for Gadhafi to go . It is time for a democratic transition to begin , '' she said . The United States is also looking into ways to help the rebels financially , including seizing Gadhafi assets and using them to aid Libya 's people , and helping the Transitional National Council to sell oil , Clinton said . Clinton was speaking in Rome , where international powers held their second high-level meeting on the Libyan crisis . The Libyan government , according to state TV , said financing the rebels from frozen assets would be equivalent to theft . Congress is being consulted on the possible use of a portion of the $ 30 billion in assets , two senior State Department officials said . It was not clear whether any of the money would go directly to the opposition government . European Union High Representative Catherine Ashton said the Rome meeting `` underlined the international community 's unity and determination to bring the Libyan crisis to a quick and satisfactory conclusion . With the humanitarian situation deteriorating , time is of the essence . Gadhafi must end his attacks against his own people and respect human rights . '' Also Thursday , the International Organization for Migration said it was suspending its passenger ships between the two rebel towns of Benghazi and Misrata after Gadhafi forces shelled the port in Misrata Wednesday , killing at least five people . IOM media director Jean Philippe Chauzy said operations would be suspended until the organization puts in place a `` better evacuation plan . '' The IOM never again wants to experience what happened on Wednesday , he said . No one was injured on the IOM-chartered boat in Misrata at the time of the shelling , the agency said . Medecins Sans Frontieres , the international medical humanitarian group -LRB- known as Doctors Without Borders in English -RRB- , said a 22-member team is delivering surgical and medical care to the wounded at two hospitals and a clinic . The organization has donated more than 25 tons of medicine and medical equipment , it said in a statement Thursday . Rebels , meanwhile , told CNN that they have taken the southern city of al-Koufra , with Gadhafi forces gone except for a small group on its western edge . The two sides have exchanged control over al-Koufra over the past two months . CNN could not independently verify the claim . Meanwhile , British Foreign Secretary William Hague ordered two Libyan diplomats to leave the country for `` actions contrary to the interests of the UK , '' the Foreign Office announced Thursday . He gave them a week to get out , starting Wednesday , the Foreign Office statement said . The British Ministry of Defense and NATO said Thursday their forces had been engaging Gadhafi 's troops over the past several days , destroying ammunition dumps , surface-to-air batteries , and other targets . As for the Rome meeting , Hague said the international community is `` resolved to continue to take action '' on Libya , and `` more countries took part and reiterated that Gadhafi should go . '' Participants also agreed to help the Transitional National Council with short term financial support with the establishment of the Temporary Financial Mechanism , which was suggested in the first meeting in Doha , Qatar , according to a statement released at the conclusion of the talks .

It does n't matter to these volunteer fighters . They are itching to learn so they can head to the front line . University student Faisal Faraj had never used a gun before showing up at a rebel training camp in Benghazi . But after what he witnessed on the streets of this opposition stronghold in eastern Libya , he decided to learn the art of war instead of studying science . `` In the beginning we went out protesting peacefully carrying banners , demanding more freedom . They -LRB- the Gadhafi forces -RRB- responded with bullets and they were attacking us in a ruthless way using heavy weaponry , tanks and planes . So we got fed up . '' Ironically the anti-government forces are training inside a military camp that was occupied by Gadhafi forces until a couple of months ago . Government troops tried to destroy the place when Benghazi fell to the rebels . The assistant commander of the rebel 's 17th of February Martyrs Brigade said the local people used to be terrified of this camp . Libya humanitarian mission turns chaotic `` This camp was the Revolutionary Committees camp . They were the most brutal arm of Gadhafi forces . People were being tortured here , they were being imprisoned here , '' said Mustafa Saguzli . Now the rebels hoping to topple the Gadhafi regime are using the burned out grounds . More than two months since the uprising began , rebel leaders say they are able to train their fighters longer and better now . `` When the war started it was almost like a picnic . Anybody who wants to fight can go by himself , carry an arm and go by himself , '' said Saguzli . `` In the very beginning we had short courses of two weeks because the battle was moving so fast and we needed to have as many fighters as possible . Now it is taking one month to a month and a half . '' Saguzli has no military experience . He is a computer engineer who owned a business . Now he 's using his programming skills to program young minds for victory in the battlefield . The fighters are even specializing . There is a section of the camp dedicated to refurbishing weapons -- a skill that is turning out to be as vital as the ability to use the weapons . The yard is filled with broken down arms , most of which are from the 1940s . They clink away on the bits and pieces they have and then test the weapons . They often do n't work the first time around and the process starts all over again . Every now and then the tired spoils of war show up at the camp via a flat-bed truck . This time it 's armed jeeps that the commanders say were captured from Gadhafi 's troops in Ajadabiya . They are all in poor shape and must be repaired . The rebels say they have received a few new arms from the Gulf state of Qatar but have long been calling for NATO to give more . `` Libya could be your gate to a new way of dealing with the Muslim world , '' said Saguzli . `` I have to be honest with you when the west supported Mubarak or Gadhafi or Assad -LRB- the long time heads of state of Egypt , Libya , and Syria -RRB- or any of these tyrants who were killing us , the west was our enemy . `` And now the west , America and Europe is supporting us . Now they are our allies and friends . '' Volunteers keep showing up at the camp to go through the most basic training regime you can imagine . They are using still bars , rope , and the few guns they have to get the recruits ready to fight as best they can . 61-year-old Fendi Faraj came out of retirement from the military to help the recruits with their fight against the very forces he used to serve . `` What I witnessed , as far as the army attacking the people , can not allow an honest soldier to remain in the service . '' Faraj has vowed to teach the young to fight against the regime knowing first hand there is a massive imbalance in training and weaponry . `` There is no comparison , '' he said . `` It 's like the difference between the sky and the earth . But the youth want to live free and if they die , they want to die a martyr . '' It is a choice these volunteers make willingly . Some have even warned their commanders if they do n't get arms soon they will go to the front lines without them .

At least three rounds of explosions echoed across the Libyan capital in a three-hour span that began late Monday , and the roar of jets could be heard overhead . Government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told CNN that the warplanes hit administrative buildings in central Tripoli , and that a nearby hospital was `` indirectly '' affected . `` Tonight was an exceptional night in Tripoli , '' Ibrahim said , noting that the strikes followed `` an extended period of calm . '' `` It is very sad , '' he said . `` We are losing people every day on both sides . We think it is time to sit down and talk . '' NATO warplanes and missiles have been pounding Gadhafi 's forces and government installations since March 31 as Gadhafi attempts to put down a nearly three-month-old revolt against his rule . Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told CNN on Monday that Gadhafi and his regime `` have no future , '' but refused to predict how long the Libyan leader could hold on . Rasmussen denied that the situation in Libya had devolved into a `` stalemate , '' insisting that NATO was `` making progress '' and had `` taken out '' a substantial part of Gadhafi 's military capability . He said a political solution was required to bring the conflict to an end , but `` It 's hard to imagine an end to the violence as long as Gadhafi remains in power . '' Despite the ongoing bombardment , Gadhafi 's forces have been inflicting a heavy toll on rebels in the port city of Misrata , survivors there have told CNN . Misrata is the only city in western Libya held by the rebels , and witnesses say indiscriminate shelling has left victims with crushed bones , burns and amputations . `` They are shelling the port and civilian neighborhoods . It has become an operation of revenge , not just taking over the city of Misrata , '' said Ibrahim al-Neairy , a rebel who was injured in the fighting and evacuated to Benghazi . Alleged rape victim flees Libya She fled Gadhafi , wants to see family It has become an operation of revenge , not just taking over the city of Misrata -- Ibrahim al-Neairy , wounded rebel Mostafa Bozen , a spokesman for the rebels , said fighters attacked Gadhafi 's forces about 22 kilometers -LRB- 14 miles -RRB- from Tripoli , killing 12 and hitting a tank . The situation in Misrata `` is at the forefront '' of U.N. concerns about Libya 's civilian population , Valerie Amos , the U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs , told the Security Council on Monday . Two months of fighting and the ongoing shelling of the city 's port has prevented aid ships from docking there , and between 150 and 300 non-Libyans are still waiting to be evacuated , she said . `` Some people are running short of food , water and other basics , '' she said . `` Medical facilities need supplies and more trained personnel . '' The Security Council voted in March to authorize the use of force to protect Libyan civilians from Gadhafi 's regime . Nearly 750,000 people have fled the country , another 58,000 are displaced within Libya and another 5,000 are stranded at border crossings into Libya , Tunisia and Niger , Amos said . For those who remain , Amos said the fighting and the sanctions imposed on Gadhafi and his allies have caused `` a severe disruption of supply lines within the country . '' The results have been `` shortages of fuel , difficulties in obtaining commodities including foodstuffs , medicines and other essential goods , and there have been severe cash shortages throughout the country . '' Western Libya has about three months ' supply of food remaining ; the mostly rebel-held east has about two months , she said . Fuel and supplies for desalinization plants and other facilities that provide fresh water to many Libyans `` are running out , '' she added . There have been widespread assumptions among experts that the conflict between pro- and anti-Gadhafi forces will continue to be a stalemate for some time . As time wears on , though , human rights groups have expressed growing concern for besieged Libyans in Misrata . The wounded arriving in Benghazi , the rebel hub city , painted a gruesome picture of the fighting in Misrata . Hanan Muhammad , who was evacuated along with about 800 others on an aid ship charted by the International Organization for Migration , was wounded when a missile struck near her home . `` I was in my house praying when the first missile landed . Shortly after , more missiles , one after another started hitting our neighborhood , '' said Muhammad , who suffered a broken arm and shrapnel wounds . People are scared every moment of the day no matter their age , '' she said . `` Oh God , it 's like a horror movie . '' Al-Neairy , who suffered facial burns and shrapnel wounds , said he does not regret fighting . `` The price for freedom is high and it -LRB- is -RRB- necessary to be liberated from this regime , '' he said . Amnesty International has said Gadhafi 's attacks in the port city may amount to war crimes . A report issued last week by the monitoring group accused pro-Gadhafi forces of the `` unlawful killing of civilians due to indiscriminate attacks , including use of heavy artillery , rockets and cluster bombs in civilian areas and sniper fire against residents . '' `` I 'm not going to guess about a timeline . I want a solution sooner rather than later , '' Rasmussen said . CNN 's Jomana Karadsheh , Sara Sidner and Amir Ahmed contributed to this report .

One patient has suffered a paralyzing bullet to the head , another is missing a left leg , has a broken right leg and is on a respirator , yet another has burns to his face and is barely conscious . The maimed men are the latest arrivals in the Libyan rebel stronghold from the besieged city of Misrata -- the center of the most ferocious fighting between Colonel Moammar Gadhafi 's forces and fighters trying to oust his government . More than 800 people managed to get out of the city on the latest aid ship chartered by the International Organization for Migration . Some were migrant workers , others extremely sick or wounded people who had no chance of survival if they stayed put . `` The ship was attempting to dock for two day but they could not . One day they were finally able to get in to get us . Some rushed to the ship but the rest of the wounded could not because the shelling was non-stop , '' Ibrahim Al-Neairy said . Al-Neairy had taken up arms against Gadhafi forces when he was injured . His face is scarred from blast burns , his body is embedded with shrapnel , and his head is filled with images of dead friends lost in battle . But he is alive and angry at what is happening to people in the city . `` They are shelling the port and civilian neighborhoods . It has become an operation for revenge , not just taking over the city of Misrata , '' Al-Neairy said . It is n't just fighters from the front line who are occupying the hospital beds . Just down the hall in the women 's ward , patient Hana Mohammad sits with her arm all bandaged up a victim of shelling . She has shrapnel wounds all over her body . `` I was in my house praying when the first missile landed . Shortly after , more missiles , one after another , started hitting our neighborhood and its houses . About 10 missiles landed , one every five minutes , '' she said . One of those missiles hit her home where she was huddled with several members of her extended family . Three relatives did not make it out alive . She and her husband survived and saw the remains of their city as they made their way to the ship to Benghazi . `` People are scared every moment of the day no matter their age : children , young , old , and women -- everyone . It is like a horror movie . Oh God it is like a horror movie , '' she said . Several patients said the shelling was coming from outside the city where rebels had pushed Gadhafi 's troops . If what the patients are describing is accurate , it could be evidence war crimes are being committed . The international criminal court says it has grounds to believe that crimes against humanity have been -- and continue to be -- committed in Libya . Those rescued say the journey down the Mediterranean coast took 16 hours and the shelling never seemed to end . According to witnesses the city is in ruins . `` There was blood and destruction everywhere . I saw death before me . Everything was horrible , '' Hanan Mohamad said . She said most residents could n't go out safely , not even for food . Instead groups of young men have formed to pick up rations from aid organizations and distribute them to homes . While Misrata 's injured endure physical pain , one patient sits on her bed along crying tears of shame and regret . `` I want to go back . I wish I had n't left , '' 25-year-old Najah said . She was taken to port by ambulance and needs surgery from a complication to her pregnancy . She 's still having trouble coming to terms with what she went through . Amid the death and destruction , Najah had to leave her three young daughters behind ; ages five , three , and five months . `` It is as if I left my heart back in Misrata .

Moammar Gadhafi was last seen on video April 30 A Libyan government spokesman says Gadhafi is alive and well Some wonder if he was killed in a NATO airstrike Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Renewed bombing could be heard Thursday morning in Tripoli shortly after NATO jets were heard flying over the city . The explosions came a few hours after Libyan state television broadcast video late Wednesday that it said showed Col. Moammar Gadhafi meeting earlier in the day with tribal elders in a hotel in the capital -- marking the Libyan leader 's first public appearance in nearly two weeks . `` The leader met with tribal elders in Tripoli a few hours ago , and this proves the perseverance and permanence of the Libyan nation and its leader , '' the announcer said . `` God willing , they are victorious . '' The camera panned from a television program bearing the date May 11 to the group of more than a dozen men , including Gadhafi . The TV appearance was the first for Gadhafi -- who was wearing sunglasses and dressed in dark clothing -- since April 30 , the same day a NATO airstrike hit the Tripoli compound reportedly housing him and one of his sons . Libyan officials said at the time that Saif al-Arab Gadhafi was killed , but his father had escaped . Libyan television ran a banner that said he was meeting with tribal elders . The camera showed a seated Gadhafi speaking to the men , who were also seated . Wednesday 's appearance took place in the Rixos Hotel , a government official said . The hotel houses a number of international journalists , including those working for CNN . `` Let me tell you something , dear leader , '' one of the men says . `` I swear to God you will surely win . '' Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim had said earlier in the day that Gadhafi was `` alive , well and very healthy . '' Ibrahim added that Gadhafi had been targeted three times by NATO airstrikes and that government officials were worried about his safety . `` We need him to lead , to be safe , '' Ibrahim said . Earlier Wednesday , the chief operations officer of NATO 's Operation Unified Protector told reporters in Brussels , Belgium , that the organization had no evidence about what Gadhafi was doing . `` And I tell you the truth , we 're not really interested in what he is doing , '' Brig. Gen. Claudio Gabellini said . `` Our mandate is to protect civilians from the attacks and from the threat of attacks , so we 're not looking after individuals . '' NATO took over the mission to protect Libyan civilians authorized by a United Nations resolution and is using airstrikes to target installations that may be used to facilitate attacks against civilians . Gabellini said that NATO is targeting military objectives , not individuals . CNN 's Barbara Starr , Jasmine Amer , Ben Brumfield and Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this story .

After the blasts , which could be heard in the center of Tripoli , sirens blared and at least two emergency vehicles could be seen speeding toward the Bab al-Aziziya compound . It was not immediately clear whether anyone was hurt . On May 1 , the Libyan government said another attack on the same compound had killed Gadhafi 's son Saif al-Arab Gadhafi and three of the leader 's grandchildren . Thursday 's strike came a day after spokesmen for the Libyan rebels sparred with a spokesman for the Libyan government over who was in control of the airport in the besieged city of Misrata . During the day , Shamsiddin Abdulmolah of the Transitional National Council said the airport , located in the southern part of the war-torn city , had fallen to `` revolutionaries '' after opposition fighters in nearby Zlaitin were able to join their counterparts in Misrata . During the night , government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said government forces were in control of the airport and the seaport in Misrata . He said rebel forces had been there `` for -LRB- a -RRB- short time , and left . '' But a rebel spokesman in Misrata , who has asked to be identified solely as Mohamed , said late Wednesday night that the rebels had retained control of the airport and were also in control of a civil defense base beyond the airport . The capture of the airport would be key for rebels fighting the forces of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi since it would provide an important entry point for humanitarian aid . Two months of fighting and the ongoing shelling of the Misrata port have prevented most aid ships from docking there , leaving the city `` at the forefront '' of U.N. humanitarian concerns , a top U.N. official told the Security Council this week . NATO warplanes and missiles have been pounding Gadhafi 's forces since March as Gadhafi 's troops try to quash a nearly 3-month-old revolt against his nearly 42 years of rule . In Misrata , Abdulmolah said an unknown number of casualties occurred in the fighting . He also reported that the oil-rich town of Jakharra , in the interior of the country , fell Tuesday night to opposition forces and that Gadhafi 's forces were surrounded in the oasis towns of Awjila and Jalu . The NATO mission is intended to enforce a U.N. Security Council resolution that calls for the protection of civilians . U.S. President Barack Obama and NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen will meet at the White House on Friday to discuss the alliance 's role , the White House said Wednesday . NATO said Wednesday that vehicle and ammunition storage facilities , a surface-to-air missile launcher and an anti-aircraft gun had been hit in the Tripoli area . It also said in a news release that ambulance storage facilities were struck in Mizdah and Qaryat . As for Misrata , Marie Colvin , the Middle East correspondent for Britain 's Sunday Times , told CNN that rebel forces defending the city from government troops were making `` meter-by-meter '' gains despite heavy shelling and rocket attacks . Units loyal to Gadhafi have been firing rockets and artillery shells into residential neighborhoods , leaving a nearby emergency room full of women , children and old men , she said . `` The rebels are very much trying , at a minimum , to push back Gadhafi 's lines so he simply ca n't do that , '' Colvin said Tuesday . As for aid , a ship carrying supplies from the International Committee of the Red Cross docked Tuesday in Misrata , but the ongoing fighting had deterred captains of other ships from trying to enter the port , Colvin said . The ICRC said the vessel was carrying medical supplies , spare parts to repair water and electrical supply systems and 8,000 jars of baby food . On the front lines of the battle , bullets were whizzing past `` like very angry hornets , '' Colvin said . At least 70 rebels have been wounded -- but they have held their line , `` and meter by meter were able to advance , '' she said . `` They 're defending their homes . They 're defending their families , and they are not giving up an inch . They are fighting , '' Colvin said . The first shipment of nonlethal aid from the United States to the Libyan opposition arrived Tuesday in Benghazi , U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said . It included more than 10,000 meals that are permissible under Islamic law . Other items en route from the U.S. Defense Department include medical supplies , tents , uniforms , boots and protective gear . Almost 750,000 people have fled the country amid the fighting , and another 58,000 are displaced within Libya , Valerie Amos , the U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs , told the Security Council Monday . Another 5,000 are stranded at border crossings between Libya , Tunisia and Niger , Amos said . Others have tried to flee by sea , but one such attempt appears to have ended in disaster for hundreds of refugees as their ship capsized off the capital , Tripoli .

Now he 's sleeping in a tent , eating rationed food and learning to shoot a rocket-propelled grenade -LRB- RPG -RRB- , among other weapons , in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi in Libya . Bashir is originally from the capitol Tripoli . His family members still live there . He is one of several men in a newly formed fighting unit made up of others who decided to return to their homeland to fight against Moammar Gadhafi 's regime . Gadhafi makes first appearance in weeks The drastic decision to leave his comfortable life in Canada was prompted by the bloody images he was seeing on the news every night . `` I tried to stay there and live with it , just to send money or collect donations and go and protest and stuff . But I realized that that 's not enough . And I could not sleep ; I could not work . '' Bashir has no trouble working now and he says he has a lot to learn . For one thing he 's never held a gun before . He is one of more than 85 men , many from abroad , who now live together , train together and pray together on a walled piece of property loaned to them by a rebel supporter . The man they agreed to make Commander , Mahedi , has come in from Ireland . Some of the others say they arrived from France , Greece , Poland , Italy , and Spain . None have previous military experience so they are being trained by older men in Benghazi who do . Mahedi says his fighters are broken up into groups : The fittest are training to be special forces , the others are learning urban warfare . In the compound the men are tested on things such as taking a Kalashnikov apart and putting it back together . They head out to the beaches of Benghazi for mortar target practice . The mortar rounds reach long distances so they shoot them out to sea trying to get a hold on how to hit a far off target . Every now and then they have to stop as a small fishing boat slowly cuts through the green-blue water . Then they pick up their Belgium FN rifles and begin target practice on the canisters that used to hold the mortar rounds . They are propped up on the sand facing the water . Only one of them manages to hit his target . It turns out it is easy to pick up a gun , but not so easy to hit your mark . Most of the men wear masks giving them a menacing appearance , especially as they tote their guns across the backs and chests . The men say they wear masks because they do not want to be identified for fear they will be recognized , making their families a target . They want to make clear they have no political or religious agenda beyond their mission to defend their families and further the revolution by helping to oust Gadhafi . `` We are just civilians . And we are just here to get them out and that 's it . I am going to throw my guns -LRB- away afterward -RRB- , '' Bashir said . Bashir 's family does n't even know what he is up to . They know he is in Libya but they do n't know why . He 's afraid to tell them because he suspects their phones may be bugged . So he trains in secret with the others , waiting for the chance to complete his mission .

'' The audio message was broadcast several times over the course of the day and expressed gratitude to people around the world who were concerned for his safety . `` Tell the crusader cowards that I live in a place you can not reach me , '' Gadhafi said . Libya 's combative leader also condemned Thursday 's attack that reportedly killed three people . Gadhafi left this message to NATO : `` I live in the hearts of millions , and even if you kill my body , you can not kill my soul that lives in the hearts of millions . '' Libya 's expat freedom fighters train The audio message was released after the Italian foreign minister raised the possibility that the Libyan leader may have been injured after weeks of NATO airstrikes in the country . Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said he did not have any evidence as to Gadhafi 's fate , but Monsignor Giovanni Martinelli , the Catholic archbishop of Tripoli , told him that Gadhafi was wounded , the Italian ANSA news agency reported . Martinelli said Gadhafi was most likely not in Tripoli anymore , Frattini said . However , Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said Friday that Ghadafi was in `` good health and high spirits '' in Tripoli . Four rockets struck Gadhafi 's Bab al-Aziziya compound Thursday and killed at least three people , according to a Libyan government official . The Libyan government took journalists near the site of the blast , where smoke could be seen still rising from the compound . NATO military spokesman Mike Bracken said NATO had struck a command and control center but did not know whether anyone was inside . A top Libyan opposition leader urged formal U.S. recognition at the White House on Friday , one day after the interim council secured strong support from Britain . Mahmoud Jibril , president of the Libyan Transitional National Council 's Executive Bureau , and his delegation met with top Obama administration officials . During the meeting , National Security Adviser Tom Donilon told the leader of the Libyan opposition group that the U.S. views the group `` as a legitimate and credible interlocutor of the Libyan people , '' according to a White House statement released after the Friday meeting . The statement stopped short of formal recognition of the Transitional National Council . In an interview on CNN 's `` Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer '' on Thursday , Jibril said his main message to Donilon in Friday 's meeting would be to clear up `` misperceptions '' about extreme elements in the opposition and ask for formal recognition . Officials have said there are no plans to recognize the council out of concern of alienating Libyans that are not part of that group . They do not anticipate recognizing any one group as the official group until there is an election in Libya , officials have said . `` Ultimately , of course , it will be the people of Libya , not the international community , who will choose their leadership . '' White House spokesman Jay Carney said Friday . `` But we do applaud the -LRB- council -RRB- for its commitment to a democratic future for Libya , '' Carney said . In talks Thursday with the council 's chairman , Mustafa Abdul Jalil , British Prime Minister David Cameron invited the group to establish a formal office in London . Cameron said Britain would also boost its presence in Benghazi , the de facto rebel capital . The United States has not recognized the opposition formally , although it has provided aid . Italy and France have recognized the opposition group . As the opposition sought greater support , the International Criminal Court at The Hague in the Netherlands said it will unveil Monday the names of those who are `` most responsible for crimes allegedly committed in Libya . '' The names will be submitted to the court 's chief prosecutor , Luis Moreno-Ocampo , who has been seeking warrants for three individuals in crimes against humanity allegedly committed since February , when the Libyan uprising erupted . Libyan state television broadcast video late Wednesday that it said showed Gadhafi meeting with tribal elders in a Tripoli hotel , marking the strongman 's first public appearance in nearly two weeks . The camera panned from a television program bearing the date of May 11 to the group of more than a dozen men , including Gadhafi . Gadhafi , wearing sunglasses and dark clothing , had not been seen on television since April 30 , the same day a NATO airstrike hit the Tripoli compound reportedly housing him and one of his sons . Libyan officials said at the time that Saif al-Arab Gadhafi was killed but that his father had escaped . Gadhafi has been firm in his attempt to retain power in Libya . Loyalist forces and rebel fighters , aided by NATO airstrikes , have been fighting each other for weeks . Libyan state television reported Friday that NATO airsrikes hit a guest house in the eastern oil town of al-Brega , killing 11 people and injuring about 45 others . Ibrahim condemned the attack , calling NATO `` barbaric '' and inhumane '' in its actions for striking attendees of a religious conference while they were asleep . He showed a video that showed the imams in prayer and then bodies being taken away . `` Now is this protection of civilians ? '' `` Is this legitimate under any Security Council resolution to kill people in their sleep ? '' NATO 's military office confirmed that NATO conducted an air strike in al-Brega earlier Friday but said the target was clearly identified as a command and control structure , which was being used by Gadhafi regime to coordinate attacks against the civilian population . And Ahmed Bani , a rebel military spokesman , denied that civilian casualties were caused by NATO strikes . All civilians have left the al-Brega area , Bani said . The remaining population are pro-Gadhafi forces and have taken up positions in civilian neighborhoods , hiding equipment and ammunition , he said . In the contested western city of Misrata , a doctor said rebels were able to maintain control of the airport and a civil defense base beyond the airport . The doctor said that at least 10 people , including two babies , were killed and at least 20 were injured Friday in sporadic shelling . A rebel spokesman , who asked to be identified only as Mohamed , also said rebels were controlling Misrata 's airport and civil defense base , which are about 17 kilometers -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- from the city center . In Jibril 's first official visit to Washington , the opposition leader is scheduled to meet Friday with Donilon as well as other senior administration officials and members of Congress . Jibril said Thursday that the United States should turn over some of Libya 's frozen assets to his group because `` a human tragedy is in the making right now . '' He said Libyan rebels are facing a `` big hurdle '' in getting the U.S. government to free up some of the $ 30 billion-plus in frozen Libyan assets to help those suffering under Gadhafi 's regime . `` Time is the crux of the matter , because having solved this problem in a matter of four or five weeks might be too late , '' Jibril told a group gathered at the Brookings Institution . He said he wanted to clarify a misunderstanding about the council : that it was not a political organ but an administrative one that was managing the situation in Libya until the fall of Gadhafi 's regime . `` The political question of who should rule Libya and how he or she should rule it , this is for the Libyan people to decide through a political democratic process based on constitutional grounds , based on an active civil society , based on equal rights and natural human rights for everybody , '' he said . In March , Jibril met privately with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton when she was in Paris for a meeting with the Group of Eight foreign ministers . At the State Department on May 5 , Clinton said , `` Clearly on our agenda is looking for the most effective ways to deliver financial assistance and other means of supporting and helping the opposition .

Italian coast guard officers and rescue workers helped offload the passengers , wrapping an infant in a metallic blanket and taking at least one man away on a stretcher . The passengers left behind husks of bread , soggy blankets , and fluorescent life jackets , scattered in the hull of the boat . `` I still have the trauma inside me . Because of the cold , the water . Because I 've never tried this before in my life , '' said a 21-year old man from Sierra Leone who only gave his first name Abubakr . Abubakr said the boat departed from the Libyan capital of Tripoli on Thursday morning and reached this tiny Italian island after a perilous 24-hour journey . The boat was just the first of five boats that arrived Friday carrying 1,271 passengers . On Saturday , two more boats carrying more than 400 people from Libya and Tunisia reached the island , the U.N. High Commissioner for Regfugees said . Most of the refugees are from Sub-Saharan Africa , including Sierra Leone and Senegal . There are also Bangladeshis , some Egyptians and Tunisians . `` The sea is really difficult ... I vomited so much , '' said Ibrahim Cooper , 26 , also from Sierra Leone . Despite reports that a similar ship sank off the coast of Libya , killing at least 16 migrants , more than 30,000 migrants and refugees from Tunisia and Libya have risked this dangerous journey to Lampedusa since last February . Late Thursday night , Italian authorities were tracking one boat from Libya carrying 250 migrants that was said to be leaking . That vessel is believed to now be in the territorial waters of Malta . Passengers onboard Friday morning 's boat said they made the journey to escape the fighting in Libya . `` It 's a war situation now , '' Abubakr said . `` Anything can happen . That 's why we have to run for our lives . Because we are blacks . We are not secure in that country . '' Cooper huddled on the pavement of the port , eating a biscuit distributed by Italian emergency workers . `` We are now refugees in Italy , '' Cooper said . `` The Italian government and the E.U. should do something to help us . '' The armada of leaky boats full of migrants that have flooded Lampedusa over the past three months has become a hot-button political issue both in Italy and the European Union . A diplomatic spat erupted recently when France prevented a train carrying dozens of Tunisian migrants from crossing the border from Italy . I still have the trauma inside me . Because of the cold , the water . Because I 've never tried this before in my life . Meanwhile , this week , the Danish government announced it would begin checking passports at the border of Denmark . These measures threaten to undermine the Schengen agreement , which allows free movement across European borders . One unexpected consequence of the revolutions that have swept through North Africa is the collapse of border controls in Tunisia and Libya . Lampedusa and Malta , both islands less than an hour 's flight from the North African coast , have borne the brunt of the subsequent wave of migration . At one point , the population of migrants vastly outnumbered the tiny population of Lampedusa , which numbers less than 6,000 . Migrants slept in the streets of this small fishing port . Dozens of blue fishing boats from Tunisia and Libya are piled up in a boat graveyard outside Lampedusa 's small commercial port . Nearby , graffiti on a wall says `` Basta Siamo Pieni , '' meaning , `` Enough , we are full . '' Today , the number of new arrivals from Tunisia has reduced somewhat , thanks in part to a recent agreement with Italy to improve patrolling along the Tunisian coast . But as the war rages on in Libya , the number of barely seaworthy vessels departing Tripoli for Europe has increased drastically . A local priest is planning to hold a memorial service in Lampedusa later Friday for three other migrants who washed up on the shore of this small Mediterranean island last Sunday . The boat they are believed to have traveled on lies on its side on the rocky shore of Lampedusa days after it ran aground .

The issue is who organized them , '' Luis Moreno-Ocampo told CNN 's Nic Robertson . `` They were committed in some police barracks . Were the policemen prosecuted ? Moreno-Ocampo said the criminal court has information about women who were stopped at checkpoints and , because they were carrying the flag of the rebels , were taken by police and gang raped . He also said there were reports of the use of male sexual enhancement drugs , which he called a `` tool of massive rape . '' `` There 's some information with Viagra . So , it 's like a machete , '' he said . `` It 's new . Viagra is a tool of massive rape . `` So we are investigating . We are not ready to present the case yet , but I hope in the coming month , we 'll add charges or review the charges for rapes . '' In late April , various media organizations -- including Foreign Policy magazine -- reported that Susan Rice , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , told a closed-door U.N. Security Council hearing that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has been distributing Viagra pills to his troops `` so they go out and rape . '' The magazine , which attributed the information to a U.N. diplomat in the room , said Rice did not offer any evidence to support her claim . Pfizer , the maker of the drug , could not be reached early Tuesday morning for comment . It was also not clear whether Moreno-Ocampo used the term `` Viagra '' as a catch-all for male sexual enhancement drugs in general . Perhaps the best-known alleged rape case in Libya is that of Eman al-Obeidy . Al-Obeidy received worldwide attention on March 26 , when she burst into the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli while journalists staying there were having breakfast . She told reporters she had been taken from a checkpoint east of Tripoli and held against her will for two days while beaten and raped by 15 men loyal to Gadhafi . While notable for the international attention it received , al-Obeidy 's case may not be an exception . Moreno-Ocampo did not say how many women might have been raped in Libya since the start of the civil war . `` The shooting is in the public space .

Meanwhile , the Tunisian government condemned Libya 's alleged continuous firing of rockets at the border town of Dhiba , a Tunisian foreign ministry source told the Tunisian News Agency . Also , fighting resumed Wednesday between rebels and forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi at the Dhehiba\\/Wazen border crossing with Tunisia , according to the Tunisian state-run news agency . Significant reinforcements joined the rebels while government troops responded with heavy artillery , the agency said . Battle in Libya rages on Libya troops using rape as a weapon ? At the same time , UNICEF announced a humanitarian campaign to raise $ 20 million for children and women inside Libya and for nearly 800,000 refugees who have fled to neighboring countries including Tunisia . The freed journalists include two Americans : Clare Morgana Gillis , a freelancer for the Christian Science Monitor , the Atlantic and USA Today ; and James Foley of GlobalPost . The others are Spanish photographer Manuel Varela , who also goes by the name Manu Brabo , and British journalist Nigel Chandler , Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said . Ibrahim said a judge released the four journalists after ordering them each to pay a $ 164 fine for entering the country illegally . Ibrahim did n't know if the journalists had paid the fines yet . When asked about missing South African photographer Anton Hemmerl , Ibrahim said the government is n't holding him and has n't been able to locate him . `` We never had him with us at any stage , '' Ibrahim said . Ibrahim spoke with the four journalists after they arrived in the lobby of the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli and told them they are welcome to stay and work in Libya under a visa . South Africa 's ambassador to Libya was also at the hotel trying to get any information on Hemmerl . The four freed journalists were to spend the night at the hotel Wednesday , with their rooms paid for by the Libyan government , and then be driven to the Tunisian border , Ibrahim said . Gillis , Varela and Foley were detained by pro-government forces in early April , according to the Committee to Protect Journalists . Once taken to the border with Tunisia , Varela will head home to Spain , the Spanish foreign ministry said in a statement . The foreign ministry declined to give any details earlier this month about Varela 's situation , due to the `` discretion and prudence '' that his case demands , but Spanish media reported April 24 that he talked by phone to his parents in northern Spain and told them he was safe and being treated well . Spain still has an embassy in Tripoli , although it evacuated its personnel from the city , like many other nations , as fighting between the regime of Moammar Gadhafi and rebels intensified in late March . When asked about journalists being mistreated while in Libyan custody since violence erupted in February , Ibrahim said all journalists were treated `` fairly '' and `` as good as possible , '' but he pointed out that the country is in armed conflict , and the military did n't know for sure whether persons captured were indeed journalists . Ibrahim added that many former military personnel from Europe are now working with the rebels . Since February , the Committee to Protect Journalists has tallied more than 80 attacks on members of the news media in Libya , including four deaths and 49 detentions . Human Rights Watch and CPJ have called upon the Libyan government to account for missing journalists covering the conflict there . Meanwhile , in Tunis , the government charged that Libya 's rocket-firing at Tunisia is a violation of its sovereignty and puts citizens and infrastructure at risk , even though Tripoli pledged several times not to fire in the direction of Tunisia , the foreign ministry source told the Tunisian News Agency . The Tunisian government warned of `` immediate and disastrous consequences '' to bilateral relations and said the `` serious '' attacks are likely to force Tunis to take `` severe '' measures such as reporting the violations to the U.N. secretary general in order `` to defend its territorial integrity , '' the source told the news agency . In a related matter to Libya , UNICEF issued its appeal to raise $ 20 million for the Libyan crisis and said more than 1 million people may have been affected by the conflict , especially as almost 800,000 Libyans have fled to Egypt , Algeria , Niger , Chad , Sudan and Tunisia , the group said in a statement Wednesday . `` Children have been deeply affected by this conflict . Their rights to learn , to play and to express themselves have been compromised . UNICEF and partners are working to support the community in their solidarity to create safe spaces for all Libyan children , '' Shahida Azfar , UNICEF regional director for the Middle East and north Africa , said in a statement .

Libyan official says commercial and military areas were struck NATO says its attack struck eight of Gadhafi 's warships Libyan spokesman calls Obama `` delusional '' Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- NATO aircraft targeted warships overnight , striking eight of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's vessels in Tripoli 's seaport , the organization said Friday morning . A Libyan government official said the targets included commercial vessels as well as military ones . `` All NATO 's targets are military in nature and are directly linked to the Gadhafi regime 's systematic attacks on the Libyan people , '' said Rear Adm. Russell Harding , deputy commander of Operation Unified Protector . `` Given the escalating use of naval assets , NATO had no choice but to take decisive action to protect the civilian population of Libya and NATO forces at sea . '' In a statement , NATO said the attack occurred after two weeks of escalating use of government maritime forces that had disrupted the flow of humanitarian assistance . All the vessels targeted were naval warships with no civilian utility , said Harding . But a Libyan official who led CNN personnel on a tour of the area said the commercial port , not the nearby military port , was hit . From the distance at which CNN was allowed to view the area , it was not clear what sort of vessels were hit . The port 's general manager , Mohammed Ahmed Rashed , told reporters that six rockets struck in three strikes that hit five coast guard boats and one navy vessel , which had been in dock for maintenance . The port remained operational , he said . Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim called the attack a `` clear attempt to bring the nation to its knees , '' and said the port serves as the main entry point for food and other critical supplies into the country . `` The nation will starve , '' he said . Battle in Libya rages on Libya troops using rape as a weapon ? Libya 's al-Obeidy : ` My soul is liberated ' Still , though the port was in disarray , the damage did not appear major , he said . Ibrahim 's claims came as President Barack Obama , addressing a global audience , condemned the use of force against Arab Spring protesters by longtime allies and adversaries alike . `` Obama is still delusional , '' Ibrahim said . `` He believes the lies that his own government is spreading around the world and his own media is spreading around the world . They have not proved one single charge against us and they refuse to investigate us . '' He added , `` It 's not Obama who decides whether Moammar Gadhafi leaves Libya or not . It 's the Libyan people who decide their future . '' The report of the attack came shortly after at least three explosions could be heard in the city . A government official said five airstrikes had targeted the port and the police academy was also hit on Thursday , during which NATO jets could be seen been flying overhead throughout the day . Libyan state-run television reported the strikes with a `` breaking news '' font that said , `` Military source : Residential and military locations in Tripoli are currently being shelled by NATO forces . '' Earlier Thursday , crowds of Libyans took to the streets of Tripoli , honking horns and dancing in the streets in support of the country 's leader , Moammar Gadhafi . More than 100 people outside the headquarters of state television chanted `` God , Moammar and Libya only '' and other pro-Gadhafi and anti-rebel slogans . The demonstrations were sparked , apparently , in response to state-run television reports that parts of the rebel capital Benghazi were `` rejecting the colonialists and their followers , '' as the government describes NATO and the rebels . A group of journalists , including a CNN team , was taken by government minders to see the celebrations in Tripoli . Among the crowds composed predominantly of young men were a number of families -- including fathers carrying children on their shoulders . One woman , who brought her 10-year-old-daughter , carried a portrait of the Libyan leader and said they were celebrating their country being united again . Many then drove toward Tripoli 's Green Square singing and honking their horns , waving Libya 's green flag and portraits of Gadhafi . But CNN journalists in Benghazi saw no indications of counter-revolutionary uprisings or protests there . And the National Transitional Council denied government claims that pro-Gadhafi forces had seized control of the city . And residents of Benghazi said they had not seen or heard of pro-Gadhafi rallies there . Two months ago , Gadhafi loyalists in Tripoli erupted in similar cheers when state media incorrectly reported that Tobruk and Benghazi had fallen to government troops . Gadhafi has been fighting to keep control of his country in the face of an uprising that has led to a number of key cities falling into rebel control . The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court this week requested a warrant for Gadhafi 's arrest on charges of crimes against humanity .

'' In Benghazi , the heart of the Libyan revolt against longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi , a rebel leader pronounced Obama 's speech in support of democratic movements across the region `` good enough . '' `` Overall , the speech was positive for Libya , '' said Jalal el-Gallal , a spokesman for the National Transitional Council . Rebel leaders were pleased to hear Obama call their provisional government `` legitimate and credible , '' remarks that raised hopes of eventual U.S. recognition as the country 's rightful government -- and accompanying aid . `` Hopefully , they will recognize our aspirations , '' el-Gallal said . `` They will recognize us fully , and we can bring this chapter to an end . '' Obama : Our message is simple CNN 's Zakaria on Obama Arab Speech Obama pushes Mideast policy change In his Washington speech , Obama pledged U.S. support for reform efforts across the Middle East and North Africa , warning leaders facing popular upheavals that `` strategies of oppression and strategies of diversion will not work anymore . '' It comes amid the Arab Spring , popular revolts that have driven two regional autocrats from power and fueled calls for reform or open revolts in several other countries . He also pledged additional economic aid for longtime U.S. ally Egypt and said the United States and European Union would push for expanded trade with the region . That was good news for Riad Greiss , who watched Obama 's address from a Cairo coffeehouse . Greiss said tourism -- one of the pillars of Egypt 's economy -- has dried up since the pro-democracy protests that drove Hosni Mubarak from power after three decades . `` We are feeling it 's getting worse , not better , '' Greiss told CNN . Greiss , an engineer from Egypt 's Coptic Christian minority , said Egypt 's revolution `` needs time . It needs a steady push , but time . '' On the eve of a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , the American leader restated the U.S. desire for a comprehensive settlement of the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict . His call for an agreement based on Israel 's pre-1967 borders drew criticism from Netanyahu , who called those frontiers `` indefensible , '' but Obama also poured cold water on Palestinian efforts to seek a unilateral declaration of statehood at the United Nations . Nabil Shaath , a senior adviser to Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas , called the speech a `` half-full glass . '' He told CNN that Abbas would review the speech with all Palestinian factions and present Obama with some `` specific requirements '' for translating his rhetoric into `` a real peace process . '' On Syria , Obama praised the courage of Syrian protesters who have defied a violent crackdown by President Bashar al-Assad and blasted al-Assad 's government for choosing `` the path of murder '' in response to calls for democratic change . Al-Assad , he said , `` now has a choice : He can lead that transition or get out of the way . '' But on the social media site Twitter , a supporter of the Syrian revolt sounded a note of disappointment . `` We Syrians started this alone and if ur too afraid to take action , we can handle this alone , '' the poster said . Obama 's passing reference to Yemen , in which he urged embattled President Ali Abdullah Saleh to `` follow through '' on his reported agreement to step down after 32 years in power , drew mixed reviews from anti-government protesters there . `` We wanted Obama to directly call Saleh to leave office the same way he did with Mubarak , '' said Saleh Kayyat , a youth leader in the capital Sanaa . `` He did not do that . This is wrong , and he is not being honest with the wave of change in the Middle East . '' Another protester , Ala'a Jarban , told CNN , `` We had hoped to hear more .

But we realize that President Obama can not give as much to the Yemeni people as we can give to ourselves . '' And Michele Dunne , a former White House and State Department expert on the Middle East , said Obama 's address was `` a lot more timid than it needed to be . '' `` He spoke a lot more about self-determination and reform than he did about broader concepts like democracy and freedom , '' Dunne told CNN . `` He has been pretty cautious about approaching these changes in the Middle East , '' added Dunne , now an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . `` At least now he has said openly ... that the United States will stand up for its principles in its actions toward the Middle East .

NEW : The attack on Zintan began at dawn Thursday and continued through Friday African Union leaders to meet May 25-26 on Libyan conflict Overnight airstrikes target ships in three Libyan ports Zintan , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Forces loyal to Moammar Gadhafi have unleashed their biggest attack yet against a rebel stronghold in the mountains of western Libya , one of the Libyan leader 's former generals said Friday . The attack began at dawn Thursday , the former commander said . He now commands rebels in Zintan , using the name Hajj Usama . The attack began Thursday when about 150 of Gadhafi 's infantry troops began firing on three fronts near Zintan , he said . They were supported by about 40 vehicles , including long-range `` Grad '' rocket launchers and 14.5 mm heavy machine guns with a range of 6 kilometers . Zintan lies about 90 miles southwest of the capital , Tripoli . Zintan , population 40,000 , is at the eastern tip of a 170-mile ribbon of rebel-held mountains that stretch westward from the Tunisian border . After decades in the Libyan army , including a tour of duty in neighboring Chad , Hajj Usama said he now despises his former commander in chief , whom he called a terrorist . Battle in Libya rages on Libya troops using rape as a weapon ? Libya 's al-Obeidy : ` My soul is liberated ' NATO strikes hit Libyan warships `` He 's never used infantry like this , '' said the trim , gray-bearded rebel commander . In previous battles , Hajj Usama said , Gadhafi 's artillery forces had taken over nearby civilian housing in Zuwail al Bagul and shelled from a distance . Gadhafi 's forces simultaneously attacked Thursday on three fronts , Hajj Usama said -- to the north of Zintan , firing Grad rockets into the eastern part of the nearby town of Rayayna , and attacking to the southeast and to the east of Zintan . In response , he dispatched hundreds of fighters to cut off Gadhafi 's advance , Hajj Usama said . As of Friday night , one rebel was dead and three were wounded , one of them critically , he said . Fresh trenches cut deep in the stark , red sand here underscore the rebels ' readiness to continue defending the town . The absence of Gadhafi 's forces has buoyed the confidence of the rebel fighters . Some of the fighters who returned late Friday from the front lines -- crammed into the backs of pickup trucks -- appeared to be school-age . They carried only a handful of weapons , a few hunting rifles and old , bolt-action shotguns . Nevertheless , Hajj Osama said , `` they are keen and determined to fight for their freedom . '' The attack that began Thursday , he speculated , was intended to regain control of Rayayna , population 12,000 . Residents east of the town had `` declared their support for the rebels a month ago , '' he said , while the rest of the town remains loyal to Gadhafi and his former head of internal security , Nasar al Mabout . Hajj Usama said al Mabout lives there . Since the raids began , Hajj Usama said , he has lost contact with rebels in Rayayna with the exception of one commander who managed to make the dangerous journey to Zintan after his house was destroyed in the shelling . As dusk fell Friday the shelling visible earlier from the roofs of Zintan abated . But shortly before 10 p.m. , the attack resumed with sporadic barrages of gunfire . The rebels said the night shelling may have been intended to terrorize Zintan 's residents so they would flee . Some have , but most were staying to brave out the battle they fear is far from over , Hajj Usama said . Early Friday , NATO jets pounded Libyan ports , destroying eight of Gadhafi 's warships , an alliance spokesman said . NATO targeted the ships in Tripoli , Al-Khums and Sirte after it was apparent that Gadhafi 's forces were increasingly using naval vessels to launch attacks on civilians , said Mike Bracken , NATO 's military spokesman . Gadhafi was indiscriminately mining waters in Misrata and hampering the flow of humanitarian aid , Bracken said . `` He was using maritime forces to lay mines . These were legal targets , '' Bracken said at a briefing in Brussels , Belgium . He did not say whether crew members were aboard when the ships were hit . The NATO campaign is progressing and Gadhafi 's combat power had been severely curtailed , Bracken said . But the Libyan leader 's forces continued their heavy shelling of Dehiba , on the Tunisian border , where thousands of refugees have amassed in recent weeks . The border crossing , through which humanitarian aid is often trucked in , was closed Friday . Along the southern borders , rebels had gained control of border crossings between Libya and Sudan and Libya and Chad and had regained control of Kufra in the southeast , according to a report by the International Medical Corps , which has teams in Libya and Tunisia . The global medical organization said rebel control along the Chad border was significant because supplies flow through there to Gadhafi 's forces . `` While control of the entire border will be difficult , the rebels are reported to have a large force in the region , '' it said . `` The Niger and Morocco border crossings remain under Gadhafi control . '' Meanwhile , the African Union announced it will hold a two-day meeting of heads of state in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa next week to address the conflict in Libya , as well as other security issues in Africa . In another development , the family of South African freelance photojournalist Anton Hammerl , who has been missing in Libya since April , said late Thursday they believe he was killed by Libyan government forces . The statement was posted on the `` Free photographer Anton Hammerl '' Facebook page and followed interviews given in The New York Times , Global Post and The Atlantic by two journalists who said they were with him when he was shot . `` On 5 April 2011 , Anton was shot by Gaddafi 's forces in an extremely remote location in the Libyan desert . According to eyewitnesses , his injuries were such that he could not have survived without medical attention , '' according to the Facebook statement . Hammerl was last reportedly seen in a remote region of the Libyan desert . He was reportedly captured by Gadhafi 's forces near the town of al-Brega , a key oil town in eastern Libya , that has been the site of intense fighting .

Haji Usama was once a top commander in Gadhafi 's forces He now commands in Zintan for the rebels He gives his account of major offensive in rebel stronghold Zintan , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Over the past two days , Moammar Gadhafi 's forces have unleashed their biggest attack yet against one of the mountainous rebel strongholds in western Libya , according to one of his former generals . Haji Usama , as he is known to the rebels , was once a top commander in Gadhafi 's forces . He spent decades in the Libyan army including a tour of duty in neighboring Chad , and now commands in Zintan , population 40,000 . Today , he hates that his former commander in chief regards him as a terrorist . Haji Usama says that early Thursday morning about 150 of Gadhafi 's infantry troops -- supported by about 40 vehicles , including long range `` Grad '' rocket launchers and heavy , long-range machine guns -- began an attack on three fronts near Zintan . Zintan sits about 90 miles southwest from the capital of Tripoli , and is at the eastern tip of a 170-mile long ribbon of rebel held mountains stretching westwards from the Tunisian border . Unexploded weapons hurting Misrata kids NATO strikes hit Libyan warships The trim , gray-bearded rebel commander says he 's never seen such an attack here before . Gadhafi `` has never used infantry like this '' -- normally he shells from a distance , he says . He says he took immediate action , dispatching what he called a brigade of men to cut off Gadhafi 's advance . A brigade he said consisted of `` hundreds of fighters , '' but he declined to give exact numbers . So far , the fighting has cost him dearly : one rebel killed and three injured , including one in critical condition . Deep , fresh trenches in the stark red sand here are testimony to the battle rebels say they are ready to fight should Gadhafi 's forces manage to break through . So far they have not and confidence among the rebels , if not high , is certainly up . Some of the fighters seen returning from the front lines crammed in the back of open top pickup trucks late Friday appeared remarkably young -- a few appeared to be school age . Among them , only a handful of weapons , a few hunting rifles and old bolt-action shot guns . Haji Usama admits many of his fighters are young , but he says `` they are keen and determined to fight for their freedom . '' He believe that Thursday 's attack was to regain control of the nearby town Rayayan . He says the east of Rayayan `` declared their support for the rebels a month ago . '' The rest of the town is loyal to Gadhafi and his former head of internal security , Nasar al Mabout , whom Haji Usama claims lives there . Gadhafi 's forces simultaneously attacked on three fronts , to the north of Zintan firing Grad rockets at the east of Rayayna , and attacking to the southeast and to the east of Zintan , Haji Usama . In previous battles , Haji Usama says , Gadhafi 's artillery forces have taken over homes in Zuwail al Bagul and simply shelled from a distance . The latest attack is different . Since the raids began at dawn on Thursday , Haji Usama says he has lost contact with rebels in Rayayan with the exception of one commander who managed to make the dangerous journey to Zintan after his house was destroyed in the shelling . As dusk fell Friday the shelling that could be clearly heard and seen from the roof tops of Zintan earlier abated before picking up with sporadic barrages of fire shortly before 10 p.m. . The rebels say the night-time shelling is simply to terrorize Zintan 's residents into fleeing . `` Some have , '' he says , but most are staying to brave out the battle they fear is far from over .

Four detained French citizens are released Libyan official says the airstrikes limit the flow of food and fuel into the country NATO says it struck Libyan warships that have been targeting humanitarian aid Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan officials sounded an alarm Saturday over NATO bombings of three ports that they said would trigger a crisis by limiting the movement of supply ships carrying critical supplies in and out of the war-torn nation . NATO jets destroyed eight Libyan warships in the ports of Tripoli , Al-Khums and Sirte after concluding that Col. Moammar Gadhafi had started using naval assets to lay mines and hamper international humanitarian aid , said Mike Bracken , NATO 's military spokesman . Libyan officials said , however , that the airstrikes violated the United Nations resolution mandating the protection of civilians . Amran al-Forjani , Libya 's chief coastguard commandant , called the operation a `` crazy attack . '' No deaths or injuries were reported . Bracken said at a Friday news conference that the NATO strikes were justified . Battle in Libya rages on Libya troops using rape as a weapon ? Libya 's al-Obeidy : ` My soul is liberated ' NATO strikes hit Libyan warships Gadhafi was indiscriminately mining waters in Misrata and hampering the flow of humanitarian aid , Bracken said . `` He was using maritime forces to lay mines . These were legal targets , '' he said . NATO warplanes have been pounding military targets since March after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution to protect civilians by any means necessary as Gadhafi 's forces try to quash a nearly three-month revolt against Gadhafi 's nearly 42 years of rule . NATO and human rights groups said Libyan forces have targeted aid ships coming in and out of Misrata , where a bloody see-saw battle has raged between Gadhafi 's forces and the rebels . But the coast guard commandant denied that his vessels were used to attack Misrata or any other Libyan city . A Libyan official who led CNN personnel on a tour of the area Friday said the commercial port , not the nearby military port , was hit . From the distance at which CNN was allowed to view the area , it was not clear what sort of vessels were hit . Six rockets struck in three strikes that hit five coast guard boats and one navy vessel in dock for maintenance , said Mohammed Ahmed Rashed , the port general manager . The port remained operational , according to officials , but the strikes would impact the limited movement of supply ships . Libyan officials said the port is the main food and fuel supply line , and they expect the strikes to deter freight ships from coming because of security concerns and to increase the insurance on ships and goods . In another development , the European Union will open an office in Benghazi on Sunday , officials said . Catherine Ashton , foreign policy chief of the European Union , will open the office , said the National Transitional Council , which is based in the city . The council , in a statement , quoted Ashton as saying , `` It will be an honor to meet the people who have been fighting for democracy and a better future for Libya . I plan to meet key people from the National Transitional Council , civil society groups and our international partners , and will report back to EU Foreign Ministers on Monday . Opening an EU office is an important signal of our unfaltering support for the Libyan people . It is the EU putting words into action . '' Also Saturday , Libyan rebels released four French nationals detained in Benghazi since May 11 . The four traveled to Egypt on Saturday , where they were taken in by French consular authorities , the French Foreign Ministry said . And in western Libya , a government bus carrying three foreigners working for international media organizations -- Phoenix TV , BBC and Reuters -- was attacked by an angry mob in Zawiya . The journalists were on their way to the Tunisian border . Yijun Zhou , a reporter for Hong Kong-based Phoenix TV , said an angry crowd of dozens surrounded the bus and a man with a knife slashed the tires of the bus , kicked in the doors and climbed aboard followed by five more men . Reuters producer Guy Desmond , who was also on the bus , said at least two of the attackers had pistols and one had a knife . They shouted at the journalists , demanding to know their nationalities and employers . The journalists were taken to a police station for two hours before they returned to Tripoli to get another bus back to the border . Meanwhile , pro-Gadhafi forces have unleashed their biggest attack yet against a rebel stronghold in the mountains of western Libya , one of the Libyan leader 's former generals said . As of Friday night , one rebel was dead and three were wounded , one of them critically , the former commander said . He now commands rebels in Zintan , using the name Hajj Usama . The attack began Thursday when about 150 of Gadhafi 's infantry troops began firing on three fronts near Zintan , about 90 miles southwest of the capital , Tripoli . In response , Usama said he dispatched hundreds of fighters to cut off Gadhafi 's advance . CNN 's Nic Robertson contributed to this report .

Asked whether the office 's opening means the EU will encourage member-states to recognize the National Transitional Council as Libya 's new government , Ashton told CNN 's Sara Sidner the subject did not come up during talks , and that it remains up to individual member-states to recognize the new government or not . Protecting civilians , she told reporters , is `` fundamental . Too many people have died already .

'' Members of women 's groups , she said , are anxious that women be fully represented in the process of building a new government . Rebels on the front lines near Libya 's border with Tunisia , where a narrow finger of land controlled by rebels has become a vital supply route for the opposition , talked with CNN 's Nic Robertson on Saturday . The area is under continued shelling by Gadhafi 's forces , who are trying to close the route . `` Today is going hard , '' said one rebel fighter .

Late Saturday , former U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney decried U.S. policy on Libyan state television , saying the `` last thing we need to do is spend money on death , destruction and war . '' State television is fiercely loyal to Gadhafi , and McKinney 's interview was spliced with footage of what appeared to be pro-Gadhafi rallies . `` I think that it 's very important that people understand what is happening here , '' McKinney said in the interview . `` And it 's important that people all over the world see the truth . And that is why I am here ... to understand the truth . '' She said she was invited to Libya by the `` nongovernmental organization for fact-finding , '' adding that she intends to bring more people to the country soon so that `` they too can understand . '' Gadhafi 's government has repeatedly urged the international community to send fact-finding teams to Libya to report what 's happening on the ground . At one point during the interview , state TV cut to what it said were live airstrikes , hitting Gadhafi 's compound . `` Is that a bomb ? '' `` I want to say categorically and very clearly that these policies of war ... are not what the people of the United States stand for and it 's not what African-Americans stand for , '' she told state TV .

Opposition officials are aware , Lavrov said , that the settlement talks should also involve other parties , including representatives of Tripoli and western regions of Libya . Lavrov said he hopes a crisis settlement plan for Libya can be formulated at an upcoming session of the African Union . `` I hope that some strategy will be worked out based on all of these approaches '' -- referring to ones offered by opposition representatives in Benghazi , the African Union and the United Nations -- `` that will help end this bloodshed as soon as possible , '' he said .

The NATO attack , one of the heaviest against Tripoli since the NATO mission began just over two months ago , started at about 1 a.m. and lasted more than 20 minutes , with alliance jets circling overhead and Libyan loyalist forces responding with anti-aircraft fire . Moussa Ibrahim , a Libyan government spokesman , said the attack targeted a guard compound for pro-Gadhafi military volunteers that had been emptied in anticipation . At least three people were killed and 150 wounded , Ibrahim said , calling the attack an escalation by NATO . Reporters felt and heard explosions from the airstrike that rocked the hotel housing members of the international media . Outbursts of gunfire , as well as ambulance sirens , could be heard in the streets . The facility resupplies government forces that have been attacking Libyan civilians , according to the NATO statement . Gadhafi 's forces `` still represent a threat to civilians and we will continue to strike targets that carry out this violence , '' said Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard of Canada , who commands the Libya operation . Journalists later visited a hospital where they reported they saw the bodies of three men , at least two covered in dust , and a number of injured people . CNN did not go on the hospital visit because of safety concerns . On Monday , forces loyal to Gadhafi attacked a rebel-held border crossing into Tunisia in a battle that resulted in nine deaths , according to the rebels ' military commander in Zintan , Hajj Osama . He said Gadhafi infantry who attacked rebels controlling the border post suffered eight fatalities ; one rebel fighter was killed . Food and fuel are shipped into Libya and wounded rebels are taken out for medical treatment via the crossing , which is literally a lifeline to the rebels , the rebel commander said . Since they were driven from the border checkposts by rebels more than two weeks ago , Gadhafi 's troops have been shelling the rebels ' nearby mountaintop holdouts to try to regain control of this vital artery . In the towns of Yefren and Algalaa , southwest of Tripoli , only about 1,000 residents remained of the usual population of 22,000 , said a local person who is in touch with rebels there . The military commander in Zintan , near the border with Tunisia , corroborated those numbers . They contrast with figures issued by the Libyan Committee for Humanitarian aid and Relief , which said 22,000 to 25,000 people remained trapped in the two towns , and that about 40,000 others had been displaced to other towns in the Nafusa Mountains , Tripoli and Tunisia . For the past two months , the towns ' dwindling numbers of residents have been enduring spartan living conditions -- without electricity or fuel and with only limited access to water , since Gadhafi forces control the region 's water wells and have contaminated some of them with oil , the committee said . Banks in Yefren and Algalaa have been closed since February 17 , which has led to a widespread shortage of cash , it added . The cities ' main water tank has been out of commission since it was damaged six weeks ago by missiles and no food supplies have entered the area since March 1 , it said . Snipers loyal to Gadhafi control access to the hospital in Yefren and most doctors have fled , it added . In other NATO efforts against Gadhafi forces Monday , an airstrike hit a Libyan army position outside the rebel town of Jadu in the western mountains , rebels in Zintan told CNN . The attack took place around noon -LRB- 6 a.m. ET -RRB- , shortly after the Gadhafi forces at that position had launched Grad rockets into the rebel-held town , rebels said . NATO reported Monday that since its operation began on March 31 , it has flown 7,870 sorties , including 3,025 strike sorties , which are intended to identify and engage targets , but do not necessarily deploy munitions . On Sunday , a command-and-control center was hit near Tripoli and a missile support facility was struck near Al Khums , NATO said in a news release . Near Sirte , an ammunition storage facility was struck and , near Brega , a command-and-control facility was targeted , it said . A spokesman for France 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said France plans to add attack helicopters to the country 's arsenal in Libya , saying the aircraft would make `` more precise '' strikes possible . Media reports said Britain also plans to use attack helicopters . A spokesman for Britain 's Ministry of Defense said only that , `` As with any military campaign , we are constantly reviewing our options alongside allies to enhance the capabilities available to NATO . '' Nearly 600 migrants and wounded civilians arrived Monday afternoon in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi aboard a boat from the embattled city of Misrata , said the International Organization for Migration , which chartered the vessel . The boat 's arrival marked the seventh such mission carried out by the group since mid-April . The boat 's passengers included nearly 400 people from Niger as well as migrants from Nigeria , Chad , Sudan , Pakistan , Egypt , Bangladesh , Tunisia and seven Palestinians . The boat had arrived Saturday in Misrata carrying 280 tons of food aid and a field hospital . The developments came as the International Committee of the Red Cross appealed to donors for an additional $ 53 million `` to help the organization meet the urgent needs of people affected by the fighting in Libya . '' `` As long as the conflict in Libya continues , the outlook for the coming months is dire , and living conditions may further deteriorate for a large percentage of the population , '' said Boris Michel , ICRC head of operations for North and West Africa . The Council of the European Union reiterated its call Monday for the protection of civilians , a cease-fire and identifying Gadhafi as `` a threat to the Libyan people . '' Catherine Ashton , the European Union 's foreign policy chief , was to detail on Monday meetings with Libya 's rebel leaders a day after opening an office in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . Ashton was to brief the EU 's foreign ministers about weekend meetings where she pledged support from the 27-nation union to the chairman of Libya 's Transitional National Council . `` I am here today to explain and be clear about the depth and breadth of our support in the European Union for the people of Libya , '' Ashton said in a statement Sunday by the EU shortly after her meeting with Mustafa Abdul Jalil , the transitional council chairman . During the meeting , Ashton said she and Jalil discussed security reform , border management , the economy and civil society . Arrest warrants have been issued by the International criminal Court for Gadhafi and two relatives , linking them to `` widespread and systematic '' attacks on civilians as they struggle to retain power in Libya . The court 's chief prosecutor , Luis Moreno-Ocampo , has said that the court in The Hague will investigate allegations of institutionalized rape in the war-torn country . A Libyan government official told CNN that Gadhafi 's government welcomes the court 's investigation but said that prosecutors `` have not been to Libya to do an investigation . '' Siham Sergewa , a Libyan psychologist , has been collecting reports of women reportedly raped and beaten by Gadhafi ` sforces that she says she is sharing with the criminal court . Sergewa told CNN 's Sara Sidner that she began collecting the reports after receiving a call from the mother of a patient in Ajdabiya , a town in eastern Libya that was the scene of some of the earliest fighting between rebels and government forces . The mother told Sergewa that she had been abducted by three or four men and taken to the desert where she was raped . Since then , Sergewa told CNN she has collected surveys from more than 270 women at refugee camps along Libya 's borders with Egypt and Tunisia who allege they were assaulted by Gadhafi forces .

The attacks got under way hours after a Pentagon spokesman acknowledged that the United States is providing munitions for allies to use in the air campaign against Libya . `` We have provided material support , including munitions , to allies and partners engaged in operations in Libya , '' Col. Dave Lapan said in a statement . But , as President Barack Obama warned Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Wednesday that there would be `` no letup '' in NATO airstrikes , Russia lashed out against the air campaign , calling the bombing of certain Tripoli targets a `` flagrant deviation '' from the United Nations mandate . World leaders urge patience in Libya Children seek shelter in Libya 's caves Damaged wells could push out rebels Gadhafi missiles litter rebel town The U.N. chief said the special U.N. envoy for Libya , who has been in Benghazi meeting with the Libyan opposition , would return soon to Tripoli to try to secure an agreement . The war has dragged on for more than two months , with reports of horrific fighting and civilian casualties . The Russian Foreign Ministry alleged Wednesday that several `` non-military facilities in Tripoli that had already been bombed , were again attacked in a massive NATO airstrike , leading to civilian casualties . '' It said in a written statement that `` this is yet another flagrant deviation '' from the U.N. Security Council resolution 1973 . That resolution authorized all means necessary , short of occupying forces , to enforce a no-fly zone and protect Libyan civilians from attacks by forces loyal to Gadhafi . A barrage of at least 18 rockets struck Tripoli Tuesday , killing 19 people and wounding another 150 in the heaviest onslaught since NATO 's aerial strikes began , a government official told CNN . NATO said it had struck a government vehicle storage facility adjacent to Gadhafi 's compound . The Russian ministry said NATO has justified its attacks by citing the need to protect civilians but said that it was `` impossible to deny the obvious fact that airstrikes are not stopping military confrontation between the warring Libyan sides , and are only causing additional suffering of peaceful Libyans . '' It said the airstrikes are failing to end the Libyan conflict , which was triggered by protests in February and an ensuing crackdown by Gadhafi 's forces . Russia , which has been critical of the airstrikes all along , has said normalization in Libya can come only from an immediate halt in military activities , the ministry said . Some have viewed the Libya campaign as a litmus test for relations between the alliance and Russia . The 28 members of NATO work with Russia as equal partners in the NATO-Russia Council , a group that works on a wide array of issues , including security . Obama , who met Wednesday in London with his British counterpart , David Cameron , increased pressure on Gadhafi by repeating that , ultimately , the embattled strongman must go . The mission to protect Libyans from their leader means making sure Gadhafi `` does n't have capacity to send in a bunch of thugs to murder innocent civilians and threaten them , '' Obama said . `` I do think we have made enormous progress in Libya . We have saved lives . Gadhafi and his regime need to understand there will not be a letup in the pressure we are applying , '' Obama said . But he and Cameron said it will take time to reach a solution in the North African country , ruled with an iron fist by Gadhafi for 42 years . `` We may have to be more patient than people would like , '' Obama said of the apparent stalemate . In an effort to break the monthslong standoff , South Africa President Jacob Zuma plans to visit Tripoli next week for talks with Gadhafi , according to a statement on the South African leader 's website . Zuma will meet Gadhafi Monday in `` his capacity as a member of the African Union high-level panel for the resolution of the conflict in Libya , '' the statement said . The panel also includes Uganda and Mauritania . It is the second such trip for Zuma , who was part of an African Union delegation that visited the nation last month . That visit , which included talks on a cease-fire , did not succeed . The Libyan government lashed out Wednesday at Obama and Cameron . `` It is illegal and illegitimate to speak about regime change under the pretext of protecting civilians , '' said a government official . `` It is up to the Libyan people to decide when and if Colonel Gadhafi should go -- not the U.S. and the U.K. '' Russia 's official RIA Novosti news agency reported that Gadhafi 's government may ask Moscow to mediate the conflict . Meanwhile , in Tripoli , daily life has become more onerous . One woman said Wednesday that she had waited more than three days on line to get a half-tank of fuel for her car . The woman said that , while waiting in the line on Tuesday night , she saw a man a few cars ahead of her reach the fuel pump and present his number to a police officer , who rejected it as fraudulent . When the man protested , the police officer fatally shot him , she said . Witnesses torched a police car in retaliation , she said . Life outside the capital also appears precarious . The same woman said about three dozen Gadhafi soldiers on Saturday broke into her family 's farm near Zwara -- just east of the Tunisian border -- and moved in . One of the soldiers told the farm caretaker they were taking over civilian properties to use as command posts and weapons storehouses because they feared being attacked by NATO if they were to use military facilities , said the woman , who asked not to be identified because she fears reprisal . A number of residents of the city of Yefren , about two hours southwest of Tripoli , had taken up residence in caves in order to avoid pro-Gadhafi forces , said an elderly man who cited safety concerns in declining to be identified . Nearby residents avoid seeking help from Yefren 's hospital , he said . `` Any injured person who tries to enter the hospital is detained by the brigades , '' he said . `` We try to treat our wounded and give them first aid and protect them inside the mountain so they wo n't be killed or kidnapped by Gadhafi 's brigades .

Naji Abdelwanis had a plan : study hard , earn a degree in the United States and return to his country to build a better Libya . The 45-year-old from Benghazi never doubted that he would complete his degree . He has already finished two years at Clemson University with high marks . But now , with Libya in turmoil and its government 's assets frozen overseas , his dream is in disarray . Abdelwanis , who is earning a doctorate in industrial engineering , is one of about 2,000 Libyans studying in the United States . They are dependent on scholarships provided by the regime of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi . But with about $ 30 billion of the government 's assets frozen by the U.S. government , Libya is now unable to cover all of the tuition , living expenses and health insurance costs of the students and their families . The money , which is administered by a Canadian non-profit group , will run out on May 31 . This leaves students like Abdelwanis -- especially those with families -- nervous about how they will keep a roof over their heads . Abdelwanis has five other family members to feed . And his options do n't look promising . `` They are n't giving us any visible solution , '' he said . `` I ca n't work with a student visa . I ca n't return because it is too unsafe . I do n't even have enough money to buy a ticket . '' The Canadian Bureau for International Education , which distributes the funds in the United States and Canada , is worried that the students will lose their status and possibly their right to live in North America . It is urgently looking for different avenues to secure money . `` I think that everybody realizes that the students are innocent victims of circumstances way beyond their control , '' said CBIE Vice President Jennifer Humphries . `` It is not appropriate in any way to have them distressed or potentially in any danger because we can not find mechanisms to provide support to them . '' CBIE manages the Libyan-North American Scholarship Program with the Libyan Ministry of Education and Scientific Research . While some 2,500 Libyan students pursue graduate and post-graduate medical studies through the program , Humphries said , close to 4,000 Libyans , including family members , are dependent on it . In February , as Libya sank into civil war , the U.S. Treasury Department froze many of the Libyan government 's assets held in America . CBIE later received permission from the Treasury to distribute funds it already had for the current academic year , but had trouble accessing any new money .

The guys running Tribute FM are amateurs who dug into their own pockets to fund Libya 's first English-language online broadcaster targeting a worldwide audience . So far it has received a few e-mails and Skype calls from listeners from as far away as Denmark , the United States and Italy . `` It is a people 's movement right , but started by youth and powered by youth , OK , '' one of the DJs says into his mike as the show begins . He wants to be heard , not seen or identified by name because , he says , it will put his family at risk . They still live in areas controlled by forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi . He , meanwhile , is in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi and using his microphone as a weapon against the regime . `` This is our gift to all martyrs , to the people who actually died and suffered throughout this revolution , '' explains his colleague Aiman , who also asks that only his first name be used . Rebel airstrip awaits NATO go ahead They are both Libyans who recently returned to the North African country from Britain . They have teamed with two of their countrymen in Benghazi and they 're all looking to play a part in the history of their country -- a country they hope is in the midst of major change . `` We had 42 years of suffering , '' Aiman says . `` We want to show the people that this regime hurt Libya very much . Hopefully it will be over very soon . We just want to prove to the world that Gadhafi is no longer wanted in this land . '' The station format swings wildly from news and information to all kinds of music , from hardcore revolutionary rap to ballads . The show begins with the sounds of Bob Marley 's `` Redemption Song '' and its chorus : `` Redemption song\\/These songs of Freedom , songs of freedom . '' Then the team starts a talk segment , joking about how their co-founder had been sleeping while their website was hacked and knocked offline . They have no proof but they suspect it was an effort by the government because they have already been talked about on government-run TV . `` They actually did mention us four or five times on the state -LRB- TV -RRB- , '' says Aiman . `` They said we 've been brought up by foreign countries to spread Christianity . '' The station founders dismiss this as a ridiculous allegation : yes , they are trying to spread a message , but it is not about religion , it 's about revolution , they say . Even the language choice is a slap at Gadhafi 's regime : from 1986 to 1997 the government banned the teaching of English in Libya . The team is on air from 8 p.m. to about 4 a.m. local time . They want to be able to broadcast for as long as possible , so they are recruiting and auditioning volunteers . Applicants have to be able to speak English if they want to be an announcer : many can because they have lived abroad . `` My dad , a couple of years ago , he wrote an article criticizing Gadhafi 's regime , '' recalls Hamida Baja . `` You know , here you are not allowed to do that so we were targeted . Moammar -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- saw the article and he was n't too happy about it . '' She and her family fled in fear . Her brothers still live abroad . `` I also fear that he might kill my dad or he might come threaten me and my mom . '' Baja is willing to help out at the station in any way that she can . She says it is also a venue that can give women a voice . `` It 's a new beginning . We can say how we feel and what we feel whenever we like .

It found itself facing a clash of cultures when it played rap music from the west , complete with curse words . `` We apologized to our listeners , '' Aiman says . `` We try to keep with the culture and our tradition . We try to keep everything here very clean , very moderate . '' But what they wo n't apologize for is slamming the Gadhafi regime at will . `` I believe we are in the frontline but with a voice , not with a gun , '' Aiman says .

Moscow has been a strong critic of the NATO-led mission in Libya , arguing that the scope of the organization 's air campaign against Gadhafi 's forces far exceeds the civilian protection mandate approved by the U.N. Security Council . Medvedev 's call for Gadhafi to step aside came at the end of the Group of Eight summit in Deauville , France , on Friday . The G8 includes the United States , the United Kingdom , France , Canada , Japan , Germany , Italy and Russia . The G8 leaders also issued a written statement Friday expressing support for the democratic uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa . The summit leaders agree that `` the regime of Gadhafi has lost its legitimacy and he must leave , '' Medvedev said , according to Russia 's state-run RIA Novosti news agency . `` This was decided unanimously . '' His statement came on the heels of a request from the other G8 leaders to have the Russian leader mediate a settlement . Earlier , Gadhafi 's government also called for a Russian mediation , a sign that the Libyan leader may be searching for a way to bring about an end to the months-long war . Libyan Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmudi asked for help in achieving a cease-fire and starting talks without preconditions , according to a statement posted late Thursday by the Russian Foreign Ministry . During that conversation , Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Libya would have to comply with the Security Council mandate and stop any action that would cause harm to civilians , the statement said . On Wednesday , the Russian Foreign Ministry called NATO 's recent bombing of certain Tripoli targets a `` flagrant deviation '' from U.N. Security Council resolution 1973 . That resolution authorizes all means necessary , short of occupying forces , to enforce a no-fly zone and protect Libyan civilians from attacks by forces loyal to Gadhafi . Russia , a permanent member of the Security Council , abstained from the vote on the resolution . U.S. President Barack Obama , who had an extended private meeting with Medvedev while in France , insisted Friday that `` the U.N. mandate of civilian protection can not be accomplished when Gadhafi remains in Libya directing his forces in acts of aggression against the Libyan people . '' `` We are joined in resolve to finish the job , '' he declared . A spokesman for Libya 's transitional government said Gadhafi must leave before the opposition could consider negotiations or a cease-fire . `` There is no more room for him in or near Libya , '' said Jalal el-Gallal , a spokesman for the National Transitional Council . NATO member Spain said Thursday that Libya had sent a message to Madrid and other European capitals , listing `` a series of proposals that could lead to a cease-fire , '' but the allies have rebuffed earlier Libyan proposals for an end to the fighting . While Gadhafi has been unable to come to terms with NATO demands , there may also be a growing rift between the NATO allies and the Libyan rebels over the nature of a post-Gadhafi regime . French President Nicolas Sarkozy indicated Thursday that any future Libyan government may include senior members of Gadhafi 's regime so long as those individuals do not have `` blood on their hands . '' El-Gallal responded to Sarkozy by declaring Friday that it `` is only up to the Libyan people '' to decide `` who will remain '' in government and who will not . Intense fighting , meanwhile , continued on the ground in Libya , with at least 10 people killed and over 40 injured during clashes that occurred Friday in Dafniya , outside the hotly contested coastal city of Misrata . NATO warplanes bombed the Tripoli area late Thursday , with a tribal site near the capital the target of the latest attacks , a Libyan official said . Five explosions , most large enough to shake buildings some distance away , struck Tripoli shortly before midnight . The Libyan official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the target was the tribal compound at Bab Al-Azizya , about 2 kilometers -LRB- 1.3 miles -RRB- from the center of Tripoli . CNN could not independently confirm the report . The site is a former military base now used to welcome tribal visitors to Tripoli , offering them guest houses during their stay , the official said . It has been used as a center for people volunteering to support Libyan authorities since the revolt against Gadhafi erupted in February .

Now that the siege is over , people feel safe enough to come out . Get up to speed on some recent developments in Libya and what the future might bring The humanitarian situation will likely worsen if the conflict drags on into the summer The rebels in Libya seemed to have finally taken control of Misrata -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three months after protests against Moammar Gadhafi began in Libya , the country seems to be grinding into a stalemated civil war . Get up to speed on some of the recent events in Libya , what options President Obama and U.S. allies might have and what the next few months may bring as CNN 's Tim Lister answers some frequently asked questions about the crisis : In the past week especially , President Obama has stepped up his call that Gadhafi must go . What options do Obama and the allies of the U.S. have moving forward ? On the military front , the war in Libya has evolved into one of attrition . The United States is not taking the lead in terms of bombing missions , but the Pentagon disclosed this week that it was supplying munition to NATO allies to help them carry out sorties . Those sorties are increasingly aimed at what NATO terms the regime 's command and control functions , and increasingly at targets in and around Tripoli -- in other words at the nerve-center of the Gadhafi regime . The tactic is similar to that which NATO used when it was trying to expel Serbian troops from Kosovo in 1999 . Its planes began bombing targets close to the heart of the Milosevic regime in Belgrade , but it took 11 weeks of sustained attacks before Yugoslavia -LRB- as it then was -RRB- sued for peace . Libya : Explain it to me In the past week , the UK and France have announced they will begin using Apache helicopters against Gadhafi 's forces . The helicopters will be based offshore and allow for swifter reaction against smaller targets . And at the G-8 summit British Prime Minister David Cameron insisted progress was being made . `` There are signs that the momentum against Gadhafi is really building , '' he said . `` So it 's right that we are ratcheting up the military , the economic and the political pressure on the Gadhafi regime . '' But no one among the coalition is under any illusions about the task at hand . For a start , there is the wear and tear on the already overstretched air assets of the European members of NATO spearheading the air war . In London this week , Obama said : `` Ultimately this is going to be a slow , steady process in which we 're able to wear down the regime forces and change the political calculations of the Gadhafi regime to the point where they finally realize that they 're not going to control this country . '' What impact will the upcoming Senate vote on a resolution to back U.S. military action in Libya have , if anything ? The resolution has been suggested as a way around the thorny issue of the War Powers Act , passed in 1973 at the height of the debate over Vietnam . The Act prohibits U.S. armed forces from being involved in military actions for more than 60 days without congressional authorization . That 60-day mark has been passed -LRB- it was May 20 -RRB- , but there has been no congressional approval . It 's not the first time . In 1999 , then-President Bill Clinton continued airstrikes in the former Yugoslavia past the 60-day deadline . Again , the rationale was that civilians -LRB- in Kosovo -RRB- were being protected . Last week President Obama wrote to congressional leaders urging support for the action against Libya but not suggesting his action depended upon their approval . `` I wish to express my support for the bipartisan resolution ... which would confirm that the Congress supports the U.S. mission in Libya , '' he wrote , `` and that both branches are united in their commitment to supporting the aspirations of the Libyan people for political reform and self-government . '' But there 's clearly disquiet in Congress over its lack of leverage on Libya . This week the House passed by a huge majority an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill that would `` prevent funds from being used to deploy , establish or maintain a presence of members of the armed services or private security contractors on the ground in Libya . '' Next week Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D-Ohio , is expected to introduce a resolution calling for a full withdrawal from the Libyan action in accordance with the War Powers Act . Any amendments to the Defense Authorization bill would also have to be passed by the Senate . The Senate resolution on Libya currently planned would not be binding . Libya is calling on Russia to mediate a cease-fire . Why Russia and what will be Russia 's role moving forward ? Is it likely that Gadhafi is open to a cease-fire ? Russia 's stance on Libya has shifted . For the first time it is suggesting that Gadhafi should step down . Russia 's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted by Russian media Friday as saying that Gadhafi had forfeited his legitimacy as Libyan leader . `` It 's necessary to find a formula for Gadhafi to leave , and such a step would help settle other issues , '' Ryabkov said . Russia also signed up to the G-8 summit declaration , which said Gadhafi `` has no future in a free , democratic Libya . He must go . '' Russia may have more leverage with the Libyan regime than some Western countries . It has not been involved in the military campaign and has actively criticized its execution as beyond the mandate of UN Security Council Resolution 1973 . It also has historic contacts with the Gadhafi regime , and was its chief arms supplier . Russian mediation would also be a way for Moscow to assert itself in an international crisis in which -- so far -- it has had little role . Libya seems open to Russian involvement . The Russian Foreign Ministry said late Thursday that Libyan Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmudi had asked for Moscow 's help in achieving a cease-fire and starting talks without preconditions . Mahmudi has also suggested that the regime is willing to talk with the rebel Transitional National Council . But there is no sign that the departure -- immediate or eventual -- of Gadhafi is on offer . `` The leader is in the heart of every Libyan . If he leaves , the entire Libyan people leave , '' said al-Mahmudi . At a news conference in Tripoli , al-Mahmudi said the offer was based on an existing African Union `` roadmap '' to resolve the conflict , which does not include any mention of Gaddafi 's own future . The rebels have demanded that Gadhafi and his family leave positions of power as a pre-condition to a settlement . The two sides are clearly far apart . Moammar Gadhafi has made few appearances since the April 30 NATO airstrike on a Gadhafi compound . Have there been any signs of cracks in the support for Gadhafi ? Gadhafi has been seen very rarely in recent weeks . In fact we are aware of just one appearance , at a hotel in Tripoli to meet tribal leaders on May 12 , an event that was broadcast on Libyan TV that day . That was two weeks after Libyan authorities said that his youngest son Saif al-Arab had been killed in an airstrike . It may be that NATO 's persistent attacks against the sprawling Gadhafi compound known as Bab el-Azizia have forced Gadhafi to move secretly between locations , even though NATO has said publicly it 's not targeting the Libyan leader . It is virtually impossible for outsiders to get a read on the regime 's inner circle , many of whom are family members . But none of those at the heart of the regime has publicly defected since the foreign minister . There have been plenty of rumors about defections -- almost since the NATO campaign began in mid-March -- but CNN correspondents with good contacts within the regime say they 've seen no signs of serious dissension . What is the status of the rebels and opposition movement ? How unified are they ? Which areas do they occupy ? Libyan enemies helping each other Keeping Gadhafi forces out of Misrata In recent weeks , the rebels have finally taken control of Libya 's third largest city , Misrata , helped by NATO attacks on Gadhafi forces that were shelling the center of the city and its port . There is still sporadic fighting around the city , which has seen some of the fiercest combat in Libya 's civil war . CNN 's Ben Wedeman reported from Misrata on Friday that another 10 people were killed in shelling . All told , the UN World Health Organization estimates nearly 1,000 people have been killed in Misrata . The city is the closest to Tripoli that the rebels control , but is still 130 miles from the capital -- and the rebels are not yet able to resupply it unhindered . Further east , the rebels have consolidated their control of Ajdabiya and are unchallenged in their headquarters -- the city of Benghazi . But pro-Gadhafi units are still operating around the city of Brega , which appears to be under government control . Toward the western border with Tunisia , fighting has flared in the last few weeks as rebels have tried to open a second front . But these rebels are not necessarily affiliated with the Benghazi Transitional National Council . They are Berbers from the Nafusa mountains . They control the town of Zintan , but it continues to be shelled by pro-Gadhafi forces . The humanitarian group Medecins Sans Frontieres said Friday it was pulling out of the town after intense rocket fire . CNN 's Nic Robertson reported from the mountains earlier this week . The towns of Yefren and Al Galaa , he reported , `` are at the eastern tip of a slender sliver of rebel-held territory extending 270 kilometers westwards to the Tunisian border . Both have been targeted by Gadhafi since they joined the rebellion three months ago . '' As with other areas , the fighting appears at times almost random and haphazard . This is not a conflict where troops are dug in along well-recognized front lines . As for the rebel leadership , it is united in one aim : removing Gadhafi . The Transitional National Council is made up of professionals such as doctors and lawyers and some tribal representatives . But there are other forces in Libya . One unknown is the strength of the Muslim Brotherhood or other Islamist groups , long driven underground by the regime . And in Libya -- as in Yemen -- tribes are a very important part of the political equation . There have been signs of tension within the rebels ' military leadership -- apparently more to do with personal rivalries than military strategy . One of the worst-case scenarios at the start of the NATO campaign was a stalemate and it seems to be at that point . What are some options for the NATO coalition under the current parameters ? Western officials sense that the tide is turning against Gadhafi , albeit slowly . That may have less to do with rebel operations than with the broader diplomatic landscape , the pressures on the inner circle through the Tripoli attacks , and the growing shortages that civilians in the capital and in other towns still held by pro-Gadhafi forces must endure . Earlier this week there were reports of people waiting as long as three days to get a half-tank of gasoline in Tripoli . What are some possible scenarios for the next few months ? It seems likely that in much of Libya -- if the conflict drags on -- the humanitarian situation will worsen . On Friday , Amnesty International published a report on the deteriorating situation in the mountains of western Libya , citing `` the growing difficulty of surviving on supplies smuggled in from Tunisia and the dangers of traveling to areas controlled by forces loyal to Colonel Gadhafi . '' The group Medecins Sans Frontieres says at least 30,000 Libyans are refugees in the Tunisian town of Tartouane . I traveled through the town two months ago , and it 's scarcely big enough to manage such an influx . There are chronic shortages of water , power and other basic necessities in mountainous areas of western Libya . The long-term economic implications of this war are tomorrow 's headache . In the east , Benghazi at least can receive supplies from outside , usually by sea . There have been reports of sporadic shortages , but nothing acute . There are no signs that the regime is about to fall apart . CNN has spoken to regime opponents in Tripoli in the recent past , but few are willing to challenge Gadhafi and none would dare speak publicly . That being said , life is clearly getting more difficult for Gadhafi 's inner circle . One Western diplomat made this analogy : `` It 's as if Gadhafi is on a desert island , and the tide -- slowly and sometimes even imperceptibly -- is gradually closing in , and his room for maneuver is shrinking . '' The rebels are beginning to receive military training and advice , and some equipment . But that wo n't change the military balance overnight . Ultimately , as President Obama put it in London this week : `` We may have to be more patient than people would like . '' CNN 's Katie Glaeser contributed to this report .

Lindsay - Special to CNN More than two months of bombing make it clear that the United States and its NATO allies are seeking to oust Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi . The air war , however , is not producing the quick result that NATO wanted . President Obama continues to resist European calls for a greater American commitment . He argues for sitting tight the air war will eventually force Gadhafi from power . Public opinion polls explain Obama s reluctance to do more right now Americans take a dim view of the operation . A new Quinnipiac University Poll finds that 57 percent of Americans don t think that the United States should be involved in Libya . Democrats and Republicans are equally unenthusiastic . But sitting tight requires patience that Americans and Europeans may not have . If domestic opposition to the air war grows , Gadhafi and his supporters might gain confidence that he can hang on , thereby undermining the bombing campaign . What steps could the administration take if it decides that the current air war isn t working , or working fast enough ? Obama has repeatedly ruled out sending in U.S. combat troops . Given the American public s intervention fatigue , he isn t likely to change his mind . So what might he do instead ? Here are five possibilities : 1 -RRB- Seek a negotiated solution . Washington could cut a deal with Gadhafi that imposes a ceasefire or sends him into exile . The Libyan dictator looks to be searching for such a deal . Obama has said it is impossible to imagine a future for Libya with Gadhafi in power . So any deal that allows him or his sons to continue ruling , which is what a ceasefire would do , would be seen as a substantial defeat . 2 -RRB- Arm the Rebels . Obama has authorized sending Libyan rebels $ 25 million worth of nonlethal equipment like body armor and uniforms . The British , French , and Italians have gone slightly further , providing some military advisers . Sending military arms might tip the balance in the fighting because airstrikes have seriously degraded Gadhafi s military forces . Arming the rebels does not guarantee a quick victory . Sophisticated weapons require training to use , and that training can take months . Washington also worries that weapons sent to Libyan rebels today could end up in the hands of anti-U.S. forces tomorrow . 3 -RRB- Ask NATO allies to do more . Obama has pushed Britain and France to lead the air war . They have grumbled but complied . France has begun dispatching attack helicopters to Libya , and Britain is considering the move . Washington can insist they do even more . How much more NATO allies can and will do , though , is an open question . The capacity of some contributing countries is already being tested , and European capitals share Washington s reluctance to wade deeper into Libya . So pushing Europe to do more could strain the transatlantic alliance 4 -RRB- Expand the air war . NATO could expand its target list to put more pressure on Gadhafi s supporters . It also could use airpower to support rebel fighters on the ground . Britain and France want the United States to commit roughly ten close air support aircraft to the fight . These AC-130 and A-10 planes were used early in the fighting to destroy Gadhafi s tanks . Two months of bombing have destroyed most of Libya s militarily significant targets . Gadhafi s forces now avoid airstrikes by hiding amongst civilians . Widening the target set or sending in close air support aircraft risks killing more civilians and undermining domestic support for the air war . 5 -RRB- Send in Special Forces . Navy SEALs raided Osama bin Laden s compound in Abbottabad , Pakistan . They could try to replicate that feat in Tripoli . The Abbottabad raid worked because the United States had exceptional intelligence on bin Laden s whereabouts as well as the element of surprise . Precise information about Gadhafi s location is hard to come by , and Special Forces wouldn t have surprise working for them . A raid that turned into Blackhawk Down rather than Abbottabad would hand Gadhafi a major political victory . Even as Obama struggles with how to push out Gadhafi , he has to contemplate a bigger challenge : what to do once he is gone . Iraq offers a cautionary lesson that it is far easier to topple dictators than it is to install just and effective governments . I 've got a 6th option ... US pulls ALL of our military out of every ungrateful , terrorist harboring sespool on this planent & we take care of our own .

But remember that , while they may not deserve our help and do n't appreciate it , it may do us more harm than good in the long run to abandon them . It 's satisfying to consider , but there are complex repercussions if we do . Also , be careful about the argument from `` national sovereignty '' . Nations may be sovereign in comparison to OTHER nations , but only individual human beings are truly Sovereign . A nation has NO right to oppress it 's own people by violating their sovereignty . It may not be in our best interest to defend the rights of individuals in other countries against their own governments , but `` national sovereignty '' is NOT a valid excuse for failing to do so .

However , in Libya we are seeing invasion , destruction and imperialism because if that was the case , then how about those civilians in Yemen , Bahrain and elsewhere ? In Egypt people were encouraged to avoid confrontation and taking weapons otherwise Mubarak would have crashed them and US , Europe would have backed him as they are doing so in Bahrain and Yemen . Without encouraging opposition in Libya that I sympathized with at the beginning to take weapons , Muammar Qaddafi would have gone today and the number of casualties would not have reached the figures we have today .

Then they hit Libyan 's infrastructures\\/residences just by labeling them command and control structures coupled with the NLC rebels and Gadhafi 's forces madly destroying each other 's cities like in Misrata . When the civil war ends the Brits and French will get billions of juicy contracts to replace Libya with new tanks , fighter jets , warships , civil contracts etc etc with Libyan 's oil and huge frozen foreign reserves .

Here rots Barack Obama , a black Zionist slave , an American terrorist and international war criminal , and 3rd ever `` illegitimate '' son of a Jewish whore to become US president NOTE : You may spit anywhere on grave I support the war in Afghanistan because we do n't want the terrorists to come back , but this Libya non-sense is a non-starter . We do n't need it . I understand the U.S. has spent upwards of a billion dollars in the Libya campaign so far . That 's a billion dollars better used to close budget gaps in state budgets for K-12 education or giving more college students grants and scholarships . This waste of money is unnecessary . Let 's leave Libya to Europe and the Libyans . May 27 , 2011 at 7:59 pm | Reply Quite true ! Libya is a nonstarter and should be left to its electors to sought out . Already the onset of the conflict was an unconsidered rush of France and Britain , which led to the current situation . A sensible thing to do is to let the UN deploy peace forces and set up a buffer zone . This will scale down all those air-strikes , that terrorise the populace and minimize further losses of lives . A diplomatic solution is the only answer to resolve the stalemate over this civil war . May 28 , 2011 at 3:42 am | Reply You are correct that we never should have gone in . However , we did so to back up our allies in EU . If we pull out , they will pull out of Afghanistan . The whole thing is a real mess . All of this goes back to W 's massive screw-up with Afghanistan . Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world . While our government is bombing the 7 million people of Libya , Mr White here is worried about how much money is being spent on killing people . Do n't you worry Mr White , it will be paid for by Libya 's frozen assets that our government stole from them , the biggest theft ever in human history .

Turning a blind eye to allow Gaddafi to butcher his people that oppose his families rule of Libya and then turning around buying oil from him would be what China would do ... At least we , the U.S. , is on the right side this time ... It would be nice to believe that this campaign will also help the UN in the future to be taken more serious by other dictators when the UN warns them to stop killing peaceful protestors . By not completing this campaign and then to remove Gaddafi , strips away any perceived authority of the UN and I would not expect any future dictator to take warnings seriously .

If any of you had a gram of decency you would be supporting Gaddafi . How can anyone just sit there and watch a 70 yr-old leader and his family being threatened with assasination .

Please people , you either speak the truth or just find something else to do . You are far from righteous or noble when you support such an attack on a small defenseless country , on the good man that Gaddafi is and what he did for the country for 41 yrs , etc. .

In that case , NATO will eventually have to commit ground forces to secure Misrata and push Gadhafi out of power . Even if that means a small US presence in Libya , I would prefer to leave it up to professionals as opposed to arming the resistance directly . May 28 , 2011 at 7:17 am | Reply I still have a difficult time understanding our country 's foreign policy strategy . Let 's take some examples . Iran , Syria , Sudan have been our shit list for ages . But when people in both countries rebelled and demanded democracy we did not stand by then . They were shot , tortured and massacred in hordes . But we stood by and watched it all happen . It is still happening in Syria . Have you seen the papers lately ? What have we done for the guys who are fighting for democracy in Syria . It seems our foreign policy is based on 1 -RRB- how do we benefit , 2 -RRB- how do we look good to the world 3 -RRB- what requires the least amount of USA human loss . If the answer to all these questions is YES , we go to war . I am not a big fan of Gadhafi , but this is a little extreme . First of all , we are not at war with Libya or the Gadhafi regime at this time . We are supporting a NATO action there . The situation in Syria is also very bad and should have been addressed already by the UN . I would support limited US involvment in Syria before it 's too late . I agree that our foreign policy is dubious , but I think that President Obama is doing as well as possible to improve foreign policy . However , if the man wants a second term he will have to work on domestic issues like the struggling economy and gradual decline in the quality of education in the United States .

So well coordinated action is hard to be prepared ad-hoc as result of some `` poetic '' movement called `` Arab spring '' and present level of media support to `` rebel cause '' and agility of UN is so suspicious , not to mention `` burnt bridges '' that French diplomacy made so promptly leaving no space for coalition to make any peace deal with current Libyan government .

Resolution 1973 clear purpose was to protect civilians not to support one side in a civil war , in this case an armed rebel force . We must find a better way to resolve conflicts in the 21st Century rather than bombing from 10,000 feet . We in the West have enormous political and military power , but the sign of truly Just and civilised nations are those that have power but choose only to use ultimate force when deemed the only possible solution . Clearly the Clinton administration failed abysmally over Rwanda and Bosnia , and that s not said in hindsight , it was obvious before the genocide really got going , but it is inappropriate to cite these two horrendous intent to slaughter with Libya . President Obama s , less than enthusiastic support of NATO s strategy , -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- is I think a sign of a man that is struggling to justify fully the actions currently being taken , and that is to be commended .

June 1 , 2011 at 3:01 pm | The audacity of NATO and the US and the Media painting the Libyan government as terrorists is typical of Nazi and Communist brainwashing . Tell big enough lies and the people will believe anything . glorifying a bunch of terrorists attacking the government of Libya and calling them the legitimate government ? is supporting terrorism , the very thing the US destroyed Iraq and Afganistan for . Who are the real terrorists ? America is NOT the America that once stood up for what is right but has become a tool in the hands of the big money boys . The US presidency is compromised . America , , take back your country . . May 31 , 2011 at 9:06 pm | Reply Here is the 6th Option . Every bomb that falls on lIbya is financed by debt and it represents a nail in our coffin . We have wasted $ 5 Trillion in 10 years to fight Osama 's few hundred followers . Osama 's plan was to banrupt America by drawing it into war in Muslim countries . America 's fatal love affair with Israel and the $ 3.5 billion debt dollars that it gives it in aid , got us involved in the Israeli-Muslim conflict . In my blog I explain how over 50 % of American military forces are war contractors and have the official government statistics . Two third of the war contractor employees are foreigners . How well will they fight in a real hot war like Vietnam ? In my blog I tell the truth about the war contractor multi-Trillion dollar business Note that as Congress has not issued a declaration of war as required by Art . 8 of the Constitution , this war is illegal in the first place . Obama 's excuse has been that it 's not a `` real war '' because there are no ground troops , which has no legal basis . Sending in ground troops without Congressional authorization would be grounds for impeachment . June 2 , 2011 at 11:23 am | Reply It is my position the the Arab Spring is potentially the greatest chance for peace in the entire region in decades . It is indeed the `` Arab '' Spring not the Tunisian Spring or the Egyptian Spring nor even the Syrian Spring . In every country the long term goals are primarily two . Greater political freedom and greater economic opportunities for millions of unemployed . As it stands now some countries are on the edge of being able to deliver on the promise of the first . As for the second , substantial economic progress , this is currently a distant goal at best for all countries involved . As long as their is no clear idea of what the endgame will be in Libya , Palestine and Syria , there will never be the investment needed to fulfill the needs of those countries as well as Egypt and Tunisia . Thus the `` Arab '' Spring is in danger of being still born . There is also the reality that the major parties on both sides of these `` revolutions '' are going to have to make peace to make any progress going forward . Not an easy task . The solution to this problem may also be Israels chance to solve it 's long standing impasse with the Palestinians . The only way any one country involved in the Arab Spring will be able to deliver dramatically on BOTH goals demanded of their citizens is for all those countries to become one . Tunisia needs to vote to join the Libyan rebels , not as allies , but as fellow long term countrymen . The same is true for Egypt . Together the first step can be reached . A non NATO led liberation of the three as one . A gesture such as agreeing to put the combined capital of the three in Al Bayda Libya is the type of compromise needed time and time again going forward . However , the ability to also transfer various members of armed forces , civil servants and such to other parts of the combined country will ease tensions among the recently warring parties for years to come . The combined economic expertise , natural resource revenues and large potential domestic markets for goods , backed by direct foreign investment should spur growth as never before in the combined region . Just as countless Arab governments have for millennium , the drafting of outside leadership to come and rule a country as capable but neutral parties could rarely be needed more than in this case . Thus , while not in anywhere near the brink of chaos as it 's neighbors , the obvious choices to lead the newly formed combined countries , and indeed to join the new entity would be King Abdullah II of Jordan and the likes of Munib R. Masri of Palestine as the original Prime Minister could form the type of government needed to both provide long term stability as a constitutional monarchy but also with a leader of government respected throughout the entire combined countries of the region . The over riding theme of the unification is the willingness of each national sovereign nation to re identify themselves as members of a new country for the good of the common whole . The new theme of `` I am doing this not only for me but for the good of countless millions of fellow countrymen so that I might provide political and economic equality for myself and my extended family and tribe '' has not had such an opportunity for perhaps decades . Which leads , if one has not already surmised , the unique opportunity to bring millions of Palestinians to the same goal . `` If we wish a better life we are now Libyans -LRB- or whatever the agreed upon name -RRB- and Arabs and we have a chance to move forward under new leadership to create a new future for ourselves and our future generations '' . Thus a united Tunisia , Libya , Egypt , Jordan and Palestine could become the model for other `` endgames '' to other nations of not only the Arab world but for sub Saharan Africa and other regions of the world .

The leader said the movement has a `` financial crisis '' and is seeking loans from outside the country .

NEW : South Africa 's president makes his second trip to Tripoli in recent weeks NEW : The aim is to stop hostilities and spur peace talks , an African Union official says The rebel leader says , `` We are in desperate need of money '' More than 25 rebels in Libya are wounded in an attack near rebel-held Misrata Dafniya , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- South African President Jacob Zuma is set to meet embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Monday , his second visit to Tripoli since unrest started roiling the North African country . Unlike many other world leaders and alliances , Zuma , his African National Congress party and the African Union -- which he will represent on his trip , and which Gadhafi himself once led -- have not called for the longtime Libyan leader to step down . In fact , it has criticized the NATO airstrikes targeting government forces . Noureddine Mezni , an African Union spokesman , said the mission is to call for the cessation of all hostilities , followed by peace talks between the warring parties . The continental organization has helped mediate such talks before , including ones in Kenya and Zimbabwe that left the ruling powers still in control . Zuma 's first visit to Tripoli in April was launched with similar intentions , but did not achieve its desired results . On Saturday , rebel leaders marked the 100th day of an uprising they say was launched over concerns about lack of freedom , democracy and other concerns related to Gadhafi 's 42-year rule . Its leader , Mustafa Abdul Jalil , told CNN on Saturday that his opposition movement is running out of money -- at the same time it has achieved key victories militarily and diplomatically , including Russia joining others in calling for Gadhafi 's exit . The chairman of the Benghazi-based National Transitional Council did not suggest in an exclusive interview that the rebels would pull back in their fight against Gadhafi 's government . But he pleaded for more resources so that the effort -- which is being backed by many Western nations -- could be successful . `` We are in desperate need of money , '' said Jalil , a former justice minister under Gadhafi . `` We really need money . We are going through a financial crisis . '' The opposition movement 's stature has been bolstered by the sale of a shipment of oil to China for $ 160 million , Jalil said . Still , he said the financial situation remains precarious for now -- especially with rebels ' limited access to more oil . `` People are patient and have been able to manage their lives at minimal living standards , '' he said . `` The problem is the prices have gone up . '' Jalil 's forces , meanwhile , continued to fend off attacks Sunday near the rebel-held city of Misrata . Gadhafi 's forces fired mortars and guns in an apparent effort to break through a stalemated line west of the city , CNN 's Ben Wedeman reported from the scene . Rebels returned fire , and while some pulled back to seek cover from the incoming artillery shells , others moved toward the front line near the town of Dafniya , about 35 kilometers -LRB- 22 miles -RRB- west of Misrata . More than 25 opposition fighters have been wounded in the battle so far , medics at a field hospital told CNN . They did not report any deaths , but fighters returning from the battle said two men had been killed . Ambulances continued bringing wounded in for treatment . Libya has been in the throes of a civil war for months , since Gadhafi dug in his heels against popular efforts to force him out of power as anti-government protests sweep the Arab world this year . NATO is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of any means -- with the exception of foreign occupation -- to protect civilians from attack or the threat of attack . It has been conducting airstrikes targeting Gadhafi 's military resources . Russia has not come on board fully supporting those strikes . But on Friday , President Dmitry Medvedev changed Moscow 's position and called for Gadhafi to step down . Ragtag rebels holding down Zintan Medvedev 's statement , echoing the stance of American and European leaders , appeared to indicate a closing diplomatic window for the Libyan strongman . In his interview with CNN , Jalil applauded Russia 's move . He said rebels would n't seek arms or economic aid from Russia , adding the council only wanted political support and help in expediting International Monetary Fund loans . Most valuable , he said , would be moving Gadhafi 's government closer to a political solition `` so no more blood will be spilled . '' `` We know very well that the Russians have relations with Moammar Gadhafi 's regime , and perhaps these relations will be used in the benefit of the revolutionaries in terms of finding an exit strategy for Gadhafi , '' Jalil said . He reiterated that the transitional council will `` agree to any cease-fire that leads to removing Moammar Gadhafi . Anything short of that is unacceptable . '' Jalil said Saturday he has offered amnesty to Gadhafi loyalists who defect before the demise of the regime , but reiterated that there will be `` no negotiation for any solution until Gadhafi 's departure . '' Once that happens , elections and a constitutional referendum will be held within a year . Marking what he called the 100th day of the nation 's civil war on Saturday , the rebel leader voiced optimism even given the movement 's financial straits . `` We see victories emerging at both national and international levels , '' he said . `` We should celebrate what our heroic sons have accomplished in Misrata and the Nafusa mountains , as well as applaud the wide international support for our revolution .

Around 12:45 a.m. Tuesday , a pair of large blasts were heard about five minutes apart , as jets flew over the capital of Tripoli . A Libyan government official said the first strike hit Abu Sita , a former military turned construction site about 10 kilometers -LRB- 6 miles -RRB- from the city center . There was no immediate indication of where the second explosion occurred . Nor was there an immediate response from NATO , which has conducted regular strikes as part of its stated mission to halt Libyan leader Gadhafi 's forces from killing innocent civilians . Hours before the blasts , Zuma emerged from a meeting with the longtime Libyan strongman convinced that Gadhafi was ready for an end to hostilities , including such airstrikes and the ongoing fight with the Benghazi-based opposition movement . But he gave no indication that Gadhafi was prepared to step aside , as rebel leaders have insisted is their primary demand . Libya opposition : ` We really need money ' Ragtag rebels holding down Zintan `` Brother leader took the position today that he is ready to implement the decision of the AU -LRB- that -RRB- there must be a cease-fire , '' Zuma told a scrum of reporters on the tarmac at Tripoli 's Mitiga International Airport before boarding a jet . `` The view is that that must include -- bombing by NATO must also come to an end , '' he said in the news conference , which was broadcast on Libyan state television . Zuma added that Gadhafi said any cease-fire must apply to all parties , `` but also , he makes the point that : Let the Libyan people be given a chance to talk among themselves . And therefore , he 's ready to implement the road map of the AU . '' Unlike some other world leaders , Zuma has not called for the longtime Libyan leader to step down . Neither has Zuma 's African National Congress party nor the African Union , which he was representing and which Gadhafi once led . In fact , the AU has criticized the NATO airstrikes . In April , Zuma led an AU delegation to Tripoli , where hopes were raised briefly when it was announced that Gadhafi had agreed , in principle , to the African Union 's `` road map '' proposal for peace . But Gadhafi continued his attacks and the Libyan opposition rejected the proposal because it did not meet its demand that he give up the power he has held for 42 years . A government official said Libyan Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmudi also attended Monday 's meeting . Baghdadi greeted Zuma upon his arrival at the airport , where dozens of Gadhafi supporters carried posters , some of which said , `` May the leader be victorious '' and `` Thanks for great Africa . '' The African Union has helped mediate peace talks before , including ones in Kenya and Zimbabwe that left the ruling powers in control . It was not clear whether Zuma used the opportunity to press Gadhafi for information on the whereabouts of South African freelance photographer Anton Hammerl . Hammerl has been missing in Libya since April and is believed dead . South Africa has said it got assurances from Libya that the journalist was alive . But a Libyan government spokesman has said his whereabouts were unknown . `` We never had him with us at any stage , '' spokesman Musa Ibrahim has said . The meeting came as Gadhafi 's grip on power appeared to continue to loosen . Eight generals from his army have defected to Italy , the Italian Foreign Ministry told CNN Monday . The generals were accompanied by more than 100 Libyan soldiers , a senior Italian official with firsthand knowledge of , and responsibility for , the operation said . The Libyans crossed their country 's border into Tunisia , where they were met by Italian intelligence agents , the official said . Italy announced Monday that it will open a consulate Tuesday in the rebel-held eastern city of Benghazi . Also Monday , the first locally based television station to operate in Libya since the start of the revolution was to begin broadcasting from the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . The station was founded by Momammed Nabus , who later was one of five journalists killed in the conflict . `` Gadhafi forces assassinated him for highlighting to the rest of the world the atrocities committed by the Gadhafi regime , '' said Zuheir Al-Barasi , who was to open the station 's broadcast from the city 's courthouse . In recent weeks , Gadhafi has been seen in public only rarely as NATO has stepped up attacks against his sprawling Bab el-Azizia compound . NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Monday that Gadhafi 's `` reign of terror is coming to an end . '' `` He is increasingly isolated at home and abroad , '' Rasmussen said during a speech in Bulgaria . `` Even those closest to him are departing , defecting or deserting . '' Rasmussen also said NATO has made `` significant progress '' in its Libya operation . NATO said Monday it has conducted 3,385 strike sorties in Libya since March . `` We have seriously degraded Gadhafi 's ability to kill his own people , '' Rasmussen said in his speech . `` We have prevented more massacres in Misrata and elsewhere across the country , and we are saving lives every day . '' The NATO-led bombing campaign began in March after the U.N. Security Council authorized the use of any means necessary -- short of occupation -- to protect civilians from attacks by Gadhafi 's forces . On Sunday , Libyan opposition forces continued to fend off attacks near the rebel-held port city of Misrata . But rebel leader Mustafa Abdul Jalil said over the weekend that the opposition movement is running out of money even as it has achieved key victories militarily and diplomatically . `` We are going through a financial crisis , '' said Jalil , chairman of the Benghazi-based National Transitional Council . In a speech in Geneva , Switzerland , the United Nations ' top human rights official noted Monday `` the brutality and magnitude of measures '' taken by the Libyan government . The government 's actions have been `` shocking , '' United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said , criticizing the `` outright disregard for basic human rights .

May 31 , 2011 at 11:19 am | Reply It 's quite funny how both the U.N. and NATO are quick to butt into Libya 's civil war and murder hundreds of civilians by bombing Libyan cities on behalf of the `` rebels '' there but yet are stone silent about this cursed Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen ! Especially this Saleh is at least 100 times worse than Mohammar Qadaffy has ever been but the right-wing media will never say that , of course !!!

The announcement , another blow to the Moammar Gadhafi regime , comes after NATO said it has decided to extend its mission in Libya by 90 days , continuing a campaign that began in March . Shukri Ghanem told CNN in Rome that he left Libya because the suffering of the people became too unbearable . `` This war is getting even worse every day and there is no end to it and we would like to end this thing peacefully and come back to a solution quickly to reinstate democracy and constitutional government , '' he said . Man aids struggling Libyan refugees The opposition 's National Transitional Council is based in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi . Ghanem could n't predict how long the Gadhafi regime will last but said the strongman 's political structure is in shambles . He said he does n't know how long he 'll be in Rome or when he 'll return to Libya . As for the NATO mission extension , Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen issued a statement saying , `` We are determined to continue our operation to protect the people of Libya . `` We will sustain our efforts to fulfill the United Nations mandate . We will keep up the pressure to see it through . '' Resolution 1973 was approved by the U.N. Security Council in March and authorized member states `` to take all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country , including Benghazi , while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory . '' The Libyan government has accused NATO of killing hundreds of civilians and wounding thousands more during a two-month bombing campaign in Libya . Between March 19 and May 26 , NATO air strikes have killed 718 `` civilian martyrs , '' according to Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim , who on Tuesday accused the alliance of acting outside `` the limits of international law . '' Another 4,067 were injured , he said . CNN can not independently verify the figures . The government released the numbers after meetings between Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and South African President Jacob Zuma in which the men discussed a possible African Union-brokered cease-fire , Ibrahim said . Under the prospective accord , `` everything would be on the table , '' said Ibrahim , `` including the place and position of Gadhafi . '' But , Ibrahim said , the country 's longtime ruler would not step down from power as a prerequisite for further dialogue concerning the prospective cease-fire . Zuma had `` lengthy discussions '' with Gadhafi , his office said in a news release . `` We call on all leaders in Libya to exercise decisive leadership to find a solution to the crisis in the country , and to put the interests of their country first , '' Zuma said in the release . He also urged `` NATO and other parties to respect the -LRB- African Union 's -RRB- role in searching for a solution . '' An intensified NATO campaign has resulted in sizable defections from the Gadhafi camp , including eight generals who recently fled to Italy , the U.N. Under-Secretary-General B. Lynn Pascoe said in a written statement . In recent weeks , Gadhafi has been seen in public only rarely as NATO has stepped up attacks against his sprawling Bab el-Azizia compound . Rasmussen said Monday that Gadhafi 's `` reign of terror is coming to an end . '' `` He is increasingly isolated at home and abroad , '' Rasmussen said in a speech in Bulgaria . `` Even those closest to him are departing , defecting or deserting . '' Rasmussen said NATO has made `` significant progress '' in its Libya operation after conducting more than 3,300 strike sorties since March . Opposition forces have also gained ground in the port city of Misrata , pushing westward toward the Libyan capital , the statement said . Government forces have regrouped in positions along the country 's western Nafusa mountains , especially near the city of Yefran , where some 54,000 Libyans have fled to neighboring Tunisia , Pascoe said . Close to 900,000 people have fled Libya since the recent conflict began back in February , the United Nations says . Ghanem has been in charge of an industry battered by the civil conflict raging across the country . According to Ghanem 's curriculum vitae on the website of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries , he is married with three daughters and one son . He received a bachelor 's degree in economics at the University of Libya in Benghazi and earned advanced degrees in the United States , at Tufts University 's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in Boston . Ghanem has master 's degrees in both economics and law and diplomacy and a doctorate in international economics , the website says . He 's held various positions in the Libya 's government , including several spots in the Oil Ministry , and has been director of the OPEC secretariat 's research division . He has written many articles and books on energy , it says . He was secretary of the General People 's Committee from June 2003 to March 2006 , a position that 's equivalent to prime minister . Ghanem has been chairman of the Management Committee of the National Oil Corporation from April 2006 to the present . CNN 's Hada Messia , Raja Razek and Richard Roth contributed to this report .

Medvedev 's statement , echoing the stance of American and European leaders , appeared to indicate a closing diplomatic window for the longtime Libyan strongman . The chairman of the National Transitional Council , Mustafa Abdul Jalil , said he has offered amnesty to Gadhafi loyalists who defect before the demise of the regime , but reiterated that there will be `` no negotiation for any solution until Gadhafi 's departure . '' Once that happens , elections and a constitutional referendum will be held within a year , Jailil said in the opposition stronghold of Benghazi . In an interview with CNN , Jalil said the council had sold a shipment of oil to China for $ 160 million . The confirmation of the sale is expected to buttress the political and economic credibility of the fledgling rebel power .

The unrest in Libya has persisted for months as opposition members demand an end to Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule . Jalil marked the 100th day of the nation 's civil war . `` We see victories emerging at both national and international levels , '' he said . `` We should celebrate what our heroic sons have accomplished in Misrata and the Nafusa mountains , as well as applaud the wide international support for our revolution . '' Meanwhile , a series of morning explosions rocked the capital of Tripoli on Saturday , including blasts at a compound belonging to Gadhafi and one at a nearby tribal compound , a government official said . The official said one morning strike occurred on Bab bin Ghashir , a tribal compound near Gadhafi 's Bab al-Aziziya compound , where the other strikes occurred . The official believed the strikes were NATO attacks . Morning strikes in Tripoli are rare . NATO confirmed one of the attacks -- a press officer said the strike on Bab bin Ghashir was timed to minimize civilian casualties . NATO said it targeted a vehicle storage area at Bab bin Ghashir . The tribal compound is used by people who volunteer as support forces for Libyan authorities . A decade ago , the site was used as a military station . NATO is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of any means -- with the exception of foreign occupation -- to protect civilians from attack or the threat of attack .

Qatari authorities took her and her parents from a hotel in Doha , the capital , and forced them onto a military plane that left Qatar early Thursday and landed in rebel-held Benghazi . Al-Obeidy , who has gone into hiding in the city , said the Qataris beat and handcuffed her before forcing her onto the plane . Al-Obeidy told a journalist that officials in the Transitional National Council had pressured the Qataris to expel her . Hours before her deportation , Obeidy told CNN that armed guards had been posted outside her room , preventing the UNHCR representative from assisting her .

HRW added that an NTC spokesman had told the group that she was free to travel domestically and abroad . Al-Obeidy received worldwide attention on March 26 when she burst into the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli while international journalists staying there were having breakfast . She told reporters she had been taken from a checkpoint east of Tripoli and held against her will for two days while being beaten and raped by 15 men . She later fled Libya to Tunisia with the help of two defecting Gadhafi army officers and their families . French diplomats drove her from the border and handed her off to rebel officials -- members of the Transitional National Council -- who organized her flight to Qatar . She was in Qatar awaiting resettlement as a refugee when she was deported . The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees had prepared papers for her departure from Qatar to begin a new life . But her deportation to Benghazi puts her in a city that remains unstable . A bomb detonated Wednesday night outside the Tibesti Hotel in Benghazi , which has housed foreign journalists , aid workers and foreign officials since the Libyan conflict began .

He said officials were working with international organizations to make sure she is safe and finds asylum in `` a third country . '' A number of nongovernmental organizations said they were making efforts to get al-Obeidy out of Benghazi to a destination in Europe in the next few days . After arriving in Qatar , al-Obeidy made public statements saying the Transitional National Council -- the Libyan rebel leadership -- was using her .

'' The U.S. criticism comes on the heels of reports that al-Obeidy was beaten in Qatar before being deported back to Libya . Nasha Dawaji , a U.S.-based Libyan pro-freedom activist , said she was with three key members of the Transitional National Council when they first learned that al-Obeidy was forced from Doha and arrived in Benghazi on Thursday . Al-Obeidy had a black eye , like she had been punched , Dawaji said . She also had bruises on her legs and scratches on her arms . The council members were upset upon seeing al-Obeidy 's condition and vowed to open an investigation , Dawaji said . Al-Obeidy had fled Libya following the alleged rape and was in Qatar awaiting resettlement as a refugee when she was deported early Thursday . Al-Obeidy sent back to Libya In the hours leading to her deportation , armed guards had been posted outside her hotel room , preventing a representative from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees , UNHCR , from helping her , al-Obeidy told CNN . The U.N. agency had prepared papers for her departure from Qatar to begin a new life . Al-Obeidy said Qatari authorities then took her and her parents by force from the Kempinski Residences & Suites in the Qatari capital . She said she was beaten and handcuffed , then forced onto a military plane to Libya . She also said the Qataris had taken everything from her and her parents -- including cell phones , her laptop , and money . On Friday , she offered CNN more detail on what happened in Qatar . When confronted by the Qatari agents , the UNHCR said that al-Obeidy was protected under refugee status , she said . `` We do n't have an agreement with the U.N. , '' the Qataris responded . She was beaten in the parking lot by a group of men and women , she said . Her father and sister were also hit , she said . Once at the airport , they were hit some more , she said . Amnesty International called al-Obeidy 's deportation `` outrageous , '' saying the action taken by the Qatari government `` is a serious breach by Qatar of its international obligations . '' `` Nothing can justify what the authorities of Qatar have done : They have compromised this woman 's safety notwithstanding the danger she clearly faces , '' the New York-based human rights group said in a statement . An official at the Qatari Embassy in Washington asked CNN to e-mail questions about the deportation , but did not respond to them . The embassy in London also asked for written questions and CNN is waiting to hear back . CNN also placed numerous calls to various ministries in Qatar but could not reach anyone for comment . Friday is not a workday in the country . The hotel in Doha said it did not have anyone available for comment . Kempinski 's corporate office in Geneva , Switzerland , was unaware of the incident . An official there said the office may offer a response later . The UNHCR on Friday called the forced return a violation of international law . `` Ms. al-Obeidy has been recognized as a refugee by UNHCR . UNHCR was present at the hotel where Ms. al-Obeidy was staying in Qatar , ready to accompany her to the airport to travel to an emergency transit center in Romania . She was prevented from leaving for this flight in the early hours of Thursday morning , '' UNHCR said . Al-Obeidy told a journalist that officials in the Transitional National Council had pressured the Qataris to expel her . But , according to Dawaji , she did not blame the rebel group for the beating itself . She told CNN that when she asked her attackers why they were beating her , they said that Mahmoud Shammam and Mahmoud Jibril , both leaders in the Libyan rebel movement , had sent the Qataris an `` urgent letter '' saying that she had to be deported immediately . `` We tried all night to prevent her deportation , '' said Vincent Cochetel of the UNHCR office in Washington . He said the Qatari authorities had informed UNHCR that they had a court order that al-Obeidy 's visa had expired ; and they ignored UNHCR 's arguments that she already had refugee status . UNHCR representatives have spoken with al-Obeidy since she and her family arrived in Benghazi , though the details of those conversations were not disclosed to CNN . Benghazi , in eastern Libya , is the hub of the rebel movement that is battling to oust Gadhafi , Libya 's longtime leader . `` Forcibly returning a refugee who survived gang rape not only violates international law , but is cruel and could trigger further trauma , '' said Bill Frelick , refugee program director at Human Rights Watch . `` All eyes are now on the authorities in eastern Libya , who should allow al-Obeidy to leave the country .

The New York-based activist group added that a rebel group spokesman had told the group that she was free to travel domestically and abroad . Al-Obeidy said that the council has warned her not to do any more television interviews or it would hurt her chances of leaving Libya . Al-Obeidy received worldwide attention on March 26 when she burst into the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli while international journalists staying there were having breakfast . She told reporters she had been taken from a checkpoint east of Tripoli and held against her will for two days while being beaten and raped by 15 men . She was forcibly taken out of the hotel by security forces in a scuffle that was captured by television cameras . She was not heard from again for more than a week as Gadhafi 's representatives said they were investigating her claim . Then on April 4 , she spoke to CNN 's Anderson Cooper by phone about the alleged rapes . `` They had my hands tied behind me and they had my legs tied and they would hit me while I was tied and bite me in my body . And they would pour alcohol in my eyes so that I would not be able to see and they would sodomize me with their rifles and they would not let us go to the bathroom . We were not allowed to eat or drink , '' she said , speaking through a translator . `` One man would leave and another would enter . He would finish and then another man would come in , '' al-Obeidy said . She later fled Libya to Tunisia with the help of two defecting Gadhafi army officers and their families .

Scores more were still missing as a rescue operation by Tunisian authorities continued . But at least 578 people survived the sinking Wednesday , according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees . On Thursday , 195 survivors were transferred to a humanitarian aid camp close to the Tunisia-Libya border , according to a statement from the refugee agency . An additional 383 survivors were expected to be taken to the same or nearby camps for help . The overcrowded boat , which set sail May 28 from Tripoli , was headed for the Italian island of Lampedusa carrying about 850 people . The passengers were mostly migrants from West Africa , Pakistan and Bangladesh who were fleeing fighting in Libya , the refugee agency said in a statement . The agency said some survivors reported the boat was manned by people with little or no maritime experience . Soon after the boat left Tripoli , it ran into difficulties and by Tuesday , the passengers ran out of food and water . The boat ran aground Wednesday near the Kerkennah Islands , about 300 kilometers -LRB- about 186 miles -RRB- northwest of Tripoli in the Mediterranean Sea , the refugee agency reported . `` Desperate passengers rushed to one side , seeking rescue by the Tunisian coast guard and fishing boats that had approached the vessel , '' and the boat capsized , the agency said . `` This appears to be one of the worst and the deadliest incidents in the Mediterranean so far this year , '' said Adrian Edwards , a spokesman for the refugee agency .

At one point , the population of migrants vastly outnumbered the tiny population of Lampedusa , which numbers less than 6,000 . `` Boats loaded with migrants fleeing the ongoing conflict in Libya have been making the journey to Italy and Malta over recent months , sometimes with tragic consequences , '' the refugee agency said in its statement . `` Just last month , hundreds died as a vessel carrying about 600 people broke up shortly after departing Tripoli .

At least one person is thought to have died in custody , with his body showing signs of torture , the group said in a report based on visits to rebel-held parts of Libya . It is difficult to tell exactly how many civilians are being held without charge because some are held by militias and because the rebels do not clearly distinguish between civilian detainees and captured pro-Gadhafi fighters , Human Rights Watch said . The rebel Transitional National Council , based in Benghazi in eastern Libya , is seeking international support including money in its battle to oust Gadhafi . A NATO-led mission that has focused airstrikes on Gadhafi 's military capability bolsters the rebel efforts . However , the Human Rights Watch report raised questions about the rebel leadership 's overall control of its forces and observation of human rights . In addition to the report , the United States expressed disappointment last week over the expulsion by Qatar of Eman al-Obeidy to Libya , a decision that it called a `` breach of humanitarian norms . '' Al-Obeidy told a journalist that officials in the Transitional National Council had pressured the Qataris to expel her . Al-Obeidy grabbed the world 's attention earlier this year when she accused Gadhafi 's security forces of gang-raping her . She then fled Libya and was in Qatar awaiting resettlement as a refugee when she was deported Thursday to Benghazi . A high-level U.S. State Department source said Sunday al-Obeidy had left Libya and was on the way to Malta with her father . Al-Obeidy , who is being accompanied by a U.N. Human Rights Commission representative , will eventually head to a processing center in Europe before leaving for a final destination , the source said . British Foreign Secretary William Hague reiterated support for the Transitional National Council Sunday . `` These people at the top of this organization are genuine believers in democracy in the rule of law , '' Hague told the BBC Sunday . `` It is quite inspiring ... to see their real hope for the future of their country . '' `` Certainly I think they are genuine in wanting a democratic Libya and in their hopes for a free country , '' Hague said . Meanwhile , NATO aircraft carried out sustained airstrikes against targets in Tripoli Sunday , including command and control centers , several military support facilities and anti-aircraft weapon sites , according to a statement from NATO headquarters . `` The targets that were struck overnight were vital to the pro-Qadhafi forces ' ability to harm the civilian population - essentially they are the hub of Qadhafi 's command network , '' said Lieutenant-General Charles Bouchard , Commander of Operation Unified Protector . `` We will continue to erode its foundations until the violence against the Libyan population ends , '' U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates believes the sustained campaign is having an effect . `` Day by day , Gadhafi is seeing the people that are closest to him walking away , '' he said Sunday on a visit to Afghanistan .

However , I do not rule out that I may have to go to Tripoli , too , if I get the corresponding order from the president , '' Margelov told Interfax , the Russian news agency . Last month , Medvedev joined American and other European leaders in calling for Gadhafi to step down from power . The chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants against Gadhafi , his son and Libya 's intelligence chief for alleged crimes against humanity . Meanwhile , on Monday , the Swiss government authorized the state 's attorney general to open a criminal investigation into the kidnappings of two of its citizens , Rachid Hamdani and Max Goeldi , who allegedly have been held hostage in Libya for nearly two years . The developments came as rebels on the front line in Misrata said the main station supplying electricity to the city , which had been targeted by Gadhafi forces , had been hit . The attack left some areas of the city without power . According to various rebel fighters , Gadhafi 's forces carried out an early morning offensive on both the western and eastern fronts of Misrata . Government forces pushed 2 kilometers -LRB- 1.25 miles -RRB- into the city of Dafniya on the west side of Misrata and fired dozens of Grad rockets , destroying a plastic factory which killed one person and injured at least one other .

Two people were killed and 17 others were wounded in the fighting on the western front of Misrata , rebels said .

We will not think about death or life . We will think about the call of duty . '' At least three explosions rocked Tripoli late Tuesday night ; it was not immediately clear what they hit . Earlier in the day , NATO targeted a military base and Gadhafi 's compound , state television reported . A spokesman for the Libyan government said that at least 31 people were killed , including a number of civilians , and dozens more were wounded after 60 missiles struck the capital city . The compound was under `` intensive continuous bombardment , '' according to state TV , which reported buildings and infrastructure were destroyed . `` We will not surrender , we will not give up , '' Gadhafi said . `` We have one option -- our country . We will remain in it 'til the end . Dead , alive , victorious , it does n't matter . '' The blasts Tuesday , and others Monday that Libyan officials said hit state television buildings , elicited heated responses from the government spokesman . `` We believe NATO understands that its military campaign is failing miserably , '' said spokesman Musa Ibrahim . `` No one has the right to shape Libya 's future except for Libyans . '' Ibrahim said Tuesday 's morning blasts hit the popular guard compound and revolution compound , which are military barracks near Gadhafi 's Bab al-Aziziya compound . The spokesman said the attack on the television network killed two people and wounded 16 . `` We did not target or hit the Libyan broadcast facilities . What we did target was the military intelligence headquarters in downtown Tripoli , '' the alliance said . `` The story coming from Libyan officials that we targeted and hit the state broadcaster 's building is bogus . '' The back and forth between Libyan officials and NATO continues a public relations war between the two sides . Libyan officials have continually charged that NATO airstrikes have damaged civilian facilities and killed hundreds of civilians . NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said recently that his forces have made `` significant progress '' in its U.N. Security Council mandate to protect Libyan civilians . This week , the Libyan government said it had evidence that alliance airstrikes were harming civilians . Officials took journalists to Tajura , a city east of Tripoli , to show them a small crater that held what appeared to be the remains of a rocket . The reporters were also taken to nearby homes that the government said had been damaged by airstrikes . NATO said it had been active in the area hitting military sites but could not say whether the attacks had caused the damage in the residential area . Reporters were also taken to a nearby hospital to see Nasib , a comatose baby who was a victim of the airstrikes , the government said . A woman , who the government said was Nasib 's mother , cried over the child 's listless body . Journalists were not allowed to talk to the woman or to the doctors . But one doctor quietly slipped a note to one of the journalists that said the girl was injured in a car accident , not a bomb attack . British Foreign Secretary William Hague , speaking Tuesday to British lawmakers , said the European Union has added six additional ports controlled by pro-Gadhafi forces to its sanctions list in an effort to starve Gadhafi 's troops of military supplies . He said the United Kingdom intends to push for additional sanctions against Gadhafi 's regime . `` Any political settlement in Libya requires an end to violence and Gadhafi 's departure , '' Hague said . CNN 's Raja Razek , Dan Rivers and Jonathan Wald contributed to this report . "}, {"uid": "138", "dct": "2011-06-08", "dates": [null, null], "text": "By Micah Zenko - Special to CNN In the Washington Post , columnist Anne Applebaum asks - though does not directly answer - the important question , What to do About Libya s Stalemate ? One position that she entertains is the notion that a stalemate is tolerable , and that it might even work . A steady but relentless bombing campaign , generous humanitarian aid and training for the rebels , a bit of patience , and we re done with Gaddafi without too much fuss or boots on the ground . Western -LRB- or certainly Arab League -RRB- political leaders might not discuss Libya often these days , but a stalemated civil war there is seriously problematic for five reasons : First , people are dying and the situation could worsen . Before the civil war erupted , the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court , Luis Moreno-Ocampo , estimated that 500 to 700 persons had been killed in February alone when Libyan security forces had fired live ammunition . Since then , deaths overwhelmingly committed by the regime have escalated though leveled off . A Libyan rebel spokesperson estimated two weeks ago that at least 15,000 people had been killed , but reports of civilian deaths at the hands of regime forces have all but disappeared . Given the motivations for revenge among both sides , however , the lull in violence directed at civilians could be short lived . As the UN s International Commission of Inquiry on Libya concluded in its report last week , The Commission reached the conclusion that crimes against humanity and war crimes have been committed by the Government forces of Libya , and did find some acts which would constitute war crimes by opposition forces . Second , one-sixth of the Libyan population of six million has been displaced . Approximately 920,000 expatriate workers in Libya were forced to return to their home countries , with some 250,000 having since returned . Sub-Saharan African workers have been targeted by rebel forces for arbitrary search and detention , as well as cruel and inhuman mistreatment . As the International Commission of Inquiry report revealed : The most serious attacks on migrant workers appear to have been linked to a suspicion that such persons were mercenaries on the basis of their national origin or skin color . According to UNHCR , at least another 100,000 people are believed to be internally displaced , though few aid agencies have a good picture of the situation in the Nafusa Mountains . Third , humanitarian assistance is needed . Applebaum identifies generous humanitarian aid as one precondition for stalemate giving way to success . However , the international community has not been generous so far . The UN issued its latest appeal for $ 407 million of critically needed humanitarian aid three weeks ago . As of today , all of the UN aid agencies in Libya have received less than half of the required funding in the form of either actual cash or pledges . In much of the eastern part of the country , the aid situation has stabilized and commercial markets are functioning . Nevertheless , as a UNHCR spokesperson stated today : An aid crisis could be looming It is apparent that the combined impact of protracted conflict and sanctions are eroding the government s ability to effectively deliver assistance . Fuel shortages are compounding the worsening humanitarian situation throughout the country . At one gas station in Tripoli , the lines stretched over five miles . Fourth , most children are not attending school . The National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- refuses to reopen schools . Education officials from the NTC have said that schools will only reopen once Gadhafi has fallen , the curriculum is rewritten , and teachers sympathetic to the regime have been purged . In the meantime , the NTC has put children to work cleaning streets , working as traffic cops and dishing up army rations to rebel soldiers , according to Dawn newspaper . Meanwhile , the UN s International Commission of Inquiry reports that both government and opposition forces have used child soldiers in violation of international humanitarian law . Finally , history and vast amounts of academic research demonstrate that the political upheaval caused by sustained civil wars decreases almost all socio-economic indicators , makes the eruption of post-conflict violence -LRB- including genocide and mass atrocities -RRB- much more likely , and often produces violence for export . On the latter point , some officials , such as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , believe that Libya could become a breeding ground for Al Qaeda . As she testified before Congress in early March : Many of the Al Qaeda activists in Afghanistan and later in Iraq came from Libya and came from eastern Libya , which is now the so-called free area of Libya One of our biggest concerns is Libya descending into chaos and becoming a giant Somalia . The possibility of Al Qaeda or its affiliates establishing a foothold in Libya has been overblown . -LRB- One of the NTC s unbelievably one-sided public opinion polls asked Does Al Qaeda play a role in the 17th February Revolution ? Allegedly , 94 percent of respondents said no. -RRB- Nevertheless , as the civil war stalemate persists , more and more young men learn the lethal tactics of warfare , forge ties with other fighters , and perhaps develop ambitions that can only be achieved through terrorism or violent goals beyond liberating Tripoli .

The reasons you listed are just common symptoms of civil war . You could have just said : `` No civil war is tolerable '' . June 8 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | Reply There wo n't be a stalemate . Do n't you see what NATO is doing in Libya ? It 's shelling the country day in and day out ! Jet fighters and drones dash through the sky . Attack helicopters circle over Tripoli like annoying flies . The western forces led by France and Britain want to oust Gaddafi . The UN Resolution 1973 is no licence to kill him , however stubborn he is . All these sorties are a cheap solution to resolve a conflict . They might eventually lead to a military victory , yet spark moral disdain for France and Britain .

June 9 , 2011 at 12:09 pm | Sorry , but I disagree overall . The bottom line , is that the world is better off without Gaddafi around . There is usually a price to pay for a long-term solution . Any civilian casualties are , obviously , tragic . However , I have been to LIbya twice . This is a country that has been run in a mafia-like fashion for 40 + years . A very depressing place . People in that country had no chance at freedom or any real life with `` The Leader '' in power and hoarding the fruits of the country for himself . Everything comes with a price . Many US citizens died in our country 's original push for freedom as well . Why should we not lend our support -LRB- which is minimal at the time -RRB- for these people in their quest ... ? June 9 , 2011 at 1:30 pm | You are so completely wrong , I do n't even know where to begin ! You seem to conveniently leave out the bit where Gaddafi mowing these people down with helicopter gunships while they were still unarmed protesters . We all know who the REAL barbarian -LRB- not to mention sponsor of terrorism -RRB- is ! And where on EARTH did you get the RIDICULOUS idea that there is `` radiation from thier bombs '' ? Do you understand anything about radioactivity ? The only bombs which leave behind radiation are NUKES . If we dropped one of those , this would be all over now . There is no residual radiation from the CONVENTIONAL weapons that are being used in Libya . You are simply spreading ill-informed and ignorant propaganda !

But UN solution can only cause more harm looking into a bigger picture please !!

Remember that Nato is not only destroying govt and military infrastructure but civilian infrastructure , civilian lives , the whole country where it goes and causes millions of refuges trillions of dollars lost and world wide economic collapse so stopping Nato is necessary to saving the world . Lawsuit Nato out of existence . I demand Supreme Court hear all court cases and claims filed before it and do not deny any claims by victims and families of living and deceases . Require that Obama , Rice , Biden , Clinton , all persons named in lawsuits and claims international and us citizens be charged , prosecuted and punished to the maximum extent of the law . Fogh has been charged with war crimes , genocide , illegal war , assassination in Libya of Gaddaffi family and be prosecuted at the Hague and in Libya either jailed and executed by the Hague and also prosecuted by Libya and executed by beheading under shariah law as soon as possible . Also all criminal , federal , intl laws to punish inclduing hosue arrest , freeze of assets , travel ban , firing from job and ban from life time high level war military job .

June 9 , 2011 at 11:32 am | Reply Peole keep complaining that the Nato mission in Libya is unjust and going too far but what people keep forgetting is that this civil war started simply because Moammar Ghadaffi decided to attack and kill peaceful demonstrators who were asking for social changes . Ghadaffi stated from the get go that Al qaeda was invading his country and behind the unrest in Libya but if so , Al Aqeda in Libya sure did n't fire the first shot . No , it was the Libyan military that fired the first shot and it was the Libyan military that started the civil unrest , the exodust and the humanitarian catastrophe and the bloodshed . Recently a Libyan government spokesman argues that the Libyan people are the ones who should be deciding Libya 's future and not Nato . And while I could n't agree with his statement more , I believe that is exactly what the Libyan people were trying to do at the getgo when the Libyan government started to attack and murder them . And while the politicians in Washington continue to criticize this administration 's involvement in Libya , I believe that it must be noted that the Libyan unrest may have been resolved a lvery ong time ago if only the right wing radicals in Washington would allow president Obama to do his job . And unfortunately , because of the widespread and ongoing criticism by the gop over US involvement in this UN mandated mission in Libya , president Obama had to prematurely scaleback our military involvement and give the lead way to Nato . And maybe its the division in Washington that is encouraging Moammar Ghadaffi to try to hold on to power believing at the end , the gop would help him prevail . That is the Party of No , the republican enemy of our state . Just imagine if John Boehner and the hardline radicals in the gop knew about our mission to kill Bin Laden way in advance . Perhaps Bin Laden would still be alive today simply because John Boehner and the gop probably would have tipped he and the Pakistan government off . But at the end , democracy prevailed and America prevailed because president Obama is the most articulate and the most intelligent commander in chief and president America ever had .

Libya : Former Guant namo detainee is training rebels A former detainee at Guant namo Bay has taken a leading role in the military opposition to Col Muammar Gaddafi , it has emerged , alongside at least one other former Afghan Mujahideen fighter . Rebel recruits in the eastern port city of Derna are being trained by Sufyan Bin Qumu , a Libyan who was arrested following the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 , and held at Guant namo for six years . Abdel Hakim al-Hasidi , a senior Libyan rebel commander in Derna , was also held following the invasion of Afghanistan and handed over to Libyan custody two months later . Both men were said to have been released from prison in Libya in 2008 as part of a reconciliation process with Islamists in the country . Mr Qumu , 51 , a Libyan army veteran , was accused by the US government of working as a truck driver for a company owned by Osama bin Laden , and as an accountant for a charity accused of terrorist links . The appearance of Islamists in the country 's revolution , and supportive statements by Islamist groups , has led to fears that Western military action may be playing into the hands of its ideological enemies . Last week Admiral James Stavridis , Nato 's Supreme Allied Commander , Europe , said that , while the Libyan opposition 's leadership appeared to be `` responsible men and women , '' US intelligence had detected `` flickers '' of terrorist activity among rebel groups . The comments were described by British government sources as `` very alarming . '' However , Islamists are said to form only a small minority within the rebel forces , and there is not said to have been any disagreement with the opposition 's political leadership , which says it is secular . Mr Hasidi , who spent several years in a training camp in Afghanistan , told a newspaper he does not support a Taliban-like state and is pursuing an `` inclusive ideology '' . He said : `` Our view is starting to change of the US . If we hated the Americans 100 per cent , today it is less than 50 per cent . They have started to redeem themselves for their past mistakes by helping us to preserve the blood of our children . '' He has also called on foreign governments to supply rebels in Libya with Stinger surface-to-air missiles . Mr Qumu has described the Nato-led bombing in Libya as a `` blessing '' . Diplomatic cables from 2008 obtained by WikiLeaks , and initially revealed by The Daily Telegraph , identified Derna as a breeding ground for fighters for a number of causes , including Afghanistan and Iraq The cables quoted a local businessman saying : `` The unemployed , disfranchised young men of eastern Libya have nothing to lose and are therefore willing to sacrifice themselves for something greater than themselves by engaging in extremism in the name of religion .

June 9 , 2011 at 4:43 pm | Hello J in DC and John Mark who is also probably in DC or northern Virginia . Since I am retired military and a former law enforcement officer I can tell you this conflict and this dictator in Libya is the Libyans business and not America , France or UK . However because of all that oil it is apparent that we made it our business . The reason that Quaddafi has not been taken out yet is because there is not as much support for the rebels as people have been led to believe and we are intentionally giving the so called rebels a chance to establish a pro-western government that is subservient to the U.S and other western countries . The reason they want to legitmize the Traditonal council is so the so-called rebels can then give foreign troops permission to come into the country . We have imported a expat libyan from Fairfax Virginia to lead their arm forces , we have imported a finance minister who has lived in the U.S. in Washington DC since 1974 to manage all those billions of dollars in oil profits . Yet if we are to believe you to individuals this is about saving civilians BS . June 9 , 2011 at 1:56 pm | Reply Being retired military and a former law enforcement officer gives you absolutely ZERO special insight into international politics , and this issue in particular . You might was well say `` as a retired international banker and former dog catcher , I can tell you we have no business being in Libya ! '' And your oil comment is a joke . How much of Libya 's oil does the US import ? About 3 % of their oil exports went to the US at its highest rate . Such a tiny amount to the US as to be nonexistent . And what about Iraq ? We are just rolling in oil profits from the Iraqi war , right ? BA ... you are 100 % correct ! this was a regime change scheme by the nato forces from the git go ! they used any excuse they could find to try to remove gadaffi to steal LYBIA 'S OIL ! they know that the rebels are AL-QAEDA as I have just posted for the world to see ! it was the american DIPLOMAT IN LYBIA who IDENTIFIED these rebels as AL-QAEDA TERRORIST ! barack is KNOWINGLY defending AL-QAEDA to remove gadaffi . then the nato forces are goingt o try to DOUBLE CROSS the al-qaeda rebels -LRB- since we know they are al-qaeda -RRB- and then install a puppet govt in that country to steal the resources of Lybia ! barack should be impeached AND TRIED FOR TREASON for defending these terrorist ! June 9 , 2011 at 2:11 pm | Reply The US does n't need Libya 's paltry amount of oil . Our top three oil sources are Canada , Mexico , and Saudi Arabia . Libya does n't even make the top 20 ! As for Terrorism , look no far than Gaddafi himself . Besides backing Terrorists , and even setting their goals , he also engages in ASSASSINATING his critics worldwide . Amnesty International has listed at least 25 assassinations between 1980 and 1987 for which Gaddafi is responsible . His agents even have attempted to murder people on American soil . In 1980 , a Libyan agent attempted to assassinate dissident Faisal Zagallai , a graduate student at Colorado State University in Fort Collins , Colorado . He survived the attach , but bullets partially blinded him . Obama is an international statesman . Gaddafi is a murdering lunatic . June 9 , 2011 at 3:15 pm | Reply I respect both of your opinons . BA , you make a lot of good points . MAR , your views are in line with other interesting conspiracy theories , but you 're not even close . So what if there are a couple of alleged ex Al Qaeda fighting with the the rebels ? That deos n't mean Al Qaeda is taking over the country . The Gaddafi opposition as a whole , is for real . And , of course , the US would prefer a more western government in Libya . Let 's not forget that the French and British are the ones behind most of the NATO offense at the moment . In any event , I 've been to Libya twice very recently . It 's a depressing place . It 's been run in a mafia-like way for 40 + years . Gaddafi was most certainly butchering his own people indiscriminately , simply because they followed the Egyptians and waged peaceful protests . He would not have stopped there either . He would have gone on a witch hunt and murdered thousands more who he thought might have been connected with the protests . Again , I respect your opinions , but you 're not entirely correct .

June 9 , 2011 at 4:30 pm | Reply I 'm not against the right when I criticize their relentless unjust attacks on the Obama administration for backing a legal UN mandate to protect the people of Libya . I really do n't care if those in charge of America are Republican , Democrat or Independent as long as they are governing for the welfare , well being and progress of America and the American people and our interest abroad . However , since president Obama has taken office the first thing that has happened is that the Tea Party has emerged on the political scene for the first time in almost a hundred years just to question the legitimacy and citizenship of our nation 's first African-American president . Then there 's the GOP who questions and opposed everything that the Obama administration tried to do to stabilize the economic crisis and move the country forward . When the president introduced the economic stimulus package to stabilize the fragile American economy and prevent it from slipping into a catastrophic depression , the GOP stressed fiscal responsibility and accused the president of inflating the national deficit . When the president asked for a jobs bill and extension of unemployment benefits for unemployed and struggling Americans , John Cornyn and Mitch MsConnel went on CNN a year ago and sarcastically told Wolf Blitzer that the GOP can not support a jobs bill because if it were to create jobs , it would be a win for democrats . Then they both chuckled . But I was pleased when Wolf Blitzer replied , `` a win for Democrats or a win for the American people ? '' Then during the same period a year ago , who can forget Jim Bunning of Kentucky , blocking a jobs bill that brought a very important highway construction project in Washington DC and surrounding arears to an abrut halt as workers were told to pack up and go home . And this defiant and selfish stance by Jim Bunning also put a hault to a very important unemployment and health insurance coverage for hundreds of thousands of unemployed and struggling Americans affected by this recession the GOP caused with their failed and misguided economic policies . And Mr. Bunning argument for his stance was because he felt that the president was inflating the national deficit while he and his party sarcastically stressed `` fiscal responsibility '' once more . Then when the president introduced the rail project slated for Florida , Florida 's governor turned down this project , arguing that he was concerned that federal funding may have exceeded the cost of the project . And in the process of rejecting this project , thousands of prospective American jobs got automatically canceled . Yet , the GOP still keep asking sarcastically `` where are the jobs . '' Then remember the oil spill desaster ? Well , when president Obama took office and appropriated federal funds to aid American states afflicted by the recession , Louisiana governor Bobby Jindel said his state did n't need any aid . But when small businesses were affected by the oil spill desaster desaster , Governor Jindel was the first to argue that federal aid was not forth coming and he and the GOP sternly criticized the president and accused the president of not holding BP responsible for compensation the victims in the gulf . But when the president got BP to set up a 20 billion dollar fund to compensate the victims , Rep Joe Barton of Texas accused the president of `` a shake down '' of BP . As they say , damn if you do , damn if you do n't . And when it comes to foreign affairs , the GOP has been against America too . For example , when the president set a deadline in 2009 to bring our troops home from Iraq , the GOP argued that the president was sending the wrong message to the enemy , although the enemy is question never existed before our illegitimate invasion and destabilizing of Iraq . The same is to be said of Afghanistan and today we are still suffering casualties in Afghanistan because that war was prolonged to begin the Iraqi war . And since the Libyan mission , many in congress have asked what is the mission in Libya and what is the end game in Libya ? However , my question to the critics is when is the end game in Iraq and Afghanistan and what is the mission there ? And where are the WMD 's ? Furthermore , let me add that while many in congress criticize the Obama administration for our involvement in Libya by asking what is the end game there , it was president Obama who had to decide the end game for both the Iraq and Afghan wars a decade later when he set a deadline to begin troop withdrawal and the president has kept to his promise as troop withdrawal from Iraq began a few months ago . Remember the crisis in Egypt ? Yea , the GOP and the mainstream media argued that president Obama was n't doing enough to defuse that crisis although the president had publicly called on Hosni Mubarak repeatedly to work towards a speedy transion and democratic changes . And at the end of the day , while some in the GOP and mainstream media argued that president Obama was not doing enough to help thye people of Egypt , others like Newt Gingrich argued that president Obama was betraying a friend in Hosni Mubarak and supporting a terrorist group , the Muslim Brotherhood by calling on Hosni Mubarak to cater to the demonstrators ' demands . And at the onset of the Libyan crisis , the GOP and the mainstream media accused the president of dragging his feet and not coming to the aid of the Libyan people who they said were being slaughtered by Ghadaffi . But when the president intervened with military intervention via a legal unilateral UN mandate , the same GOP and the mainstream media without a sense of moral integrity and common decency , deliberately flipped flopped on the issue and accused the president of rushing to war in Libya . Now they say that president Obama is not doing enough to defuse the crises in Yemen and Seria . You 've got to be kidding right ? No , I do n't deslike the Republicans in America but I deslike the fact that they are anti-America and their only wish seems to be wanting to see the president of the United States and the country fail because they have a problem with the color of the president 's skin . I 'm not for or against any political party in Washington , I 'm just for America . Its that plain and simple . It 's either you 're for America or against America and so far , the GOP and the mainstream republican owned and operated media and press seem to be enemies of the state .

Cheney started with Afghanistan and Iraq , and Obama added Pakistan , Libya , Egypt , Tunisia , and a half dozen other countries like Yemen and Syria .

I will remember the TV news videos of those Libyan `` civilians '' riding around in white pickup trucks with giant machine guns mounted in the back . I remember seeing the `` civilians '' brandishing AK-47s and RPGs . I heard early reports that those civilians had advanced on the opposition and had taken territory in some locations . These are not things that civilians do , they are things that paid militias and mercenaries do . It 's all just badly exposed work of the CIA . All of the above listed `` civilian '' activities made people in Gaza legitimate targets when Israel invaded . I assume this is why the Goldstone report on Israel 's invasion of Gaza was `` recinded '' in an op-ed just prior to the events in Libya .

Thousands of government troops attacked around 6 a.m. -LRB- 11 p.m. Tuesday ET -RRB- , with 13 rebels reported dead by evening . Mohamed Mokhtar , a rebel fighter wounded in Wednesday 's fighting , accused government troops of infiltrating rebel lines in cars bearing rebel flags . Dr. Khaled Abu Falgha , a spokesman for Misrata 's Hekma hospital , said it was the bloodiest day in a week in the besieged city . More than 1,000 people are believed to have been killed since the fighting began there in February , including 686 registered residents of the city , he said . Rebel fighters returning from the front lines reported that their defenses were holding up under the onslaught , however . Gadhafi : ` We will not give up ' NATO making progress in Libya ? The assault followed a day of intense bombardment of Libya 's capital by the NATO alliance , which intervened in the conflict in March under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians as Gadhafi tried to crush the revolt against him . Libya 's government said 60 missiles struck the capital city , killing at least 31 people , including a number of civilians , and wounding dozens more . NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen reiterated Wednesday that the alliance is doing all it can to avoid civilian casualties . But he told reporters from allied headquarters in Brussels , Belgium , that NATO could continue the airstrikes `` for as long as it takes to bring this crisis to an early conclusion . '' Rasmussen said NATO bombing has saved lives in Libya , and that the alliance has the resources to extend its military mission for another 90 days past the end of June . It is time to start planning for what to do after Gadhafi 's departure `` because Gadhafi 's reign of terror is coming to an end , '' he said . Pressed by reporters on why airstrikes would be able to dislodge Gadhafi when `` the history of the last 30 years '' shows that air attacks alone do not win wars , Rasmussen offered no clear answer , saying only , `` We have no intentions to put troops on the ground . '' For his part , even as NATO airstrikes bombarded his Tripoli compound , Gadhafi vowed Tuesday that `` we will not surrender . '' `` I am now speaking as planes and bombs fall around me , '' Gadhafi said in a live audio broadcast on state television . `` But my soul is in God 's hand . We will not think about death or life . We will think about the call of duty . '' The Gadhafi compound was under `` intensive continuous bombardment , '' according to state TV , which reported buildings and infrastructure were destroyed . But government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said the allied campaign `` is failing miserably . '' `` No one has the right to shape Libya 's future except for Libyans , '' he said . Ibrahim said Tuesday 's morning blasts hit the popular guard compound and the revolution compound , which are military barracks near Gadhafi 's Bab al-Aziziya compound . The spokesman said attacks Tuesday and Wednesday hit state television buildings , killing two people and wounding 16 . `` We did not target or hit the Libyan broadcast facilities . What we did target was the military intelligence headquarters in downtown Tripoli , '' the alliance said . `` The story coming from Libyan officials that we targeted and hit the state broadcaster 's building is bogus .

Tesoro , a U.S. oil refiner , entered into a deal May 25 with the Transitional National Council based in Benghazi , Libya for 1.2 million barrels of Libyan crude oil , the State Department said in a written statement . The shipment was scheduled to arrive aboard the MT Equator , a Liberian-flagged tanker , at the Single Point Mooring in Hawaii on Wednesday . The dollar value of the deal is not known . U.S. support for additional oil sales with the TNC will continue as a means to support additional revenue streams for the Libyan people , the statement said . The sale was made possible following an April announcement by the Office of Foreign Assets Control at the Treasury Department that established a new licensing policy with Libya . That action was taken to ease barriers to certain oil related transactions with the TNC , in place because of wider U.S. sanctions on Libya . The announcement came the same day Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in the United Arab Emirates for a meeting with the Libya Contact Group , a coalition of various countries and international organizations that seek to build support for the TNC while preparing for Libya 's future after the presumed end of Moammar Gadhafi 's regime . This is the third meeting of the group . France , Italy and Qatar are among the small number of countries who have officially recognized the TNC as the legitimate government of Libya .

Talk at the meeting in the United Arab Emirates focused on sustaining pressure on the embattled Libyan leader . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said `` numerous and continuous discussions '' on a transition of power were taking place among people close to Gadhafi . A spokesman for a Libyan opposition group told CNN that Gadhafi 's son , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , was the primary negotiator for an exit plan for his father , but suggested the timing of the talks might not be good . `` I 'm not sure there 's a lot of people willing to listen right now , '' said Mohammed Ali Abdallah of the National Front for the Salvation of Libya . Abdallah said a southern front had opened up in the fighting and that Gadhafi 's days were numbered . `` We are in the final phases , '' Abdallah said . `` Gadhafi 's military power has significantly been reduced . He is basically rattled . '' Clinton announced an additional $ 26 million in U.S. aid for the victims of Libya 's ongoing war and said time was on the international coalition 's side so long as Gadhafi faced sustained pressure . `` The violence must stop , '' she said . `` Gadhafi must go . '' Financial assistance flowed at the meeting , the third the international Libya group has held since war erupted . Italy pledged up to $ 580 million to the Libyan opposition 's Transitional National Council - which is facing a budget shortfall - to cover its expenses , but not weapons , Foreign Ministry Spokesman Maurizio Massari said .

Abu Dhabi -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Night after night , day after day , NATO aircraft have hammered presidential compounds in Tripoli , Libya . I have walked over the piles of rubble . What I and my CNN colleagues have seen , particularly in recent days , gives additional credence to reporting by CNN 's counter terrorism analyst Fran Townsend that NATO 's leadership believes the U.N. resolution on Libya justifies killing the country 's leader Moammar Gadhafi . Townsend 's source , a senior NATO military official with knowledge of NATO 's Libyan operations , also implied more could be done to target Gadhafi . The comments drew a rapid response from a NATO spokeswoman , hinting at an internal rift within the organization over tactics . Libyan girl loses leg in rocket blast Timeline : NATO ramps up pressure on Libya `` We are targeting critical military capabilities that could be used to attack civilians , including command and control centers that could be used to plan and organize such attacks , '' spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said . `` We are simply not targeting individuals . '' Townsend 's source points out that Gadhafi commands Libya 's military and is at the center of its command and control . Gadhafi , as several diplomats noted at a Libya contact group meeting in Abu Dhabi on Thursday , is willing to watch his army get bombed into the dirt rather than quit . Indeed , just this week Gadhafi said in a radio address he would die rather than step down . What seems to up for debate at NATO is , with limited resources , what should it bomb first ? Should NATO go after Gadhafi 's army around rebel strongholds like Misrata , which wo n't do anything to remove the dictator ? Or should NATO relentlessly pursue the man himself , because the longer he is around the longer the war drags out and the bigger the final cost of picking up the pieces ? He warned NATO chiefs the alliance 's European partners are relying too heavily on the United States . `` The mightiest military alliance in history is only 11 weeks into an operation against a poorly armed regime in a sparsely populated country -- yet many allies are beginning to run short of munitions , requiring the U.S. , once more , to make up the difference , '' he said . The pointed language highlights the urgency of pursuing an end game -- getting Gadhafi and not his troops .

It did not used to be that way , '' she said in a tone of voice laced with contempt . `` I used to be able to play and run around . Now these people disturb me . '' Malaak has every reason to be frustrated . For nearly a month she has been living , sleeping and eating in a hospital bed . `` What do you want ? '' her father asked , trying to soothe her . `` Dad , do not make me cry , '' she responded . `` I do not want to see anyone . I want to go home .

On May 13 the three siblings had just lay down for an afternoon nap in their mother 's room . Suddenly their neighborhood -- controlled by rebels opposing Libya 's government -- came under attack by forces loyal to Moammar Gadhafi . `` They all were lying in bed and I was next to them on the same bed but I left to clean up the house , '' the children 's mother , Saffiya Abdullah , explained . `` Less than a minute after that I heard the first Grad rocket falling and it seemed very close to our house so I ran back to hug them , pick them up and take them to safety , '' she added . Instead more missiles rained down and before she got to her room there was a deafening blast . The door to the room came crashing down on her as she struggled to find her children . A Grad rocket , which looks like an over-grown bullet about nine-feet long and 15 inches around , had slammed into her bedroom wall and exploded . It left a hole wide enough for two adults to push through at the same time . `` My clothes were burnt . A big part of the house was damaged and even my uncle 's house next door was damaged , '' Malaak said , without mentioning the worst of it . Malaak 's right leg was nearly torn off . Her left leg was broken , as was her arm . Her mother stood there in shock . Her younger son and daughter were n't breathing . `` I lifted them up one after the other , '' she said . `` I kept praying ; God make me patient . God make me patient . And I found Malaak alive but Mohamed and Rodayna looked dead . The two youngest children were dead . I want to travel to America and get a new leg then get right back here . `` A mother would want to die rather than see her babies die . '' Malaak was rushed to the hospital . Doctors said there was no question about what had to be done . `` It was gross . It was nearly totally amputated . It was just the skin and some muscles keeping the limb attached to the body , '' Dr. Ahmad Radwan said . Radwan , an Egyptian national who came to Libya as a volunteer with the Arab League , made the call . Malaak 's leg had to be amputated . He knew what it would mean to someone who had so much more life to live to wake up and find her leg gone . He also knew there were no prosthesis that would fit a child and she would be confined to a wheelchair . It was too much for him to bear . `` I could n't do it . I did it for young guys and for rebels at the frontlines but I could n't do it to Malaak , '' he said . He asked other doctors to take over . But Radwan has n't stopped fighting for her since the day he saw her being carried into the hospital . He called his fianc who knew someone at the nonprofit group Global Medical Relief Fund . The group 's mission is to aid children who are missing or have lost the use of limbs or eyes . In Malaak 's case that will likely mean she needs to travel to the United States to find help : a new leg to give her a better life . We visited Malaak in the hospital a second time . It was Tuesday afternoon and she was in a great mood , smiling , laughing and offering everyone chocolates . She is celebrating with her family , nurses and doctors . She has been told she must visit the hospital for more treatment but for the first time she can sleep at home . It is a relief , a wish come true . When her father asked what she wanted now , she replied : `` I want to travel to America and get a new leg then get right back here . That 's it .

Neither has Zuma 's African National Congress party nor the African Union , which he was representing and which Gadhafi once led . The AU also has criticized the NATO airstrikes . In April , Zuma led an AU delegation to Tripoli , Libya 's capital , where hopes were raised briefly when it was announced that Gadhafi had agreed , in principle , to the AU 's `` road map '' proposal for peace .

White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said the report will address a whole host of issues about our ongoing efforts in Libya , including those raised in the House resolution as well as our legal analysis with regard to the War Powers Resolution .

It breaks my heart to see Americans volunteer to act like lawless marauders under the guise of `` saving the world and the USA . '' But in the end , it 's not the military men and women who committed the crimes , it 's the so-called leadership that will do anything to avoid personal responsibility . The Vietnam-era vets have every right to storm and take out our central government for the crimes they 've committed against Americans . June 15 , 2011 at 3:51 pm | @ lauradet -- It could also be said that President Bush had to send the troops into Afghanistan and Iraq because it was President Clinton who failed to take out Osama bin Ladin back in the 1990s after the original World Trade Center bombing and the bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania . June 15 , 2011 at 4:10 pm | Your logic is flawed . Because even if Clinton did fail to get Osama Bin Laden , Bush as President and Commander-in-Chief had a choice about how to respond to 9-11 . He CHOSE to declare war and sent troops into Afghanistan . He had other choices , like do nothing , a more limited response , use covert\\/special ops and air power only , etc. . As for IRAQ , that had absolutely nothing to do with 9-11 and took much needed resources AWAY from Afghanistan . Iraq could have totally been avoided . Both of those wars were already in play when Pres. Obama took office . June 15 , 2011 at 5:17 pm | That 's right he is cleaning up George Bush 's mess by adding up one more mess to heritage ! June 15 , 2011 at 7:09 pm | And your logic is flawed there xwing ... the president ca n't declare war ... only congress can ... and they at least voted to support the action initially ... as for the teleprompter ... who knows ... I would like to think that he can speak with out some one else writting his words ...

You 'll sit and argue to protect a side , either one will win the election , and you 'll sit back and squable over name calling as they rob you blind . wake up June 16 , 2011 at 12:00 pm | President Obama is Commander and Cheif . He can do exactly as he did for the people of Libya . -LRB- Someone had to . -RRB- . In the world he has done more for this country , overnight in 2008 when he was elected President . A lot of other Countries cheered , maybe because he 's part black . I do n't know . HE WAS THE BEST HUMAN BEING FOR THE JOB . He was elected not because of his race , but because he was the brightess and just plain best man for the job . . Because he will WIN again ... The power of the computer was his best bet .

Now if you are talking about the economy ... Obama surely made a bad situation worse with his ideas of getting it back on track . . but I am not going to blame him for something that he did not do . . even if I am a Republican and not liking him very much at this time .

The Republican Party of empty suits would do better to take a lesson from a President who is strong on national security , protects US interests , and earns the respect of the world at the same time . Right now , not a single member of the GOP is worthy of polishing President Obama 's shoes . June 15 , 2011 at 12:11 pm | Reply So Bush is reposnsible for 9\\/11 8 momnths into his Presidency , but Obama is not responsible for the economy in about twice the amount of time ? Face facts , we are worse off now than we were when Obama took office . You can blame Bush all you want , but there is only one President and he needs to own up to the fact that his policies are hurting America . Are n't you sick of him feigning no knowledge or influence on things like this NLRB\\/Boeing travesty or the brillianceof sending weapons to Mexican drug cartels to track them . losing track of them and getting an American killed in the process ? June 15 , 2011 at 12:39 pm | Your ability to draw an analogy is severely lacking . 9\\/11 is a concrete , single event whereas the economy is a chronic trend . Any constituent with a basic degree of insight knows that economic trends lag by several years beyond legislative intervention -LRB- that is assuming there are no significant filibusters inhibiting said intervention -RRB- . June 15 , 2011 at 12:48 pm | Gosh , have you lost all sense of fairness ! Do you want to support him just becos some people are vehemently opposed to him on everything . everyone understands obama inherited a big problem , thats why he was elected -- he made big promises that he will solve these issues . & he has not done that !! . Many neutral experts have confirmed that he has made the situation worse specially on the economy ! June 15 , 2011 at 1:28 pm | I am sick of your ignorance . Why ca n't you just live in the real world ? Seriously , where are you from ? It must be a small town where religion rules all ... June 15 , 2011 at 1:35 pm | Umm ... the Dem party would be the primary party whose negligence allowed 9\\/11 to happen . All of those involved were in the U.S. 2 years before it happened with visas that were expired for at least 11\\/2 years of that . When their visas expired , the Clinton administration failed to deport them , just like Democrats have stood in the way of deporting the other ~ 10 million people who are in this country illegally . June 15 , 2011 at 4:20 pm | Now ADOC a direct question ... How did the Republicans in congress and the presidency on 9\\/11\\/2001 after having 8 months in office result in the culmination of a plot that started dduring the reign of W. J. Clinton ? He was the guy that blew up the asprin factory and turned down the offer to be handed OBL on a platter . June 15 , 2011 at 9:47 pm | Bush 's response to 9\\/11 was his problem . He did n't plan 9\\/11 but his response leaves much to be desired . Instead of going for OBL where he was known to be and sticking to it , he diverted his attention to Iraq because he knew Afghanistan was going to be one long hard haul . He did n't care about catching OBL just whipping someone 's fanny and saying `` Mission Accomplished '' . From a salesman 's point of view it is called bait and switch . As we all know Iraq did n't turn out as easy as he thought it would either . It is one thing to destroy a country 's infrastructure , but not a easy to rebuild a nation with a working government .

You do n't think like I do so STFU ... right ? June 15 , 2011 at 9:53 pm | Bill in STL ... our founding fathers were socialist . I am proudly one too . The government is authorized by the constitution to levy taxes to pay for programs the government sees as benefiting the citizens welfare and provide for their security . These programs do not benefit just certain members of society , but the majority of citizens . Our tax system was set up to be a socialist system that what we contribute is for the benefit of all citizens . The founding fathers designed programs such as public roads , bridges , libraries , postal system , and fire stations these were designed by the founding fathers to benefit all citizens . Taxes were collected to make these public works the property of all our citizens ... therefore yes we are both a socialist and capitalistic society . Furthermore , there is nothing in the constitution that would stop future presidents or congress from expanding and creating new socialist or capitalist programs that would benefit the welfare of our citizens .

We have lost more troops under Barry 's command 1451 in only 2.5 years , compare that to 1049 in President Bush 's 7 years . Barry is the warmonger .

Panetta , Cates , Clinton and Petraues went over his head and ordered the strike . Obama went ballistic over it but was nothing he could do because the Democrats have too much graft on him . They will ot release any of it because they accepted two billion dollars from George Soros to have Obama elected . June 15 , 2011 at 7:24 pm | Reply In his campaign speech on October 7 , 2008 : `` What I have said is were going to encourage democracy in Pakistan , expand our non-military aid to Pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us , but insisting that they go after these militants . And if we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out , then I think we have to act , and we will take them out . We will kill bin Laden . We will crush al-Qaida . That has to be our biggest national security priority .

After 2 years , he found OBL which the previous President did not do in 71\\/2 years . There is your waste . As for your incorrect figures , President Obama has sent approximately 30,000 of the 100,000 + American and foreign troops in Afghanistan , the remainder were sent by President Bush , and other countries .

Lawmakers cant seem to make up their mind . First they are angry because we are not taking the lead and not involved enough .

June 15 , 2011 at 11:50 am | Reply Jean , there were about 32,000 troops in Afghanistan when President Bush left office . Liberals can try and spin in all you want but the truth is there . Barry is responsible for the two surges and additional NATO forces . More of our solders have died under Barry 's leadership , more kids have been killed , nothing gained . In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech , he said that Afghanistan was a ` just war . ' Well , history is proving him wrong . Maybe its time to melt down the gold . He will need it to live of off when he is out of office . BTW , President Bush did not look for OBL in Iraq , just another Liberal lie , not willing to face the facts . June 15 , 2011 at 11:57 am | Reply You 're right . George W Bush stopped looking for OBL altogether .

But you need to remember Bush did n't look for OBL AT ALL ! As I recall , W said he was n't worried about him , and did n't believe he was relevant . I still do n't understand why the person at the head of the organization that attacked us on 9\\/11 was n't worth worring about . Bush 's zeal to go after Saddam and his sad lack of knowledge of how that would go is what got us into the problem Obama now has to deal with . Bush did n't go into Afghanistan like he should have to find OBL , he split our forces to go into Iraq when they had nothing to do with 9\\/11 -LRB- and no , there were no WMD either -RRB- and has put us into a decade of war that has helped to wreck many lives but also our economy . Obama is doing a much better job than W could have hoped to in his wildest dreams . It refreshing to have a president that thinks before he acts . June 15 , 2011 at 4:30 pm | The Taliban of Afghanistan were providing cover for Osama who knocked down the World Trade Centers .

The countries that can need to stand up for themselves . June 15 , 2011 at 4:46 pm | Let 's not forget that OBL was found based on intelligience acquired from Guantonamo while Bush was in office .

'' That means the president has authority to decide exactly how we fight after Congress decides who and when . Madison , Hamilton and Jay in the Federalist Papers explained that this division of power is one of the main things distinguishing our president from a king . Even Senator Obama , just a few years ago , said he agreed that the president may not legally get us into war without Congress . The current president , unlike even Bush , is claiming that he does n't need Congress ' permission to send US troops into danger . If we tolerate that stance , we 've destroyed another part of the Constitution in direct defiance of something our Founders specifically warned us not to do . So , if the president refuses to withdraw our troops and does n't get authorization , we need to either immediately force withdrawal or begin impeachment . Do n't accept any explanation about how this is n't a `` real '' war , if it includes US troops risking their lives and shooting at people . The Constitution offers no such excuse .

This is diifficult to explain since the only purpose of NATO is to defend NATO members if they are attacked by a non-NATO country . Libya is not a member of NATO and did not attack a NATO country -LRB- it was a civil war -RRB- . There is no way to justify NATO doing anything against Libya . Just because the U.N. gave the O.K. to NATO does not justify NATO going against its charter and getting involved in Libya . It is even worse when Congress did not give the O.K. because this is not a justifiable NATO action .

When the Libyan conflict began many politicians , mostly Republicans , called President Obama out for not being fast enough and not jumping right in unilaterally and bombing Libya . McCain and many others were on the air calling for the US to create the no-fly space on its own . All of this would have been very expensive but more important it would have put the US in another war like Afghanistan and Iraq . So , the President uses good judgement and goes into this conflict sharing the responsibility with NATO . Now the congress is complaining again and trying to put a political spin on it . Making points with national security is pretty low . Do they want the US to withdraw their support from NATO in Libya ? That would make America look weak , like flip-floppers and lose a lot of respect around the world . . What do these congressmen really hope to gain from this embarassing law suit ? .

June 15 , 2011 at 12:30 pm | Reply First of all , president Obama sent 50,000 US troops to Afghanistan to complete the Afghan war that the GOP abandoned to start their illegitimate Iraqi war . Secondly , president Obama completed what we supposedly went into Afghanistan to do 10 years ago and that was to kill OBL . And I may add that this delicate mission was completed successfully without the lost of lives amongst US troops and Pakistan civilians . Secondly , president Obama set a deadline to start the withdrawal of our troops from the GOP 's illegitimate Iraqi war and he has followed through on his pledged promise as US troop withdrawal from Iraq began several months ago . When congress voted for the war powers act in 2003 , it did so in accordance with United Nations mandate for Iraq to disarm and give up its war arsenal . However what that war powers act did not authorize was for George W. Bush , John Boehner and the Republican Party to create a scheme and lie and mislead the American people , the UN and the world community about bogus and non existent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , dragging us into a bloody and senseless war that may last for decades to come . And what the 2003 war powers act did not authorize was for George W. Bush and the Republican Party to prematurely withdraw UN inspectors from Iraq by force to start their illegitimate Iraqi war . During this UN mission , both long and short range Iraqi missiles were being destroyed before the world eyes each and every day by UN inspectors and the Iraqi war arsenal was being made inefficient and obselete without bloodshed and lost of life . Subsequently , Iraq was no longer a threat to its neighbors and neither was it an immenent threat to the United States . However , the dictator and war criminal George W. Bush , John Boehner and his Republican Party violated American and international law by prematurely removing UN inspectors from Iraq by force to start their illegitimate Iraqi war . The result is 4,000 plus dead US troops and half a million Iraqi civilians dead to date . But ten years later , no one is yet to call for the impeachment and imprisonment of George W. Bush , John Boehner and the Republican party . And what has president Obama done wrong in his handling of the Libyan crisis ? Has any American lives been lost in the Libyan conflict ? Have we committed ground troops to the Libyan conflict ? Are we actually involved in the conflict at this moment or just proving logistic support to NATO ? and is president Obama hurting our economy by supporting the UN mandated Libyan Mission ? I may add that today we are spending 11 billion US dollars a month in the Afghan war the GOP abandoned to start their illegitimate Iraqi war and so far we have spent 1 trillion US dollars in Iraq . So who is really to be blamed here ? And today we are still suffering casualties in Afghanistan because George W. Bush , John Boehner and the GOP abandoned and prolonged the Afghan war to wage their senseless and illegitimate Iraqi war . So far Mladic has been arrested and taken to the ICC in the Hague for war crimes against humanity but ten years later , George W. Bush is showing up at NBA finals and Superbowls , living it up while American sons and daughters are dead as a result of his insidious war atrocities and he is yet to be tried for war crimes . So why the double standard ? And is there preferencial treatment when the war criminal in question is white and American ? At the onset of the Libyan crisis , John McCain , John Boehner and the Republican Party rediculied president Obama and accused him of dragging his feet and not rushing to intervene militarily in Libya because in their words , Libyan civilians were being slaughtered by the Libyan government . But as soon as president Obama with support of the world community followed through on a UN mandated mission to protect the Libyan people , the GOP decided to flip flopped on the issue , making a 360 and accusing the president of rushing to war . My message to the GOP is you 've got to be kidding right ? But perhaps the reason why the GOP is upping its stance and criticism on the president for our involvement in Libya is probably because they sense that the Libyan government is about to collapse any day now and they just want to score political points by trying to prevent president Obama from getting credit should Moammar Ghadaffi fall . But what is amasing is that everytime the GOP tries to set up roadblocks for the Obama administration , at the end of the day this administration prevails and so do the American people . Remember Obama got Osama ? Yea , and it sure was nice to see Americas celebrate all across the country , waving the American flag once more on that faithful night and remembering what it is like to feel patriotic and be American once again . And yes , we will wave ole glory once aagain in 2012 for OBAMA\\/BIDEN . June 15 , 2011 at 12:34 pm | Reply I am lost .

If I recall the republicans were complaining because he did n't act fast enough so he is damned by these people no matter what .

June 15 , 2011 at 1:38 pm | Reply First , I would like to say that criticizing the current President does not mean a person is racist . I believe it is extremely important to look at the facts and argue based on those -- not just feelings or arguments that `` hit below the belt '' in order to try to discredit another 's point of view . It is a good sign that Congress is ensuring President Obama does not abuse his War Powers . This is a good demonstration of the balance of powers , which makes our country great . If Congress recognizes -- and they do -- that President Obama has not properly requested authorization to continue U.S. troop involvement in Libya than President Obama should be wise enough to ensure that Congress has sufficient evidence . Instead by combating the War Powers Resolution he is challenging Congress ' power to `` Declare war , raise and support the armies '' of the Constitution - Article I , Section 8 . I heard an argument here stating that former President W. Bush did not receive congressional authorization to enter Iraq . October 11 , 2002 Congress -LRB- both House , 296 to 133 , and the Senate , 77 to 33 -RRB- passed H.J. Res 114 `` Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 . With congressional authorization , President W. Bush approved an air strike on March 19 , 2003 , with an invasion on March 20 , 2003 . On the same token , President Obama needs to adhere to the Constitution by supporting an action to have Congress vote on allowing the U.S. troops to remain in Libya . This article is correct -- the War Powers Resolution does allow the President as Commander in Chief -LRB- Constitution , Article II , Sec 2 -RRB- to deploy troops for 60 days without approval from Congress , but must receive approval after that time . This argument may appear to be critical of President Obama , but really it is just a case of looking at the facts . I believe in the past , the Congress has not utilized the Constitution as they should -- this is a good step in the write direction .

I believe it is extremely important to look at the facts and argue based on those not just feelings or arguments that `` hit below the belt '' in order to try to discredit another 's point of view . It is a good sign that Congress is ensuring President Obama does not abuse his War Powers . This is not a cause of Republican vs Democrat -- both sides are displeased with the lack of authorization . In order to continue U.S. troop involvement in Libya , President Obama should support Congress in authorization . Former President W. Bush did receive congressional authorization to enter Iraq . October 11 , 2002 Congress -LRB- House voted 296 to 133 , and Senate voted 77 to 33 -RRB- passed H.J. Res 114 `` Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 . With congressional authorization , President W. Bush approved an air strike on March 19 , 2003 , with an invasion on March 20 , 2003 . On the same token , President Obama needs to adhere to the Constitution by supporting an action to have Congress vote on allowing the U.S. troops to remain in Libya . This article is correct the War Powers Resolution does allow the President as Commander in Chief -LRB- Constitution , Article II , Sec 2 -RRB- to deploy troops for 60 days without approval from Congress , but Congress has the power under the Constitution - Article I , Section 8 to approve the action after 60 days . I believe in the past , the Congress has not utilized the Constitution as they should this is a good step in the right direction .

June 15 , 2011 at 2:50 pm | Reply For you right wing aholes who say that the economy is worse off than it was when president Obama took office , let me make it clear that first of all , president Obama inherited the worst economic crisis in America since the Great Depression from the GOP . Furthermore , when president obama took office and implemented the Economic Stimulus package , the goal of this was to prevent the American economy from slipping into a catastrophic depression . But the GOP said , no that is wasteful spending and they urged to let the economy slip into a depression and then the GOP said some ten years down the road , the American economy will bounce back on its own . Yet they kept asking where are the jobs ? And how do you create the basis for American jobs if you do n't first of all , stabilize the broken American economy ? However , from day one the Federal Reserve which has no party affiliation , said that job growth will be gradual and will fluctuate from time to time because some manufactures would be slow in hiring because of uncertainty over the job market . When president Obama took office in 2008 , 23 million Americans had already lost their jobs to the recession caused by the failed and misguided economic policies of the Republican Party . Let 's face it , in the history of America even during good times , 5 million jobs were never created in two years , let alone 23 million jobs , especially with the deliberate policy delaying tactics and roadblocks by the GOP . That brings me to my next point . When president Obama took office , the GOP said let the BIG THREE , Ford , GM and Chrysler crumble to the ground . But waht is aamazing about the GOP is how they lack a sense of American history because during World War II , it was the Big Three that was responsible for mobilizing our military and helping America to defeat Fascism in Europe and Imperialism in the Pacific . And while for two years the GOP has been sarcastically asking where are the jobs , a few months ago Florida Republican Governor purposely turned down a multibillion dollar rail project funded by the government , arguing that he was concerned that the project may have exceeded the available funding . Here 's a governor who declined the opportunity to improve his state 's infastructure and America 's infastructure and the opportunity to create thousands of American jobs . Then a year ago , Kentucky senator Jim Bunning blocked a very important highway construction project for the south eastern corridor , arguing that the funding was inflating the national deficit and he and his Republican Party called president Obama fiscally irresponsible . But when Jim Bunning voted against this bill , his vote alone haulted this project as many workers were told to back their bags and go home . Wanna know where the jobs are ? The Party of No. . They 're JUST a bunch of aholes .

It denies the accusation by some members of Congress that Obama has violated the War Powers Resolution by intervening militarily for more than 60 days without seeking approval from Congress . `` Given the important U.S. interests served by U.S. military operations in Libya and the limited nature , scope and duration of the anticipated actions , the president had constitutional authority , as commander-in-chief and chief executive and pursuant to his foreign affairs powers , to address such limited military operations abroad , '' it says . `` The president is of the view that the current U.S. military operations in Libya are consistent with the War Powers Resolution and do not under that law require further congressional authorization , because U.S. military operations are distinct from the kind of ` hostilities ' contemplated by the resolution 's 60-day termination provision . '' The report was accompanied by a two-page letter jointly signed by legislative affairs officials with the departments of Defense and State and directed to House Speaker John Boehner . Rep. Frank ` disappointed ' in Obama Kucinich : If it looks like war , it 's war `` Taken in response to direct appeals from the Libyan people , and acting with a mandate from the United Nations , the United States mobilized a broad coalition , stopped an advancing army , prevented a massacre , established a no-fly zone , and limited the spread of violence and instability in a region pivotal to U.S. security interests , '' it says . In response , Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said , `` The creative arguments made by the White House raise a number of questions that must be further explored . Regardless , the commander-in-chief has a responsibility to articulate how U.S. military action is vital to our national security and consistent with American policy goals . With Libya , the president has fallen short on this obligation . We will review the information that was provided today but hope and expect that this will serve as the beginning , not the end , of the president 's explanation for continued American operations in Libya . '' The exchange of documents came after a bipartisan group of House members filed a lawsuit Wednesday that challenges U.S. participation in the Libya military mission . Boehner , R-Ohio , said in a letter to Obama on Tuesday that the administration could be in violation of the War Powers Resolution , if it fails to get congressional authorization by Sunday , the 90th day since the mission began and a deadline that some legal experts cite as the deadline set by the resolution . The lawsuit addresses a long-standing dispute between the executive and legislative branches -- meaning the White House and Congress -- over the powers of the president to send forces to war . `` We are intending through our presence and through this lawsuit to correct an imbalance which exists today , to correct a deficiency in the separation of powers , to correct ... and to firmly establish that Congress is a co-equal branch of government and that the founders made it unmistakably clear they did not intend for the war power to be placed in the hands of an executive , '' said Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D-Ohio , an anti-war liberal and one of the 10 legislators filing the lawsuit . Rep. Tim Johnson , R-Illinois , said the legal issue was whether Obama exceeded his authority in committing U.S. forces to the Libya mission . `` Did he act illegally ? The answer is yes , '' Johnson said . But Wednesday 's report from the White House say that U.S. operations are limited to a supporting role in a coalition whose operations are authorized by the U.N. Security Council resolution . They `` do not involve sustained fighting or active exchanges of fire with hostile forces , nor do they involve the presence of U.S. ground troops , U.S. casualties or a serious threat thereof , or any significant chance of escalation into a conflict characterized by those factors . '' In a letter to Boehner and to the president pro tempore of the Senate , Daniel Inouye of Hawaii , Obama called U.S. support for the NATO-based coalition `` crucial to assuring the success of international efforts to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas from the actions of the Gadhafi regime , and to address the threat to international peace and security posed by the crisis in Libya . '' He noted that no U.S. ground forces have been deployed , except for operations to rescue the crew of a U.S. aircraft on March 21 . But Kucinich said earlier in the day that the Obama administration must make its case in court . `` They can tell it to the judge now , '' Kucinich said . `` They ca n't claim this is n't a war . '' The lawsuit asks the court to `` declare that the war in Libya is illegal and order the White House to stop . '' The goal of the administration and legislators who support the Libya mission is approval of a new resolution that backs U.S. participation , which would serve as an equivalent to congressional authorization . The White House has said it was complying with the War Powers Resolution through frequent briefings on the Libya mission , and Wednesday 's report cited dozens of them . Boehner 's letter contested that assertion . `` Since the mission began , the administration has provided tactical operational briefings to the House of Representatives , but the White House has systematically avoided requesting a formal authorization for its action , '' Boehner 's letter said . `` It has simultaneously sought , however , to portray that its actions are consistent with the War Powers Resolution . The combination of these actions has left many members of Congress , as well as the American people , frustrated by the lack of clarity over the administration 's strategic policies , by a refusal to acknowledge and respect the role of the Congress , and by a refusal to comply with the basic tenets of the War Powers Resolution . '' Such political wrangling over war powers is common in Washington , with presidents frequently seeking to expand their freedom to commit U.S. forces and Congress battling to exert influence on the process . Congressional opponents of the mission say that its objective of civilian protection fails to match the stated U.S. goal of Moammar Gadhafi 's resignation or ouster and that the Libya situation could become a stalemate . The White House says incremental progress is occurring through increasing diplomatic , political and military pressure on Gadhafi to step down . In a coincidence of scheduling , Obama and Boehner are set to play golf together for the first time Saturday , a day after Boehner 's deadline for information from the administration and the day before he says it could be in violation of the War Powers Resolution .

Rebels say they have confiscated cell phones that contain video showing Gadhafi loyalists raping women and torturing people . CNN has obtained a copy of a video shot on a cell phone that appears to show a woman being sexually abused . The person who gave the video to CNN says it was on a cell phone that was confiscated from a Gadhafi loyalist . It shows two men in civilian clothes standing over a naked woman who is bent over with her face on the floor . The man standing behind her is sodomizing her with what appears to be a broomstick . `` I ca n't bear it ! I ca n't bear it ! '' `` Let 's push it farther , '' a male voice says off-camera . `` No , no , that 's enough ! '' Eventually , one of the men puts his sock-covered foot on her face . In Arab culture , that is considered a major insult . But in this case , it pales in comparison to what the victim is already enduring . Arabic speakers who listened to the video at CNN 's request say the voices have Tripoli accents . There is no date on the video and the men in it are not wearing military uniforms . CNN has been unable to verify the video 's authenticity , when it was shot , or by whom . The person who gave it to CNN asked not to be identified for fear of being punished by Libya 's conservative society . The Gadhafi government did not respond to CNN requests for comment on the allegations of abuse . But officials have said in response to similar accusations in the past that the government has not been able to verify the claims and would `` welcome '' a fact-finding mission . We were able to confirm that rape was used as a weapon of war because it was systematic . An opposition spokesman says the video illustrates a pattern of abuse . `` We were able to confirm that rape was used as a weapon of war , because it was systematic , '' rebel spokesman Abdullah al-Kabeir said . The rebels have many videos showing other types of torture , and a few depict rape , he said . He did not know exactly how many videos there were showing abuse . One of the most famous faces of Libya 's revolution , Eman al-Obeidy , dramatically claimed in March she had been gang-raped by pro-Gadhafi forces . She has since fled the country . A Libyan psychologist who has conducted an investigation of her own says al-Obeidy 's case is not unique . Siham Sergewa says she has evidence of hundreds of cases of rape by pro-Gadhafi troops . She began her investigation after receiving phone calls from women who said they had been sexually assaulted . Her survey of 50,000 people in refugee camps turned up 259 people who said they had been raped , she said last month . `` They tie up my husband , they rape me in front of my husband and then they kill my husband , '' Sergewa said one woman told her . `` I 'm a psychologist and I 've seen lots of things , really . But sometimes after I leave some of these families I just sit in my car and cry because it 's really so painful , '' she said . She has compiled a number of distressing images that she says demonstrate the abuse of alleged victims . One appears to show a cigarette burn on a woman 's breast , another a faded bite mark , while several others show the deep purple hue of nasty bruises . Sergewa shared her research , complete with pictures and recordings , with the International Criminal Court at The Hague , Netherlands , where prosecutors are investigating accusations that the Gadhafi regime has used rape as a tool of war . `` The victims are starting to come out , '' the court 's chief prosecutor , Luis Moreno-Ocampo , told CNN Thursday . `` But in our court the crimes are massive and the crimes we are charging Gadhafi with are crimes against humanity , meaning a widespread and systematic attack -- in this case through rapes -- so we do n't need to prove one case ; we need to prove massive numbers of cases . `` In this case , the evidence can be different . It could be soldiers who were given instructions on how to do it . The evidence could be doctors or psychologists who have spoken to the victims . That 's the kind of evidence we are collecting . '' The court is still in the evidence-collecting stage , he said . For the video to be part of that evidence , its authenticity would have to be certified , he said . `` These are interesting pieces , but it is n't the only way to put forward the case . For instance , we have some information of people saying that Gadhafi himself was giving instructions . So if we can confirm this evidence , that will be enough to present this type of case as a crime against humanity -- as a widespread campaign of rapes . '' Moreno-Ocampo said he was hoping the judge would soon issue an arrest warrant for Gadhafi . `` And then the challenge will be to arrest him , because arresting him will be the end to these crimes , '' he said . Rebel spokesman al-Kabeir , however , said some of the evidence of war crimes that prosecutors want to present in court has been destroyed by a rebel leader . `` There was a commander here at the eastern front in Misrata named Mohamed al-Halboos ; he ordered all the -LRB- rebel -RRB- fighters to give him all the rape videos they find on Gadhafi soldiers ' cell phones . I heard that he used to destroy every rape video he got , '' al-Kabeir said . Asked why potential evidence of war crimes being carried out by pro-Gadhafi forces would be destroyed by rebel forces , he cited the heavy stigma that Libyan culture attaches to the victims of such crimes . `` Aside from being a heinous crime , rape is perceived here in our culture as damaging not only for the girl , but also the whole family , '' he said . In fact , he added , rape is such a taboo here that some victims ' families would rather erase potential evidence than risk living with the shame . In Washington , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States was `` deeply concerned '' over the reports of wide-scale rape in Libya . `` A thorough investigation of this matter is needed to bring perpetrators to justice , '' she said in a statement . `` Gadhafi 's security forces and other groups in the region are trying to divide the people by using violence against women and rape as tools of war , and the United States condemns this in the strongest possible terms .

It acts too slowly , with too little force and proves shamefully dependent on U.S. firepower . Following on the heels of U.S. Secretary of Defense Bob Gates ' stern warning about the future of NATO , such displays of what increasingly seems like self-righteous indignation were to be expected . To be sure , the European response to Libya leaves much to be desired . And yet , I wonder : Imagine the Europeans had brought to bear all the firepower imaginable and had done so rapidly . Would the world be better off ? The answer is not a matter of conjecture and speculation , but of hard evidence because there is a relevant precedent : Iraq . The key question that needs to be asked is : Just what has shock and awe brought us in Iraq ? Or in Afghanistan for that matter ? The evidence is that even the best-resourced military the world has ever known , rife with its impressive hell-from-the-sky and boots-on-the-ground skills , has not succeeded where it moved fast , in Iraq . Hundreds of billions of dollars and a decade later , the United States is likely to have very little to show for its interventions , especially considering the human lives lost and financial treasures expended in those two large-scale missions . The key question is this : What does all that firepower really yield ? Temporary , mucho macho self-satisfaction ? A live-action training ground for toys for boys ? In the end , what has been forgotten amid all the na ve and , yes , boyish , fascination with state-of-the-art military equipment is that all those conflicts require a political solution . And the prospects for that definitely do not get advanced much by rapid , `` decisive '' military action . Quite the opposite : The action may come too fast , exceeding ground commanders ' ability to steer the process of political change . Remember L. Paul Bremer , that dapper Timberland `` boot guy '' who quickly determined , in his infinite wisdom and really quite idiotically , to dissolve the Baath Party instead of cleansing it and preserving a semblance of a non-Shiite , non-Iranian-steered power structure in Iraq ? Those are exactly the kinds of mistakes that are made if things go too well and too swiftly militarily . So the bigger question , with the U.S. media rush toward rapid action in Libya , is : Who 's kidding whom ? The Europeans are far from perfect and they know it . But it is important to recognize that their scarce-resources-induced go-slow approach actually helps settle the political battlefield in Libya . Assume the NATO partners and related parties had succeeded wildly and toppled Gadhafi in next to no time . The problem has been all along that , when it comes to the opposition , we don t know whom we are dealing with , who had the skills to lead and we are still grappling with these questions . So what time has really been lost ? The `` delay '' has only prevented us from making yet another rash , L. Paul Bremer-like pact with yet another potential devil . As things stand , Libya 's post-Gadhafi regime , in a way , is slowly shaking itself out by virtue of allowing plenty of members of the previous elite to disassociate themselves from the despot . As a result , a gradual internal self-cleansing process is taking place , which can only be said to help the transition and lay the groundwork more deliberately for the subsequent transformation , which is going to be difficult enough . Even in Poland , perhaps the biggest success story in terms of self-liberation , it took eight long years , from the imposition of martial law under General Wojciech Jaruzelski in December 1981 to October 1989 , when Solidarnosc had finally won the upper hand . Given that , how could Libya , fraught with tribal conflicts as it is , realistically expect to have a transition lasting but a few weeks ? In closing , it 's worthwhile to reflect on NATO : NATO , or so it seems , increasingly only brings out the worst in the transatlantic partners these days , even when it seems they are finally pulling on the same rope and in the same direction . I remember attending a dinner in Washingtonat a very pro-NATO organization and some people around the table , ardent transatlanticists , spewed with disgust over the Europeans ' actions in Libya . `` Wimps , `` incompetents , '' `` cowards '' were probably among the nicer words I heard . My own view , that the NATO intervention actually gave the previously rather ephemeral `` responsibility to protect '' some real meaning -LRB- and also created a precedent -RRB- , did n't cut it . Neither did my point that , in comparison to the eternal hesitation in the 1990s in dealing with the Balkans , this ought to be considered progress . If you engage , I was told , bring maximum force . Since the Europeans , as a matter of political and public will , as well as of finances , were not only unable to do it now , but really will be unable to do so at any time in the future , why uphold the charade that is NATO ? And there you have it : On the rare occasions when one might surmise a happy meeting of the minds between those who are usually keen to pull the trigger and those who are hesitant to do so , it 's still not good enough . That is indeed a wide ocean to bridge , one that will perhaps prove unbridgeable . The views expressed in this article are solely those of Stephan Richter .

A measured increase in force would have saved lives . The current bloody stalement is the worst case scenario . June 17 , 2011 at 11:56 am | Reply Well said and that is exactly how I think . NATO has decided not to kill Ghaddafi 's soldiers and mercinaries . It is like playing tennis with one leg in chains .

June 19 , 2011 at 9:56 am | A good point in this article is being made with regards to NATO 's fundamental role . . True enough , considerations must be given to the aftermath of any intervention , but , nonetheless , this does does not detract any from the justification of the first engagement . If allied nations , or those deemed to be under conditions that qualify as unacceptable sufferage , and more to the point if such may lead to regional instability , then NATO is abliged to act . That is its post cold war function . On the other hand , it can be said , when placed in comparison with Afghanistan and Iraq , in particular , that the outcome of our intervention could lead only to further instability , and at the very least to prolonged and unintended investments of time and resources . Iraq has been a money pit for the US , And , perhaps not without irony , leads to beg the question . . what then is the developing nature of NATO intervention , today ? Or more broad in scope , as the outcomes will lead to correlated results with wholey US endeavors , what direction have coalition forces in that region been taking with regards to regime change ? One thing for certain that modern history has taught the would be military savior is ` be careful what you wish for . ' Our decision to train and circulate Manuel Noriega is testament enough . And in response I believe that foreign policy on these issues has very much reflected this awareness . With Iraq , Afghanistan , and now apparently with Lybia the military trend seems to moved more towards the direction of compromise and sustainable enclosure of the emergency ; like a bunch bandaids on a critically ill patient , but with plenty more bandaids to spare . And honestly at this point what other resolutions beyond that could there be . Our options thus far have been , one , pull out and avoid further interventions in the future ... disasterous for the global community , two , come in full force , which has been politically unstable . . -LRB- No one ever being reminded from their own militaries past just what exactly ` full ' commitment means . No society does this anymore , just a fiew remaing despots . -RRB- And thirdly we have what seems to be the beginings of our final evolution for joint military and ancillary economic and relieg intervention . . Seal the dam , try to keep everything contained within as much open for business as possible , and incorporate as much of every faction as possible into this new sort of pseudo reinfrastructuring . Seems a terrible direction , but what others are there . We are not about to change the way these regimes function , their populations interact , nor the way their government and coalittions from within take shape . . nor for that matter over the next century . And we are not suppossed to , they are . And that might be the toughest realities of all that we and the world now finally have to face : If we are there for any reason above all it is not just for the oil or for the global community . It is because the region has shown no attempts at governing itself . Deals are made , foreign militaries are kept on retainter to maintain the status quo ; has been so since 1914 . And now that is all gone , and we have nothing to replace it with . So get used to patch work and a growing stockpile of bandaids , because they are going to be needing more and more of them before anything like a coordinated and developing system can be built .

The Gadhafi regime had initially not responded to CNN requests for comment on the abuse allegations but Libyan Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmudi said Friday at a news conference that women are `` our sisters '' and Libyan soldiers would not commit such heinous acts . `` This , like the other mercenaries lies , are false , '' al-Mahmudi said . Rebel fighters said they have found videos of rape on cell phones confiscated from captured or killed Libyan soldiers . CNN obtained a copy of a cell phone video that appears to show a woman being sexually abused .

Arabic speakers who listened to the video at CNN 's request said the voices have Tripoli accents . There is no date on the video and the men in it are not wearing military uniforms . CNN has been unable to verify the video 's authenticity , when it was shot , or by whom . The person who gave it to CNN asked not to be identified for fear of being punished by Libya 's conservative society . Al-Mahmudi said there was no proof that Libyan soldiers were behind the abuse . It said the perpetrators could belong to the armed gangs leading the rebellion against Gadhafi . An opposition spokesman , however , said the video illustrated a pattern of abuse by Libyan soldiers . `` We were able to confirm that rape was used as a weapon of war , because it was systematic , '' rebel spokesman Abdullah al-Kabeir said . The rebels have many videos showing other types of torture , and a few depict rape , he said . He did not know exactly how many videos there were showing abuse . One of the most famous faces of Libya 's revolution , Eman al-Obeidy , dramatically claimed in March she had been gang-raped by pro-Gadhafi forces . She has since fled the country . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States was `` deeply concerned '' over the reports of wide-scale rape in Libya and called for an investigation . `` Gadhafi 's security forces and other groups in the region are trying to divide the people by using violence against women and rape as tools of war , and the United States condemns this in the strongest possible terms , '' she said .

'' Libya 's government had claimed earlier Sunday that nine people were killed and six injured when a NATO strike hit a residential neighborhood in the Libyan capital . `` This is cold-blooded murder , '' government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said at the scene in Tripoli . `` Is this the protection of civilians ? Is this really the search for peace and democracy in Libya , to attack peaceful neighborhoods of Tripoli ? '' NATO said in a statement Sunday that a military missile site was the strike 's intended target . `` However , it appears that one weapon did not strike the intended target and that there may have been a weapons system failure , '' the statement said . Charles Bouchard said the organization `` regrets the loss of innocent lives . '' Cmdr. Mike Bracken told CNN Sunday that NATO was doing everything it could to avoid civilian casualties , citing a case in which a missile had been diverted after it was fired last week . The statement from NATO noted that the air campaign over Libya has involved more than 11,500 sorties , `` and every mission is planned and executed with tremendous care to avoid civilian casualties . NATO remains fully committed to this operation . '' On Saturday , the alliance denied earlier Libyan claims it was killing civilians . `` The claims made by Gadhafi and members of his regime are outrageous . It is Gadhafi and his regime that have been systematically and brutally attacking the Libyan people , '' NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu in response to Libyan government accusations . Separately , at least eight people were killed and 30 were wounded in fighting in Dafniya , west of Misrata , according to records at Al-Hikma hospital and a field hospital that are treating casualties . Most of the dead appear to be rebel fighters . A rebel who identified himself only as Walid said he and fellow fighters came under `` intense , intense , intense '' shelling when they tried to advance on Gadhafi forces Sunday . They were forced to retreat , allowing Gadhafi forces to advance , he told CNN . Bombardments began in the Dafniya area on Sunday morning , and a CNN crew could hear them continue on a fairly regular basis through the day . A stream of wounded people flowed into a makeshift hospital in Dafniya , and witnesses reported seeing intense artillery fire coming from both sides of the clashes . A local radio station in Misrata was calling for people to donate O-positive blood to meet increased demand after the fighting Sunday . Ibrahim , the Libyan government spokesman , said the government holds NATO , British Prime Minister David Cameron , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and U.S. President Barack Obama `` responsible morally and legally for this murder and crimes '' for the alleged strike that killed nine in Tripoli on Sunday . State TV reported that three of the people killed belonged to the same family . The network broadcast footage of a destroyed building and a chaotic scene of rescue teams and civilians pulling a body from the rubble . The incident occurred a day after NATO acknowledged that its aircraft had mistakenly struck vehicles aligned with the Libyan opposition in the hotly contested eastern oil city of al-Brega . On Saturday , NATO expressed regret over the incident . NATO did not provide details as to how many people , if any , died or were injured in the al-Brega strike , which took place on Thursday . But in a statement released Saturday , NATO admitted that its forces hit vehicles that were `` part of an opposition patrol '' -- an incident the military alliance described as `` unfortunate . '' For weeks , NATO forces have been targeting forces loyal to Gadhafi in an effort to prevent civilian casualties . Most of those strikes have come from missiles fired from off-shore ships or aircraft flying high above the north African nation , though earlier this month British and French attack helicopters did fly closer to the ground in al-Brega to go after targets in that city more precisely . Al-Brega is on a frontline -- east of Gadhafi 's base in Tripoli and west of the rebels ' headquarters in Benghazi -- in fighting that has taken place between the two sides over the past several months . In its statement , NATO said that `` a column of military vehicles , including tanks , '' were spotted Thursday around al-Brega where Gadhafi forces `` had recently been operating . '' During what it called `` a particularly complex and fluid battle scenario , '' leaders in the military alliance ordered a strike after determining these vehicles posed `` a threat to civilians .

He has prospered during the Libyan leader 's 41-year reign , first as a professional and later taking care of his deceased father 's businesses . But , as with many things in Tripoli , a first glance can be deceiving . `` Ninety percent of the people in Tripoli hate Gadhafi , '' Mahmoud told me over sips of espresso at a corner coffee shop this weekend . `` All his people do is tell lies . If anyone tells you different they are just afraid . '' CNN is withholding his real name for his own safety . On an almost hourly basis , regime officials and government minders tell foreign journalists that Tripoli is a stronghold of Gadhafi and that dissent has vanished in recent months . CNN , like other media here , is under severe government restrictions . But I recently managed to slip away from government minders to talk directly to several Libyans . And according to several eyewitness accounts , major demonstrations were held against Libya 's strongman as recently as last week . And in the Souq al-Juma neighborhood of the capital , where anti-Gadhafi protests first erupted in February , the government 's propaganda bubble is quickly burst . While international journalists including me were ferried by government minders to a pro-Gadhafi rally at Green Square on Friday afternoon , multiple sources tell CNN that several Tripoli neighborhoods were wracked by running battles between protesters and security forces . `` They were protesting right around the corner . They streamed out of a mosque and onto the small square , '' said Mahmoud . `` Almost immediately Gadhafi forces fired at them with live rounds . '' Mahmoud and other sources say that the group was several hundred strong . He claims that three people were killed and that the area was put under lockdown by government security . Other people in the area confirmed the death toll , but it is impossible for CNN to independently verify this account . The government has repeatedly denied any anti-Gadhafi protests in Tripoli in recent weeks , including on Friday . A taxi driver in his 20s also said that he took part in one of the protests in Souq al-Juma on Friday . CNN is calling him Jamal -- not his real name -- to protect his safety . `` We came out after afternoon prayers , '' he said , `` we were unarmed and peaceful and they just shot at us . '' He says he a bullet grazed his arm . Jamal says that unlike the rebels in the East , they do n't have easy access to weapons to fight . But he says , `` I am not afraid . Even though we were unarmed , I am doing this for the future of my country . '' Another protest was fired upon in a seaside neighborhood of the capital , Jamal says , citing friends who said they were at the demonstration . Speaking to journalists in Tripoli is risky . Gadhafi 's vast spying network means that almost anyone on the street could be an informer or worse . Residents of Souq al-Juma say that hundreds , if not thousands , have been summarily arrested by the dreaded intelligence `` brigades . '' They are never heard from again . And it seems nowhere is safe . Jamal says that recently , a family he knows pinned up a rebel flag out of sight in their home . Somehow the intelligence services found out . `` They stormed into the house , pulled down the flag , and arrested every man in that house , '' says Jamal . But the worst indignity of all , people here say , is they ca n't bury their dead . `` The Gadhafi men . They come out and shoot you like cats , '' Mahmoud told me . `` they hold their guns over you like this and shoot you like cats . We are not people to them . '' Regime officials will often then take the dead away , he says , not affording people a proper burial . `` If we bury them , we must do it in secret .

Humanitarian shipments are exempt from the measure , it added . `` Time is not on Gadhafi 's side , '' the organization said . `` He has lost all legitimacy to remain in power . ...

NEW : The House may consider a resolution limiting U.S. role to noncombat activities Sens. Kerry and McCain introduce a resolution offering support for the Libya mission Critics say the White House has n't complied with the War Powers Resolution Pressure is mounting in the House to cut U.S. support for the NATO-led mission Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two influential U.S. senators introduced a resolution Tuesday expressing support for limited American involvement in the NATO-led military campaign in Libya -- part of an effort to counter rising pressure in the House of Representatives to withdraw backing for the mission . Meanwhile , House Speaker John Boehner proposed two resolutions on the Libya mission that could come up for votes on Thursday . One would be the same as the Senate resolution introduced Tuesday , and the other would limit U.S. involvement in the mission to a noncombat role while allowing many of the same functions being performed now by U.S. forces to continue . The House proposal seeking a noncombat role reflects frustration in Congress over what Boehner and others call President Barack Obama 's failure to get necessary congressional authorization under the War Powers Resolution for engaging U.S. forces in the Libya military campaign . `` If the Commander-in-Chief believes that intervention in Libya is important for our national security , he has a responsibility to make a case for it -- clearly and publicly -- and seek authorization , '' Boehner said in a statement announcing the two proposed House resolutions . `` In the three months since military action in Libya began , none of this has occurred . The American people deserve to have their voice heard in this debate , and Congress has a responsibility to hold the White House accountable . '' The Senate resolution , introduced by Massachusetts Democrat John Kerry and Arizona Republican John McCain , authorizes the commitment of U.S. forces for one year while stressing the lack of support for any use of American ground troops . CNN tours NATO airstrike site `` I believe the president did the right thing by intervening to stop a looming humanitarian disaster , '' McCain said . `` I believe we will find a strong , bipartisan majority that is in favor of authorizing our current military operations in Libya and seeing this mission through to success . '' Kerry added , `` By supporting this resolution , we tell Arabs young and old that the United States is willing to make tough decisions and spend our tax dollars to help ensure your freedom . '' The allied military effort , which already has formal U.N. support , was launched to protect Libyan civilians from violence stemming from a crackdown launched by the North African country 's longtime ruler , Moammar Gadhafi . Western leaders have made clear , however , that they believe the mission can not be successfully completed without Gadhafi 's ouster . The Obama administration has already promised not to use U.S. ground troops , but bipartisan congressional opposition to the military campaign has been mounting . An unusual coalition has formed between traditionally anti-war Democrats and conservative Republicans worried about the cost of the conflict and skeptical of its national security importance . One of the House resolutions under consideration will be the same as the McCain-Kerry proposal that supports the current limited U.S. role in the mission , Boehner , R-Ohio , said in a statement . A House GOP leadership source said the measure is expected to be defeated . The second House resolution would remove U.S. forces from hostilities in Libya , except for those engaged in nonhostile actions including search and rescue ; aerial refueling ; operational planning ; intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ; and noncombat missions . While the resolution would be nonbinding , its approval by the House would signal strong opposition to Obama 's decision to commit U.S. forces without seeking authorization from Congress . A House leadership aide said the second resolution is aimed at U.S. military drones and any other combat role by U.S. forces in Libya , and is likely to pass in the Republican-controlled chamber . House Republicans will meet Wednesday to further discuss the issue , and GOP leaders were not ruling out possible changes or additions to the resolutions . Critics contend the 1973 War Powers Resolution gives the president 60 days to get congressional approval for sending U.S. forces to war , followed by a 30-day extension to end hostilities . The combined 90-day period ended Sunday . Support for the war has also been shaken by evidence presented by Gadhafi 's government of several noncombatant deaths caused by recent NATO airstrikes . NATO officials admitted over the weekend that aircraft from countries in the alliance had mistakenly struck vehicles aligned with the Libyan opposition . The White House argues the president did n't need congressional authorization because U.S. forces are playing only a supporting role in Libya and have n't engaged in what the law defines as hostilities . Obama , however , personally overruled contrary legal opinions put forward by both the Pentagon and the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel , according to a Saturday report in The New York Times . In the Senate , Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada , and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky , have resisted holding a vote on the war because of divisions within their respective caucuses . Reid said Tuesday that there is bipartisan support for the McCain-Kerry resolution in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , but that he was still in discussion with the two sponsors on when to bring the measure from the panel to the Senate floor . He indicated it could be brought to the floor as early as this week . McConnell , meanwhile , told reporters that `` we all anticipate that there will be some kind of Libya debate in the Senate in the near future . '' McCain has expressed anger that the White House did n't push for an earlier congressional vote on the war . The senator , who ran against Obama in 2008 , contends a resolution of support would have passed easily when NATO first intervened . `` The administration 's disregard for the elected representatives of the American people on this matter has been troubling and counterproductive , '' McCain said Tuesday . `` The unfortunate result of this failure of leadership is plain to see in the full-scale revolt ... that is occurring in the House of Representatives . '' The House is also planning to take up the 2012 defense spending bill later this week , and liberal Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D-Ohio , intends to propose an amendment cutting off funding for the mission . However , that amendment is likely to only come up next month after the House returns from its Fourth of July recess . To prevent a similar resolution from Kucinich from passing earlier , Boehner pushed through a resolution giving the president two weeks to send Congress information justifying the U.S. strategy in Libya . Obama responded with a 32-page report arguing in part that he has not violated the War Powers Resolution . Even if the Republican-controlled House passes measures intended to limit funding for the Libya mission , it is unlikely the Senate would do the same . `` The president 's done a lousy job of communicating and managing our involvement in Libya , but I will be no part of an effort to defund Libya or to try to cut off our efforts to bring Gadhafi down , '' conservative Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina , told NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' on Sunday . Obama `` needs to step up his game with Libya , but Congress should sort of shut up and not empower Gadhafi , '' Graham argued . In March , the Senate unanimously passed a nonbinding resolution supporting the no-fly zone over Libya . Some Republicans , however , have now expressed opposition to that effort , citing growing concerns about its cost . In its report on the mission , the administration said the cost of military and humanitarian operations through June 3 was about $ 800 million . It estimated the total cost through September 30 would be $ 1.1 billion . Questions about the war 's financial and other costs have also been raised in the United Kingdom , which has played a leading role in the NATO effort . British Prime Minister David Cameron insists that Britain 's military involvement in the North African country can continue `` as long as we need .

Contact with the Fire Scout was lost at 7:20 a.m. , said Wing Cmdr. Mike Bracken , a NATO spokesman . A Pentagon source told CNN that the Fire Scout belonged to the U.S. Navy . Libyan state television reported that an `` Apache helicopter was downed in the area of Majr in Zliten , '' claiming it was the fifth NATO aircraft to be downed . An Apache is a manned attack helicopter . Bracken denied that NATO had lost any attack helicopters during the alliance 's mission in Libya . Gallery : Rockets bring misery to Misrata The resolution , introduced by John Kerry , D-Massachusetts , and John McCain , R-Arizona , authorizes the commitment of U.S. forces for one year while stressing the lack of support for any use of American ground troops . Libya state TV on Tuesday reported a NATO strike southwest of Tripoli in Nalut city , resulting in `` material and human damages . '' Libyan forces were also continuing their attacks . At 6 p.m. in Misrata , a CNN employee saw three Grad-type rockets strike the center of the city , slightly wounding a 13-year-old boy in front of a bicycle shop . In Dafniya , between Tripoli and Misrata , five rebels were killed and 31 were wounded in clashes along the frontline , according to officials at Misrata 's Al-Hikma Hospital . The Libyan war erupted from anti-government protests in February . Following a United Nations mandate to protect civilians , NATO began bombing military targets in March . However , strongman Moammar Gadhafi still maintains control in Tripoli . Tuesday , Human Rights Watch said that Libyan government forces had planted more than 150 landmines in at least one location in the Nafusa Mountains in western Libya . The global monitoring group visited the site , inspected mines that had been removed , and interviewed the rebel fighters who removed them . `` These antipersonnel landmines pose a huge threat to civilians , '' said Steve Goose , arms director at Human Rights Watch . `` More than 150 countries have banned landmines , but Libya continues to defy this global trend . '' The human rights group said it has confirmed Gadhafi 's use of five types of landmines in six locations in Libya . NATO officials stressed that it was Gadhafi who was deliberately and indiscriminately targeting his own people as the alliance faced questions over a series of incidents over the weekend and into Monday that resulted in allegations of civilian casualties and strikes on Libyan opposition vehicles . `` Let 's not lose sight that it is the Gadhafi regime which started this crisis , '' Bracken said . Libya said that 15 people , including three children , were killed in Monday 's incident . Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said the attack included strikes from eight rockets . `` You are planting the seeds of hatred , NATO , '' Ibrahim said . Five houses and a farm were hit Sunday in the Surman area , west of Tripoli , he said . One of the homes belongs to Khaled el-Kweldi , a top aide to Gadhafi , Ibrahim said . The Libyan leader was not home at the time of the attack , but three children were killed , Ibrahim said . NATO said a residential building west of Tripoli was targeted early Monday . `` NATO is aware of allegations that this strike caused civilian casualties , '' Bracken said . `` That is something we can not independently verify , but I say again that this was a legitimate military target . '' He would not detail how NATO came to determine that the target was a command-and-control communications node except to say that 17 satellite dishes could be seen in aerial imagery . Bracken said the center was involved in coordinating attacks on the Libyan people . Monday 's strike in Surman came a day after NATO acknowledged an errant airstrike in Tripoli may have caused `` a number of civilian casualties . '' Libya 's government said Sunday that nine people were killed and six wounded when a NATO strike hit a residential neighborhood in the Libyan capital . NATO said Sunday that a military missile site was the intended target . `` However , it appears that one weapon did not strike the intended target and that there may have been a weapons system failure , '' a NATO statement said . On Saturday , NATO expressed regret after its aircraft mistakenly struck vehicles aligned with the Libyan opposition in the key and hotly contested eastern oil city of al-Brega . Meanwhile , Libyan opposition leader Mahmoud Jibril arrived Tuesday in Beijing for meetings with Chinese officials , state media reported . Jibril , chairman of the executive board of the opposition Transitional National Council , will be in China for two days , according to Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei . `` China 's major task is to promote peace and encourage talks , '' Hong said . `` China has followed closely the development of the situation in Libya , and calls for the political resolution of the Libyan crisis . '' The Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the rebels `` an important political power of Libya . '' That recognition comes a month after Jibril said that China bolstered the opposition movement 's stature by purchasing a shipment of oil from the opposition group for $ 160 million . `` We have maintained contacts with both sides of Libya , and urge them to take actions that are conducive to the interest of the people of the country , '' Hong said . `` We believe that the future of Libya should be determined by the Libyan people themselves , and China will respect the independent choice of the Libyan people . '' In May , Jibril met in Paris with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Prime Minister Francois Fillon . France has been a strong backer of the Libyan rebels and the NATO air campaign . Also in May , Jibril tried to secure formal recognition for the interim council from the White House , but failed . Since then , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said the United States views the group as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people . For weeks , NATO forces have been targeting forces loyal to Gadhafi in an effort to prevent them from inflicting civilian casualties . Most of those strikes have come from missiles fired from ships located offshore or from aircraft flying above the North African nation .

As I ve watched the Libyan adventure unfold , I ve been particularly interested by the myriad justifications that proponents have offered for intervention . The predominant reason given and indeed authorized in UN Security Council Resolution 1973 has been to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack . Beyond this narrow mandate , however , an additional set of overlapping reasons have been put forth , before and since the intervention began on March 19 . Below are but five of the more prominent secondary justifications put forth by Obama administration officials , congressional members , pundits , and policy analysts . On the second day of the bombing campaign , cruise missiles were launched into Moammar Gadhafi 's Bab al-Azizia compound in Tripoli . The stated military objective was to disrupt the command and control of loyalist forces , but the immediate intention was to kill Gadhafi in an attempt to quickly resolve the civil war . The day prior , British defense minister Liam Fox was asked if Gadhafi was a legitimate target , and responded that attacking the Libyan leader would potentially be a possibility . Since then , while NATO officials emphasize that it does not intentionally target specific individuals , the alliance has routinely bombed Gadhafi 's suspected residences , including one attack that reportedly killed the Libyan leader s son and three of his grandchildren . Since then , the calls for regime change through a targeted killing have only increased . Five weeks into the NATO-led bombing campaign , Senator Lindsey Graham demanded that the alliance cut the head of the snake off , go to Tripoli , start bombing -LRB- Gadhafi 's -RRB- inner circle . Senator John McCain further lamented that while President Obama was limiting America s military mission to achieve primarily humanitarian objectives , the fact is that we need to take -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- out . Foggy Bottom , apparently , wants Gadhafi deposed but only of his own volition . Last week , when presented with several potential diplomatic solutions to resolving the civil war , a State Department spokesperson responded that the only option that the United States was willing to entertain was Gadhafi stepping down from power . Thus , beyond the initial stated military mission of protecting civilians , the only acceptable outcome of the intervention has become the removal of Gadhafi from power , with the bombing campaign continuing until whenever that objective is achieved . Sending a Message to Other Dictators The Libyan uprising and subsequent civil war occurred within the broader context of the Arab Spring that began in neighboring Tunisia , and has swept across North Africa into the Middle East . It was believed by many that the demonstration effect of intervening to attempt to stop the brutal repression used by the Gadhafi regime would deter other dictators from doing likewise . As the events in Yemen , Bahrain , Syria , and even Libya have demonstrated , attempting to use force for second-order psychological effects is a fool s errand , and should not be included as a justification for military intervention in the first place . Nevertheless , in the absence of intervention in Libya s civil war , President Obama warned in his March 28 address to the nation that the democratic impulses would be eclipsed by the darkest form of dictatorship , as repressive leaders concluded that violence is the best strategy to cling to power ; former State Department official , Anne Marie Slaughter , contended that if Colonel Gadhafi wins , regimes across the region will conclude that force is the way to answer protests ; Nicholas Kristof , New York Times columnist , claimed that If not for this intervention the message would have gone out to all dictators that ruthlessness works ; former British Prime Minister Tony Blair wrote , We would send a signal of Western impotence in a region that analyzes such signals keenly ; and Senator John Kerry believed that a military intervention in Libya sends a critical signal to other leaders in the region : They can not automatically assume they can resort to large-scale violence to put down legitimate demands for reform without consequences . Supporting the Libyan Rebels While the Libyan rebels have been unable to remove Gadhafi from power , its self-appointed leadership group the Transitional National Council -LRB- TNC -RRB- has succeeded at courting western support since its founding on March 5 . Utilizing the skills of multi-national public relations firms like the Harbour Group and Bell Pottinger , the TNC has consistently portrayed itself as inclusive , western-educated , committed to democratic principles , and opposed to any Islamist influences . The TNC s official website motto : Freedom . Democracy provides upbeat messages about the progress of the war , and extensive coverage of every foreign official who tours Benghazi . After one such visit in mid-May , Senator John McCain vouched for the rebel leadership , stating : Their Prime Minister got a doctorate at the University of Pittsburgh . Their Finance Minister was recently teaching economics in Seattle others are lawyers , doctors , women activists . Similarly , after British Foreign Secretary William Hague held talks with the TNC in the rebel-held capital in early June , he declared : These people at the top of this organization are genuine believers in democracy and the rule of law . It is quite inspiring . After another early June visit to Benghazi , Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Jeffrey Feltman wrote of being profoundly impressed by everyone he encountered , and drew a vivid picture for how the military intervention in Libya was transforming America s image in the Arab world : Imagine walking in the main square of a teeming Arab city and having people wave the American flag , clamor for photographs with a visiting American official , and celebrate the United States as both savior and model . Repaying European Support in Afghanistan Reports of the White House debate over whether to join the Paris and London-led war party show that the Obama administration has been a reluctant participant from the start . One reason that the administration overcame its reluctance was to maintain the limited support that European NATO allies have provided to the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan . To repay them for their cooperation in the Hindu-Kush , the United States was compelled to support those European allies in North Africa . In explaining why the United States was intervening in a country that was not a vital interest , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton admitted in late March : We asked our allies , our NATO allies , to go into Afghanistan with us ten years ago . They have been there and a lot of them have been there despite the fact they were not attacked They stuck with us . When it comes to Libya , we started hearing from the U.K. , France , Italy , other of our NATO allies . This was in their vital national interests . This rationale has endured , with Secretary Gates acknowledging last week : What was going on in Libya was considered a vital interest by some of our closest allies . Those are the same allies that have come to our support and assistance in Afghanistan . And so it seems to me the kind of limited measured role that the president decided on in support of our allies , who did consider it a vital interest , is a legitimate way to look at this problem . Or , as Senators Joe Lieberman and Marco Rubio wrote yesterday : American disengagement would also inflict irreparable damage on the NATO alliance Having walked out on our European allies in the middle of a battle , we can expect them to do the same to us in Afghanistan . It Will Be a Piece of Cake A final proposition put forward by intervention proponents was that , ultimately , it would not be very hard to achieve the desired end state . Whether based on recent technological advances or the fragile nature of loyalist security forces , such best-case scenario thinking was evident on both sides of the Atlantic . Libya s rebels encouraged the Western assumption that Gadhafi could be deposed with ease . One purported spokesperson for the rebels Transitional National Council claimed on March 13 , We are capable of controlling all of Libya , but only after the no-fly zone is imposed . The United States , according to Obama , would lead with days , not weeks of military action , thus shaping the conditions for the international community to act together . White House spokesperson , Jay Carney , later clarified America s role to be a time-limited , scope-limited military action , in concert with our international partners . My Council on Foreign Relations colleague Elliot Abrams asserted that only a small amount of effort -LRB- is -RRB- needed from the United States to ensure that Gadhafi is defeated . The former U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Merrill McPeak , discussing the imposition of a no-fly zone over Libya , contended that it would change their calculation of who might come out on top . Just the mere announcement of this might have an impact . Meanwhile , the French philosopher Bernard Henri Levy , who was instrumental in flying Libyan rebel leaders to Paris to meet with French President Nicolas Sarkozy , made the implausible claim that If the decision had been made to intervene five or six days earlier , bombing three airports would have been sufficient . So Why Does This Matter ? Every time the United States considers the use of military force , proponents and opponents offer a smattering of justifications for why it should or should not happen . Of course , people have varying vantage points and biases , which leads different arguments to be convincing to different audiences . This is to be expected in a democracy . But presidents do not have the luxury of finding a lot of arguments convincing enough . When presidents authorize a military action , they must have a clear objective in mind . Without a singular , defined goal , policymakers can not appropriately match means and ends , which increases the likelihood of failure . The United States will assuredly use military force against another state in the future , whether to attempt to protect civilian populations , destroy threatening WMD or ballistic missile capabilities , or degrade assets associated with an adversarial regime . When the debates over such interventions unfurl , take the time to sift and winnow through each of the justifications provided by government officials and pundits . Then decide for yourself if these arguments either individually , or in some cluster rise to the level of requiring the use of the American military . In the case of Libya , there was one overarching rationale provided the protection of civilians yet the initial intervention and the now ninety-seven day bombing campaign has been about so much more . I 'm sick and tired of ppl acting like it s ok for us to sit on the sidelines when innocent ppl are being tortured and rapped . Has anyone seen the video of the women being sodomized by a broom stick ?!?!?!?!?! Plus it helps that Libya sits on a lake of oil -LRB- uuughh duh we really need it -RRB- . These are the same ppl that thought we could negotiate with Hitler . And a Hitler and Ghadafi comparison is accurate and not over reaching here , unlike the GW and Obama comparisons . Anytime ppl ask for freedom and are lucky to get shot instead of raped and tortured , and the country has a financial means to lift itself from oppression of course we should step in !!!!!

There 's no explanation in this article about why helping the rebels is `` insufficient '' justification . The article merely mentions that the rebels have worked with PR firms . Guess what , so does the U.S. Government . So does every state government and probably all but our smallest municipalities .

The first measure -- similar to legislation introduced in the Senate by Sen. John Kerry , D-Massachusetts , and Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona -- was backed by the White House . It was defeated 123-295 , with Republicans overwhelmingly opposing the measure and Democrats voting more narrowly in favor of it . The second measure was strongly supported by House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , and other top GOP leaders . It was defeated 180-238 , with Democrats largely voting no as Republicans voted yes by a slimmer margin . In short , the House appeared unable to speak with clarity on President Barack Obama 's controversial effort to oust Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi . White House press secretary Jay Carney expressed disappointment in the first House vote , and told reporters the `` writing is on the wall '' for Gadhafi . `` Now is not the time to let up , '' he said . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was `` gratified that the House has decisively rejected efforts to limit funding for the NATO mission . '' Debate on U.S. involvement in Libya White House defends actions in Libya Protesting for , against Gadhafi in Libya Rape as a weapon of war `` I am pleased that a very important statement was made today by the House , on a bipartisan basis , that recognizes the need for us to continue this important mission , '' she added . Asked to explain the relatively rare defeat for the House leadership on the second vote , Boehner only offered a one-word reply : `` nothing . '' A GOP leadership aide , however , told CNN there was last-minute concern among some Republican members that a vote to restrict certain forms of U.S. involvement in the NATO mission could have been interpreted as an inherent authorization of other types of force . `` Once you de-facto -LRB- approve -RRB- it ... then the president can run with it , '' said Rep. Scott Garrett , R-New Jersey , who opposed both measures . `` What we 're trying to do here is have our cake and eat it too . We 're trying to split it in half by declaring a partial war and then telling -LRB- Obama -RRB- how he is going to be commander-in-chief . '' `` I do n't think you can do that in a bill , '' Garrett said . `` The proper resolution would say we should not be over there , -LRB- and -RRB- we are withholding all funds for all military activity , period . '' Rep. Gerry Connolly , D-Virginia , who backed the support resolution while opposing the bill restricting involvement , said he was n't lobbied by the White House until Friday morning . `` I think moving forward , a lesson -LRB- about administration outreach -RRB- has been learned here , '' he said . Much of the House 's disapproval of the Libya campaign has been fueled by a belief that Obama failed to sufficiently consult with Congress before committing to military engagement . Specifically , representatives from both political parties say the administration has violated the 1973 War Powers Resolution , which gives the president 60 days to get congressional approval for sending U.S. forces to war , followed by a 30-day extension to end hostilities . The combined 90-day period ended last Sunday . Support for the war has also been further shaken by evidence of several noncombatant deaths caused by recent NATO airstrikes . The White House says Obama did n't need congressional authorization because U.S. forces are playing only a supporting role in Libya and have n't engaged in what the law defines as hostilities . The president , however , personally overruled contrary legal opinions put forward by both the Pentagon and the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel , according to a report published Saturday in The New York Times . Boehner said during Friday 's debate on the House floor that Obama 's authority under the Constitution `` does not free the president from accountability to the American people , this Congress or the rule of law . '' The War Powers Resolution `` is the law of the land and simply can not be ignored , '' he said . The GOP-sponsored bill is necessary to `` defend the constitutional authority of the legislature '' and provides `` much-needed accountability . '' Some Democrats , however , blasted Republicans , accusing them of playing politics with what they called a critical foreign policy priority . `` This was not handled right '' by the White House , said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee , D-Texas . But the House votes are `` nothing but politics , '' and `` I do n't want to abandon my friends in the Arab states who are now struggling for democracy . '' Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Thursday it would be a mistake for Congress to cut funding for U.S. military operations in Libya . `` I think , once we have our forces engaged , to deny them funding would be a mistake , '' Gates told PBS News . Key American allies -- especially the British , the French and the Italians -- consider Libya a vital interest , and `` our alliance with them is a vital interest for us , '' he said , citing their efforts in Afghanistan . Gates insisted that progress has been made toward the U.S. goal of ousting Gadhafi . `` Based on everything we see , the government gets shakier by the day , '' Gates said . `` His forces have been significantly diminished . The opposition is expanding the areas under their control . '' Clinton met privately with House Democrats on Thursday to urge support for the resolution backing the Libya mission , according to a Democratic source who attended the meeting . `` The bottom line is , whose side are you on ? '' she said earlier in the week . `` Are you on Gadhafi 's side , or are you on the side of the aspirations of the Libyan people and the international coalition that has been created to support them ? '' The allied military effort , which has formal United Nations support , was launched to protect Libyan civilians from violence stemming from a crackdown launched by Gadhafi . Western leaders have made clear , however , that they believe the mission can not be successfully completed without Gadhafi 's ouster . The White House has promised not to use U.S. ground troops , but bipartisan congressional opposition to the military campaign has nevertheless been mounting over several weeks . In addition to concerns about the War Powers Resolution , traditional anti-war Democrats and fiscally conservative Republicans are worried about the cost of the conflict . In a recent report on the mission , the administration said the cost of military and humanitarian operations through June 3 was about $ 800 million . It estimated the total cost through September 30 would be $ 1.1 billion . CNN 's Dana Bash , Rachel Streitfeld and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .

He is slated to retire June 30 . But Congress has expressed impatience with the pace of the NATO military effort , which got under way three months ago to protect peaceful anti-government demonstrators in Libya . Republicans have accused Obama of having violated the War Powers Act by not having sought congressional authorization for the military intervention within 60 days -- a deadline that has passed . Obama said last week that he did not believe he needed the approval because the U.S. military role is limited . But that did n't placate some House Republicans . `` I believe -- and I think most of my colleagues believe -- that the president has failed to make his case as to why we have engaged in Libya , '' House Speaker John Boehner told reporters Thursday . `` I think the strategy was flawed from the beginning . As I said then , I understand the humanitarian mission , but the idea that the rest of the strategy was to hope that Gadhafi would leave begged the question of well how long are we going to be there ? '' But , the Ohio Republican added , `` I do n't want to do anything that would undermine NATO or to send the signal to our allies around the world that we are not going to be engaged . This is primarily a fight between the Congress and the president over his unwillingness to consult with us before making this decision . '' During a trip to Jamaica on Wednesday , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton dismissed fears of a quagmire and said the mission should not be abandoned now . Clinton said the Libyan opposition has made `` very clear progress '' in its political organization , as well as in its fight against forces loyal to Gadhafi . `` But the bottom line is , whose side are you on ? '' she said to reporters . `` Are you on Gadhafi 's side or are you on the side of the aspirations of the Libyan people and the international coalition that has been created to support them ?

John McCain , R-Arizona , expressing congressional support for limited American involvement in the NATO-led military campaign in Libya . McCain 's resolution , introduced Tuesday with Sen. John Kerry , D-Massachusetts , authorizes the commitment of U.S. forces for a year , while stressing the lack of support for any use of American ground troops . McCain , the GOP 's 2008 presidential nominee and a decorated veteran of the Vietnam War , said he believes Obama `` did the right thing by intervening -LRB- in Libya -RRB- to stop a looming humanitarian disaster .

The committee repeated calls Sunday for a cease-fire between the Libyan government and rebels . `` Only a political solution will make it possible to sustainably settle the current conflict , '' the statement said . It also urged the temporary `` stopping of NATO bombings '' to allow delivery of humanitarian aid . `` Civilian lives have been lost due to these bombings , and civilian infrastructure has suffered untold damage , '' Zuma said . Ahead of Sunday 's meeting , human rights activists urged the African Union to prioritize the issue of the plight of civilians caught in armed conflicts , including Libya . The meeting followed claims a day earlier by the Libyan government that NATO warplanes bombed a bakery and a restaurant in a key oil refinery town east of Tripoli , a charge the alliance has countered . Gadhafi has been a strong supporter of the African Union and has channeled large sums of money its way . Libya also holds a seat on the 15-member Peace and Security Council , which is headed by Lamamra . The African Union 's committee on Libya includes representatives from Mauritania , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Mali , Uganda and South Africa . Opposition leaders had voiced doubt that any mediation involving that multinational group would end the conflict in a way that would satisfy their goals , which include Gadhafi 's ouster . In its proposed agreement in April , the African Union said Gadhafi had agreed in principle to stop all hostilities and allow outside forces to help keep the peace . But rebels rejected the non-binding proposal , saying it did not address whether Gadhafi would step down or provide any solution to the violence against the Libyan people . Both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have blamed the Gadhafi regime for violations of human rights , including indiscriminate fire on civilians , the use of internationally banned cluster bombs and the torture and executions of captured fighters .

It has evidence that rapes have taken place in Libya 's civil war , he said , but he can not prove Gadhafi ordered them . The court issued arrest warrants Monday for Gadhafi , his son Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , and his brother-in-law Abdullah al-Sanussi on other charges . Saif Al-Islam Gadhafi is a close adviser to his father . His arrest warrant came two days after his 39th birthday . Al-Sanussi serves as Gadhafi 's head of intelligence . The warrants are `` for crimes against humanity , '' including murder and persecution , `` allegedly committed across Libya '' from February 15 through `` at least '' February 28 , `` through the state apparatus and security forces , '' the court said in a news release . The court could file charges against `` one or two other names , but in principle the first investigation focuses on these individuals , '' Moreno-Ocampo said Tuesday . The court is not asking international forces operating in Libya to arrest the suspects , he said , explaining that Libya has the primary responsibility to do so as a United Nations member . NATO confirmed in a news conference that it is not seeking to arrest anyone , as that is not part of its mission . Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard of NATO gave a mixed assessment of the mission to protect civilians , saying Libyans were writing `` Thank you , NATO '' on their roofs . But , he said , Gadhafi 's forces were using civilians as human shields , making NATO operations `` more difficult , but not impossible . '' Court issues Gadhafi arrest warrant Back to school in Misrata Libyan families reunited in war And he said NATO had reports that government forces had `` put down very severely '' attempts to demonstrate against Gadhafi 's rule . `` Security forces continue to inflict pain and harm on the population , '' Bouchard said at a briefing in Naples , Italy , where Operation Unified Protector is based . NATO struck civilian and military locations in the Badr Al-Osta Milad area of Tripoli on Tuesday , Libyan state TV reported without further details . Elsewhere Tuesday , rebels attacked a government weapons depot some 30 kilometers south of Zintan , an opposition stronghold in western Libya . It was a location that had previously been a target of NATO attacks . Two people died and four were injured in the fighting , according to Khalid Shhop , a doctor stationed at the depot . Rebels overtook government forces and were later seen carting away ammunition , he said . At the International Criminal Court , Moreno-Ocampo insisted it is only a matter of time until Gadhafi is arrested , pointing out that Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect Ratko Mladic was finally seized more than 15 years after a warrant for his arrest was issued . `` The arrest warrants are not going away , '' he said , noting that 161 warrants had been issued in connection with the Yugoslav wars of the early 1990s -- and that 160 suspects have been seized . Libyan rebels could also face arrest warrants , Moreno-Ocampo said . But `` by far the greatest crimes committed in Libya are committed by the Gadhafi forces , '' he said , explaining why the court investigation began with them . And he batted away questions from reporters about whether an ICC arrest warrant would discourage Gadhafi from stepping down , saying the decision to investigate him came from a unanimous U.N. Security Council resolution , not the court . It was `` not our idea , '' he said . In rebel-held Misrata , where fighting has raged , a crowd cheered Monday following the announcement of the arrest warrants . The announcement at The Hague came as fighting inside Libya inched closer to the capital . A rebel fighter , Hassan al-Jiwali , told CNN that rebel forces were 80 kilometers -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- from Tripoli on Monday . Libya is not a signatory to the Rome Statute that established the international court 's authority , but Moreno-Ocampo said Tuesday it still had a responsibility to arrest Gadhafi and his allies because it is a member of the United Nations , which ordered the investigation . He said the rebels could also arrest Gadhafi and hand him over . The court does not have the power to enter Libya and arrest the leaders . The U.N. Security Council referred the matter to the ICC through a resolution February 26 , following widespread complaints about Gadhafi 's efforts to crush a rebellion . The resolution said that , while `` states not party to the Rome Statute have no obligations under the statute , the Security Council urged all states and concerned regional and other international organizations to cooperate fully with the court and the prosecutor . '' Gadhafi 's backers rejected the court 's authority . `` This court is nothing but a cover to the military operations of NATO , '' said Libyan Justice Minister Mohammed Al Qamod . `` It is merely a political tool for exerting pressure and political blackmail against sovereign countries . '' Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khalid Ka'eem offered a similar view . `` Both the International Criminal Court and the chief prosecutor have neither the legal competence nor the moral compass in any way to pass judgment on anyone , let alone the Libyan people , '' he said . Michael Rubin , an analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute , said the court 's move could damage efforts to get Gadhafi to end his 42-year reign , because he would not seek refuge in a country that is a party or signatory to the Rome Statute . `` The ICC 's arrest warrant symbolizes the dirty underside of international law , '' Rubin said . `` While the ICC makes itself feel good and diplomats can chatter about their commitment to international law , the fact of the matter is their action takes off the table any possibility that Gadhafi could flee to a retirement haven outside Libya . In effect , the ICC arrest warrant tells Gadhafi to fight to the death . '' Most African countries are parties or signatories to the Rome Statute .

An air war alone is not enough , say some analysts But without ground troops , what is the end game ? Some fear a protracted war that could go on for months A Libyan analyst says self-determination is key -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It was supposed to have been over in a few days . World powers would go in with fighter jets and the world 's most sophisticated precision-guided weapons to render Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi powerless . But that 's not the way things happened . As NATO 's airstrikes crossed the 100-day mark , analysts blamed a host of faulty assumptions , including success based solely on surgical airstrikes , for a protracted war that some fear could drag on for more months . `` It 's absolutely wrong to think that an air campaign can win this , '' said Andrew McGregor of the Jamestown Foundation and director of Aberfoyle International Security , a Toronto-based agency specializing in security issues related to the Islamic world . The basic problem , McGregor said , stemmed from presuppositions about the fortitude of the Libyan opposition . It 's absolutely wrong to think that an air campaign can win this . -- Andrew McGregor , director of Aberfoyle International Security . Buoyed by the successful uprisings to the east in Egypt and to the west in Tunisia , Libyan rebels believed they had the mettle to bring down Gadhafi . Western powers believed that with a little help , Libya could be freed from totalitarian rule . But rebels launched an armed insurrection against a man who had spent four long decades preparing his state for unforeseen challenges . This was n't a peaceful revolution of the masses against a government that had no public support . `` This revolt never really had the strength to succeed , '' McGregor said . `` There was this feeling among the rebels that all we have to do is show up . But you should take a couple of years to get it organized first . If you 're just going to run out on the streets , the results will be predictable . '' Four months on , the rebels are not capable of supporting themselves , McGregor said . They are out of fuel , oil production has shut down , and they have few available resources . They will soon face even shortages of food and water , McGregor said . President Barack Obama faces pressure at home to withdraw U.S. forces . There is debate , too , in Europe over the expensive air campaign . The war may have been morally right , but NATO , said McGregor , is facing a conundrum . Part of that failure was a lack of consideration of the makeup of the Libyan population , said University of Texas political scientist Alan J. Kuperman , author of `` The Limits of Humanitarian Intervention . '' `` The fundamental error by the White House and NATO was to imagine that the Libyan people were united in opposition to Gadhafi , '' he said . `` In reality , Libya is divided along lines of clan and tribe , some of whom benefit greatly from Gadhafi , and therefore defend him fiercely , '' he said . `` Any expert on ethnic conflict and intervention could have told the White House that ahead of time . '' In that respect , said Thomas Donnelly , director of the Center for Defense Studies , the Libyan war has the potential for fallout that is worse than what happened after President George W. Bush declared `` mission accomplished '' weeks after Saddam Hussein 's 2003 ouster in the Iraq war . `` To imagine that Libyans are going to come together -- is a hope , but not a plan , '' Donnelly said . `` It was a mistake to get involved in such a feckless way . '' Behind the rhetorical rallying cry of protecting civilians , Donnelly said , has always been the real aim of NATO -- to kill Gadhafi . `` If you made me bet my mortgage at gunpoint , I 'd say we probably will get Gadhafi , '' he said . But the question is when . And if it does n't happen in a timely fashion , then NATO risks the erosion of public support for its campaign , Donnelly said . `` In some sense , 100 days is a short period of time , '' he said . `` But when your political support is so tenuous and thin , and when your operations have heretofore been ineffective in achieving campaign goals , then taking ground forces off the table has not made the war any shorter or any less bloody . '' The Libyan regime has also proven itself to be more robust and resilient than anyone imagined . It would be a mistake , said Donnelly , to assume that killing Gadhafi would mean a collapse of the entire system . The Libya conflict has sometimes been compared to NATO 's air war in the Balkans in the 1990s . Many people thought the Serbs would go down instantly once NATO began bombing . And eventually , it was the threat of a ground invasion that led to the capitulation of then-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic . Gadhafi , however , faces no such threat . And some believe the arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court this week will only help strengthen his resolve to stay in power . `` If Barack Obama had thought a hundred days ago that he would be where he is now , you have to wonder whether he would have made the same decision , '' Donnelly said . `` How can you tell the American people we 're going to start jumping over the fence and we have no idea where we are going to come down ? '' But not everyone is pessimistic about prospects in Libya . Ali Ahmida , for one , stands by his belief that the Libyan opposition can defeat Gadhafi . The rebels , he said , have made noticeable gains with the support of NATO air power . He cited recent rebel takeovers of western towns in the Nafusa Mountains and said Gadhafi is more isolated now than ever before . `` The Libyan people are capable of fighting this fight , '' said Ahmida , an analyst at the University of New England . `` The consequences of this , even though it is more painful and brutal , will have a positive outcome in the end .

Women from in and around Gadhafi 's stronghold of Tripoli have been traveling south to a training facility in Bani Walid to practice with weapons , a common sight in a country where young girls receive military training in schools . As NATO 's airstrikes crossed the 100-day mark and rebels continue to fight to oust Gadhafi , he is tapping everything and everyone in his arsenal to hold on to power . At the training facility in Bani Walid , women are training to `` defend Moammar and the country , '' said Sgt. Faraj Ramadan , a woman who is training other women to properly handle weapons . `` They train to use it , assemble it and take it apart , and to shoot , '' she told CNN recently . `` They were trained and got excellent scores . '' At a recent graduation at the facility , 40-year-old Fatima Masoud said she liked the training . She said she left her textile job every day at 4 p.m. to train . `` I liked training and defending my country , and now I 'm am training women from all ages to use weapons , '' she said . It is unclear how many have answered Gadhafi 's call or how many had graduated from the program at Bani Walid . But women are fighting alongside government forces . A woman , who did not want to identified , fresh from the frontlines , attended the graduation . She was still wearing a cannula in her wrist . `` Do not underestimate any woman in Libya , whether old or young , '' the woman said . `` The woman is still able to perform more than you think . '' Gadhafi 's government claims it has handed out more than a million weapons to civilians since the uprising began . CNN can not independently verify the claim .

World powers would go in with fighter jets and the world 's most sophisticated precision-guided weapons to render Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi powerless . But that 's not the way things happened . As NATO 's airstrikes crossed the 100-day mark , analysts blamed a host of faulty assumptions , including success based solely on surgical airstrikes , for a protracted war that some fear could drag on for more months . `` It 's absolutely wrong to think that an air campaign can win this , '' said Andrew McGregor of the Jamestown Foundation and director of Aberfoyle International Security , a Toronto-based agency specializing in security issues related to the Islamic world . The basic problem , McGregor said , stemmed from presuppositions about the fortitude of the Libyan opposition . Buoyed by the successful uprisings to the east in Egypt and to the west in Tunisia , Libyan rebels believed they had the mettle to bring down Gadhafi . Western powers believed that with a little help , Libya could be freed from totalitarian rule . But rebels launched an armed insurrection against a man who had spent four long decades preparing his state for unforeseen challenges . This was n't a peaceful revolution of the masses against a government that had no public support . `` This revolt never really had the strength to succeed , '' McGregor said . `` There was this feeling among the rebels that all we have to do is show up . But you should take a couple of years to get it organized first . If you 're just going to run out on the streets , the results will be predictable . '' Four months on , the rebels are not capable of supporting themselves , McGregor said . They are out of fuel , oil production has shut down , and they have few available resources . They will soon face even shortages of food and water , McGregor said . President Barack Obama faces pressure at home to withdraw U.S. forces . There is debate , too , in Europe over the expensive air campaign . The war may have been morally right , but NATO , said McGregor , is facing a conundrum . Part of that failure was a lack of consideration of the makeup of the Libyan population , said University of Texas political scientist Alan J. Kuperman , author of `` The Limits of Humanitarian Intervention . '' `` The fundamental error by the White House and NATO was to imagine that the Libyan people were united in opposition to Gadhafi , '' he said . `` In reality , Libya is divided along lines of clan and tribe , some of whom benefit greatly from Gadhafi , and therefore defend him fiercely , '' he said . `` Any expert on ethnic conflict and intervention could have told the White House that ahead of time . '' In that respect , said Thomas Donnelly , director of the Center for Defense Studies , the Libyan war has the potential for fallout that is worse than what happened after President George W. Bush declared `` mission accomplished '' weeks after Saddam Hussein 's 2003 ouster in the Iraq war . `` To imagine that Libyans are going to come together - is a hope , but not a plan , '' Donnelly said . `` It was a mistake to get involved in such a feckless way . '' Behind the rhetorical rallying cry of protecting civilians , Donnelly said , has always been the real aim of NATO - to kill Gadhafi . `` If you made me bet my mortgage at gunpoint , I 'd say we probably will get Gadhafi , '' he said . But the question is when . And if it does n't happen in a timely fashion , then NATO risks the erosion of public support for its campaign , Donnelly said . `` In some sense , 100 days is a short period of time , '' he said . `` But when your political support is so tenuous and thin , and when your operations have heretofore been ineffective in achieving campaign goals , then taking ground forces off the table has not made the war any shorter or any less bloody . '' The Libyan regime has also proven itself to be more robust and resilient than anyone imagined . It would be a mistake , said Donnelly , to assume that killing Gadhafi would mean a collapse of the entire system . The Libya conflict has sometimes been compared to NATO 's air war in the Balkans in the 1990s . Many people thought the Serbs would go down instantly once NATO began bombing . And eventually , it was the threat of a ground invasion that led to the capitulation of then-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic . Gadhafi , however , faces no such threat . And some believe the arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court this week will only help strengthen his resolve to stay in power . `` If Barack Obama had thought a hundred days ago that he would be where he is now , you have to wonder whether he would have made the same decision , '' Donnelly said . `` How can you tell the American people we 're going to start jumping over the fence and we have no idea where we are going to come down ? '' But not everyone is pessimistic about prospects in Libya . Ali Ahmida , for one , stands by his belief that the Libyan opposition can defeat Gadhafi . The rebels , he said , have made noticeable gains with the support of NATO air power . He cited recent rebel takeovers of western towns in the Nafusa Mountains and said Gadhafi is more isolated now than ever before . `` The Libyan people are capable of fighting this fight , '' said Ahmida , an analyst at the University of New England . `` The consequences of this , even though it is more painful and brutal , will have a positive outcome in the end . '' It has not been easy for Ahmida to watch the conflict unfold in Libya . But he is a strong proponent for self-determination who feels strongly that the Libyan people , not outside forces , must determine their fate . `` I warned against this from the start , that Libyan public opinion would not like it , '' he said , referring to the possibility of foreign boots on the ground . And Ahmida still questions the motivation of Western powers and the agendas of exiles who he fears may want to exploit oil-rich Libya . `` I 'm optimistic but guarded , '' he said . Ahmida said the bad news is that NATO lacked clarity in its mission and also in a negotiated exit for Gadhafi , which he said is more difficult now because of the arrest warrant for alleged crimes against humanity . Still , Gadhafi 's regime will fall , he said . Then the real battle for the future of Libya will just be starting . Oh -- So there is a war going on in Libya ? According to President Obama there `` are very little hostilities '' . I never thought I ` dd be saying this but I am rooting for Moammar Ghadhafi . Until President Obama gets authorization from congress I consider him a war criminal . June 30 , 2011 at 11:06 am | Reply I totally agree with you , Galtinator . 75 % of all the civilian deaths in Libya are caused by the NATO air strikes and do n't let the right-wing media kid you otherwise ! Besides , anyone with half a brain would know that since the Libyan air force has been virtually eliminated early in the conflict . June 30 , 2011 at 4:12 pm | Reply 75 % ehmm ehmm -LRB- clearing throat -RRB- Where did you get your numbers ? I 'm libyan and what you are saying is 100 % crap . I would like to see where you get your info ... Gadhafi is a dictator and a murderer who sends libyans to get killed all the time for decades . Women are being raped and children killed . I understand what a war means ... I guess that 's something you probably wo n't , but in a war thousands of people will die for sure -LRB- from both sides -RRB- but the outcome at least will end all the killings . Gadhafi 's people are telling everyone that NATO is killing more so NATO gets out . Now , I 'm not a big supporter of NATO either because I do n't trust their interests , but as long as Gadhafi dissapears forever then I 'm happy . Believe me , at least 10,000 people have been killed by Gadhafi and it is not just NOW , it has been going on ever since he took power . The whole country lives in poverty and people die from poverty while Gadhafi 's family enjoys their billions and makes 5 million dollar parties all the time . July 1 , 2011 at 7:11 pm | Are n't the Rebels part of the French Foreign Legion ? Doubt they really care if civilians die as long as France gets the oil . You can not honestly tell me France has not signed oil contracts already . Even the blind can see that , Rebels are puppets . I do not support Gadhafi but I the rebels are not clean either , support 1 dictator to replace another not going to happen . July 1 , 2011 at 8:49 pm | How many male personnel that are in Libya right now that are not fighting for or against Gadaffi ? How many are not doing anything at all ? Why the hell would people even consider to have foreign ground troops to fall on that field ? Why do n't the Libyan men actually get off their behinds and do something ? I know a lot are , but if they were to get everyone on board then it would be a finished project . Anyways , the end result would be ... Libya did not overthrow Gadaffi , NATO and the US did so they can not claim that . July 2 , 2011 at 12:45 pm | Honesty , sincerity and patience can solve this issue in no time .

July 1 , 2011 at 3:21 pm | Reply Is n't it funny how the pacifist Obama became a hawk once he became president ? That type of transformation seems to happen to anyone in the White House , regardless of party . We never should have gotten involved there . Europe got involved because it did n't want Libyan refugees but this is not our problem . In fact , we should get out of NATO entirely , as General Petraus suggested when he said only the US is covering the huge costs . Let Europe defend themselves , the lazy jerks . We need to close our bases there , bring the troops home and save all of the money for our country . July 1 , 2011 at 3:29 pm | Reply Weird . Obama is criminal for not getting congress authorization . But Gadhafi , who has not had any elections for 42 years is not ?

Air power alone has never decided the outcome of a conflict . Example : Britian survived th Blitz , Germany survived 5 years of allied bombing , Iraq survived the coalition air strikes . Now , France is dropping arms to the rebels in violation of the arms embargo . What a mess !! Remember what happened in Cuba ?? The world supported Castro in taking over Cuba then he turned out to be a communist stooge . Stop the bombing and let them settle their internal affairs .

Good enough reason to cut off aid to Africa for me July 3 , 2011 at 12:56 am | Reply @dan You understand of course that the USA itself does not recogonize the International Criminal Court -LRB- ICC -RRB- . In fact the USA voted WITH Libya AGAINST ratifying the ICC . American administration officials would ignore any warrants for arrest from the ICC as well , and you can be sure that American friendly governments would also not honor the warrant . If China were to start lobbying missles and bombs on Taiwan the USA would consider it an Act of War . When you drop bombs and send precision missles to military targets you are engaged in acts or war . You have to be the dumbest , most moronic , stupidist POS to believe anything otherwise .

'' - and what if he gets authorization from congress ? Then it is the congress who becomes a bunch of war criminals ? Most American people who disagree with the war -LRB- incl . the ones in Congress , with the exception of , perhaps , Dennis Kucinich -RRB- are just saying that `` we can not afford it '' , while still believen that US\\/NATO has `` upper moral hand '' to liberate Libya from brutal dictator . In reality it appears that a significant portion of Libyans actually like Gaddafi . Just picture this : Gaddafi rides standing in open truck during a rally in Tripoli , and all men in the cheering crowd have AK-47 and franticly shooting them into the air . Well , this is how Arabs express their happiness . Now imagine anybody from Western leaders , say Obama or Sarcozy or George W. riding in an open truck surrounded by the crowd of cheering supporters all armed with M-16s and shooting them into the air franticly . The truth is that it would take only one supporter among a thousand to point his AK-47 not to the air , but a bit more horizontal . and that would be the end of Gaddaffi . Still , he does not seem to afraid . So what this war in about ? `` Intelligence was flawed , oh , f-word , we were mislead '' again ?

July 1 , 2011 at 12:34 pm | We all know how difficult it is to predict the outcome of an armed conflict , especially when there are so many parties involved . As we know , human beings are so unpredictable and the actions uncontrollable . At the beginning it looked llike an impetuous act as the rebels , got carried away by their peers in Tunisia and Egypt took to the streets . Hundred days later , after a bloody hard lesson and casualties they have shown themselves organised and disciplined . Despite the airstrikes from the NATO they still have n't gained much ground . I do n't share their optimism that the whole conflict will be over in 4 weeks , by the break of the Ramadam . June 30 , 2011 at 11:39 am | Reply Why do you think that rooting for Gaddafi is rooting for the dark side ? What they fail to talk about is WHY Gaddafi has such fierce loyalty . He modernized libya , made life for the poorest tribes better , made women 's rights the best in the region and made it so Libya is one of 2 or 3 countries in Africa to have an above average per capita GDP . The Rebels are sporting a MONARCHIST flag , and the ideas of the Monarch who Gaddafi overthrough over 40 years ago approximately matchl the ideas of the Saudi Monrachs . If the rebels win , you can be sure that women 's rights will be trampled , the poorer tibes will be excluded from oil profits and large parts of the country will be left in poverty while tribal elites live like Saudi Royalty . This is better for the West , because it is far easier to extract cheap oil from a corrupt tribal regime . June 30 , 2011 at 12:13 pm | Reply What you have said is 100 % correct .

He confiscated people s properties and destroyed successful businesses and well established private sector . In brief he converted Libya to his own private property and all the people just became slaves to him and his children and his tribe . If you don t believe this go and read about Libya in the US Congress archive or even in the archive of Ghadafi himself , everything is documented .

First of all : The KINGDOM OF LIBYA which gaddafi ended in 1969 was definetly not a democracy . It was a western backed monarchy run by a cyrinaican tribal elder . Second , King Idris was the one who actually developed a huge s fortune from oil sails to the West . Next , women 's rights in libya were severely limitted prior to 1969 because of the conservative nature of the monarchy . Gaddafi has allowed women to move up in government and business -LRB- which is why so many of them are willing to fight for him now -RRB- , he created a wonderful healthcare system -LRB- the life expectancy in libya is the same as in the US ! unheard of anywhere else in africa -RRB- He developed the poorest tribes . The problem is that he had to nationalize the wealth that tribal elders from the old regime hoarded , This created a lot of bitterness which is being played out right now .

People forget the the people of Iraq under Saddam had the most moderate muslim goverment in the entire ME . The women went out freely , went to University . They had food , health , and unheard of freedoms . Then came the USA with ` shock and awe ' for ` regime change ' . Now Iraq has lost two entire generations in the process of being ` freed ' . Libya is the same story , just a bit smaller . Libyans had unheard of freedoms , education , food , and health just a number of weeks ago . You can bet that now , after being ` freed ' , they will lose a couple generations rebuilding what the West just took from them . There is no place in the world for moderate , developed Muslim countries . July 3 , 2011 at 8:51 am | Reply June 30 , 2011 at 12:31 pm | Reply It the same problem that happens every time the decision is made to rely exclusively on airpower without boots-on-the-ground , the air force can not identify targets , or assess the effectiveness of their attacks , effectively in a timely manner . And close air support -LRB- CAS -RRB- is totally out of the question . The solution , of course , is to put boots-on-the-ground . If they had send it the special forces troops to work with the rebels to locate targets and coordinate air support like they did in Afghanistan . This would have made CAS the standard approach and created casualty rates in Gadaffi s troops enough to break them , same as in Aghanistan , and all the cities would be in rebel hands by now . Gadaffi and his remaining supports would be dead , captured , or hiding in the desert plotting a guerrilla campaign that is none of our concern . And all the special forces could have returned home and left the people of Libya to sort out a new government .

This article is misleading in that it does n't acknowledge the tenuous political alliance that got UNSCR1973 passed in the first place . It is clear from subsequent statements by the African Union , Arab League , Russia and China that UN approval was a one-time thing . If Ghadaffi and sons had kept their mouths shut and had n't made speeches about hunting the ` rats ' down and ` fighting to the last man ' they may well have gotten away with their repression of a not-very-well-planned uprising . However , its too late for that now . This may take a while yet , but momentum and initiative are on the side of the rebels . NATO strikes will never be enough by themselves , but they are serving to draw down Ghadaffi assets and prevent his troops from conducting co-ordinated mass counterattacks . The regime is being squeezed , and every day brings more defections and bits of territory lost .

They wanted military intervention to protect Libya 's oil , which mainly goes to Europe , not to the US .

The type of bombardment necessary would target not only gov ' t installations , but also power stations , bridges and civilian buildings that may be harboring Libyan military or gov ' t officials .

July 3 , 2011 at 10:28 am | Reply I have always said that Gadaffi is an intelligent man , he has probably planned this whole thing , of attacking people and attracting western forces on his land to keep them occupied in Libya , while the other Middle Eastern nations secretly plan war on the West , so far it looks like his plan is working out . This is the beginning of WW3 , yes the war is going to be taken to the West . I was told by my spiritual leader that from 2012-2022 there shall be hell on earth , the west and the middle east shall have land destroyed , no more buildings all flat . It 'll be sad if its true , the ultimate outcome is that both sides middle east and west lose out and the victors of the war get to inherit an earth that is nuked out . In a way I am glad that peace shall come after war , if it was possible to have peace we would have had it by now . July 3 , 2011 at 10:32 am | Reply Gadhafi is a bad man , no one denies that .

The only opposition there before the CIA\\/Mossad got involved were muslim fundamentalists who did n't like women having rights , AKA -- al qaeda .

July 3 , 2011 at 5:30 pm | Reply I just read about Libya and Gadaffi on wikipedia and my first reaction was wow , this Gadaffi is a great man , is it any wonder that he has planned this war and so far he has also intended to take it to Europe . The Western media for quite some time has utilised Gaddafi s eccentricities to portray him as mad . In reflecting on how this war in Libya has progressed , I , however , have reason to doubt the sanity of some Western leaders . The war has been advanced by mainly three NATO nations , America , France and Britain . Obama , while bombing Libya has professed that this is not a war . With stunning linguistic gymnastics , the war has somersaulted from the feet first war to a head over heels support mission and merely an intervention . I must now conclude that if I dislike my neighbor and start throwing Molotov cocktails on his roof and stones into his windows , I am not at war with him , but in an effort to have him remove from the neighborhood , I am involved in a support mission and have merely intervened across the fence into his property . Sounds like a defense , then once I run it , I would have provided the Judge a good reason to order a psychiatric examination . Sarkozy , for his part , is faced with a UN Resolution which prohibits the supply of arms to Libya . He then in seeking to enforce the UN Resolution supplies arms to the rebels , while professing to be upholding that UN Resolution . Candidate number two for mental status assessment . In Britain , by parity of reason , one must assume that if a community took up arms , set up its own central bank , professed itself the new legitimate government of the UK , then for consistency , David Cameron , would simply fold his arms and direct that the British army not suppress the rebellion ? Absolutely , because , no doubt , he would have to be politically consistent with his conduct in Libya now , would he ? On the 1st of July , and after 3 months of bombardment of Libya by NATO , several thousand people have marched in the streets of Tripoli in support of Gadaffi , yet in the words of Cameron : - As I ve said , we will help fulfill the UN Security Council -LRB- resolution -RRB- it is for the Libyan people to determine their government and their destiny . But our view is clear there is no decent future for Libya with Colonel Gaddafi remaining in power . -LRB- The world can not -RRB- stand aside while this dictator murders his own people . So , there are no equivalent public mass rallies in Benghazi of any size , and yet Gadaffi s own people come out in mass support of their leader , but we can not forget what Obama said : - Muammar Gaddafi has lost the legitimacy to lead and he must leave , '' and that Cameron and Obama are of one mind . All three leaders are , of course , on a humanitarian mission . And to implement same , one drops bombs relentlessly on the Libyan people , who then come out in mass support of their leader and demand that the NATO bombing stops . But , as we know , Obama , Sarkozy and Cameron are all great humanitarians and thus they shall not relent from the humanitarian bombing for accomplishment of the noble humanitarian mission of removing the leader who over a million people want , while insisting that a leadership that no one ever heard of before is installed in power to uphold the democratic wishes of the Libyan people . P.S. I note now that you tube is busy , yet again , blocking the videos showing the size of the pro-Gadaffi demonstrations . Of course , we have freedom of expression here in the West . Somebody is making sense here . Its all so obvious , but people are blinded and brainwashed by media propaganda A + July 4 , 2011 at 12:59 am | Reply Actually Cameron and Sarkozy were the instigators and Obama jumped on the bandwagon of `` Liberation movement '' . Cameron and Sarkozy have learned a hard lessonand realized that they had been too impetuous at the onset of their military foray , They underestimated their enemy and thought the mission would be over in a couple of days if not weeks . Now facing the stalemate , they do everything they can to finish their `` job '' . July 4 , 2011 at 5:28 am | Reply what is wrong with saying you were mistaken . we all have to do that , what if everyone said , you know I was wrong , I was wrong to impede dissent , who cares what kids say where they are in their 20 's -- come to us with better ideas and we will look at them seriously . what if cameron and sarkozy said -- we were wrong we thought you were going to blurt out some things that we ... would prefer remain between us , and obama said , oh I was in error . what if we fixed it all back up and took the cia mercenaries home and ... oh , I forgot . there is no rewind button for some of this . so instead we will make it worse and kill more people -- we could make them stop . but that would take a lot of feet on the street . of course it would be totally worth it . July 5 , 2011 at 2:39 pm | Good Girl -- do n't be surprised though if someone contacts you and threatens you as they did to me this morning on another Libya related article . He was posing as a US government agent , but all of my Tea Party friends told me to relax , that we have first amendment rights here and that the fact that all of the current articles were taken down is not indicative that I was in truth threatened . it was pretty scary though . Its a sad world when they can tell you who to talk to and who to love . July 5 , 2011 at 1:19 pm | Reply The only way to really end the Libyan war is to get rid of Gadhafi . If he 's taken out with a missile or just a rock it will be the deciding factor . He 's the one who 's run the nation like a dictator and has made a small group of fanatics powerful enough to rule by his will . His rule has to do with him controlling the oil and anything financial in the country . Helping those of neighboring countries who only want the same kind of power he has within their own borders has created an army of mercenaries . With Gadhafi gone , his group that runs the nation would lose it 's muster , power , everything . Only then will Libya be able to control its own fate . Maybe if the UN just put a bounty on him a few of his mercenaries might change their minds and chose to retire in comfort . July 3 , 2011 at 10:00 pm | Reply I think the world has forgotten that waging war is basically a bloody and ruthless mess . There is nothing `` humanitarian '' in war . While waging war is decisive to win , a fighter does n't enter a ring thinking he can talk the opponent into submission , in the end it 's about getting him to submit with pain or knocking him senseless to the point that he 's physically broke . I 'm sorry but a part of me feels that if those who wanted Gadhafi removed would just gather their forces and pound him into the stone-age it might save more lives in the end and be more economical . While he continues to punch without gloves on and we go in with our gloved hands tied behind our back , he 's going to stay in power and you can bet he utilizes this as a tactic . Dictators stay in power by being ruthless . He may be eccentric but he 's not the madman the west portrays him as . July 3 , 2011 at 10:09 pm | Reply Gadaffi is very clever , he invested well in Africa , he ran his nation well , he really will take the war to the west , and this shall officially mark the start of WW3 , and that is when it all begins Europe truly can not afford any war , neither can US , imagine the condition of the world now and how much it is deteriorating especially for the west .

Bombing the country for the sake of civilians ? Who are these civilians , cause once you got an AK 47 in your hands you are n't a civilian in my book . Imagine if China or Russia would have bomb another country ; I could just imagine the hysteria in the media . July 4 , 2011 at 12:41 am | Reply The air campaign will eventually make it possible for the opposition in Libya to win , but an expectation of a quick finish was never reasonalbe after the first week or two had gone by . A basic truth though is that air campaign can continue for years and still cost only a small fraction of the daily expense of having ground forces directly involved . The conflict will end when all the men with power in the Gaddafi family are dead or when the casualties on both sides of the conflict has worn down the resistance to compromise . The conflict at its core is not that much different than the current budget standoff in Congress , which may too result in deaths before it is over .

NEW : Libyan state TV reports strikes by NATO forces in Gharyan , south of Tripoli Rebel leaders in Misrata say they are in talks with France about supplying arms France has not confirmed that claim , but says it has dropped weapons to rebels elsewhere Libya 's leader Moammar Gadhafi is under huge international pressure to step down Misrata , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The French government is in talks with Libyan rebels about supplying them with weapons and ammunition , a Libyan opposition military spokesman in Misrata said late Thursday . The French government has not confirmed the claim , which follows an acknowledgement earlier this week that its military has previously dropped light weaponry to rebels elsewhere . Ibrahim Baitalmal , the spokesman for Misrata 's Military Council , said that if the French agreed to help in Misrata , anti-Gadhafi forces there would receive much needed supplies to fight against Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's forces . Misrata is surrounded on three sides by Gadhafi 's forces , which are much better armed . The city 's only outlet is by sea . Gadhafi has been under enormous international pressure to step down following a months-long uprising by rebels , emboldened by popular movements across the Middle East , trying to bring an end to his 42-year rule . The U.N. Security Council approved a resolution in March authorizing force by whatever means necessary , with the exception of a ground invasion , to protect civilians . NATO began bombing military targets a short time later . Libyan state TV reported Friday that NATO had attacked targets in the city of Gharyan , south of the capital , Tripoli . It also reported that pro-Gadhafi forces had bombed an opposition building in Tobruk , in the far east of the country . Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov demanded an explanation from Paris Thursday over its parachuting-in of arms to Libyan rebels -- which was first revealed in a French media report Wednesday -- Russian news agency Itar-Tass reported . Lavrov said that if confirmed , France 's action was in violation of the U.N. resolution . But speaking in Moscow Friday , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said his country 's NATO partners and the U.N. Security Council had been told about France 's decision to drop weapons for the Libyan opposition . `` We are exactly within the framework of resolutions 1970 and 1973 ... all means can be used to help civilian populations to protect themselves , '' he said . `` It 's within that framework that we reacted . We informed our NATO partners and the Security Council . '' French Ministry of Defense spokesman Colonel Thierry Burkhard confirmed Wednesday that its military had dropped food , medical products and light weaponry by parachute to Libyans in Djebel Nefoussa . `` It became clear that people there were defenseless and very much threatened by Gadhafi 's forces , '' he said . `` The weapons were given for self defense because of the security situation . '' Speaking at a news conference Thursday , Libyan Prime Minister Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi said rebel forces were receiving arms from France but were not trained in their use . He said it was reckless of France to take such action , saying it went `` against all of the proclaimed aims of NATO 's intervention in Libya . '' CNN 's Ben Wedeman contributed to this report .

It is that my father is a symbol , a guide . '' The comments by Gadhafi 's daughter come as NATO 's bombing campaign crossed the 100-day mark , raising concerns among some that the airstrikes could drag on for months . Gadhafi has been under enormous international pressure to step down following a months-long uprising by rebels , emboldened by popular movements across the Middle East , trying to bring an end to his 42-year rule . The U.N. Security Council approved a resolution in March authorizing force by whatever means necessary , with the exception of a ground invasion , to protect civilians .

Gadhafi 's daughter has accused NATO of war crimes for airstrikes targeting her father in Tripoli that resulted in the deaths of her four-month-old daughter , her brother and his two children . `` I am not hiding . I am at home . I live normally , '' she said in the France 2 interview that aired Thursday . `` But you see , I 've already lost one of my children and my brother in the bombings . Every day there are members of my people who die . Anyone who has a heart can understand what I feel .

She is believed to have had a hand in keeping the peace among her seven brothers , who have vied over the years for positions of prominence at their father 's side . `` Contrary to what has been said , our family is still very tight . These events have brought us closer than ever . There is no division , no difference between us , '' she said . `` What is being said about it is pure invention .

At least 11 rebels were wounded in the exchange of fire and treated at one of the two field hospitals in what has been the most active day in Dafniya this week , according to a CNN team . Heavy government shelling on Misrata and Dafniya began shortly after Gadhafi rallied his supporters in an audio message on state TV and threatened to take the fighting to Europe in retaliation for NATO 's bombing campaign . `` As soon as Gadhafi 's speech ended , they started shelling Dafniya and around midnight there was a salvo of about eight rockets inside Misrata itself , and it continues on the front this morning , '' said CNN 's Ben Wedeman , who was in Misrata Saturday . Daughter : Gadhafi is ` symbol , guide ' Scrambling for cash in Misrata Gadhafi has vowed vengeance for NATO bombings in Libya . He said the Libyan military could be `` like locusts , like bees '' in Europe , potentially targeting homes and offices . `` You are mistaken , you are involved in a battle that you do n't know what you are going to face , so withdraw and run away , '' Gadhafi told a pro-government gathering in Tripoli . `` Our people is able in one day to move the battle to the Mediterranean , and able to move the battle to Europe . '' Gadhafi referred to NATO , which began bombing military targets in Libya after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution in March authorizing force by whatever means necessary -- with the exception of a ground invasion -- to protect civilians . Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim on Saturday reiterated Gadhafi 's call for vengeance . NATO 's `` aggression is killing our children -LRB- and -RRB- Europe will have to face the consequences , '' he said . `` You will have people attacking Europe , joining terrorist organizations against Europe , and building a culture that makes legitimate all violence against Europe . '' Ibrahim claimed rebel fighters `` have no popular support . '' `` The rebels have no future , '' he added . `` They know it and they are terrified . '' On Saturday , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the NATO mission in Libya is on track , with pressure on Gadhafi mounting and the rebel forces growing stronger . `` We need to see this through , and we are in complete agreement that we will , '' she said alongside the Spanish foreign minister in Madrid Saturday . In Washington , State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the United States was taking seriously the Libyan leader 's remarks . `` Certainly this is an individual who 's obviously capable of carrying out these kinds of threats , '' he told reporters . `` It 's what makes him so dangerous . But he 's also someone who 's given to overblown rhetoric . '' He said the United States would continue to support NATO 's mission of increasing pressure on Gadhafi to step aside . The events came one day after the African Union 's special committee on Libya said it had officially presented a plan meant to help Libya find a way out of the current crisis . The proposal states that Gadhafi will not be part of the negotiation process , but stops short of saying he should step down . `` It is envisaged to convene , soon , in Addis Ababa , -LRB- Ethiopia -RRB- negotiations between the parties to discuss these proposals , '' the group said in a statement . Committee members have met with Gadhafi and opposition leaders over the past three months . Another African Union-led attempt to broker peace between Gadhafi and the rebels fell through in April . The French government was in talks with Libyan rebels about supplying them with weapons and ammunition , a Libyan opposition military spokesman in Misrata said Thursday .

Mustafa Abdel Jalil contradicted earlier opposition statements that Gadhafi 's exit from the country was an absolute prerequisite to bring about the end of the months-long conflict . It signaled a possible willingness to negotiate with the Libyan leader to bring about an end to the fighting . In a Reuters Television report Sunday , Jalil made the comments while reacting to a proposal put forward by the African Union , which rebels have interpreted to mean Gadhafi should have no further role in the country 's leadership . Jalil told Reuters once Gadhafi resigns , `` At that point he can decide if he would stay in Libya or abroad . '' `` If he desires to stay in Libya , we will be the ones to determine the place and there will be international supervision on all his movements and communications , '' he said during an interview in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . Daughter : Gadhafi is ` symbol , guide ' Donilon : No decision on arming Libya Jalil took the reins of the rebel movements after resigning from Gadhafi 's government in February over what he saw as excessive use of force against demonstrators calling for the leader 's resignation . Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim has previously said the prospect of a peace deal would be welcomed , but not one that rested on Gadhafi 's departure . Libya 's Deputy Foreign Minister , Khaled Kaim , noted Monday that talks between government officials and rebel leaders are continuing on multiple levels , including daily phone conversations . He expressed optimism that the talks could have a positive outcome if NATO 's air campaign is halted . Kaim said Italian officials had granted travel visas to certain individuals to help facilitate the talks outside of Libya . But Maurizio Massari , a spokesman for the Italian foreign ministry , denied Kaim 's assertion . The fighting in Libya , meanwhile , was slated to take center stage Monday at a meeting between NATO nations and Russia . The meeting brought together countries who support the airstrikes targeting Gadhafi 's forces and one of the biggest critics of the bombing campaign . NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen was scheduled to meet with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev as part of the Russia-NATO Council meeting in Russia 's Black Sea resort town of Sochi , Russia 's state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported , citing the Kremlin . `` The sole possibility of stabilizing the situation in Libya is an immediate cease-fire and the start of talks between the internal Libyan participants in the conflict with the support of , but not interference from , outside , '' the Kremlin said , according to RIA Novosti . Russia has been a critic of the NATO bombing campaign that began in March after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution for the use of force , with the exception of a ground invasion , to protect civilians . Russia , a member of the Security Council , abstained from the vote . `` Special responsibility in the search for a political-diplomatic solution to the crisis lies with regional organizations , above all the African Union , and the UN secretary general 's special envoy , '' the Kremlin said , according to the news report . The meeting followed reports Sunday of fierce fighting in western Libya , where Gadhafi 's forces have been shelling the towns of Yefren and Kikla , east of the rebel stronghold of Zintan . The shelling began three days ago , according to Mazigh Buzakhar , who works for an opposition media group . Buzakhar said clashes in the western Nafusa mountains on Sunday killed two rebel fighters and wounded 11 . CNN can not independently confirm Buzakhar 's account . Conditions in the embattled towns in the Nafusa mountains are bleak , with no electricity and a shortage of water , Buzakhar said . Rebels have been battling Gadhafi 's forces for months in an attempt to bring about an end to the Libyan leader 's 42-year rule . The rebels received a financial boost Sunday when Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu pledged $ 200 million in support to the opposition . Davutoglu made the pledge during a meeting with Jalil in Benghazi , the foreign ministry said . The Foreign Ministry told CNN Monday that Turkey recognizes the opposition in Libya as legitimate representatives of the country , however , it does not mean the rebels are recognized as the sole representatives . Turkey has not cut off its diplomatic relations with Gadhafi 's government , the ministry said . Gadhafi has been under international pressure to step down , and the International Criminal Court at The Hague issued a warrant for his arrest as well as for the arrest of his son , Saif al-Islam Gadhafi and his brother-in-law Abdullah al-Sanussi . The warrants are `` for crimes against humanity , '' including murder and persecution , `` allegedly committed across Libya '' from February 15 through `` at least '' February 28 , the court said in a statement . On Sunday , South African President Jacob Zuma traveled to Russia to discuss efforts to end the fighting in Libya , just days after he and other members of the African Union said they would not cooperate with the International Criminal Court 's arrest warrant for Moammar Gadhafi . Zuma and others were attending a meeting of the International Contact Group on Libya -- a group of NATO countries , Arab nations and other countries working to bring about an end to the months-long conflict . The African Union said its members will not cooperate with the ICC 's arrest warrant for Gadhafi , arguing that the measure jeopardizes efforts to negotiate a peace deal in the war-torn nation . The arrest warrant `` seriously complicates the efforts aimed at finding a negotiated political solution to the crisis in Libya , '' said a statement summarizing the countries ' decision at a summit in Equatorial Guinea that ended Friday . Libya is not a signatory to the Rome Statute , which established the international court 's authority , and the court does not have the power to enter Libya and arrest the leaders . Gadhafi has made clear he would not recognize the court 's authority . CNN 's Ivan Watson , Yasmin Amer and Yesim Comert contributed to this report .

Some analysts said last week that the court 's move could damage efforts to get Gadhafi to end his 42-year reign , stopping him from leaving the country for fear of being prosecuted . `` In effect , the ICC arrest warrant tells Gadhafi to fight to the death , '' said Michael Rubin , an analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute . Speaking to reporters after the court issued the warrants last week , chief prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo batted away questions from reporters about whether an ICC arrest warrant would discourage Gadhafi from stepping down . He said the decision to investigate Gadhafi came from a unanimous U.N. Security Council resolution , not the court . The U.N. Security Council referred the matter to the ICC through a resolution February 26 , following widespread complaints about Gadhafi 's efforts to crush a rebellion . In a statement Sunday , a spokesman for the British Foreign Office called on Gadhafi to end violence and leave office , noting that the NATO coalition 's aim was to protect civilians , not arrange a safe exit for the Libyan leader . `` We have been clear that those responsible should be held to account . The ultimate political objective is to facilitate a transition to a stable , democratic Libya , '' the spokesman said in a statement . `` To achieve this , Gadhafi must step down , and leave Libya to the Libyan people . '' On Sunday South African President Jacob Zuma was scheduled to head to Russia for a meeting of the International Contact Group on Libya . The situation in Libya is slated to be a top agenda item at a Russia-NATO Council meeting Monday , Russia 's state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported , citing the Kremlin . NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen will meet with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev as part of the meeting in Russia 's Black Sea resort town of Sochi , the news agency reported . `` The sole possibility of stabilizing the situation in Libya is an immediate cease-fire and the start of talks between the internal Libyan participants in the conflict with the support of , but not interference from , outside , '' the Kremlin said , according to RIA Novosti .

He touched on a number of hot-button subjects in his interview with the state-run Al-Ahram news agency , including the hostilities in Libya and strife in Syria . Now that he is the Arab League 's secretary-general , Al-Araby , 75 , said he plans to order investigations into alleged human rights abuses perpetrated by forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi . He also urged Syrian authorities to implement real reforms and transition to democracy . The former Egyptian foreign minister also weighed in on the plight of Palestinians , saying an independent Palestinian nation ought to be recognized and Israelis should pull out of Palestinian territory . Al-Araby was elected by Arab League representatives in May , after its then-leader Amre Moussa declared his intention to leave the post in order to run for president of Egypt . That country is in the midst of a major political transition following the ouster of longtime President Hosni Mubarak in February . A judge on the International Court of Justice between 2001 and 2006 , Al-Araby joined the movement to unseat Mubarak 's government early this year .

Their attacks got under way around 7 a.m. from the north , the west and the south . On the western front , journalist David Adams said rebels were using Grad launchers , two Russian tanks and a number of other vehicles , rockets and guns . The rebels captured the town around 2:30 p.m. , entering from all three fronts , some having captured vehicles belonging to Gadhafi forces . Some rebel fighters could be seen breaking windows , shooting doors of houses and rummaging through families ' belongings . Some said they were looking for weapons , but they appeared to be looting . After they had lost control of the town , Gadhafi forces began shelling its periphery with Grad rockets . At least 12 government soldiers died , six were wounded and seven were captured , said Adams . Rebels , whose casualties included at least seven dead and 15 wounded , said their next target would be Al Assabiah , said Adams . Hassan Al-Jiwali , a rebel fighter from the Nafusa Mountains , said 50 of Gadhafi 's men were killed and 15 were captured in the offensive .

He rattled on about crimes against humanity in his country of Zimbabwe and about somewhat free municipal elections in South Africa without once asking why no white was ever tried for all of the crimes against humanity committed in both countries over the past few decades . Or why bringing western style democracy has been such a challenge -LRB- i mean , really . if you had been brutalized for decades by whites claiming to be implementing democracy , would you trust them now ? -RRB- Zimbabwe did not get their independence from colonial brutality until when ? And yet into the 1990s 85 % of the fertile , money producing lands were owned by 40 000 whites . That alone is a crime against humanity . And let 's not even talk about South Africa , who didnt come out from under brutal oppression until well into the 1990s . And who has ever been tried in the Hague for the evils that happened there at the hands of the white minorities ? Yet mr. godwin wants to talk about crimes against humanity .

Was this decision based on economic considerations or was there some reason that you really felt that he was the best thinker for the show ? Was it not possible to find an African ? In addition Kristof 's comments on certain things was borderline offensive . Problems of disease left him with '' `` a bad taste about West Africa .

Free and fair elections does n't a nation build . It is easy to visit Ghana for a while , and be fawned over by the `` natives '' , knowing that you will eventually return to your cozy quarters in the West . Your comments will have more relevance if you lived there permanently and had to deal with the open sewers , the bad roads , the lack of amenities , and the decadent corruption , corruption so vicious that high officials vie for office to claim it thereby embedding it in institutional structures .

Ghana is a mess and the seeming relative progress vis-a-vis other countries in Africa is a sham . With more than 30 % of GDP in foreign debt , and a pittance 10 % of GDP in revenue from offshore oil discoveries , it is only a matter of time before all the citizens and land resources are held for ransom . If Ghana is a success , then Africa as a whole is in big trouble . July 10 , 2011 at 2:40 pm | Reply I wanted to add my voice to the outrage expressed so well by Shea , Khadijah and others here . Fareed , you more than any other talking head on TV , should have enough common sense to have INDIGENOUS AFRICANS participating in a discussion of countries on the African continent ! Failing to do this undercuts your credibility . How can you provide a viewpoint any different from the rest of the disinterested western media when it comes to Africa if you talk to a couple of white guys about a very diverse , and yes , black continent . A representative from the African Union would have been a good , and obvious start at balancing your panel . I mean , really ! July 10 , 2011 at 3:20 pm | Reply I could n't help but disagree with Bernard Henri-Levy 's objection to the housekeepers defense lawyer 's press conference . In an American court all the details of her alleged rape would have to be revealed . Up to now the prosecution has divulged\\/leaked all details of the case to the public . Giving the details of her side of the story is only fair . If the case is going to be played out in public then the public should hear both sets of details . BHL 's point that it was humiliating and an invasion of her privacy only helps to perpetuate a one-sided view of the case . Revelations about past lies in her life may put her credibility on the line , but she still could have been raped . July 10 , 2011 at 3:54 pm | Reply I agree that some measures were not proportionate . Yet DSK has himself to blame for . However good he is professionally he is a sleazebag . His sex drive was or will always be his stumbling block . July 11 , 2011 at 7:43 am | Reply Your guest Ms. Freeland said she was angry that the media brought up DSK 's reputation for having affairs as if being sexually promiscuous made him more likely to commit the crimes of rape and sexual assault . Although I agree with her that the distinction is very important especially to women who if they are victims should not be less credible if they have an active sex life . However , as an American living in France reading the press on both sides of the Atlantic , I would like to point out that Mr. Strauss-Kahn reputation went far beyond that of being a playboy . To the point that female journalist were warned not to interview him alone . As Ms. Freeland wishes to defend women who are victim of sexual aggression , she should recognize that many women are either afraid to object or to report incidents especially when the agressor is a powerful person . If DSK has a history of sexual harassment it is relevant to this case . And it is my impression from what I have read and watched in France since his arrest that there were numerous incidents that were `` winked '' at in France that would have had consequences for a man in his position in the US . So as to Ms Freeland 's hope that this attitude not be exported to France , if so-called `` affairs '' are cases of sexual harassment , I fervently hope that this incident HAS led to the exportation to France of the attitude that men who use their power to abuse women should be exposed not excused . July 10 , 2011 at 5:23 pm | Reply This is a great post for such a hard topic to discuss . I look forward to reading more excellent posts like this one . Something to think about ... Just as a man 's history as a skirt-chaser does n't mean he 's a rapist , a woman 's history of shady dealings does n't mean that she ca n't be a victim of a sexual assault . The public should n't be quick to convict DSK nor should we be quick to exonerate him . July 10 , 2011 at 7:40 pm | Reply Fareed you make no sense Fareed is the kind of guy with many colors .

Yet there is a buzz around this village , which is in the hands of rebel fighters eager to defeat forces loyal to longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi . Their optimism and energy are matched , in many ways , by their inexperience . When spotters on a rooftop spy vehicles they believe belong to the Libyan army , a rebel rocket team wipes off desert grit from their weapon , oils it up and fires -- their aim , at best , approximate . The group 's commander , Fahti , knows the opposition forces are in many ways overmatched . `` They have tanks . Rockets , '' Fahti said . `` They have mortars , all the heavy weapons . '' Dressed in everything from military fatigues to polo shirts to T-shirts , the rebels are not the stereotypical picture of a modern fighting force . But despite their challenges , the rebels here have had success . That includes , they say , driving Libyan forces several days ago out of the village 45 kilometers -LRB- 90 miles -RRB- south of Tripoli , a key north-south route in the North African nation . One fighter said Gadhafi 's men are `` very afraid '' that rebels will soon take another big step forward by taking his home city of Gharyan , which is 45 kilometers to the north and just 100 kilometers south of the Libyan capital . While strongest in the east near Benghazi , the opposition remains active around much of Libya . A fighter named Mahmoud told CNN on Saturday that his comrades had conducted night raids and ambushes , for instance , around his native Zamiya , a coastal city still in the government 's hands about 50 kilometers from Tripoli . `` But on the coast Gadhafi is strong , he has his people everywhere , '' Mahmoud said . The opposition continues to get help in the form of NATO strikes . The alliance announced in a statement Saturday that it had struck a missile-firing position near Tawhurgha , south of Misrata , that it claims was tucked within a set of farm buildings . Libyan forces used this area to attack civilians in nearby Misrata through missile strikes and as a staging area for attacks , NATO said . In Qawalish , the rebels had some good fortune after coming upon an abandoned army base , and its boxes stacked almost to the ceiling with mortar and artillery rounds . The find was a welcome one for a force that , until recently , was struggling to muster the weaponry to keep up the fight . Those rolling through checkpoints around the village are almost exclusively rebel fighters , drawn to the battlefront by their commitment to a common cause . Their enthusiasm appears strong as they drive by , crammed into the back of pickup trucks , smiling broadly and flashing victory signs . And even with the sounds of war in the distance , some rebels pose for pictures -- victory photos , they hope , in their quest to end Gadhafi 's 42 years in power .

'' CNN was not able to reach anyone from NATO or the Transitional National Council , based out of the opposition-held eastern Libyan city of Benghazi , to confirm reports of the Brega attack . The government spokesman , Musa Ibrahim , also issued a warning that he said he hoped would make headlines around the world . `` We will die for oil . We will kill for oil , '' Ibrahim said . `` We will kill everyone who comes near our oil . Rebels , NATO , we do n't care . We will defend our oil to the last drop of blood that we have . '' His comments came shortly after Gadhafi used similar imagery in pledging not to knuckle under to international demands that he cede the power he has held tightly for nearly 42 years , and instead said he would remain `` until the last drop of my blood . '' `` It is impossible for me to leave my loyal people , '' he told an enthusiastic crowd numbering in the thousands in the western city of Ageelat , in a speech that was broadcast over state television . `` I will remain with my people and with my firearm until the last drop of my blood . We will win over this unjust campaign . We will win over the campaign of colonization , the campaign of hatred . '' After Gadhafi spoke , dozens of young men dressed in civilian clothes and carrying shiny new Kalashnikov rifles in a crowded square fired their weapons into the air in celebration . One of the participants in the pro-government demonstration said he had a message for Libyan rebels who have been fighting Gadhafi 's forces on three fronts : `` I would tell our brothers in Misrata and Benghazi , stop the bloodshed , '' said Walid Khaila , a 22-year old medical student . Libya has been riven by a civil war since shortly after peaceful anti-government protests in February were met by violent crackdowns by government forces . That prompted NATO forces in March to launch a campaign of airstrikes against government troops and command-and-control centers , as well as the Libyan leader 's compound in Tripoli . Gadhafi said he would welcome warm relations with Europeans , who compose many of the NATO forces . `` We want a strong relationship , cooperation and peace with the European people , and not with the war criminals , who must leave immediately , '' he said . He added , though , that he and his followers are prepared to endure privation to ensure he remains the leader of Libya . `` We are ready to live without electricity , without benzene , without buildings , and without air conditioning , '' he said . `` But our firearms are in our hands to fight until the end . '' Their statements came on the same day that Libya 's prime minister warned Western governments they were looking at their last opportunity to engage in oil deals with Tripoli . `` Now is the last chance for any nation contributing to the aggression to review their policy , '' Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi said after meeting with top Libyan oil industry executives . He said any future oil deals with Italy and its energy giant ENI were already off the table . Rome and Tripoli were close trading partners until the conflict erupted in Libya last winter . Tripoli has said that ENI alone invested tens of billions of dollars in Libya 's oil and natural gas industry . Italy scrapped a friendship treaty with Libya last February , in the wake of Colonel Moammar Gadhafi 's bloody crackdown on peaceful opposition demonstrators . Later , Italy joined the NATO bombing campaign of Gadhafi 's forces , after the United Nations Security Council passed two resolutions authorizing the use of force to protect Libyan civilians . Also Thursday , the United Nations reported it completed a four-day humanitarian assessment mission to the port city of Misrata , site of intense fighting in recent months . Though aspects of normalcy have returned to the city , it remains surrounded by government forces and exposed to intermittent rocket attacks , the world body said in a release . Misrata is 210 kilometers -LRB- 130 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli on the Mediterranean and , because of the government forces around it , can be reached only by sea . Though some shops and markets have reopened , rising food prices , a shortage of supplies and a lack of cash mean that most residents have been short of food . The World Food Programme said that , since April , it has distributed 2,634 metric tons of food in Misrata to 125,000 people .

He says he 's wildly popular in Libya and derides `` traitors '' Hillary Clinton states the new policy at Libya Contact Group meeting in Turkey The Transitional National Council is a main organization for the opposition Istanbul -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States now recognizes the main opposition group in Libya `` as the legitimate governing authority '' in a country that Moammar Gadhafi has long ruled with an iron first , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday . U.S. recognition of the Transitional National Council is a major diplomatic policy shift that could give the rebels access to Libyan regime assets that have been frozen by the United States . Clinton announced the change in Istanbul at a meeting of the Libya Contact Group , the alliance of nations working to deal with the Libyan crisis . Applause rippled through the audience as she spoke . Clinton said the Transitional National Council , also known as the TNC , `` continues to gain legitimacy as the representative of the Libyan people '' and conducts `` high-level diplomacy with governments worldwide . '' `` So I am announcing today that , until an interim authority is in place , the United States will recognize the TNC as the legitimate governing authority for Libya , and we will deal with it on that basis . '' The United States had previously stopped short of giving this recognition to the council , but Clinton said the body , based in Benghazi , Libya , `` has offered important assurances today . '' They include `` the promise to pursue a process of democratic reform that is inclusive both geographically and politically , to uphold Libya 's international obligations and to disburse funds in a transparent manner to address the humanitarian and other needs of the Libyan people . '' The United States `` appreciates these assurances from the TNC , which reinforce our confidence that it is the appropriate interlocutor for us in dealing with Libya 's present and addressing Libya 's future . '' In Zintan , rebel military commander Hajj Ousama Jwaili , a commander in the western mountains , said Friday that he considers the announcement `` another indication of support by the international community toward the rebel fighters . '' He added , `` This is an appreciated move by the U.S. , and more countries should do the same . '' Gadhafi reacted with derision to the U.S. announcement . `` Their decisions , meetings , recognitions and their statements are all under your feet -- trample on them , '' he said Friday in an audio message , purportedly taped in Zlitan and broadcast on state-run television . `` This is our answer to all the decisions they took against the Libyan people . '' The Libyan leader urged the NATO powers and others to take heed of what he said was his continuing popularity in Libya . `` You in America , Europe , Russia and everywhere , look ! Look at the millions . Look at the Libyan people . More than 5 million people carrying the pictures of Gadhafi are ready for jihad and for martyrdom . '' He called for `` traitors '' to give up their effort to overthrow his regime , warning that failure to comply will have consequences . `` They must abandon their weapons and turn themselves in from Benghazi to Misrata to Zintan , '' he said . `` We will not hold anyone who turns in his weapons accountable . If this does not happen , the march of millions will take place . '' The Libyan uprising began in February , when opposition forces began fighting to oust Gadhafi and his regime . NATO forces have been operating under a U.N. mandate in Libya to protect people from aggression by Gadhafi forces . Clinton said the United States `` will help the TNC sustain its commitment to the sovereignty , independence , territorial integrity and national unity of Libya , and we will look to it to remain steadfast in its commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms . '' `` In contrast , the United States views the Gadhafi regime as no longer having any legitimate authority in Libya , '' she said . Diplomatic efforts have been ongoing to end the crisis , and Clinton said Libyans are `` looking past Gadhafi . '' `` They know , as we all know , that it is no longer a question of whether Gadhafi will leave power but when . '' Clinton said the coalition will continue to target Gadhafi 's command and control if he keeps threatening the citizenry . `` The terms of a cease-fire are clear . Gadhafi must stop attacks or the threat of attacks , remove his troops from all of the places they have forcibly entered and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance . `` The terms of a political process that will produce a cease-fire and pave the way to a democratic Libya are also clear . It must involve Gadhafi 's departure and an inclusive effort to build a new constitutional framework that redeems the democratic aspirations of all the Libyan people . '' As for the recognition step , a senior State Department official reiterated that the rebel council 's political and economic assurances `` turned the tide '' in their favor . `` We sent a very clear signal ... to the TNC that we recognize them as the future of Libya , '' State Department spokesman Mark Toner said . `` As such , we 're going to take steps to make sure that they 're able to carry out their functions . '' A final statement issued by the Contact Group raised a range of points , including an agreement by the participants `` to deal '' with the Transitional National Council `` as the legitimate governing authority '' in the country `` until an interim authority is in place . '' It also welcomed monetary pledges and encouraged financial help . `` Noting that the unfolding situation in Libya since mid-February has disrupted the operations of foreign companies and contractors , the Contact Group welcomed the commitment of the -LRB- Transitional National Council -RRB- to open up Libya to foreign investment as soon as possible and its commitment to honor any existing legal contracts signed under the Gadhafi regime , '' it said . It also cited `` the need for establishment of a genuine cease-fire and provision of safe humanitarian access remain as urgent as ever . '' The group `` urged all relevant parties to explore ways and means of paving the way for the formation of an interim government to ensure a smooth and peaceful transition of power with the widest popular support possible , '' it said .

Those threats were heard in Tunisia , Egypt , Yemen , Bahrain , Syria , and rendered in black-comedy style in Libya . But there is a strong belief across the region that the costs of removing autocracies , as high as they might be , are low compared to the damage inflicted by the current rulers . In short , freedom is worth the price . In Libya , four scenarios may negatively affect prospects for democratization : civil\\/tribal war , military rule , becoming stuck in transition , and partition . Given the high price Libyans have paid , those scenarios should be prevented rather than cured . The civil\\/tribal war scenario is the worst risk . Egypt s revolutionaries understood this . When sectarian violence erupted there following the removal of Hosni Mubarak , the revolutionary coalitions adopted the slogan , You won t gloat over this , Mubarak . Repressive dictatorships can not win free and fair elections . But they can use extreme violence to consolidate their control over the state , its people and its institutions . So , to win , Libya s Colonel Moammar Gadhafi has deliberately and successfully turned a civil-resistance campaign into an armed conflict . That will have ramifications in the post-authoritarian context . A study published by Columbia University on civil resistance has shown that the probability of a country relapsing into civil war following a successful anti-dictatorship armed campaign is 43 % , versus 28 % when the campaign is unarmed . According to the same study , which was based on 323 cases of armed and unarmed opposition campaigns between 1900 and 2006 , the likelihood of democratic transition within five years following a successful armed opposition campaign is only 3 % , compared to 51 % when campaigns were unarmed . Libya , of course , can survive the gloomy prospect of post-authoritarian civil war . But this requires containing tribal and regional polarization , as well as the rivalries between the Interim National Council -LRB- INC -RRB- and the Military Council -LRB- MC -RRB- , and between senior military commanders . Violent polarization has developed not only between Eastern and Western tribes , but also between some of the Western tribes . Last month , for example , armed clashes erupted between rebels in al-Zintan and the villagers of al-Rayyaniya , 15 kilometers away . Six people were killed a reminder of what can happen if violent polarization continues between neighboring towns and villages . Vendetta politics is not unknown in Libya , and , in an armed society comprising more than 120 tribes including around 30 with significant numbers and resources it can become extremely dangerous . Another negative scenario is military rule . Several figures from the free officers the group that plotted the 1969 coup against the monarchy are leading the INC. . They include General Abd al-Fattah Younis , General Soliman Mahmoud , Colonel Khalifa Haftar , Major Mohamed Najm , and others . Those figures hold a mix of historical legitimacy , for participating in the 1969 coup , and current legitimacy , for helping the 17th February revolution . They also belong to several large tribes , guaranteeing wide tribal representation if a military council were to take power , as in Egypt . Unlike Egypt , however , whoever takes power in Libya will not necessarily inherit poor economic conditions that could threaten their legitimacy and undermine their popularity . This might lead a group of senior officers to rule directly , especially if victory in Libya comes militarily . A move by army officers in Tripoli against Gadhafi and his sons might end the conflict , with military commanders getting the credit and the political capital . But four decades of military-based dictatorship may be enough for Libyans , a majority of whom never really benefited from their country s wealth or potential . When it comes to producing terrorists and undocumented immigrants two critical issues for Europe Arab military dictators have an inglorious record . Algeria in the 1990 s is a potent reminder of this , and Western governments do not want the vicious cycle of repressive autocrats producing violent theocrats and refugees to restart . Getting `` stuck in transition '' Getting stuck in transition is a third possible scenario , with Libya remaining in a gray zone neither a fully-fledged democracy nor a dictatorship , but semi-free . This means regular elections , a democratic constitution , and civil society , coupled with electoral fraud , skewed representation , human rights violations , and restrictions on civil liberties . Getting stuck in transition usually kills the momentum for democratic change , and widespread corruption , weak state institutions , and lack of security serve to reinforce a myth of the just autocrat . Vladimir Putin s rule in Russia illustrates this outcome . Unfortunately , a study published in the Journal of Democracy showed that out of the 100 countries that were designated in transition between 1970 and 2000 , only 20 became fully democratic -LRB- for example , Chile , Argentina , Poland , and Taiwan -RRB- . Five relapsed into brutal dictatorships -LRB- including Uzbekistan , Algeria , Turkmenistan , and Belarus -RRB- , while the rest were stuck somewhere in transition . Given Libya s lack of democratic experience , some view this as a likely outcome in the post-Gadhafi era . But Libya is not the only country that has tried to move from dictatorship to democracy with weak institutions and strong tribal identities . Albania , Mongolia , and India successfully passed more complicated tests and offer some useful lessons in democratic transitions under unfavourable conditions . The fourth scenario is partition , with the old three-province , Ottoman-style setup commonly mentioned : Cyrenaica -LRB- east -RRB- , Fezzan -LRB- south -RRB- , and Tripolitania -LRB- west -RRB- . Cyrenaica is Gadhafi-free , Tripolitania is not , and Fezzan did not fully join the revolution . But the administrative borders of these districts were never fully established , and they have changed at least eight times since 1951 . In 2007 , Libya had 22 sha biya -LRB- administrative districts -RRB- , not three . All of these scenarios will be affected by outcomes in Egypt and Tunisia . In the case of democratic transitions , a success nearby often helps at home . Either country , or both , could offer Libya successful transition models , erecting an important obstacle to military dictatorship or civil war . The views expressed in this article are solely those of Omar Ashour . www.project-syndicate.org The above may be quite true in Yemen and in fact , is but in Libya it 's a different story . What the people in the right-wing news media wo n't and never will talk about is the way Mohammar Qadaffy greatly helped the Libyan people after the 1969 revolution . For instance , the litteracy rate in Libya was 15 % in 1970 and today is 85 % while the poor gradually became less poor and hospitals , bridges and schools were built which otherwise would not have happened under King Idris . If the `` rebels '' triumph there with the help of NATO , Libya will only degenerate into another pro-Western Arab police state !!

Distant explosions shook windows in central Tripoli for more than an hour during the raid , launched about 1 a.m. Sunday . NATO said later that the targets were warehouses full of Libyan tanks , troop carriers and ammunition in Tajoura , about 16 kilometers -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- from the city 's center . The Western alliance has been bombarding Libya since late March a U.N. mandate to protect civilians from forces loyal to longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi , who is attempting to put down a revolt against his nearly 42-year rule . The strike on Tajoura followed `` extensive intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance '' of the target , the allied command reported Sunday . According to NATO , `` the military equipment deployed from this facility was used to resupply pro-Gadhafi forces launching attacks on civilians . '' A surface-to-air missile launcher and radar sites were also hit during the strike , which began shortly after midnight Sunday . It was the first time in several days that the alliance targeted Tripoli and its immediate surroundings . Food shortages in Western Libya Sunday 's events followed a rally by mounted by pro-Gadhafi rallies in Zawiyah , west of Tripoli , where more than 10,000 portrait-waving demonstrators gathered amid a sea of green flags in the city 's cratered and pock-marked central square . Zawiyah was the scene of intense fighting last winter , in the early days of the anti-Gadhafi uprising that has left this country bitterly divided . Gadhafi 's forces eventually succeeded in capturing the city , but recovery appears to have barely begun in its war-torn heart . Municipal buildings and a hotel overlooking the central square still stand gutted , windows broken and facades still singed by fires . A vacant lot filled with sand marks the spot where a government minder said a mosque once stood . The mosque was apparently completely bulldozed in the months since Zawiyah was re-captured . The rooftop of a conference center was still littered with sandbags , bullet casings , several military helmets and bottles stuffed with rags apparently for use as petrol bombs -- evidence that rebels fought from this roof before their defeat last winter . The demonstration in Zawiyah , less than a half-hour 's drive from the Libyan capital , was the third pro-Gadhafi rally in as many days . But unlike the previous rallies in the towns of Zlitan and Ajilat , there was a much larger security presence -- and members of the crowd were much more aggressive toward foreign journalists who were bused into the city by government minders . The men , women and children who attended the rally , many of whom traveled by bus and car from nearby Tripoli , appeared fanatically devoted to Gadhafi . `` Allah , Moammar -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- , Libya only , '' chanted many men and women , some of whom beat their chests in devotion as they repeated the slogan . As he had in previous rallies , Gadhafi addressed his supporters with an audio message that denounced the rebel-held enclaves in the west , center and east of the country . He also denounced the foreign governments that recently declared the rebel Transitional National Council , based in the eastern city of Benghazi , as the sole legitimate government in Libya . `` You agents , you traitors , start looking for survival , '' Gadhafi said , in comments that were simulcasted on Libyan state TV . `` There will be no survival anywhere , get out of Benghazi , you traitors . '' Saturday 's rally looked like a victory celebration as well as a declaration to Libya and the rest of the world that Zawiyah was now firmly in Gadhafi 's hands . But there were signs Gadhafi 's forces still had concerns about security in Zawiyah . A CNN journalist driving through the city hours before the rally officially took place saw security forces lining up three men who had apparently been detained against a wall . And the reinforced presence included soldiers and police who used their vehicles to block off side roads leading to the main road running through the city .

Rebel forces moved to within 9 km -LRB- 5.6 miles -RRB- of al-Brega over the weekend after dismantling thousands of land mines , a rebel spokesman said . But government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told CNN that forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi remained in full control of the eastern city late Monday . `` Defending Brega is so vital to the livelihood of the Libyan nation , '' Ibrahim said . `` We will turn Brega into hell . We will not give Brega up , even if this causes the death of thousands of rebels and the destruction of the whole city . '' Ibrahim said Gadhafi 's troops successfully fought off waves of rebel attacks over the last five days , with 30 government troops and 500 rebel fighters killed . The claim could not be independently verified . Col. Ahmed Banni , a spokesman for the rebel Transitional National Council , said fighting broke out over the weekend after the rebels pulled out thousands of land mines and secured a path for movement toward the strategic oil town . Pro-Gadhafi troops dug a trench and filled it with oil only to set it alight as a line of defense near the eastern entrance of the city , he said . `` So this may delay our plan to take over the city , since they have linked the trench to an oil pipeline so they keep the fire going , '' Banni added . A rebel fighter who did not want to be named said a small rebel force entered the city and clashed with pro-Gadhafi forces , killing at least 11 and injuring dozens among rebel ranks . Gadhafi forces withdrew ahead of the rebels , but re-grouped and launched a counter-attack , Banni said . `` I can tell that the communication between the Gadhafi brigades is not too good , since they did not immediately fire at our expeditionary troops with Grad missiles . That 's what they usually do , but there was hesitation this time , '' Banni said . U.S. to Libya : Gadhafi must go U.S. , Libya officials in talks Food shortages in Western Libya Officials with the Gadhafi government in Tripoli have denounced the assault on al-Brega . At the start of the latest round of fighting on Thursday , Ibrahim accused the NATO alliance of coordinating with rebels to mount a land , sea and air attack . He said the attack exceeded the mandate of United Nations Security Council resolutions that authorize the use of force in order to protect Libyan civilians . In the meantime , NATO announced it struck more targets in the Libyan capital on Monday . For the first time , NATO forces attacked Tripoli 's main international airport . Libyan officials brought journalists to see a radar tower that was bombed in a predawn attack . The remarkably precise strike damaged only the top of the radar tower , while also shattering windows in a neighboring office building . A NATO military statement accused the Tripoli regime of using the radar device to track warplanes and warn pro-Gadhafi forces of impending airstrikes . Officials at the airport scoffed at these claims . `` It is 100 % civilian , '' said acting airport director Naji Daw , pointing at the twisted metal at the top of the red-and-white tower . Daw said two people were lightly wounded by the attack . `` They want us to go back to 100 years ago , '' he said , adding that the airport will now have to rely on an outdated back-up system to track air traffic . Not far away , Libyan commercial airliners sat motionless on the tarmac . Since NATO and US forces imposed a no-fly zone on Libya last March , this once bustling gateway to Tripoli has been barely operational . Daw said the airport now received occasional United Nations and Red Cross flights , as well as planes carrying foreign diplomatic delegations .

Left behind were mammoth construction projects that still dot the Libyan landscape . Many of these unfinished structures were apartment buildings being built for an estimated 50,000 families across the country . `` So many infrastructure projects ... were carried out by international companies , '' Zlitni said . `` Yet the stoppage of these projects could be felt in the economy . Particularly in the building sectors , the transportation sectors , the communication sectors . '' More ominous for the Libyan economy has been the Tripoli government 's growing isolation . NATO is enforcing a no-fly zone over Gadhafi-controlled territory as well as a virtual blockade of Libyan ports . The sanctions have created huge fuel shortages . Long lines of cars now wait at service stations . This week , the government in Tripoli announced it was intervening to control rising prices of basic commodities . `` In a crisis situation like this traders tend to profit more than they should , and therefore there is an intervention by the ministry of foreign trade for the prices of consumer goods , '' Zlitni said . The minister said the government was fixing prices of rice , flour , meat , eggs , sugar and edible oils to prevent hardship among lower-income families . `` We subsidize , basically , '' Zlitni said , `` with large amount of funds . '' But Zlitni warned it was growing increasingly difficult for the embattled Gadhafi regime to pay for these types of subsidies . He pointed out that foreign countries have frozen tens of billions of dollars in Libyan government assets that had been carefully invested overseas in `` treasury bills , bonds , stocks and investments in various international markets , whether in Europe , the USA or Asia . '' Zlitni compared Libya 's dwindling government coffers to the edible meat on an animal . `` This should n't last long , otherwise we 'll be eating the fat and meat . And we 'll very soon arrive to the bones . '' Throughout the hour-long interview , Zlitni made no mention of the fact that last month , the U.N. Security Council added his name to a list of high-ranking officials in the Gadhafi regime now facing an international travel ban . He did , however , declare Tripoli 's opposition to proposals to hand over frozen Libyan government bank accounts to the opposition Transitional National Council headquartered in Benghazi . Last week , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced Washington formally recognized the council in Benghazi as Libya 's legitimate governing authority . State department officials said this could potentially give Benghazi access to some $ 30 billion in frozen Libyan funds in the United States . `` This is against international rules . The international monetary system can not withstand action in this manner , '' Zlitni said . `` If you are freezing through United Nations Security Council action funds for any country , then you ca n't confiscate it . There are legal obligations of the banks . '' But when asked what recourse Tripoli would have if the U.S. government went through with its threat , Zlitni conceded there are few options . `` We should file litigation against them , '' he said .

NEW : Rebel forces fight to hold on to village of Qawalish Germany to lend money for `` civilian and humanitarian purposes '' Statement : The money ultimately will be repaid from unfrozen assets Germany previously announced a smaller loan of $ 10 million -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Germany announced Sunday it has agreed to lend 100 million euros -LRB- $ 144 million -RRB- to the rebels in Libya for `` civilian and humanitarian purposes '' despite staying out of NATO 's bombing campaign against Libyan government forces . Germany had previously announced a loan of $ 10 million -LRB- 7 million euros -RRB- for humanitarian aid to the Transitional National Council , the rebel movement that is battling to unseat longtime Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi . `` Because of Colonel Gadhafi 's war against his own people , the situation in Libya is very difficult , '' German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a statement announcing the loan . `` There is a major lack of funds to build infrastructure , as well as a shortage of needed goods , ranging from medical supplies to food . '' Germany has not participated in the NATO-led military effort in Libya and abstained from the U.N. Security Council vote that authorized military action to protect civilians from Gadhafi 's forces . But German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in June that her country shares the hope `` that this NATO mission is successful . '' Merkel also said Germany was supporting the NATO mission by providing increased resources to the U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan , freeing other nations to contribute to the Libyan campaign . Germany has recognized the rebels as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people and established a liaison office with the opposition in Benghazi in May . Berlin indicated Sunday that the loan will eventually be repaid by the Transitional National Council , using frozen assets from the Gadhafi regime . The statement indicated the reimbursement would happen `` when the U.N. Security Council unfreezes the assets for a legitimate Libyan government . '' By agreeing to the loan , Germany added itself to a growing number of nations , including Turkey and Qatar , that have announced plans to hand over millions of dollars in frozen Gadhafi assets to the rebel council in Benghazi . In an interview with CNN last week , the finance minister for the internationally isolated Libyan government in Tripoli warned that the proposed reallocation of frozen funds would violate international law . `` The international monetary system can not withstand action in this manner , '' said Abdulhafid Zlitni . `` If you are freezing , through United Nations Security Council action , funds for any country , then you ca n't confiscate it . There are legal obligations of the banks . '' Also on Sunday , rebel forces fought to hold on to Qawalish , a key Libyan village along a major north-south route . Rebel fighter Talha Jwaili told CNN that Gadhafi forces advanced from nearby Al-Asaba using heavy machinery . The rebels called in a large rebel force from Zintan , a city 25 miles -LRB- 40 kilometers -RRB- away , and `` managed to repel the Gadhafi forces after a fierce fight that lasted almost four hours , '' Jwaili said . One person died in the fighting , Jwaili said -- his 16-year-old cousin , Youssef Jwaili , son of the Zintan military commander . Several others were injured , Jwaili said . State TV , meanwhile , offered a different version of events . It reported `` armed gangs and the colonialist crusader alliance '' attacked a march of Libyan tribes at the entrance of Qawalish . It broadcast video of a convoy of civilian vehicles with passengers waving green government flags . It also showed video of people being treated at a hospital . In a speech last week , Gadhafi called on his supporters to march -- unarmed -- to reclaim rebel-controlled cities and towns . `` A million should march to Benghazi and liberate it from the traitors without any weapons , '' the strongman said . `` Even without weapons , we can cleanse the western mountains by the march of men and women .

Indeed , it 's becoming increasingly clear as the weeks rush by that battle-weary European partners in the intervention force are keener to find ways of ending the conflict and pull forces back home than they are to obtain their initial objectives of seeing Gadhafi deposed and forced abroad . The upshot is the sound of diplomatic throats being cleared ever louder to prepare public opinion for the now-probable scenario of the operation ending without Gadhafi having budged much . As Tony Karon 's July 20 post noted , U.S. officials came away from recent meetings in Tunisia with Gaddafi representatives repeating demands that the colonel must go as a part of any resolution to the conflict . Yet even then it was becoming evident that what go ultimately entails may not meet the definition rebels have long advanced : of Gadhafi being forcefully driven from power , arrested , and handed over to the U.N. tribunal wanting to try him for crimes against humanity . On July 20 , French Foreign Minister Alain Jupp told French TV channel LCI that one of the hypotheses that 's envisioned is , indeed , that -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- stays in Libya on the condition he very clearly leaves Libyan political life . That considerably watered down position on the criteria to end the conflict was then repeated on July 25 by British Foreign Secretary William Hague . While remaining adamant that Gadhafi must leave power , Hague left the Libyan leader 's fate beyond that open to question . `` Obviously him leaving Libya itself would be the best way of showing the Libyan people that they no longer have to live in fear of Gadhafi , Hague said Monday , prior to his meeting with Jupp in London . `` But as I have said all along , this is ultimately a question for Libyans to determine .

NEW : NATO rejects claims it hit non-military targets near the coastal city of Zlitan Monday NATO airstrikes have pounded the city , about 40 km west of rebel-held Misrata , for a week `` It 's continuous bombing , morning day and night , '' one resident says Government minders took reporters to Zlitan Monday to view the damage Zlitan , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Firefighters battled a blaze caused by NATO airstrikes at a food-storage complex Monday in Zlitan , increasingly a front-line city in the conflict between Libyan government troops and rebels fighting to oust longtime ruler Moammar Gadhafi . The firefighters doused burning sacks of flour with water after bombs punctured the high roofs of three facilities packed with flour , rice and cooking oil in Zlitan , on the Libyan coast east of Tripoli . An unexploded bomb lay buried in the concrete floor of one of the buildings , beneath a hole in the ceiling where sunlight streamed through . Zlitan is about 40 kilometers -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- west of the opposition-held port city of Misrata , and the front line between the rebels and pro-regime forces is somewhere in between the two cities . Smoke rising on the horizon and the rumble of artillery in the east suggested that by Monday , the fighting had moved closer to the city limits . `` It 's continuous bombing , morning day and night , '' said Fathi Amar , who stood armed with a radio and camouflage uniform at the entrance to the burning storage center . No one was hurt in Monday 's attack , Amar said . But he said five guards had been killed in another bombing run that struck the agricultural police center next door on Saturday , leaving little more than a heap of rubble . And another attack two days ago demolished what he described as a military base several hundred yards up the road , killing at least two people , he said . Libya ' Zlitan in rebel , NATO sights Moments after a busload of international journalists arrived , a handful of Libyan men ran up before television cameras chanting the oft-repeated pro-regime slogan `` Allah , Moammar , Libya , nothing else ! '' When Libyan government minders last brought CNN to Zlitan about a week and a half ago , it was to see a large pro-Gadhafi rally in the city 's main square . Crowds of Libyans waved green government flags , fired guns in the air , and fervently pledged their loyalty to their embattled leader . But the scene was dramatically different Monday , as fire trucks and ambulances regularly raced through the city 's largely deserted streets . Many shops appeared to be closed , and the ominous rumble of warplanes could be heard overhead periodically . The NATO alliance says it has been hitting targets it describes as tanks , `` military storage facilities '' and artillery pieces in the vicinity of Zlitan on a daily basis for the past week . Officials from the embattled Gadhafi government also say the air strikes have intensified in frequency . `` People here call NATO the crazy one which lost its sanity , '' said Ramadan Mohamad Ramadan , an official from the local city government . `` It is waging wide-scale war on the people . They are destroying everything . '' Ramadan was standing in front of the rubble of a health clinic that he said had been demolished by a pre-dawn attack on Monday . Several bulldozers dug through wreckage strewn with medical supplies , including syringes , medication and even a microscope . Government officials said they were looking for the bodies of three people believed to be buried underneath , and said the bodies of eight people had been pulled out earlier in the day . Journalists did not see any evidence of dead or wounded at the site . Barely 100 yards away , however , drivers had parked a number of pick-up trucks under the cover of olive trees . Some of the vehicles were smeared with mud and the equipment in their chassis covered with branches -- an apparent camouflage tactic seen used by both loyalist and rebel fighters around Libya . Uniformed troops could also be seen resting in the shade of the orchard . Responding to the Libyan government 's claims to journalists that a health clinic and food-storage facility had been hit , NATO had found no evidence to support the allegations , a NATO representative said . NATO forces had hit a number of targets near Zlitan that were `` military in nature '' Monday , the representative said . `` These targets were a command and control node and a vehicle storage facility that contained military vehicles . `` This is not the first time that such allegations have been made and as is the case with all NATO strikes a thorough damage assessment is conducted afterwards . As always great care is taken to minimize the risk of civilian casualties . `` We are always concerned by any reports of civilian casualties , take them seriously and the appropriate analysis will be conducted to ascertain the legitimacy , or otherwise , of these allegations . '' In the afternoon , government minders brought journalists to the ruins of a mosque and school located in an all-but-deserted residential neighborhood several kilometers to the east of Zlitan 's city center . An air attack clearly destroyed the compound , but there were conflicting reports from government minders regarding which week the strike took place . As another small group of pro-regime supporters began chanting at the ruins of the school , the thud of big guns continued to rumble . One of the minders said NATO warships in the Mediterranean Sea were shelling loyalist positions , but it was impossible for CNN to confirm whether the fire was incoming or outgoing . Two vehicles loaded with women , children and belongings drove past the shattered buildings , heading west -- away from the fighting . Suddenly , the unmistakable cloud from an air strike mushroomed up several miles away to the east . A four-door sedan , caked with mud and carrying several men wearing camouflage and carrying Kalashnikov rifles , drove past , also headed away from the direction of the front lines as the cloud from a second apparent air strike billowed in the distance . `` Come on , let 's go , '' the minders repeated . `` We have to go , they could bomb us here any time , '' they said , some of them visibly nervous . Monday 's government tour of Zlitan was over , but the fighting there appeared to have barely begun . CNN 's Bharati Naik contributed to this report .

Barely 15 days ago , there was optimism from regime insiders here in Tripoli that a deal was in the works to resolve the five-month conflict . Perhaps this was because the Muslim holy month of Ramadan was fast approaching , and with it , an anticipated slow-down in fighting on the front-lines . Also , the regime was engaged in talks on multiple fronts with its European , American , and Libyan opponents . Developments over the last two weeks appear to have killed those hopes . First , the United States joined the growing list of countries officially declaring the rebel council based in Benghazi the `` legitimate governing authority for Libya . '' A day after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made the announcement in Istanbul , Turkey , the message was personally delivered during a round of secret talks in Tunisia . The Americans said they had one message for the Libyans , `` Gadhafi must go . '' At roughly the same time , the Benghazi-based rebels mounted an attack on the eastern front , against the long-contested oil town of al-Brega . Gadhafi 's main spokesman accused the NATO military alliance of assisting rebels in the assault . He also drew a rhetorical line in the sand around al-Brega , declaring dramatically , `` We will kill , we will die for oil . You come to get our oil , we will destroy you . '' Libya 's Zlitan in rebel , NATO sights The rebels admit hundreds of their fighters were killed and wounded during a week of fighting around al-Brega , which Ibrahim grandiloquently re-branded `` Libya 's Stalingrad . '' Meanwhile , the Tripoli regime has been staging large rallies in support of its embattled leader . Enthusiastic , flag-waving crowds thronged the central squares of different regime-controlled towns and cities . Partisans swore allegiance to Gadhafi and defiantly fired volleys of gunfire in the air . State TV provided blanket coverage of the events , labeling them `` million man marches . '' The size of the rallies has been the subject of heated debate between foreign journalists and government officials . But there is no question that Tripoli has been shoring up popular support for the man who has ruled this country for more than 40 years . Government officials argue that the rallies prove Gadhafi is the democratic choice of the Libyan people , a position that the rebels have fought and bled to refute . Therein lies the main sticking point . The regime insists cease-fire first , then talks , while also adding that Gadhafi 's position as `` Brother Leader '' is non-negotiable . Benghazi and NATO say no talks until Gadhafi goes . In recent days , both the rebels and officials in Paris , London and Washington softened their demands . They indicated one possible way out of the stalemate could include Gadhafi remaining in Libya , rather than going into exile . But Wednesday 's announcement by Britain 's top diplomat marked yet another escalation against Gadhafi and his cohorts . William Hague announced he would hand over Tripoli 's embassy -- as well as some of its frozen funds -- to the rebels in Benghazi . Gadhafi has never been this internationally isolated , even in the dark days of the eighties when Ronald Reagan famously labeled him `` mad dog of the middle east . '' Turkey and even Germany , which abstained from the U.N. resolution authorizing the NATO operation in Libya , have both pledged to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars worth of regime assets to the rebels . Even tiny Malta , long described as the `` gateway to Libya , '' has all but broken with the Tripoli regime . This week , the United Nations special envoy to Libya seemed to kill all hope for peace . After yet another round of shuttle diplomacy between the rebels and the regime , Abdul Ilah al-Khatib offered this grim assessment : `` Both sides remain far apart on reaching agreement on a political solution . '' A senior Muslim cleric told CNN that in the month to come , loyalist soldiers could break their daily Ramadan to better fight against what the regime calls `` the colonialist , crusader aggression . '' Ramadan begins in just a few days . Expect Libya 's holy month to be a bloody one .

The death of Gen. Abdul Fattah Younis came after the rebels ' Transitional National Council sought Younis for questioning about military matters and alleged ongoing ties to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , according to what Younis ' supporters told journalist James Hider of the Times of London . Supporters also shot at a Benghazi hotel and smashed its windows . Journalists had been gathered at the hotel for a press conference held by the rebel 's civilian leader who announced Younis was summoned back to Benghazi and was killed along with his two aides under unclear circumstances , Hider told CNN . Younis had served as interior minister in Gadhafi 's government until February , when he defected to the Benghazi-based rebel movement . He was killed along with a colonel and a lieutenant colonel , the rebels ' Transitional National Council said in a statement aired on their television network late Thursday . No further details were immediately released . Younis , a onetime general in Gadhafi 's army , told CNN in February that he switched sides after Gadhafi told him he planned to have Benghazi bombed -- a move Younis said would have killed thousands . Rebel forces have been battling to oust Gadhafi since then , aided by a NATO bombing campaign that has targeted government troops under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians . More explosions rocked Tripoli shortly before midnight Thursday -LRB- 5 p.m. ET -RRB- , indicating fresh airstrikes were under way in the Libyan capital . Earlier Thursday , the rebels said their forces had captured five towns and surrounded a sixth in the plains below the Nafusa mountain range , which borders Tunisia . Hundreds of rebels moved from their mountain positions at dawn . With heavier weapons leading the way with lighter armed fighters following , they initially encountered fierce resistance from Gadhafi 's loyalists . Col. Jumma Ibrahim , spokesman for the Military Council for the western mountain region , said several major battles had taken place before the towns were secured . He named the captured towns as al-Ruwais , Takout , al-Jawsh , Bader and al-Ghazzaya , and the surrounded town as Umm al-Far . Ibrahim said rebels were now negotiating with Gadhafi troops inside Umm al-Far . He said four rebels had been killed in the fighting and at least 20 were wounded , while 20 Gadhafi fighters had been captured . The claimed successes come after one of the biggest rebel offensives in recent weeks and , if true , puts the fighters closer to capturing a significant supply route used by Gadhafi forces . Ibrahim said that on the eastern side of the mountains , Gadhafi forces had been shelling rebel-held positions near Beir al-Ghanam and also near Qawalish . Rebel fighters last month suffered heavy casualties in a failed attempt to wrest control of al-Ghazzaya from forces loyal to Gadhafi . Last week , rebel fighters manning hilltops in the western mountains overlooking al-Ghazzaya told CNN that they had been watching the government forces reinforcing their weapon stocks with heavy military machinery and rocket launchers . The United Kingdom on Wednesday recognized the Benghazi-based rebels as Libya 's legitimate government , and the United States recently recognized the council as the country 's `` legitimate governing authority . '' British Foreign Secretary William Hague on Wednesday reiterated his stance that Gadhafi could remain in Libya if he leaves power , but added that the best thing would be for him to face justice at the International Criminal Court , which is seeking his arrest .

In May , she escaped to Tunisia with the help of a defecting military officer and Libyan rebels , and found temporary sanctuary in Qatar before being deported back to Benghazi in Libya in early June . She was granted asylum in the United States , and on June 6 arrived at the U.N. refugee facility in Romania .

Rebel leader Mustafa Abdul-Jalil said they had been killed by gunmen after Gen Younes was recalled from the front for questioning by judges . He said the ringleader of the attack had been held but he gave no details about his identity or the motive . It is not disclosed where the attack happened ; nor where the bodies are . The general -- a former interior minister who had served at the heart of Col Muammar Gadhafi 's regime since the 1969 coup -- joined the rebels at the beginning of the Libyan uprising in February . The BBC 's Ian Pannell in the rebel-held city of Misrata says his defection was seen as a coup for the opposition , but there had been rumors that he had kept contacts with the Gadhafi leadership . \\* Reading haltingly from a brief communique , Mustafa Abdul Jalil , president of the Transitional National Council , said pro-Gadhafi gunmen had infiltrated rebel-held areas , but he did not specifically blame them for the killings . Abdul Jalil refused to take questions from reporters . Abdul Jalil did not address reports that Younis had been summoned to Benghazi for questioning by the rebel leadership on suspicion of continuing loyalties to Gadhafi , saying only that he was called for military discussions . One rebel loyalist in Benghazi with close ties to the council said Younis was to have been `` interrogated '' Thursday by the council about alleged contacts with government forces . Possible tribal split among rebels Adding to the confusion , the rebels had said hours earlier they had already detained the commander , Abdel-Fattah Younis , on suspicion his family might still have ties to the regime of Moammar Gadhafi , raising questions about whether he might have been assassinated by his own side . Such a scenario would signal a troubling split within the rebel movement at a time when their forces have failed to make battlefield gains despite nearly four months of NATO airstrikes against Gadhafi 's forces . It could also shake the confidence of the United States , Britain and several dozen other nations that have recognized the rebel council as Libya 's legitimate leaders . `` The Libyan military part -LRB- of the TNC -RRB- is in disarray , '' said Dirk Vandewalle , a professor at Dartmouth University who specializes in Libya . `` It has never been able to really define a clear command strategy and my hunch is that it probably never will , despite all of the aid it is getting . '' From the New York Times : The specter of a violent tribal conflict within the rebel ranks touches on a central fear of the Western nations backing the Libyan insurrection : that the rebels democratic goals could give way to a tribal civil war over Libya s oil resources . Colonel Qaddafi has often warned of such a possibility as he has fought to keep power , while the rebel leaders have argued that their cause transcends Libya s age-old tribal divisions . A pickup truck full of angry armed Obeidi tribesmen arrived at the front of the hotel -LRB- in Benghazi that acts as rebel hq . -RRB- . Some fired their Kalashnikovs at hotel windows , shattering them , and others shot into the air . One man raced with his rifle through the front door of the hotel , and two witnesses said they heard gunshots inside . Rebels in west seize four towns In the western Nafusa mountain range southwest of the capital , Tripoli , hundreds of rebels launched a broad offensive against government forces Thursday , seizing three small towns and advancing on others to secure a major supply route near the Tunisian border , rebel spokesmen said . Four rebel fighters were killed and several wounded while taking the small towns of Jawsh , Ghezaya and Takut , Abdel-Salam Othman said . The claimed successes come after one of the biggest rebel offensives in recent weeks and , if true , puts the fighters closer to capturing a significant supply route used by Gadhafi forces . Ibrahim said that on the eastern side of the mountains , Gadhafi forces had been shelling rebel-held positions near Beir al-Ghanam and also near Qawalish . The authorities in Syria have said saboteurs blew up an oil pipeline near Homs , a hub of protest against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . The attack was the second of its kind this month . It left a crater 15m -LRB- 50ft -RRB- wide and oil gushing from the broken pipe , the state news agency Sana said . Overnight , at least five people were killed during raids by security forces , activists say . The deaths occurred in the north-eastern city of Deir al-Zour and a suburb of the capital Damascus , in the south-west of the country . Activists and opposition groups are calling on the `` silent majority '' to stand up and be counted in the last Friday mass rallies across Syria before Ramadan . Opposition groups have given Friday rallies the label `` Your silence is killing us '' in attempts to mobilize prominent community leaders , intellectuals , the business elite , religious leaders and other Arab countries to join the opposition cause . While mass protests have been marked in regional centers around the country , Syria s two largest capital cities , Damascus and Aleppo , have so far failed to attract the large numbers of protesters like the regional centers of Hama , Homs and elsewhere . Many believe the protest movement must take hold of the business and political capitals to progress from the deadly ritual stalemate that has claimed the lives of up to 1,500 civilians . Will Ramadan provide new platform for Syrian protests ? The relentless cycle of protest and crackdown in Syria over the last four months appears poised to enter a new phase in the coming Muslim holy month of Ramadan , with activists planning to capitalize on religious rhythms to hold nightly demonstrations despite fears of an even harsher government reaction . The protesters say it should be easier to gather people since they would ordinarily end their days of fasting and nights of feasting with a visit to mosques for prayers . Their hope is that mobilizing people every day , rather than waiting for large Friday protests , will wear down a government that has so far been able to hang on to support among substantial sectors of the population despite protests that have grown larger and more widespread . Activists , who have posted video on YouTube instructing protesters on the plan , said they expect demonstrations to begin around 10:30 p.m. , just after people gather for the tarawih , the prayer performed only in Ramadan . More civilians killed in southern Afghanistan Two roadside bombs killed 19 people and wounded four Friday in Afghanistan as civilians are increasingly being caught in crossfire of the fighting between the Taliban and the U.S.-led coalition . A minibus ran over a bomb in Nahri Sarraj district of Helmand province , with the blast killing all 18 passengers , said Kamaluddin Sherzai , the province s deputy police chief . `` The mine was very powerful and destroyed the vehicle , '' he said . `` They were all civilians . Some were children . '' In its midyear report , the United Nations said the number of Afghan civilians killed in war-related violence rose by 15 percent in the first half of 2011 . The report said 1,462 Afghan civilians lost their lives , including 444 killed by roadside bombs . During the first half of last year , 1,271 Afghan civilians were killed in the war . Talks on long-term Afghan -- US partnership stumble Negotiations to set the terms of the U.S. partnership with Afghanistan in the decade after 2014 are faltering as the two countries struggle to bridge the gap between their demands , according to U.S. and Afghan officials . After months of talks , some of the officials involved are growing increasingly pessimistic about the prospect of a substantive `` strategic partnership '' declaration anytime soon that would allow for a long-term U.S. troop presence in exchange for protection guarantees for Afghanistan and support for the nation s security forces . U.S. - led NATO forces are set to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2014 . `` I see a situation building that will turn negative , '' said Shaida Mohammad Abdali , Afghanistan s deputy national security adviser . `` If the U.S. is really interested in staying in Afghanistan , it must show it practically to the Afghan government and the people . And respond to what we need . '' UN stiffens sanctions against Pakistan Taliban The U.N. Security Council on Friday will impose sanctions on the Pakistani Taliban , an extremist Islamic organization which American officials blame for masterminding the botched September 2010 Times Square bombing plot . The group , which is formally named Tehrik-E-Taliban Pakistan -LRB- TTP -RRB- , will be added Friday to a U.N. blacklist of terrorist organizations linked to Al Qaeda . It was already placed on the U.S. Foreign Terrorist Organization list last September , some four months after the U.S. accused the group of attempting to set off a car bomb in the packed New York City tourism center . The United States proposed in recent weeks that the organization be added to the U.N. list , citing the widening reach of the organization 's terror targets . Australia , Canada , Britain , France and Pakistan cosponsored the U.S. measure . Yemen : tribal clashes kill 40 Associated Press : Clashes between Yemeni soldiers and armed tribesmen in a mountainous region north of the capital killed at least 40 people yesterday , a military official said . The fighting in the Arhab region is one example of the wider security collapse across Yemen since the outbreak of a massive uprising seeking to topple President Ali Abdullah Saleh six months ago . Armed tribesmen are battling security forces in Arhab , the southern city of Taiz , and elsewhere , while militants believed to be linked to Al Qaeda have overrun towns in the country s restive south . Yesterday s clashes northeast of Sana s international airport began when tribesmen attacked a base belonging to the Republican Guard , said Sheik Hamid Assem of the Arhab tribe . Shabab send more fighters to Mogadishu Heavy fighting broke out Thursday in the Somali capital , Mogadishu , as African Union peacekeepers launched an offensive to protect famine relief efforts from attacks by the Shabab rebels , officials said . At least six people died . The Shabab , which initially said they would allow the aid to be delivered , changed their mind last week . The rebels have sent 300 reinforcement fighters to Mogadishu in recent days , said Lt. Col. Paddy Ankunda , spokesman for the African Union peacekeeping force . He said the Shabab were trying to prevent aid from reaching the tens of thousands of famine refugees who have poured into Mogadishu this month . CNN 's Nima Elbagir reports from Mogadishu : `` Tens of thousands of people fled the Somali capital of Mogadishu because of the violence and insecurity here . They 're now having to come back seeking refuge from the famine that hit them in those areas they fled to , and it seems that that violence is following them , '' Elbagir says . Senior al Qaeda figure in Algeria killed Algerian security forces killed a top member of an Al-Qaeda regional offshoot and two accomplices who were trying to reach Algiers aboard a car laden with explosives , a government official said Thursday . The official said Abdelkahar Belhadj , son of former Islamic leader Ali Belhadj , was killed Monday as he was heading for the capital Algiers with a small group of Islamic extremists and that they were plotting a bomb attack . Belhadj , born in 1988 , joined Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -LRB- AQIM -RRB- in 2006 and took the battle name of `` Mouawia , '' in tribute to one of the companions of the Prophet Mohammad . Belhadj s father had been deputy leader of the Islamic Salvation Front -LRB- FIS -RRB- , whose armed wing tried to overthrow the government in a bloody civil war from 1992 to the early 2000s . Iraq -- as US leaves , Iran steps in American influence within Iraq is on the wane . U.S. officials believe the Iranian government is trying to fill the void , stepping up both its commercial dealings with Iraq s government the two countries , along with Syria , signed a $ 10 billion natural-gas pipeline deal earlier this week and its covert support to the armed militias inflicting casualties on the departing U.S. troops . `` Their intent is to bleed U.S. forces on the way out of Iraq for some sort of moral victory , as well as to reestablish coercive control over Iraqi governors in the south by showing off their capacity to carry out these kinds of sophisticated attacks , '' said Mike Oates , a recently-retired , three-star Army general and former commander of all U.S. forces in southern Iraq . `` They re trying to prick us as we leave . '' U.S. military officials acknowledge that it will be difficult , if not impossible , to prevent Iranian-made weaponry from being smuggled into Iraq . US says Iran supporting al Qaeda The United States has accused Iran of providing sanctuary to an al Qaeda network that provides help to jihadists moving between the Middle East , Afghanistan and Pakistan . The U.S. Department of the Treasury Thursday announced the designation of six members of the network , including its alleged leader Ezedin Abdel Aziz Khalil , and described Iran as a `` critical transit point for funding to support al-Qaeda s activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan . '' `` This network serves as the core pipeline through which al-Qaeda moves money , facilitators and operatives from across the Middle East to South Asia , '' the U.S. Treasury said in a statement . Not so fast The recently departed director of the nation s main counterterrorism center said Thursday that Al Qaeda in Pakistan still posed a serious threat to the United States , and he warned that assessments that Al Qaeda was on the verge of collapse lacked `` accuracy and precision . '' The comments by the official , Michael E. Leiter , who stepped down three weeks ago as head of the National Counterterrorism Center , are the most significant pushback to a growing chorus of statements by American officials that the death of Osama bin Laden and years of Central Intelligence Agency drone strikes in Pakistan have brought the United States `` within reach of strategically defeating Al Qaeda , '' as Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta put it recently . Mr. Leiter said that Al Qaeda s leadership and structure in Pakistan were `` on the ropes , '' but he contended that `` the core organization is still there and could launch some attacks '' and that `` Pakistan remains a huge problem . '' He noted that the failed plot to blow up an explosives-packed vehicle in Times Square in May 2010 was carried out by a Pakistani-American trained by the Pakistani Taliban . The Qaeda affiliate in Yemen also remains especially dangerous , he added . Mr. Leiter also raised concerns that a decade of intensive paramilitary operations by the Central Intelligence Agency in Afghanistan , Pakistan , Somalia and Yemen had begun to change the nature of the spy service , and not necessarily all for the better . `` The question has to be asked : Has that in some ways diminished some of its strategic , long-term intelligence collection and analysis mission ? '' he said , citing the potential impact on traditional espionage and analysis of longer-range issues like China and counterproliferation . The infamous Norwegian gunner planned to carry out more attacks on the same day , his lawyer has said Friday . `` Breivik planned to carry out a few more attacks on July 22 , on a slightly different scale . However , something happened , about which I can t yet speak , and his plans didn t come to anything , '' Geir Lippestad told Norway s Aftenposten newspaper . Anders Breivik is accused of killing over 70 people in Norway in two terror attacks last Friday . Breivik has confessed to both crimes . He is due to be interrogated for the second time by police today . Ahead of yesterday s emergency counterterrorism meeting , EU Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom spoke of a `` huge lack of political leadership in allowing right-wing sentiment to bleed into the mainstream . `` Blaming Islam or immigration for all sorts of problems has become normal , Malmstrom told the European Voice newspaper . She cited a `` permissive climate in which such views `` are no longer seen as extreme . German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said Germany s intelligence agencies had far-right groups under `` intensive surveillance , but there was a greater risk in extremists like Breivik who operate alone and under the radar . `` Among the right extremists , we know of some who could be dangerous , but they re not the problem -- those who we have an eye on -- but rather those who radicalize in secret , he told the Rheinische Post . Fort Hood case : Abdo had jihadist bomb recipe An AWOL Muslim American Army private arrested near Fort Hood has told investigators that he wanted to attack fellow soldiers at the military post , the police chief in Killeen , Texas , said Thursday . `` Military personnel were a target of this suspect , '' Chief Dennis Baldwin told reporters about Pfc. Naser Jason Abdo , who is expected to face federal charges . Baldwin said Abdo , who was arrested Wednesday , had no accomplices , `` as far as I know . '' He added , `` We are not aware of any additional threats to the safety of our community . '' New York Times adds : A U.S. soldier who was accused Thursday of planning to attack troops near Fort Hood , Tex. , has told investigators that he was acting in support of Maj. Nidal M. Hasan , the Army psychiatrist who has been charged in the killing of 13 people at the base in 2009 , according to congressional and federal officials . Pfc. Naser Abdo , 21 , was arrested in Killeen , Tex. , after authorities said they discovered bombmaking materials in his motel room , as well as a copy of an article from the al-Qaeda magazine Inspire , which is produced by the terrorist group s Yemen affiliate . The officials said Abdo was planning to set off bombs at locations outside the base where soldiers gather and to follow the explosions with gunfire . `` I would classify this as a terror plot , '' Police Chief Dennis Baldwin told reporters in Killeen . Law enforcement officials said Abdo would be charged in federal court with possession of bombmaking materials , among other offenses . \\* CNN 's Randi Kaye interviewed Greg Ebert , a former police officer working at the Killeen , Texas gun store where Pfc Naser Jason Abdo went to buy supplies . Here is some of what Ebert told CNN 's Newsroom : `` He came to the store to purchase a quantity of smokeless gunpowder and did not seem to know what it was . It was just really odd , his behavior . '' `` He selected six canisters of smokeless gunpowder , placed them on the counter and then asked the manager `` well , what is smokeless powder ? '' If you do n't know what it is , why in the world would you buy that much ? '' Budget cuts and the US Navy From Politico : A large budget cut will force a change in U.S. naval strategy , Adm. Chief of Naval Ops Jonathan Greenert told SASC at his confirmation hearing Thursday , echoing his comments earlier this week to a HASC subcommittee . `` Our options are limited . We ca n't hollow the force . ... We ca n't go to our personnel . Our Navy has n't changed much since 2008 in force - in our manning level , in our manning plan . If we reduce force structure , that would exacerbate the problem we already have . And if we reduce modernization , that is , go to the ship building and aircraft accounts , I 'm concerned about the industrial base . So we have sort of a conundrum here . And I believe that this needs to be a strategic approach to such a large reduction , '' he said .

Five year-old Malaak Al-Shami arrived in the U.S. on Thursday evening to get fitted with a prosthetic leg after suffering injuries in Libya 's raging civil war . She landed at New York 's John F. Kennedy International Airport from Germany , the last part in a journey arranged by the Global Medical Relief Fund , a U.S. nonprofit . The group aids children who have lost the use of , or are missing , limbs or eyes . It says it is funded almost exclusively by donations . Malaak and her parents are being housed temporarily at The Ronald McDonald House of Long Island , which shelters families with sick children undergoing treatment at area hospitals . `` All the kids that come here , they 're bewildered , reluctant ; and once they 're here , they open up , '' said Elissa Mantonti , founder of the nonprofit . Malaak , who arrived in a wheelchair , initially appeared to be tired , but she quickly perked up when the other children housed in the facility came out to greet her . She got off her wheelchair and started exploring a toy room and play space with the other children . She quickly befriended three Iraqi boys who , like her , speak Arabic . They , too , were brought to the U.S. by the nonprofit . They suffered their injuries in Iraq 's continuing violence , according to Mantonti . Malaak 's rebel-controlled neighborhood in the western Libyan city of Misrata was attacked by pro-government forces on May 13 . A Grad rocket , which looks like an overgrown bullet about 9 feet long and 15 inches around , slammed into her bedroom wall and exploded , causing a gaping hole . Her 3-year-old brother and 1-year-old sister died in the attack . Malaak 's right leg was severed below the knee in the attack . According to Mantonti , her organization helped arrange for the family to be ferried by boat from Misrata , which is still under siege from pro-government forces despite recent rebel advances . From there , the family boarded a flight to Frankfurt , Germany , and continued onward to New York . The girl 's father expressed a mixture of hope and sadness upon his arrival in the U.S. `` I feel joy that my daughter will get treatment for her leg , '' Mustafa Al-Shami said . `` At the same time , I feel grief for the loss of my two other children . And , even though I feel that Malaak may never be the same after the attack , I 'm so happy that she will be able to walk and run again one day . '' She is scheduled for an initial fitting for a prosthetic leg at Shriners Hospitals in Philadelphia , with the fitting process taking up to seven weeks , Mantonti said . The family plans to return to Libya once the treatment is complete .

Where does this leave the rebels in the fight for Libya ? Republican Leader John Boehner delays a vote on his proposal to fix the U.S. debt crisis . Will lawmakers vote on his plan today ? And one year after devastating floods hit much of Pakistan , many of the victims are still waiting for help . Mystery surrounds the death of this man , General Abdul Fatah Younis . Now , he commanded Libya 's rebel army , and officials say that he was killed , along with two of his senior officers . But we do not know exactly where he was killed or , more importantly , who was behind his death . Now , the chairman of the Transitional National Council made this announcement . MUSTAFA ABDUL JALIL , CHAIRMAN , LIBYAN TRANSITIONAL NATIONAL COUNCIL -LRB- through translator -RRB- : In deep sadness , we announce the death of General Abdul Fatah Younis , the chief general of the Libyan army , and his two companions , Colonel Mohammed Khamis and Lieutenant Colonel Nasir al - Madhkur . STOUT : Younis had been summoned back to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi to face questions about military matters , and reports say he has alleged ongoing ties to Moammar Gadhafi . You may recall that Younis defected from the Libyan leader 's government back in February . He held the post of interior minister and was considered Colonel Gadhafi 's second in command before his defection . Now , Younis ' death leaves the rebel army without a leader as the opposition claims advances in the west . Ivan Watson joins us live from the Libyan capital of Tripoli . And Ivan , is there any more information about the circumstances of his death ? IVAN WATSON , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : No. . This assassination really raises the specter of the possibility of infighting among rebel ranks , the possibility of a power vacuum within the rebel military command , and a lot of questions about just how this general was killed . According to the leader of the Transitional National Council , in a very short press conference that he gave last night in the rebel capital of Benghazi , he said that Abdul Fatah Younis had been summoned to Benghazi from the front line around the oil report of Brega and that the assassination occurred somewhere along the way . What was even stranger was he went on to say that they were trying to find Younis ' body , as well as the attackers who carried out this alleged assassination . There had been a lot of rumors , Kristie , at the time that he was being brought under arrest by the rebel council , and we know that he had engaged in power struggles with another rival rebel commander in the five months that this civil war has been taking place . There was some gunfire from Younis ' supporters last night after the press conference announcing Younis ' death took place , gunfire outside the hotel where the announcement was made . We 've been monitoring Libya Alhurra television , pro-rebel TV , which has been showing a live picture from Benghazi of Friday prayers and some speeches by supporters of Younis who have been vowing vengeance and also pledging support to the Transitional National Council . Here in Tripoli , officials have been quite thus far , have not offered any official reaction to the death of a former comrade in arms of Moammar Gadhafi who defected early on to the rebel side . We 're waiting for some kind of reaction from the Gadhafi regime to this very important development -- Kristie . STOUT : And Ivan , what is the state of play on the battlefield ? And what will be the impact of Younis ' death on the rebels ' ability to fight this civil war ? WATSON : Still trying to figure that out . It 's important to note that the ground war is being fought on three fronts -- in the east , around that oil port of Brega ; in the central port of Misrata , which is held by the rebels ; and in the west , along the Tunisian border , where the rebels report they 've made some gains in the last 24 hours . Tripoli was being bombed by NATO warplanes last night within hours of the announcement of Abdul Fatah Younis ' death , and there has been an increase in the amount of NATO bomb attacks here in the Libyan capital in recent days . Some of that footage we can show you . Sometimes the strikes are quite close and pretty frightening here . But this was described by the U.S. ' top military commander as a stalemate just a few days ago . It will be very interesting to see whether this could be a game-changer in this grinding and bloody five-month conflict , the loss of the main rebel commander -- Kristie . STOUT : Ivan Watson , joining us live from Tripoli . And while Libya 's rebels have struggled on the battlefield , they are making significant political progress . Now , the countries in red on this map , these are the countries that recognize the Transitional National Council as Libya 's legitimate government . Now , as you 'll recall , on Wednesday the United Kingdom expelled Colonel Gadhafi 's diplomats and turned the embassy over to the opposition group . That comes less than two weeks after the U.S. officially recognized the rebel government . In Egypt , a demonstration for national unity is being dominated by Islamic groups . Cairo 's Tahrir Square is packed with protesters . Some are political activists who have been camping there for weeks . They say that they are keeping pressure on the country 's military rulers to implement promised reforms . In Syria , a number of people are also expected to take to the streets after prayers . Now , let 's bring it up for you . This is a live Web stream . It comes from the city of Hama . Now , protesters are trying to topple the regime of President Bashar al - Assad . If we can bring that webcam for you -- we 'll bring it to you a little bit later on the program . Now , meanwhile , our Arwa Damon , she says the slogan for today 's rally is `` Your Silence is Deadly . '' That is a criticism of the international community for not taking what they consider sufficient action against President al-Assad . Meanwhile , in the United States , members of the House of Representatives could vote later today on Speaker John Boehner 's bill to raise the U.S. debt ceiling . And if that sounds familiar , it 's because they were meant to vote on the measure on Thursday , but the vote was postponed late in the evening after Boehner failed to rally enough support from within his own party . He has been struggling to come up with a plan that meets demands of the party 's more conservative Tea Party wing . REP. JOHN BOEHNER -LRB- R-OH -RRB- , SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE : The bill 's not perfect . I 've never said it was perfect , nobody in my caucus believes it 's perfect . But what this bill reflects is a sincere , honest effort to end this crisis in a bipartisan way , to send it to the Senate , where it can receive action . STOUT : Now , Democrats in the Senate say that they will vote down Boehner 's plan if it does eventually pass in the House . Both sides are holding caucus meetings on Friday to work out the next step . And meanwhile , the clock continues to click toward the big August the 2nd deadline . And without a plan to raise the U.S. debt ceiling by then , the U.S. could face it 's first-ever default . Now , it is something that would not only negatively impact the U.S. economy , but financial institutions around the world . So , does the White House have a backup plan if lawmakers do n't get their act together ? Mary Snow joins us now from CNN New York with more -- Mary . MARY SNOW , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Well , Kristie , the president in this case is legally limited . One constitutional expert at Yale Law School looked at the scenarios where the president could bypass Congress if Congress does n't reach a deal . And this expert took a look at the question of , could the government just print more money ? The answer is , not unless it came in the form of coins . BOEHNER : It 's a zip-a-dee-doo-dah day . SNOW -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : And just days until the government can no longer borrow money . If Congress does n't reach an agreement in time , could there be a Plan B for President Obama to act on his own and raise money ? Fitting under the category of desperate times calling for desperate measures , there is actually some talk of issuing two $ 1 trillion coins . Constitutional law expert Jack Balkin says there is a statutory limit on the amount of paper currency that can be in circulation , but not on coins . It 's an idea he calls science fiction . JACK BALKIN , YALE LAW SCHOOL : I think what it underscores is that people are now trying to investigate different ways of resolving an artificially created financial crisis , fiscal crisis . And I think the problem is that these solutions have been offered precisely because the situation we have been put in is so absurd . SNOW : A potential option for the president that has been taken more seriously is the idea of him invoking a clause in the 14th Amendment where he would raise the debt ceiling without congressional authorization . But the president himself has indicated that is not on the table . BARACK OBAMA , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : I have talked to my lawyers . They do not -- they do not -- they are not persuaded that that is a winning argument . SNOW : One way for the government to raise money is to sell assets . Gold now at record highs is one of those assets . But -- JAY POWELL , BIPARTISAN POLICY CENTER : There is no likelihood of that at all . If the United States government were to announce that it was going to sell some gold to pay its bills , one can only imagine what would happen to the price of gold . You would want to be out of the way of that collapsing price . SNOW : Jay Powell was undersecretary at the Treasury Department under President George H.W. Bush . He has been briefing members of Congress , saying he 's been separating fact from fiction , even getting asked if the government can issue IOUs . POWELL : If the debt ceiling is not increased , if no deal is made , then people need to understand there 's no secret bag of tricks , there 's no magic bullet that will allow us to avoid defaulting on our non-debt-related payments . SNOW : Bottom line , Jay Powell says , is there 's nothing really the executive branch can practically do in the absence of a deal -- Kristie . And for more on the political ramifications of the debt crisis , CNN senior political analyst David Gergen joins us now from CNN London . And David , this has become a huge test for the Speaker of the House . Now , why is it that House Speaker John Boehner was not able to get support from his own party , and what is at stake for him ? DAVID GERGEN , CNN SR. . POLITICAL ANALYST : Well , there 's a great deal more at stake for the country and for the world , of course , but this is a crisis for John Boehner . If he can not win this vote , he may well lose his speakership over time . I think it 's important to keep in mind that his problem is he has 240 members . There are no Democrats willing to vote for his plan . And he can only lose about 23 . But see that in context . That means he has about 90 percent of his caucus with him . He has 90 percent of Republicans in the House with him . There 's another 10 percent that 's holding out , and they want deeper cuts . They want something more significant . They 're the mostly Tea Party types who were elected with an avalanche of criticism of Washington coming from the grassroots of America . And it 's been hard for him to corral . But right now they are in danger if -- I think they have to vote today . I think we 've entered a crucial 24-hour period , and I think they will -- it will have to come up or come down today , because we do n't have time now . We 're down to the final strokes . STOUT : That 's right . We only have four days left . Now , I want to ask you about the overall political tone of this debate . In the U.S. , the debt limit has been raised dozens of times in recent years , but without the extreme partisan bickering that we 've been seeing in recent weeks . So why is the climate so different this time around ? GERGEN : Well , I think the debt ceiling offered a tool , if you would , that Republicans could latch on to , to bring home and force reductions in spending . This fight has been brewing for a long , long time , and the United States is deeply polarized about the size and shape of government . How big should government be ? How much should the federal government spend ? I mean , the Republicans basically want government to spend about 18 percent of GDP on its activities , whereas Democrats say no , we 'd like it around 23 or so . That may sound small , the difference between 18 and 23 , but when you translate it into dollars , it 's actually huge . It 's about $ 700 billion a year and a difference and a vision of what the government ought to do . So , that 's part of the fight . And there 's also , frankly , a growing fear in the country that we 've allowed the national debt to grow so rapidly , that it really could lead to the decline of America -- a reduction in growth , and in fact would impact the world . There 's a serious study that has been well accepted now across the world by two economists named Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart . They 're world class economists who have studied 800 years of financial crises , and one of their main conclusions is that a country which allows its debt , its public debt to grow to more than 90 percent of its gross national product , its GDP , is a country that 's in trouble , and we 'll see its growth rate decline and may stumble into a lost decade , as Japan did . Well , the United States , if you add federal debt to state and local , it 's past 90 percent now . And so there 's a real fear of the direction we 're moving . And responsible people on both sides of the aisle want to get the debt down . The differences are on how you do it , whether you cut government a lot or whether you raise taxes and cut government some . And those are pretty fundamental differences . STOUT : Yes , it 's a clash of two fundamentally different philosophies . The last question for you , David Gergen , you have been an adviser to numerous U.S. presidents . I wanted to get your thoughts on President Obama 's leadership and his handling of the debt crisis so far . GERGEN : Let me be very clear that all sides in this conflict have their fingerprints all over and bear responsible for this disaster . I mean , this is an embarrassment , for the United States to be in this position . It 's telling the world our political system does n't work very well and so forth , and certainly there are a lot of people very deeply concerned in the financial community . Does the president bear some responsibility ? Has his leadership been all that it should have been ? Much earlier in the game , where there was something called the Bowles - Simpson Commission that reported and had a pathway to a $ 4 trillion reduction in our deficits over the next 10 years , had Republican support within the commission , had the president seized that report back in December of last year and it pushed it with that kind of bipartisanship that went into the report , I think he would have secured an agreement a lot faster , and a much bigger agreement . Were there other moments along the way ? If Lyndon Johnson were in the White House right now he 'd be bringing people in , he 'd be knocking heads together , he 'd be corralling people . He 'd be exploiting their weaknesses , making tradeoffs , and you 'd probably get a deal . Barack Obama is a more cerebral individual . He has many , many strengths . Leading the Congress and corralling people in Congress is not one of his strengths . Now , the U.S. debt problem has led to one curious statistic I 'd like to share with you . Now , take a look at this . At the end of Wednesday , July the 27th , the U.S. Treasury had a closing balance of just under $ 74 billion . But according to Apple 's most recent earnings statement -- check it out -- Apple has over $ 76 billion in cash and marketable securities , meaning the U.S. Treasury has less cash on hand than the maker of the iPhone . Now , Spain 's prime minister has set a date for a general election four months earlier than planned . Jose Luis Zapatero says Spain will go to the polls on November the 20th , and that will allow a new government to be in power by the end of the year to help restore financial stability there . Ahead on NEWS STREAM , the crisis in Somalia . U.N. aid arrives , but then the violence picks up . We 'll get the latest on the situation there through the eyes of a refugee doctor . Plus , it has been one year since massive flooding ravaged parts of Pakistan . We 'll see how they 're coping now . And as Norway continues to mourn the massacre one week ago today , police there are meeting again with the man who has admitted he is responsible . Now , many Somali families have fled the famine gripping the country . Some have walked hundreds of kilometers with limited food and water in the hopes of receiving safe assistance . ITV 's Martin Geissler brings us the latest on their plight and looks at the staff working for their welfare . MARTIN GEISSLER , ITV NEWS -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : This is the front line in the fight against Somalia 's famine . With basic facilities and equipment , the staff at Hagadera do extraordinary work . With each new day , John Kiogora and his team of medics know they 'll face crises in this intensive care ward . They 've seen it all here many , many times . And first thing this morning , they saw it again . DR. JOHN KIOGORA , INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE : Very sick , you see . The child is severely malnourished . GEISSLER : Abdi Rahman -LRB- ph -RRB- is 1 year old and unconscious . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : What are your chances of saving a child like this ? KIOGORA : Fifty-fifty now . We 've seen a child like this and you just want to do your best . GEISSLER : Every minute is crucial at this stage . The team give Abdi Rahman -LRB- ph -RRB- a glucose boost . Fluids now are his only chance . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : So there 's still some reason to hope ? KIOGORA : Yes , there 's some hope still . We have n't given up . You ca n't give up , yes . GEISSLER -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Fifteen minutes were all it took for this dramatic change . KIOGORA : The child is coming up , huh ? GEISSLER : Hooked up to a drip , the baby has been revived . So that 's the most I keep saying , because the child -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . He was actually dying -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . GEISSLER : Lunch for the staff in this field hospital is quick and simple . Then the afternoon roams -LRB- ph -RRB- . Seven-month-old Minaj -LRB- ph -RRB- , so ill at the start of this week , is improving , as is Abdi -LRB- ph -RRB- . On the critical list for days , he 's now eating solid food . The work does n't pay well , but there are priceless rewards . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : Being a doctor though , as a human being , that 's just a magical moment . It 's very good . It 's something very -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- to me . GEISSLER -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Thirty years old , from a small town in the Kenyan highlands , John has learned fast he does n't just save lives , he brings them into the world , too . He delivered this baby yesterday across the compound in Hagadera 's maternity unit . Up to 80 children are born here each week . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : Dadaab is a hard place to start your life , is n't it ? KIOGORA : It is difficult . It 's a hard -LRB- ph -RRB- place , but this is the best for famine , because -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- , and they get the care that you can give them . GEISSLER -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : This evening , in the intensive care ward , Abdi Rahman -LRB- ph -RRB- is receiving that care . But his chances are still 50-50 . John and his team ca n't save everyone . The ward loses a couple of children most weeks . KIOGORA : I 've done my best to -- I mean , ca n't change the nature . I can only save the doomed and -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- as far as medicine is concerned . GEISSLER : Another long day over , there 's a chance to reflect and prepare for whatever tomorrow might bring . STOUT : Martin Geissler reporting there . Now , the site , it has a wealth of information on how you can help , including links to reputable aid agencies working there in the region . Now , ahead on NEWS STREAM , the waters may have receded , but a lot of the damage still remains . We 'll see how Pakistan is coping one year on from its record flooding . STOUT : I 'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong . You 're watching News Stream . And these are your world headlines . Now U.S. lawmakers are still in gridlock over the government 's debt ceiling . Republican John Boehner , the U.S. House Speaker , had to scrap plans for a vote on his deficit cutting bill on Thursday . Not enough members of his own party supported it . Republicans may try again today . But even if the House passes the bill , Democrats who have the majority in the Senate have vowed to block it . Now Libya 's rebels have lost their army chief . General Abdul Fattah Younis was killed along with two officers . The circumstances of their death remain unclear . General Younis was Libya 's former Interior minister and Moammar Gadhafi 's second in command before switching sides in February . A woman who worked on the campaign with the no defunct News of the World after her daughter was murdered has learned that her phone may have been hacked . As Sarah Payne previously defended the newspaper . In its final addition she wrote that it was a force for good . And the only surviving gunman from the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai is challenging his death sentence . More than 160 people died in the three day coordinated attack . India 's supreme court says Mohammed Ajmal Kasab 's appeal was sent by authorities from the Mumbai jail where he is being held . And no date has been set for a hearing . Now police in Norway plan to interview this man , Ander Behring Breivik today for a second time . They say that investigators have gained new information since the last time they spoke to him . Now that was one day after last Friday 's terror attacks . Breivik has confessed to carrying out the shootings on Utoya Island as well as the bombing in Oslo . And he is currently in solitary confinement in a prison near Oslo . Now it is one week to the day since Breivik 's rampage left at least 76 people dead . And on this day a memorial service in central Oslo . The youth movement of the ruling Labor Party organized the event . And members were holding a summer camp on Utoya Island when Breivik began shooting them . Now the pictures you are watching were filmed at the service just a short time ago . In South Korea , rescue efforts go on , but the deluge just wo n't stop . The heaviest rains in a century have killed more than 50 people . Now outside Seoul people in five neighborhoods have been told to evacuate their homes . And most of those who died were overwhelmed by mudslides triggered by the rain . Now the country faces a daunting clean-up operation . Paula Hancocks has more . PAULA HANCOCKS , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : A huge amount has changed here in Seoul in just the last 24 hours . The sun is now shining , the weather has improved dramatically . And I brought you here to one of the inner city streams to show you just how radically the water levels have receded . On Thursday I would n't be able to stand on this bridge . There was a ferocious torrent of water that was coming down here . The paths on both sides were completely covered and the water levels were several feet higher . We 've also had confirmation this Friday of just how historic these floods were . Korea 's Meteorological Administration says that the past three days broke all records , 536 millimeters of rain fell , that 's more than 21 inches . And also Wednesday was the heaviest daily rainfall in July since records began . Now as well as the search and rescue operation , you are also seeing now the clean up operation . Volunteers are helping , the police , the military , civil service . There 's 34,000 people working on the clean up operation nationwide , 11,000 in Seoul alone . Politicians as well are also postponing their meetings so that they can be seen to be about and to be helping with the effort . One concern at an artillery unit on Mount Umyon . The Defense Ministry tells us at least 10 landmines are yet to be retrieved around this military base due to these landslides . But the administration also insists that concrete blocks have been set up to make sure that they ca n't fly down the mountain into the civilian areas . It is not just south Korea that has been affected , it is the entire Korean Peninsula . North Korea 's state media says that these storms have caused severe damage across the country . The state run television , KRT , is showing video of flooded areas , of damaged crops , and also a collapsed bridge in the southern Hwanghae Province just north of the border with South Korea . 522 millimeters , or 20 inches of rain fell in 12 hours , according to KRT . We do n't yet have word on any possible casualties from North Korea . And it 's possible we wo n't hear word of possible casualties . Now the worst is certainly over for the Korean peninsula . The weather has been punishing over the past few days . And the intensity of these rains have surprised everybody . STOUT : Now one year ago a slow motion tsunami swept over Pakistan . That is how the United Nations chief described the devastating floods that covered nearly one-fifth of the country . And let 's show you how that looks over Europe . Now those waters killed 2,000 people and destroyed 1.6 million homes , a huge affected area . Now many people in Pakistan still are in dire need of help , but as Reza Sayah shows us , it is yet to arrive . REZA SAYAH , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Here in Pakistan you find poverty in a lot of places , but where we are right now this is probably the depths of poverty . In villages like Kut Almo -LRB- ph -RRB- in southern Sindh Province , the right kind of help never reaches children like Shulkit Ali -LRB- ph -RRB- , a 5 year old boy with symptoms of liver disease . But when Pakistan 's monster floods devastated the settlement one year ago , people here hoped the disaster would shed light on the wretched conditions they have suffered for years . They hoped help would finally come . But as a visit to Kut Almo -LRB- ph -RRB- makes clear , help has not come . Nothing for the past year . We 've had nothing , '' says Shulkit 's -LRB- ph -RRB- mother Sabbab Bajaj -LRB- ph -RRB- . The 2010 floods left one-fifth of Pakistan under water , an area roughly the size of Italy . Residence of Kut Almo -LRB- ph -RRB- were among the thousands rescued and taken to refugee camps where they waited for months for the floods to recede . Eventually they came back . Villagers here say over the past year at most three or four times aid workers have stopped by here , dropped off some building material and relief goods , but today they 're still going without some of the most basic needs to survive . `` What has the government given us ? '' Says Khatim Shah -LRB- ph -RRB- . `` They just gave us a little something to eat , but it 's gone . They have given us nothing . '' Many of the homes remain demolished here . Most of the water pumps still do n't work . There 's about 120 kids in this village and none of them go to school . And here 's why . This used to be their school and look at it . Destroyed by the flood waters a year ago , you can see some flood debris . This is Khatim Ali -LRB- ph -RRB- . That 's the flood line . He 's pointing to the flood line up there probably about 15 feet high . Most men here are farmers . The floods wiped away their land . Today many still do n't have jobs . Everywhere you look in this village there are signs of disease with no sign of medical help in a region with a history of neglect . A $ 20 vaccine would have probably saved Ishbak -LRB- ph -RRB- from polio when he was a baby , but today he 's a cripple living in this flood ravaged village . One year after Pakistan 's floods , aid groups say hundreds of thousands are still homeless . The UN 's appeal for $ 2 billion is not even three - quarters of a way to its goal . Shulkit Ali 's -LRB- ph -RRB- family hope the floods would showcase his medical condition for the world , but that has n't happened . With the media attention all but gone , his family asks if not now then when . Reza Sayah , CNN , Southern Sindh , Pakistan . STOUT : Let 's keep our focus on Pakistan and how that slow motion tsunami struck the country one year ago today . Our Mari Ramos is at the World Weather Center . She joins us now -- Mari . MARI RAMOS , CNN WEATHER CORRESPONDENT : Kristie , those images that Reza was showing us is really amazing . And I remember a year ago when we were covering this story how surprised we were to see all of that rain and how it just kept going and going and it would n't stop . Now you know that 's what we saw right now with South Korea , with Seoul , with all of that historic rainfall . Well , that 's kind of what happened in Pakistan , except the topography is different . And the rain did n't stop in Pakistan . Let me go ahead and show you first of all this image . Can -- oh , I guess you ca n't see it , I 'm sorry . Well , let 's go ahead and -- let me go ahead and show you kind of -- a little bit of an explainer of what actually happened here . First of all , the rainfall that happened on July 29 and 30 , that 's when we say that it started around this time . They had in 24 hours more than 270 millimeters of rain . Compare that to their monthly average right here . When they had all of this rain across this northern portion here of Pakistan . And then , it just continued to rain over the next few days , an all-time -- new all-time record was made around that time . 70 percent above average rainfall in July , 104 percent above average as we headed into August . So this kind of kept going . When all of that water came along it came down from the mountains , it flooded the Indus River . It flooded the tributaries . And all of that happened very , very slowly . Areas continue to flood . Some areas dams failed and then you had flooding in areas that had never flooded before . And that crest continued to travel farther and farther to the south very , very slowly . I remember talking about that flood crest a week and two weeks and three weeks and four weeks after the flood still had not reached the sea , which was incredible . And then it took months for that water to continue going down . Right now at least over the last two weeks we 've had a little bit of above average rainfall across northern Pakistan . Below average rainfall in areas to the south . The southwest monsoon is in full swing right now . This is the rainy season again that we 're dealing with here . The heaviest rain has actually been across parts of India . In some cases over 200 millimeters of rain in areas particularly in the north . But , you know what , this is what we would expect . We have n't seen extreme amounts of rain like we did last year and certainly not in Pakistan . We 've had some bursts of some very heavy rain across portions of India , but overall the monsoon is right around where it should be for this time of year . Let 's go ahead and take a look at your forecast now . And talk about the differences from one country , from one area to the other . Paula Hancocks was just showing us from Seoul how the water had pretty much left the river and areas that she could n't be standing a couple of days ago are generally dry now , because of the topography there in Seoul , that water drained very quickly into the ocean . In Pakistan , it took months for that to happen . There you see the satellite image right now for the Korean peninsula . Much dryer now than it was just a few days ago . Some scattered rain showers expected . Some pop up thunderstorms on and off . Not out of the question over the next few days , probably a better chance as we head into late Sunday and into Monday , but we 're not expecting anything like what we saw in the last few days . So a little bit of good news there , Kristie . And finally , I do want to update you on Tropical Storm Nock-Ten . This is the one that moved first into the Philippines , then into the South China Sea . It 's one that gave you the typhoon 3 signal in Hong Kong for a little while yesterday . That signal is down . The storm actually made landfall in Hynan . And it is now moving into Vietnam . A lot of rainfall associated with this weather system . It should continue to weaken as it moves inland . I am concerned about the rain , though . We 'll watch it through the weekend here on CNN . STOUT : All right . Thank you and take care . And ahead here on News Stream , discovering the truth . Now secrets that were submerged underwater are now finally coming to light . We 'll have the latest on the investigation into the crash of Air France flight 447 . Now this is a 3D sketch up of the Air Fracen jet that tragically went down during a flight from Rio to Paris two years ago killing all 228 people on board . Now the details surrounding Air France flight 447 , including the cause of the crash , were largely a mystery until recently . Now just this past May , the French authority BEA recovered the plane 's flight recorders from the bottom of the Ocean . It has helped shape BEA 's third report that has just been released . Now Jim Bittermann joins us now live from Paris with more details . And Jim , walk us through the latest findings . JIM BITTERMANN , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well , basically this was the third but not the final report . The final report is expected at the end of the year . And basically with each one of these interim reports we 're finding out a little bit more about what happened in the final seconds of that ill fated flight . In this report , I think we 're beginning to see more and more fingers pointed at the crew . Basically the report said that the crew had had no training for this kind of high altitude stall that they faced . It also points out , however , that there were a lot of things happening at once . Some false indications coming in from the various parts of the aircraft equipment -- a stall warning horn going on and coming off and giving a bad indication of whether the plane had actually stalled . So pilots groups here , victims associations , and Air France are pushing back at the idea that the crew may have been to blame . In fact Air France said right after this report was issued a couple of hours ago , they said there 's no reason at this stage to question the crews technical skills . So as the Transport minister here said this morning , while these reports are giving more and more details of what happened , the actual blame for this crash , and of course there are million perhaps hundreds of millions of euros and dollars resting on the outcome in terms of the lawsuits involved , that the adjudication of any blame is going to wait for the courts . So basically these reports are interesting reading . They 're giving some indication . But like I said , a final report is due at the end of this year -- Kristie . STOUT : Now this is the third in four reports . What is the bottom line here , Jim . After going through all these reports , could the tragedy of Air France flight 447 been avoided if the pilots were better trained ? BITTERMANN : Well , that 's a good question . Well , the fact is they were getting a lot of contradictory information in a very short period of time . So they had to interpret the data that was coming into them . Now if they had interpreted correctly , and there had been other times when this kind of air speed indicator problem had cropped up , the other times when the crews had successfully managed the situation . They did n't in this case . And of course that will be the argument that 's at the crux of any kind of a court case . It certainly is the argument right now , because basically when blame is finally affixed , either by the accident investigators or by the courts as the Transport minister suggested -- when blame is affixed , then of course if it 's going to be Air Bus , the makers of the aircraft , or Air France who were providing the pilots and training the pilots , those are going to be libel for a lot of damages . So there 's going to be a lot of argument over exactly that point . Could it have been avoided ? It could have been avoided , of course , if the equipment had n't failed . It could have been avoided if the crew had performed better . But one way or the other , those are going to be the arguments that are going to come out in court -- Kristie . STOUT : All right . Jim Bittermann joining us live from Paris . And now to the latest twist in a scandal that has reached the highest levels of the UK . Now a mother who worked on a campaign with the now defunct News of the World tabloid after her daughter 's murder now says that her phone was hacked . Now senior international correspondent Dan Rivers is following the story in London . DAN RIVERS , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : The official inquiry into phone hacking has been started by Lord Justice Brian Levenson in the building behind me . But only a few hours after he set out the sort of mechanics of how that long inquiry were run , there was another shocking allegation in the phone hacking scandal , the suggestion that Sarah Payne , the mother of the murdered 8 year old Sarah Payne , had her phone targeted by the News of the World . Now this is especially shocking , because Sarah Payne worked closely with the News of the World to campaign for greater information about pedophiles living in different areas and campaigned for the introduction of the so-called Sarah 's Law to give parents the right to know if a pedophile was living in their area . Indeed , she even wrote an article in the last addition of the News of the World saying News of the World proved that it is a force for good . In light of this suggestion that her phone may have been targeted by an investigator working for the paper , Sarah Payne 's agent put out a statement saying that she was devastated by the news . It went on , `` we are all deeply disappointed and are just working to get her through it . '' Rebekah Brooks , the former editor of the paper at the time , and the former chief executive of News International also put out a statement saying these allegations are abhorrent and particularly upsetting as Sarah Payne is a dear friend . The idea of her being targeted is beyond my comprehension . It 's an issue that Lord Justice Brian Leveson will no doubt look at as well as the wider issue of the ethics in journalism in the UK . And also allegations of a cozy and almost corrupt relationship between certain journalists and the police . STOUT : The story that does n't seem to end . You 're watching News Stream live on CNN . We 'll be back right after this . Now over the years people have been finding the face of Jesus in many objects , but now we are hearing about some divine vines . Jeanne Moos takes a closer look at the holy foliage . JEANNE MOOS , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Do you see just overgrown vines on a telephone pole or does this look the big operator in the sky ? MOOS : Now often these Jesus sightings require lots of imagination , whether it be Jesus on a moth , or Cheeto Jesus . MOOS : Even the famous Virgin Mary on a grilled cheese could arguably be Madonna . But this telephone pole in Middleton , Colorado strikes most people the same way . What do you see here ? MOOS : Folks pointed out what looks like a crown of thorns , the body 's positioning . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Oh , and then look at the legs . Like , you know it 's like -- yeah . He 's like that . MOOS : But while you might think a telephone pole Jesus is pretty unique . It turns out he 's not alone . Vine covered utility poles have been sprouting religious images for years all over the country . MOOS : From North Carolina to Louisiana . That looks put there by him . MOOS : This one in Lake Charles , Louisiana from last fall was said to be most striking when seen as you drove by . And while one local was quoted as saying you ca n't spray Jesus with Roundup , workers did cut down the vines . Officials were worried believers would climb the pole to touch the greenery then get an electrifying jolt . Now if you 're having trouble seeing Jesus on telephone poles , maybe what you need is the Jesus pan . It 's supposed to put the image of Jesus right on food . Advertising for the Jesus pan says imagine serving heavenly hot cakes at the next church breakfast . Of course , the image of Jesus was much clearer when an episode of Glee focused on the topic . MOOS : Finn did n't just make the sandwich , he prayed to it . MOOS : Ca n't say that about a phone pole that looks like a holy Chia pet . MOOS : But what is he saying . UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : He 's saying call your mother . STOUT : Now shares of Nintendo , they plunged around 20 percent on Friday . And that was its biggest fall in the last two decades .

Now unlike the Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 , the Wii did not offer the latest high definition graphics , but instead used that revolutionary controller that sensed your movements . But Wii sales have slowed , so Nintendo pinned their hopes on a new console , the 3DS . Now it is a handheld that can display 3D without the need for special glasses , but it has n't quite caught on with consumers . Now Nintendo has sold only 710,000 now forcing it to cut prices by 40 percent in Japan , over 30 percent in the U.S. Nintendo needs a boost and soon . So this is the company 's latest console .

Gen. Abdul Fattah Younis and two other rebels were killed after the country 's main rebel organization , the Transitional National Council , sought to question him about military matters and allegations that he or those close to him had ongoing ties to Gadhafi , Younis ' supporters said . Younis ' killing represents `` more proof that the transitional council of the traitors is not able to lead any sort of government or have any control of eastern cities of Libya , '' said Musa Ibrahim , the Gadhafi spokesman . Ibrahim accused two members of al Qaeda of having arrested Younis with the help of the Transitional National Council and subsequently charging Younis with treason for `` betraying the cause . '' But the abductors knew that a fair trial would have been lengthy and that Younis ' tribe would have intervened to help him , so they killed him , Ibrahim said . `` He was shot and his body was immediately disfigured , '' he added . The killing shows that `` al Qaeda is the real power among the rebels , '' he said , repeating Gadhafi 's assertion that rebel forces are allied with al Qaeda . `` They have the most soldiers ; they have the training ; they have the weapons ; they have the faith -- a wicked faith ; they have the strategies . '' The killing also sends a powerful message to other tribes : `` Try to exclude us from your settlement , your political settlement , and this is your fate , '' Ibrahim said . Younis was killed along with a colonel and a lieutenant colonel , the Transitional National Council said in a prepared statement . No further details were immediately released . Mohammad Ethish , a member of a rebel military council , released a statement that seemed to imply that Gadhafi loyalists had something to do with the death . `` This incident will increase the will and courage of the rebels , and it will even get us close together to reach the home of the tyrant , '' Ethish said . `` We promise our brothers in the East that we will do the impossible to avenge the death of Abdul Fattah Younis , and we promise that we will increase our blows and empower our will . Until we capture the tyrant Moammar Gadhafi . '' The deaths have provoked questions and stirred speculation that they might cause a rift among opposition leaders . `` We really do n't know what happened yet , '' said Marina Ottaway , senior associate of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace 's Middle East program . `` Politically , it 's a reminder of how tenuous a coalition it is . '' Rebels have been battling government troops in a fight to oust Gadhafi , who has ruled the North African nation for nearly 42 years . NATO has used air power to enforce a U.N. resolution protecting civilians from the regime , and world powers have announced their support for Libya 's rebel umbrella group . This week , the United Kingdom joined the United States and other Western powers in recognizing the TNC as the legitimate governing authority in Libya , a decision that could steer millions of dollars to the opposition . Younis had served as interior minister in Gadhafi 's government until February , when he defected to the Benghazi-based rebel movement . A onetime general in Gadhafi 's army , Younis told CNN in February that he switched sides after Gadhafi told him he planned to bomb Benghazi -- a move Younis said would have killed thousands . A young man in a tan uniform who spoke in Benghazi after Friday Muslim prayers said on rebel TV that Younis `` was assassinated by him like the other martyrs of Libya '' and called for `` revenge for everyone who took part in this crime . '' It was n't clear whom he was implicating in Younis ' death . The man said that `` knowing the truth of what happened to him and avenging his death is a debt every Libyan man and woman owes . My message to Mustafa Abdel Jalil is we will be with you on this path , '' the man said , referring to the leader of the rebels ' government . Alistair Burt , the British Foreign Office 's minister for the Middle East and North Africa , said , `` Exactly what happened remains unclear . '' He added that the `` killing will be thoroughly investigated . '' `` We agreed that it is important that those responsible are held to account through proper judicial processes . '' Sir Richard Dalton , a former British ambassador to Libya and associate fellow for the Middle East and North Africa Programme of the London-based Chatham House , said `` one scenario is revenge by Tripoli . '' However , Dalton said , the ultimate impact of the killing on the opposition movement will depend on the facts that emerge about the killing . `` They 've been promising it for a while , '' he said of the Gadhafi government . `` Right from the start , they 've threatened people who 've turned away . There are stories that AFY -LRB- Younis -RRB- had rebuffed approaches by Tripoli . '' There have been tensions between different parts of the opposition forces , Dalton said . So a `` second hypothesis '' is that a quarrel got `` out of hand . But he warned not to jump to conclusions about the significance of a `` single episode . '' `` We have n't got much to go on , '' he said . `` I think our governments will find out soon . '' Ottaway , the Carnegie Endowment scholar , said the killing raises questions about the rebel council . `` It 's clear there are divisions '' within the Transitional National Council , she said . `` There are suspicions of some of the people who went from being close allies -LRB- of Gadhafi -RRB- , as Younis was , to joining '' the rebels . The motives of those who switched sides have been questioned by people who were n't sure whether they had truly made the transition or were just pretending to have changed . There has been speculation , she said , that Younis might have been dealing somehow with Gadhafi . `` The main point perhaps is that the unity at the Transitional National Council is tenuous at best . This is a strange coalition at best , '' she said . `` They are very aware of the fact that they are not an organization that represents the entire country . '' As for how the killing might affect the rebels ' military effort , Ottaway said it 's not clear how much control Younis had . She pointed out that the killing occurred on the same day rebels embarked on an offensive in western Libya . The fighters said their forces captured five towns and surrounded a sixth in the plains below the Nafusa mountain range , which borders Tunisia . Mark Quarterman , a senior adviser and director of the Center for Strategic and InternationalStudies ' Program on Crisis , Conflict and Cooperation , said the `` potential implications '' of the death are `` very worrisome '' and could help the Gadhafi regime in the short run . The death has had the effect of `` roiling rebel politics , '' Quarterman said . The killing has fomented anger among members of Younis ' Obeidi tribe , according to news reports . Quarterman , an expert on the Libyan crisis , said the killing undermines the bet NATO powers have made that , by enforcing the U.N. resolution protecting Libyans , they would give rebels space to defeat Gadhafi forces . Quarterman noted that Younis had been engaged in a dispute with another rebel commander , Khalifa Hifter . `` They seem unable to take and hold territory . This makes things worse , '' Quarterman said . `` You ca n't have a lot of faith and confidence in forces saying , ` I 'm the commander , no I 'm the commander . ' `` If this disarray does continue , this only benefits Gadhafi . And it makes the coming of a post-Gadhafi Libya that much more distant . '' There has been talk among world powers about negotiated settlements and scenarios that could include Gadhafi remaining in Libya after the conflict ends , Quarterman said . The international sense that the conflict would end quickly with `` capitulation on the part of the Gadhafi regime is fading , '' Quarterman said . `` As a result , the end game is seeming much more murky .

In downtown Tripoli , cars were backed up in traffic jams . Shoppers lined up outside a bakery waiting for bread .

'' Libyan leader 's cult of personality Rift in Libya rebels rank ? Details murky on Libya rebel chief death UK expels Libyan Embassy staff However , when a government guide was out of earshot , a Libyan man had a dramatically different assessment of the situation . `` We 're barely staying alive , '' said the man , who spoke discreetly and asked not to be named , due to what he claimed were large numbers of secret police and security forces operating in the immediate vicinity . `` Have n't you seen the fuel lines ? '' Long lines of parked cars snake through the city next to gas stations , where drivers sometimes wait days to buy gas . Huge piles of garbage have started to accumulate on streets , parks and beaches due to the departure of armies of guest workers who often fulfilled basic municipal duties . A gleaming , recently constructed Marriott hotel stands empty on one of Tripoli 's sea fronts , a symbol of the burst of foreign investment that was frozen after the conflict erupted last February . The NATO-enforced blockade of seaports and airports controlled by Gadhafi 's forces have severely disrupted trade , forcing Tripoli to rely largely on food and fuel trucked in from neighboring Tunisia . Earlier in July , the United Nations published a report warning about `` pockets of vulnerability '' in Tripoli and other Gadhafi-controlled cities . A U.N. humanitarian team reported seeing shortages of cash , medicine , and fuel . The besieged Gadhafi regime has acknowledged the growing hardship . In an interview several weeks ago with CNN , the finance and planning minister in Tripoli announced his government had begun pumping in `` large amounts of funds '' to drive down growing war-time prices of basic consumer goods like rice , flour , meat , eggs , sugar and edible oils . These measures appear to have helped Libyans preparing for a month of fast-breaking iftar feasts . `` Everything we need is available . There has been a slight increase in prices , very small increase , '' said an elderly retired engineer named Milad Omar . Harder to evaluate is the impact the conflict is having on the collective Libyan psyche . Regime officials strictly control the movements and conversations of foreign journalists . And after 42 years of strict Gadhafi rule , Libyans often appear visibly uncomfortable speaking openly about their situation . But on a recent visit to the market in Tripoli 's central Abu Salim neighborhood , CNN journalists met two families who said they had recently fled fighting in the nearby Nafusa mountains to the southwest of the capital . `` We woke up to shelling , '' said Mabouka Hassem . Her town of Al Josh came under attack from rebel fighters on Thursday morning , she said . `` We never expected it . Our neighbors who live in the hills above us attacked us . '' Hassem said she and her sister and their children fled crying and screaming , some barefoot . They arrived in Tripoli on Friday . `` We left with only the clothes on our back , '' said Nuri Mohamed Ali , a man who said he fled with his children from Gawalish , another front-line town , two weeks ago . He walked through the market with two of his children , shopping ahead of what is supposed to be a month focused on faith , spirituality and reflection . Officials in Tripoli have been preparing for what they say will be a bloody Ramadan . At a recent gathering in support of Gadhafi , a Muslim cleric told CNN that loyalist troops would be authorized to break their daytime fasts to fight on the front lines . `` Those who are fasting , if they get thirsty they should break their fast . -LRB- Because -RRB- those who are fighting are Mujahedeen -LRB- holy warriors -RRB- , '' said Mohammed Madani Chouairef . `` Everyone standing up to this sedition is a Mujahed except for those who are with NATO . '' `` It is very bad to fight against other Muslims during Ramadan , '' said Moussa Ibrahim , Gadhafi 's main spokesman . `` But it -LRB- Ramadan -RRB- makes us stronger , '' he added . Late Sunday night , hours before the official start of Ramadan , Tripoli shook with the sound of several explosions . NATO warplanes roared overhead .

An administration official told CNN the United States has warned the TNC that this is a `` do-or-die moment '' for the organization to carry out a credible and thorough investigation of the killing of its military commander , Abdel Fatah Younis . Last week 's mysterious assassination has raised concerns that it might have been carried out by feuding groups within the rebels themselves . `` We do welcome the Transitional National Council 's move to set up an impartial committee that will investigate the incident and we look forward to hearing the results , '' deputy spokesman Mark Toner told reporters Monday . `` It 's important that , given the fluidness of the situation on the ground , that the Transitional National Council work to ensure that it takes the right kinds of actions , such as an investigation into the death , and sends a clear and transparent message that they speak on behalf of the Libyan opposition and the Libyan people and that they are diligently carrying out their mandate . '' The TNC has been rocked by internal divisions , with rival rebel groups battling each other . The divisions create a dilemma for the Obama administration , which recognized the rebel movement based in Benghazi as Libya 's rightful government on July 15 at an international meeting on Libya in Istanbul . The move , done in coordination with the international community , paves the way for the United States to reopen the embassy , accredit diplomats and unfreeze billions of dollars in frozen assets . The internal strife within the rebel movement comes as the State Department prepares to hand over the Libyan embassy to the TNC as the recognized government of Libya , according to U.S. officials . The officials say the move would allow the TNC to re-open the embassy , accredit diplomats and regain control of the embassy 's frozen bank account , worth about $ 13 million . Rift in Libya rebels rank ? Details murky on Libya rebel chief death It follows a formal request from the TNC to re-open the embassy under its control and accredit Ali Aujali , the former Libyan ambassador to the United States , as its charge d'affaires . In March , the State Department ordered the Libyan embassy in Washington closed and kicked diplomats loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi out of the country . Aujali had resigned his post as the regime 's ambassador to the United States in February and has since represented the opposition in Washington . `` We are consulting with the National Transitional Council on a broad range of issues , and that includes diplomatic accreditation and representation , '' Toner said . Despite the divisions within the TNC , the State Department publicly expressed confidence in the rebels . `` We believe that this is the legitimate representatives of the Libyan people during this transition period , '' Toner said . `` This is an extremely challenging period for Libya and they are dealing with these challenges as they come . But we have confidence that they can weather this . '' But privately , U.S. officials acknowledge there is some concern about the apparent disarray within the rebel movement , although officials say it is not surprising . `` This is a tribal society , '' one official said . `` We knew from the start this could be messy and there was always the concern about not moving too fast . We had no illusions about the TNC , but they have done a pretty good job and look better to us than Gadhafi at this point .

In many places that Gadhafi 's forces have fled , they 've left behind deadly fields of mines -- tens , perhaps hundreds of thousands of them , say the rebels . Not only do they pose a danger for civilians but they also have slowed the advance of the rebels in their march toward Tripoli . Here in Qawalish , a town 60 miles southwest of Tripoli where fierce fighting has taken place in recent weeks , the war looks like this : Men in no protective gear sift through a public park to fight an enemy that can kill instantly and indiscriminately . Here , the enemy is Gadhafi 's landmines . Milad al Saidy and his fellow `` sappers , '' as those who work with mines are known , are armed only with simple metal probes and a couple of metal detectors . A burned-out shell of a car sits as evidence of what the mines can do . Libya 's frontline on an ancient fort Ramadan does n't slow civil war in Libya Reporter 's journey into Western Libya So far , they say , about 2,500 mines have been discovered , all left by fleeing pro-Gadhafi forces . Al Saidy has been doing this work for 16 years but many others are green -- fresh recruits who volunteered for a potentially deadly job . Some learn on the job . Amazingly , al Saidy said , no one has been killed or hurt . `` It 's very , very dangerous but people are insisting they want to work with us to secure the lives of the innocent , the children , so families can come without the fear of landmines , '' he said . The sapper teams find a Chinese-made anti-tank mine , designed to blow up armored vehicles . The rebels explain that the anti-tank mines require a lot of pressure to detonate . So , Gadhafi 's men place Brazilian-made anti-personnel mines , which blow when a person steps on them , atop the bigger mines . The result is an easier but potentially far more deadly blast . The work , al Saidy said , is crucial . He and his men toil under the sun , even though it is Ramadan . They observe the rules of the holy month , neither eating nor drinking and pausing only to pray . `` The circumstances command us to work , '' he said . Farther west , rebel fighters loom over the town of Tiji from an observation post . This place , the locals say , was used by the Berbers 2,000 years ago to look out for invading Roman armies . Now it 's a lookout for a whole new war . The rebels call Tiji a gateway city . If they are able to wrest control from Gadhafi 's men , there would be little between them and Tripoli . But talk of victory and actually achieving it are two different things . The rebels said they engaged Gadhafi 's troops this week but then saw women and children running into houses . `` In this situation we 're facing a big problem because Gadhafi is using people as a human shield , '' said Tarek Zambou , head of the local military council . CNN could not independently verify that claim , but it 's clear that after making significant gains last week in half a dozen towns beneath the Nafusa Mountains , rebel advances have stalled in this key town . The rebels said they have sent word to residents : Leave now . It wo n't be long before they are firing again . Five months into the Libyan war , the rebels have won international support and NATO jets have continuously bombed Gadhafi 's forces . But so far , they have not been able to break the dictator 's hold . On the eastern front , they have been pushing in Zlitan . Thursday , however , it appeared that Gadhafi 's forces were still in control of the central city . In recent weeks , NATO has intensified its bombing of Zlitan , which is less than 50 miles west of rebel-held Misrata . Tuesday , jets struck two buildings in Zlitan , the alliance said . One of Gadhafi 's main battle tanks was destroyed in that attack . A follow-up run Thursday morning attacked another command-and-control center , used to support multiple rocket launchers , NATO said . A mother and her two boys were buried Thursday . The Libyan government , which took reporters on a tour of the city , said they were killed in the airstrikes that hit a two-story villa in a residential neighborhood . A NATO spokesman acknowledged the airstrike but said : `` We do not know of any casualties , we have only heard the government allegations of casualties visa the media . '' Abu Bakr , the brother of the slain woman , wept through the funeral . He pulled back the blankets covering the two small coffins bearing the bloody bodies of his nephews , Mohamed , 5 , and Motez , 3 . `` Whether you like it or not , we 're staying here , '' he yelled . `` This is our country . '' He damned NATO and `` the rats , '' the Libyan regime 's word for the rebels . Back in Qawalish , al Saidy , the sapper , leaves the minefields to return to his vehicle . He knows there is no end date yet for his risky work . `` The more we advance , the more landmines we are facing , '' he said . But at least on this day , there 's good news .

Mustafa Naji al-Mrabet 's left hand and feet were bandaged , there were bloodstains on his robes , and the valve for an intravenous needle still stuck out of his arm . He was both a husband and a father , deep in mourning . Nearby , his brother-in-law , 26-year-old Abubakr Ali cried like a child . Ali pulled back the blankets covering two small coffins . Inside lay the bloody bodies of his nephews , Mohamed and Motez al-Mrabet , ages 5 and 3 . Their mother Ibtisam lay in a coffin beside them . All three were killed early Thursday morning as they slept , neighbors and relatives said , when their house on the outskirts of this coastal city was hit by a NATO airstrike . Family members said a third child , 8-year old Naji , was in intensive care after suffering serious injuries . Officials from Moammar Gadhafi 's embattled government brought journalists to the ruins of al-Mrabet family 's 2-story villa in a residential neighborhood on Thursday . `` In all my 36 years I 've never seen a day like this , '' said a neighbor named Salah Buharto . He said the 6:30 a.m. blast was so powerful , he initially thought his own house had been hit . Libya 's Zlitan in rebel , NATO sights When asked about the suspected air strike , a NATO spokesman told CNN : `` NATO made a strike in Zlitan at 6:30 a.m. -LRB- Thursday -RRB- local time . The target was a command and control facility held by government forces . `` We have had no reason to believe that there were any civilian casualties , '' said another NATO spokesman to CNN , also speaking on condition of anonymity . `` But we take these reports very seriously and we are looking into the matter . We have a process that we go through . '' For weeks , Zlitan has been the target of an intense NATO bombing campaign . The number of buildings and compounds devastated by air strikes have visibly increased since foreign journalists were taken on a government-controlled tour of the small city last month . The Gadhafi regime accuses NATO of hitting food warehouses , health clinics and schools . But a tour of one bomb site on Thursday revealed evidence suggesting the target was not entirely civilian . At the compound of a bombed-out law school where classroom walls were scorched and broken glass littered the floor , CNN found several military uniforms lying on the ground next to wooden ammunition crates . When asked about the military paraphernalia , a government escort said the ammo boxes and uniforms `` belonged to school security guards . '' Meanwhile , every few seconds , rocket and cannon fire rumbled in the distance , as rebels and regime loyalists fought a deadly artillery duel across the front lines a few miles to the east of the city . Zlitan is located less than 50 miles west of the rebel-held port city of Misrata , which survived a long , bloody siege by Gadhafi forces . Over the last week , rebel commanders claimed to have captured parts of Zlitan after advancing west from Misrata . But on Thursday , the city center appeared to remain firmly in loyalist hands . The combined NATO and rebel offensive have clearly taken their toll on Zlitan . On Thursday , the city 's streets were mostly deserted and most of the shops were closed . Residents said they suffered from long power outages lasting 10 hours or longer . Civilian cars and an ambulance smeared with dirt -- a tactic used by both rebels and regime fighters to camouflage vehicles -- raced through the town center . The rebel Transitional National Council and its allies in Washington , London , and Paris have long demanded that Gadhafi step down . But more than five months after anti-Gadhafi protests first erupted across Libya , the flamboyant colonel is still clinging to power . His government is threatening a war of attrition against his enemies . `` This war , this honorable confrontation , could go on for years , '' warned Gadhafi 's main spokesman , Musa Ibrahim , in a press conference on Wednesday . `` We do not want it to ... but from the beginning we were preparing ourselves to fight on the diplomatic front for years , on the military front for years , on the economic front for years . '' As always in conflict , civilians pay the highest price . At Thursday 's funeral , Abubakr Ali watched volunteers carefully bury the bodies of his sister and two nephews next to the neighborhood mosque . `` This was a civilian home . No army , no military , no Gadhafi forces . It 's a family sleeping safely in their place , '' he said . `` This is the protection of civilians , '' Ali added with disgust . He was referring to the United Nations Security Council resolution which authorizes the use of force in Libya in order to protect civilian lives . As tears streamed down his face , Ali took a Kalashnikov rifle and fired a round of bullets into the air . `` Screw NATO and the -LRB- rebel -RRB- rats and screw those who gave the coordinates for the attack , '' he yelled . `` God damn you now and in the afterlife . Moammar -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- , I 'm with you until the last drop of blood .

Two thousand years ago , Berber men would sit in a stone lookout over the majestic brown plains , watching for strangers or enemies approaching their villages . Today , their descendants use the same ridgeline to watch over their own enemies -- the forces of Moammar Gadhafi entrenched in the dusty city of Tiji below . Tarek Zambou was an intelligence officer in those forces , until the revolt began and he defected , returning home to the town of Kabaw , a few kilometers from where he now stands . He commands the area 's Military Council . Today he stands on the windswept point next to a solitary tank standing sentry and points to Taji , nine kilometers away but clearly visible across the flat desert plain . `` It is a very important place for us to take , '' he said . `` And we will take it , no problem .

The rebels made significant advances last week , sweeping off the mountain high ground to the plains , and capturing half a dozen towns and cities . That advance stopped at Tiji , the city now sealed off by rebels on three sides . The fourth , to the northeast , is the way to Tripoli . Zambou says his men prodded forward and engaged Gadhafi forces on the city 's outskirts earlier this week , withdrawing when they saw civilians inside . They had believed most , if not all , had fled . `` In this situation we 're facing a big problem , '' he said . `` Gadhafi is using people as a human shield , and we do n't want to hurt civilians . '' But he says patience is wearing thin . Multiple warnings have been sent to civilians inside Tiji , telling them to leave , and leave soon . `` We -LRB- will -RRB- go in . We -LRB- will -RRB- try as we can to avoid the civilian people but we should go -LRB- in -RRB- . Because we give them the chance , '' he said . During our visit to this historic observation post , we heard anti-aircraft fire coming from the city . `` No problem , '' Zambou calls out to our crew , trying to be reassuring . `` They see us and they shoot , but the ammunition they shoot wo n't reach here . I like to hear it -- it means they 're wasting bullets . '' We follow Zambou 's car down the winding mountain road , closer to Tiji , our crew still marveling at the brutal yet spectacular terrain . Three rebel fighters sit beneath a flapping tarpaulin , peering down the deserted road to the besieged city . There 's another rebel position two more kilometers down the road , Zambou tells us . A Grad rocket killed three of his fighters there recently . We tell him we want to go to that final post , to interview the men there , but Zambou refuses . `` No , too dangerous - the road is very exposed on the way there , '' he said . `` Gadhafi troops will see you and probably fire with anti-aircraft guns , maybe rockets . `` I 'm not worried about you , '' he added . `` But the rockets could hit my men . Do n't go . '' We do n't , and so we return to Kabaw .

The Libyan government said earlier its forces had retaken Bir al-Ghanam but Jumma Ibrahim , a rebel spokesman in the western mountain region , said the claims were false . Rebel commander Nasser abu al Qassem told CNN Monday that the rebels are holding firm on the town 's eastern outskirts , squaring off against loyalists just a few miles away at a key road junction the rebels hope to take in the days ahead . He reported regular exchanges of fire between the two sides . The rebels entered Bir al-Ghanam in June but only held it for a matter of hours . Capturing the town puts the rebels closer to Tripoli than they 've been before . The town is about 85 kilometers -LRB- 53 miles -RRB- southwest of the Libyan capital . Meanwhile , bombs rained down on Tripoli overnight , the sky lit up by explosives . Multiple airstrikes and secondary explosions could be heard continuously for the better part of an hour . Entire neighborhoods of the city were already without electricity -- due to shortages of fuel -- prior to the pre-dawn strikes . Parts of Tripoli have been suffering for days from such blackouts . Gadhafi 's forces fired several rockets Sunday in Bir al-Ghanam , causing minor damage inside the town but no rebel injuries , al Qassem said . He reported no further rocket attacks so far Monday . Al Qassem said NATO forces had informed the rebels that the Gadhafi forces included up to 40 trucks outfitted with heavy weapons , and rebel forces had reinforced their positions Sunday and overnight into Monday . He was confident the rebel lines would hold and said there had been no concerted effort so far by the government troops to try to re-take Bir al-Ghanam . The battle to take Bir al-Ghanam lasted for nearly five hours Saturday and was fought on three fronts . CNN witnessed heavy rocket , mortar and anti aircraft gun fire from the rebel side at one front near a Gadhafi military encampment three kilometres west of the town . Gadhafi forces returned fire with rockets and mortars . Commanders said taking the junction where Gadhafi forces remain east of the town would provide a direct route to the coastal city of Azzawayia .

The death of the rebel government 's military commander , Gen. Abdel Fattah Younis , on July 28 played a role in board members ' ouster Monday , said Shamsiddin Abdulmolah , the council 's media director . `` They were dismissed because of some are directly responsible for how Gen. Younis was arrested , '' Abdulmolah said . `` There were shortcomings and mishandling of the events that led to his assassination . '' Younis and two other rebels were killed after the TNC sought to question him about allegations that he or those close to him had ongoing ties to Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi , Younis ' supporters have said . At least four people are directly responsible administratively for the events leading to the Younis assassination , Abdulmolah said . But the criminal investigation is still ongoing , and no arrests have been officially been made . Despite their dismissal , Abdulmolah said `` some of the people who served on the board can definitely be included in the new Cabinet . '' The rebel government 's chairman commissioned Mahmoud Jibril , the former head of the executive board , to submit new names to be considered for a new board soon , Abdulmolah said , but no exact deadline was mentioned . NATO has used air power to enforce a U.N. resolution protecting civilians from the Gadhafi regime , and world powers have announced their support for Libya 's rebel umbrella group . But concerns have been raised that the mysterious assassination might have been carried out by feuding rebel groups . According to Gadhafi spokesman Musa Ibrahim , Younis ' killing represented `` more proof that the transitional council of the traitors is not able to lead any sort of government or have any control of eastern cities of Libya . '' In July , rebel military council member Mohammad Ethish released a statement that seemed to imply that Gadhafi loyalists had something to do with the death . `` This incident will increase the will and courage of the rebels , and it will even get us close together to reach the home of the tyrant , '' Ethish said . `` We promise our brothers in the East that we will do the impossible to avenge the death of Abdul Fattah Younis , and we promise that we will increase our blows and empower our will . Until we capture the tyrant Moammar Gadhafi . '' A one-time general in Gadhafi 's army , Younis told CNN in February that he switched sides after Gadhafi told him he planned to bomb Benghazi -- a move Younis said would have killed thousands . Meanwhile , the Libyan Embassy in London re-opened Tuesday under National Transitional Council management , a shift that `` marks very clearly the fundamental change that is taking place in Libya , '' British Foreign Secretary William Hague said . Rebel forces also reported Tuesday that they had advanced more than 9 miles -LRB- 15 kilometers -RRB- north from B'ir al Ghanam toward the key coastal city of Az Zawiyah , which is about 27 miles -LRB- 43 kilometers -RRB- west of Tripoli .

The Libyan strongman continues to hold on , but it may just be a matter of time before he is forced from power . We asked him to summarize the challenges the United States will likely face and what it should be prepared to do . Here is what he had to say : The first challenge will be security . Failure to maintain public order is what got us into big trouble in Iraq , where Saddam Hussein s stay behind operation stirred civic unrest and destroyed government buildings . The murder in Libya last month of the overall rebel commander is a reminder that internecine warfare among the more than forty-five rebel militias is a real possibility . People who lost family and tribal members to the Gadhafi regime may seek to settle scores . Former regime elements may seek to defend themselves and to privatize state assets . Criminals will see opportunities to traffic in arms , drugs and even people . The humanitarian challenges will be no less daunting . Fighting has displaced at least half a million Libyans from their homes . Perhaps half of those are still in Libya , and many who are not will seek to return quickly once Gadhafi falls . Food , water , shelter and health services need to be secured for the most vulnerable . In addition , keeping water and electricity flowing to the residents of Tripoli and other major urban centers will be vital to maintaining public order , especially if Qaddafi falls this summer . U.S. interests in Libya are limited , but a relatively successful transition from the Gadhafi regime to a united , stable , more open and democratic Libya would be seen in the region and more widely as a credit to the NATO-led intervention . It would also enable Libya to resume oil and gas exports , demonstrate the international community s capacity to manage such transitions and encourage positive outcomes to other Arab Spring protests , including those in Yemen and Syria . Failure to stabilize Libya could lead to chaos , breakup of the Libyan state that sets an unwelcome precedent elsewhere , or restoration of dictatorship . These outcomes would all damage American and allied credibility and likely also cause major problems for our European allies , including shortfalls in energy supplies , loss of major investments and a continuing refugee flow . Refugees could also cause problems in Tunisia , Egypt , and the rest of the Mediterranean . It is therefore the Europeans , along with the Arab League , who should take the lead in post-Gadhafi stabilization of Libya , under a clear United Nations Security Council mandate that recognizes a legitimate post-Gadhafi Libyan authority and sets out strategic goals for the transition . The goals should include a united and sovereign Libya within its well-established borders that can sustain , govern , and defend itself through inclusive democratic institutions , using Libya s resources transparently and accountably for the benefit of all its people . Quick deployment of a peacekeeping force of several thousand paramilitary police , mainly to keep order in Tripoli and other population centers , would help ensure these goals are met . The European Union and its member states can deploy several hundred paramilitaries . Turkey and Arab countries might supply the remainder . An international peacekeeping operation would not administer Libya but would support an inclusive interim authority in maintaining stability , providing humanitarian assistance , and beginning the reconstruction process . What if this does not work ? NATO will need to be prepared to step in . Only as a last resort to deal with widespread disorder , a threatened breakup of the Libyan state , or a humanitarian catastrophe should the international community consider armed intervention without the invitation of a legitimate Libyan authority . This could mean U.S. boots on the ground , but only briefly as part of a broader multilateral effort . Leadership in post-Gadhafi Libya should be passed as quickly as possible to the Libyans , who have already set up local councils and a Transitional National Council , which help to organize and provide services in the liberated portions of the country . These indigenous institutions merit nurturing and support , including unfreezing of Gadhafi-era assets so that the councils in liberated areas can begin to meet the needs of their populations . The post-Gadhafi era has already begun there . Libya is a resource-rich country with a relatively well-educated citizenry that has demonstrated courage under fire . The country lacks institutions and political experience , but not talent and commitment . The international community should prepare to support Libyan efforts to take charge of the country s destiny once Gadhafi leaves the scene . This whole war is propaganda right from the start when they declared that armed civilians are being killed in the oppen desert ... strange because in the UK unarmed gangs are criminal what if the youngsters in the UK carried AK74 's RPG 's drove tanks from day 1 -LRB- fact -RRB- and had a UK general defect to his hometown and tribe with 8000 troops including special forces and 100 + tanks jets and fighter helicopters and they all call in dozen powerful armies like some kind of Trojan horse ... this would boil the blood of many civilians that had no say in this war and the government forced to fight this senseless bloodshed full of slander and media spin .

NATO bombed and killed 100s of Libyan army soldiers and bombed cars moving towards their armed gangs in Benghazi . The rebels will not permit any dissent . They will go and arrest anyone they think has any Gaddafi sympathies . There have been night raids almost every night for the last 5 months in Benghazi , all based on neighborhood informants , etc. .

'' The task is not `` to think through the challenges that a post-Gadhafi Libya would be for the Libyan People '' . It is obvious that NATO 's mission `` Operation Unified Protector '' is to protect western top banking and industry interests . NATO simply wants Gadhafi replaced by a `` puppet '' . It has NOTHING to do with protecting Libyan civilians ! August 13 , 2011 at 3:21 am | Reply In my opinion , the turn of events in Libya is a failure by the United States and NATO to dismantle the legitimate government of Libya . DEMOCRACY ist not fought with bombs and weapons . DEMOCRACY in my opinion is a peaceful word and should be fought through the ballot box . I am for peaceful demonstrations and the freedom of speech . I stand strongly against the brutality and Scientific Atrocities that the United States and NATO are committing against the People of Libya . I stand for International FREEDOM and JUSTICE . The events taking place in Syria are more serious than those in Libya . Why is it that NATO and the United States and its allies are till now not taking any effective action against Assad and his regime to stop the Carnage in that country ? Justice and equality must prevail . Is it because Syria has no oil that the U.S.A. and it 's Allies are marking time with events in Syria ?

NEW : Rebels made headway Thursday northward toward coastal cities near the capital NEW : Rebel spokesman predicts fighters will reach the road leading to Tripoli within days NEW : Libyan Embassy in Washington reopens under TNC control Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rebels pushed Thursday northward on three fronts toward the coastal cities of al-Zawiya , Aziziya and Sorman , with their ultimate goal being Tripoli , rebel field commander Adel Al-Zintani told CNN . Six rebels died and dozens more were wounded in fighting Wednesday and Thursday , he said . He predicted that the fighters would reach the coastal road that leads to the capital city within days . Zawiya is strategically important because the coastal road through the city is the main supply line from the Tunisian border to areas held by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi . Fighting was continuing around Misrata , where rebel spokesman Mohamed Ibrahim said the main hospital reported four rebels killed and 54 wounded . Meanwhile , in New York , a spokesperson for Ban Ki-moon said the U.N. secretary-general `` is deeply concerned by reports of the unacceptably large number of civilian casualties as a result of the conflict in Libya . '' Ban is urging `` all Libyan parties '' to engage with his special envoy , Abdel-Elah Al-Khatib , `` and respond concretely and positively to the ideas presented to them , in order to end the bloodshed in the country , '' the spokesperson said . His remarks came three days after allegations that a NATO strike in the village of Majer near Zlitan wound up killing 85 civilians -- 33 children , 32 women and 20 men . The Tripoli government called it `` a massaacre '' of civilians ; NATO has said its warplanes struck two farms used as a staging point for Gadhafi 's forces `` This is a legitimate target . And by striking it , NATO has reduced pro-Gadhafi forces capabilities to threaten and attack civilians , '' said Col. Roland Lavoie , a spokesman for the NATO operation . `` We do not have evidence of civilian casualties at this stage , although casualties among military personnel , including mercenaries , are very likely due to the nature of the target . '' But , on Tuesday , officials from the government in Tripoli escorted international journalists to a mass funeral in Majer , and to the site where the government and residents said the NATO airstrike killed civilians . Journalists saw the bodies of children and women among the dead and wounded at the site of the attack . It was impossible for CNN to confirm the extent of the casualties . A spokesman for the Tripoli government , Musa Ibrahim , called it `` a crime beyond imagination . '' For weeks , NATO warplanes have been bombing Zlitan on a daily basis . Meanwhile , rebels have been pressing toward Zlitan 's eastern gates from the nearby opposition-held port of Misrata . Speaking to journalists in Majer on Tuesday , Ibrahim accused NATO of bombing Majer to clear the way for rebels to advance on the Gadhafi-controlled city of Zlitan , a few kilometers north . Maj. Gen. Nick Pope , spokesman for the British Ministry of Defense , said Thursday that British aircraft have been in action in recent days `` as part of NATO 's mission to protect civilians at risk of attack from Col. Gadhafi 's former regime . '' The latest operations included British aircraft carrying out precision airstrikes on several sites in and around Zlitan , Pope said in a statement . The report of civilian deaths stirred anger in Washington . `` If such reports are true , it further highlights the increased risks to civilians that has occurred as a result of military intervention in Libya and is further evidence that continued bombing by NATO ... is an inappropriate tool to protect civilians or force Moammar Gadhafi from power , '' wrote Rep. Dennis Kucinich in a letter to Ban . `` How can they continue to cause the deaths of innocent civilians under the color of international law and not be held accountable ? '' the Ohio Democrat continued . The changing nature of who controls what in Libya was underscored Thursday by events in Washington , where the Libyan Embassy officially reopened under the control of the Transitional National Council . `` This is a message that Gadhafi can no more rule Libya , '' said Ali Aujali , who was accredited Thursday as head of the Libyan mission . Aujuli said he talked Thursday with State Department officials about the Obama administration 's efforts to help the TNC gain access to some $ 30 billion in frozen Libyan assets . The State Department had ordered the embassy closed in March and expelled diplomats loyal to Gadhafi . Aujali had resigned his post as the Gadhafi regime 's ambassador to the United States in February and has since represented the opposition in Washington . The United States on July 15 recognized the rebel movement based in Benghazi as Libya 's rightful government .

Heavy gunfire was heard in al-Zawiya , located about 33 miles west of Tripoli , where rebels had arrived . Rebels entered the city center and managed to cut off the road to Tripoli , they said . Talha Jwaili , a rebel fighter , told CNN that rebels control al-Zawiya . Ten rebels died in the fighting , four from Zintan and six from al-Zawiya , he said . More than 20 people were reported injured . A spokesman in the media office of the Military Council of the Western Mountain Region said that rebels control about 85 % of the city and that clashes there are ongoing . CNN could not independently confirm Saturday who was in control of al-Zawiya , nor other details of the rebels ' accounts . A government spokesman downplayed the fighting , telling reporters in Tripoli that the town is `` absolutely under our control . '' Al-Zawiya is strategically important because the coastal road through the city is the main supply line from the Tunisian border to areas held by Gadhafi . His weapon of choice ? His brush Government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said fewer than 100 rebels moved in on al-Zawiya from the southern side of the city , but were stopped . Another group of fewer than 50 rebels was waiting inside the city , but `` took action too early , '' he said , adding that the group is still on the run . `` They are mad . ... This is not an advance . This is what you call a skirmish , what you call a suicide mission , '' Ibrahim said , noting that al-Zawiya is the country 's third-largest city . While forces loyal to the Libyan leader tried to defend the capital from the west , rebels announced that they had cut off an important military supply route to the south . Sixty miles to Tripoli 's south , rebels said they captured the town of Garyan and pushed the Gadhafi forces to the south , cutting them off from the road to Tripoli . The soldiers left behind heavy artillery and ammunition , rebel field commander Adel al-Zintani told CNN . `` We captured many anti-aircraft artillery vehicles , two full fuel tankers and 106 anti-tank piercing artillery and shells , '' he said . Seven people were injured in the clashes , he said . `` The rebels have 95 % control of Garyan and have surrounded a Gadhafi brigade inside a military camp inside Garyan , '' said the spokesman in the media office of the Military Council of the Western Mountain Region . Finally , in the opposition-held port of Misrata , missile attacks by Gadhafi forces ended after rebels captured the nearby town of Tawargha , National Transitional Council spokesman Guma El-Gamaty told CNN . That city was being used by Gadhafi forces to launch missiles indiscriminately into Misrata , he said . Rebels also took a crucial bridge that links Tawargha to Sirte , Gadhafi 's hometown and loyal stronghold , he said . However , Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim said government fighters had pushed the rebels away from Tawargha and back to Misrata . Ibrahim also downplayed the rebel claims in other towns . `` Small groups of armed gangs , 50 here , 50 there , some attacked south of al-Zawiya , some attacked north of Garyan , and Tawargha , but they have very weak influence on the ground , '' government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told reporters . `` The people 's armed forces are dealing with them , they do not represent a real threat . Tripoli is safe . '' He later noted that Gadhafi 's forces are `` very strong '' and have the support of `` thousands upon thousands '' of armed volunteers . `` You have to remember we are very powerful , '' Ibrahim said . `` The tens of thousands and tens of thousands of volunteers are armed right now . It does n't matter whether NATO advances or not , whether rebels advance or not , because we will always be able to fight , in a year 's time , in two years , in three years . '' Five months into the Libyan war , the rebels have won international support in their effort to oust Gadhafi . They have been aided by NATO airstrikes that began in March after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution that ordered civilians be protected . This week , the government accused NATO of killing 85 civilians , including 33 children , in airstrikes Monday near the embattled city of Zlitan . NATO has said there is no evidence that the strikes killed civilians , though journalists , including CNN reporters , taken by Gadhafi 's government to the site of the strikes , reported seeing bodies of women and children . It was impossible for CNN to confirm the extent of the casualties and if they were all civilian . Kaim on Friday criticized the United Nations for what he claimed was an organizational silence over claims that NATO has violated the mandate of the Security Council by killing civilians and conducting a naval blockade . Ibrahim renewed the government 's accusations Saturday , saying NATO is aiding the rebels , whom he described as `` armed gangs .

Six months into Libya 's war , some artists in rebel strongholds are arming themselves with fresh paint . A brush can be as mighty as the Kalashnikov in the fight against the strongman . `` Everybody supports the revolution in some way , '' says Mohammed Zamoul , formerly a bulldozer driver . `` Some people fight , I use the brush .

Gallery : Rebel art in Libya His caricatures of Gadhafi sucking on his country 's oil reserves , pinned down by a rebel flag and being launched out of Libya on a bomb -- are everywhere around his hometown of Rujban in the country 's western mountains . `` Building owners welcome it , '' he says . `` Not one single person said no. . I get a lot of support . '' Several miles away in the rebel-controlled city of Zintan , Masoud Baji is also using art as weapon . He was a calligrapher before the uprising began in Libya last February . Now , he revels in his new career . Each of his paintings , he says , expresses Gadhafi 's persecution of the Libyan people . One portrays Gadhafi as a vampire sucking the wealth of the people . `` He has not left anything for them , he kept us illiterate , without education , '' Baji says . `` He kept everything for himself . '' Some of the paintings are humorous . Some make strong political commentary . All are new in a nation where freedom of expression was an unknown under Gadhafi . `` Now we can express ourselves freely , thank god , '' Baji says . `` The chains have been lifted . Everyone can express themselves . Even a simple painting about the tyrant , now we can paint . Before the revolution we could not do that , he would arrest and in some cases kill us . '' Zamoul and his assistant , calligrapher Abdul Aziz , bear sizzling daytime temperatures to create their latest fresco -- `` The Lady of the Sea '' beckoning rebel fighters to come and join her in Tripoli . `` What I have inside I can now express and put it on the walls , '' Zamoul says .

Nasr al-Mabrouk Abdallah arrived with nine of his family members on a private plane from Djerba , Tunisia , the newspaper reported , citing an unidentified airport official . Djerba is about 150 miles -LRB- 240 kilometers -RRB- west of Tripoli . Meanwhile , a U.S. defense official confirmed Monday that Libyan forces loyal to Gadhafi fired a short-range Scud missile on Sunday at a rebel stronghold , but by all accounts the missile failed to reach its target . The official said the missile was launched from a government-held area 50 miles east of Sirte and landed 50 miles east of Brega in the desert . His weapon of choice ? His brush The newspaper and an official at Cairo International Airport identified Abdallah as Libya 's minister of the interior . However , a Libyan government official -- whose information has proved reliable in the past but who is not allowed to talk to the news media for attribution -- identified Abdallah as an administrative director at the Interior Ministry and a former Libyan minister . The official said he could confirm that Abdallah had traveled to Egypt with his family on nonofficial business , but could not specify the nature of the trip . A Libyan government website reported in June that Abdallah had been sworn in as deputy minister of public security . Libya 's interior ministry is called the Ministry of Public Security . Asked about the apparent defection , Tripoli government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said he would not comment on any personal decisions by Abdallah . `` In the last while , we noticed that he had intense social pressures on him . It 's probably not appropriate that we talk about it in detail because it 's personal . '' Ibrahim added , `` Truthfully , he has fallen under a lot of social and emotional pressure as we 've noticed . He could n't handle it and preferred that he left . That 's a personal decision . '' Abdallah 's departure comes as rebels have been reporting major advances toward their goal of cutting off Libya 's coastal road , the Tripoli regime 's lifeline , and reaching the capital . In the coastal city of al-Zawiya , clashes were ongoing . `` At the moment , it 's quite hard to say who is in complete control of the city , '' said Deborah Haynes , a reporter for the Times of London who left the city Monday . `` The rebels say they have 80 % of it under their control , but it is a very fluid situation . '' Pro-Gadhafi snipers were holed up in buildings in the main square , where rebels were firing at them with rocket-propelled grenades , she said . Rebel fighters controlled all but the eastern part of the city , said Hassan Jwaili , who is a rebel fighter and a source who has proven reliable in the past . Gadhafi forces shelled al-Zawiya with Grad rockets from nearby Janzur , killing two rebels , bringing the number of dead in al-Zawiya to 11 , with dozens more wounded , Jwaili said . NATO airstrikes , though , have hit Gadhafi forces in Janzur , aiding the rebels , he said . West of al-Zawiya , rebel forces entered the towns of Surman and Sabrata late Sunday , Jwaili said . Twenty-two rebel fighters died and 38 were wounded in the towns , he said . West of Sabrata , rebels surrounded Gadhafi forces inside a military camp , he said . Clashes were continuing for control of Tiji , on the plains of the western mountains , Jwaili said . And in Assaba , east of Qawalish , also in the western mountains , rebel fighters had surrounded the city and negotiations were under way for Gadhafi forces to turn themselves in , Jwaili said . But a Tripoli government spokesman denied the assertions that rebels were advancing . Gadhafi himself , in an address broadcast Monday on Libyan state television , urged Libyans to fight opposition forces and `` cleanse this sweet and honorable land . '' Cheers from the crowd accompanied the speech , cries of `` Allah , Libya , Gadhafi and nothing else '' at times drowning out Gadhafi . `` We dance and sing despite the strikes ! The strikes will be over and NATO will be defeated , '' Gadhafi said . `` Move always forward to the challenge ; pick up your weapons ; go to the fight in order to liberate Libya inch by inch from the traitors and from NATO . Be prepared to fight if they hit the ground . '' Claims of control over the city of al-Zawiya -- if true -- would be a strategic blow against government forces , since the road through the city serves as a critical supply line to Tripoli from the west and has an oil terminal . In his news conference Monday evening , Ibrahim denied the assertions and said Gadhafi forces were in `` complete control '' of al-Zawiya after having halted rebel attacks there . `` There are a few armed gangs inside the city who took advantage of the opportunity to enter but they are limited , '' he said . `` All of south Zawiya is protected . The armed gangs tried to attack people in their homes , occupy a school and raid shops . The government closed off a main road for the protection of the people . '' The rebels say that they were the ones who closed the coastal road . Ibrahim said heavy NATO airstrikes were continuing to strike some coastal cities , including al-Zawiya , with the eastern city of al-Brega bearing the brunt of the attacks . `` To be honest , they 're unable to shake our civilians or our youth , '' he said . He said the rebels suffered heavy casualties . `` Hundreds of them injured and tens killed . Because of this , now people in the eastern regions and even the armed gangs refer to al-Brega as a cemetery . Al-Brega is synonymous with death . '' In Tiji , 40 rebels were killed by pro-Gadhafi forces , who took three tanks and a number of weapons from them , he said . Ibrahim said officials were negotiating with international companies that have expressed interest in returning to Libya , he said . The goal is for them to resume operations `` very soon . '' Ibrahim added that the Tripoli government forces were planning to `` free '' the key port city of Misrata from rebel forces . `` We ca n't tell everything but we 're in a position to free Misrata , '' he said . `` It 's not an easy feat . '' Rebel commander al-Zintani rejected Ibrahim 's assertions that Gadhafi 's forces controlled al-Zawiya and Surman , which is also along the western supply road , as well as the government 's claims to Garyan , another city on a key supply route leading to Tripoli from the south . `` The next few days will prove him wrong , '' the rebel field commander predicted . NATO said Sunday it had struck a Gadhafi military facility in Garyan . Rebel spokesman Jumma Ibrahim has said that rebels control the coastal road connecting al-Zawiya with a post on the Tunisia border , but that Gadhafi forces still controlled the post . Reports from Tunisia 's state-owned Tataouine radio corroborated the account . CNN has not been able to independently confirm battle claims , including who controls al-Zawiya . Daily claims of rebel successes indicate rapid progress when compared with positions rebels claimed on previous days . The government in Tripoli has consistently downplayed claims of rebel victories and played up the strength of Gadhafi 's forces . `` You have to remember we are very powerful , '' Musa Ibrahim said Saturday . `` The tens of thousands and tens of thousands of volunteers are armed right now . It does n't matter whether NATO advances or not , whether rebels advance or not , because we will always be able to fight , in a year 's time , in two years , in three years . '' Five months into the Libyan war , the rebels have won international support in their effort to oust Gadhafi . They have been aided by NATO airstrikes that began in March after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution that ordered civilians be protected .

Roland Lavoie , who described the advances as `` the most significant anti-Gadhafi territorial gain we have seen in months . '' Since the end of July , as the threat from pro-Gadhafi forces has diminished , thousands of people have returned to their homes in the western Nafusa mountains , he said . Since Friday , the northwest coastal city of Misrata has been free of pro-Gadhafi forces , he said . And the threat from nearby Zlitan has diminished as pro-Gadhafi forces are being pushed farther west , he added . His weapon of choice ? His brush Over the last week , NATO warplanes have damaged or destroyed some 150 military targets as part of Operation Unified Protector , Lavoie said . `` Our assessment , without going into details , is that the Gadhafi regime does not have anymore an effective operational capability , '' he said . Lavoie said that rebels had occupied Surman and Sabratha west of Tripoli , but added that the regions were `` still contested . '' However , Libyan state television reported that pro-Gadhafi forces and tribal fighters were `` cleansing the city of Sabratha from the gangs of traitors '' and had secured the coastal road , a key supply pipeline into Tripoli . Though the center of Zawiya was under rebel control , `` there 's still reports of fighting also in the suburbs , '' Lavoie said . Still , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed optimism . `` I think the sense is that Gadhafi 's days are numbered , '' she told reporters in Washington . But a spokesman for the Gadhafi government offered a different view . `` We are doing very well , '' Ibrahim Musa told reporters . `` It 's true that it 's a bit slow -- people are still saying that we 're not acting immediately and that we 're having problems in Surman and Sabratha and whatnot because of armed gangs . That 's true but , God willing , we are able to lead this battle successfully . We will achieve peace and victory . '' He added , `` We are fighting NATO -- not the tens or hundreds of armed gang members . Our war is with the crusaders . '' If rebels gain control of Zawiya , that would be a major stride in putting a stranglehold on the Gadhafi-controlled seat of power . `` We will be very careful entering Tripoli , which we hope to do by the end of this month , '' said Col. Ahmed Banni , military spokesman for the opposition National Transitional Council . Banni said there is intelligence that some Gadhafi forces are moving to Tripoli from other fronts -- Terhouna in the southeast and Sirte farther east . He said those forces have taken off their uniforms to blend in with the population , a `` dangerous '' sign those troops are preparing for a `` bloody war . '' He said rebels in Tripoli recently were supplied with arms . But , he said , `` We asked them to stay put until the zero hour . '' Col. Jumma Ibrahim , a spokesman for the rebels ' western command , said Gadhafi forces controlled most of the eastern part of the city and were shelling rebels with Grad missiles and artillery . `` There are still skirmishes with the brigades in the city center , with snipers taking positions , '' Col. Ibrahim said . `` The fight is now urban warfare there at the moment . There have been a lot injured among our ranks but it is hard to give a number . '' The rebels claim control of towns west of Zawiya to near Ras Jedeir . These include Surman and Subratha . `` It is a huge deal and a decisive defeat for his forces in that region . All these areas are liberated , '' Banni said . Col. Ibrahim said Garyan , south of Tripoli 's city center , had been taken by rebels but Gadhafi loyalists were shelling them from a nearby town . There has been `` fierce fighting '' in Terhouna . He said rebel forces were surrounding Zlitan in the south , east and northeast and fighting Gadhafi forces . He said there 's been fighting in the industrial area of al-Brega , where rebels control the residential areas except for one controlled by the Gadhafi government . Gadhafi forces also control the industrial area , Banni said . `` He is trying his hardest to prevent us from access to $ 35 million worth of daily oil money under normal circumstances in al-Brega , '' Banni said . `` If we control the port and the refinery in the industrial area , we 'd have that money .

Watson says he watched slow destruction of a country Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` Mia mia . '' It is an extremely popular phrase , widely used in Libya , that translates roughly to `` 100 percent . '' Nine times out of 10 , that is what Libyans said when I asked how they were coping with nightly bombardments by NATO warplanes , electricity blackouts that lasted days and rebel forces who were pressing forward on three fronts . `` Mia mia , '' they said with a smile . In other words , everything 's great ! Was this the cheerful coping method of a society living amid olive groves and palm trees next to the Mediterranean Sea ? Or was `` mia mia '' a survival tactic for people who had grown up within the authoritarian system of Moammar Gadhafi 's perpetual revolution ? The whispers of dissent my colleagues and I often heard in Tripoli suggested the latter . One night , after we had filmed the largest poster ever of a head of state in Tripoli 's Green Square , a middle-aged man rode past on a bicycle , yelling , `` Do n't believe what you see ! It 's all lies ! '' Then he disappeared into traffic , swallowed up amid posters of Gadhafi and regime loyalists , who shrouded themselves in the green of the Libyan flag . His weapon of choice ? His brush Even in peacetime , Gadhafi 's Libya had the Orwellian trappings of a police state governed by a culture of fear . I first traveled to Tripoli in 2007 , when I was greeted at passport control by a portrait of Gadhafi in sunglasses and the revolutionary slogan `` Partners not Wage-Slaves . '' At the time , Libya was coming in from the cold after years of international isolation . U.S. diplomats opening a new American Embassy were temporarily housed in a sky-high suite of the pricey Corinthia Hotel . Meanwhile , European businessmen were downstairs in the hotel lobby , plotting ways to profit off bountiful Libyan petro-dollars . The foreigners were free to make deals with the government . But Libyans were still clearly afraid to say much beyond the mantra of `` mia mia . '' Gadhafi 's cult of personality reigned supreme . During that visit , I watched a highly placed engineer and an academic at a government `` think tank '' separately feign illness rather than speak on the record about their country . Even though I had jumped through bureaucratic hoops , acquiring all the necessary permits from the Foreign Press Department to conduct interviews , these adult , educated men were terrified about sticking their necks out and perhaps saying something that might accidentally challenge Gadhafi 's utopian vision of Libya . After all , in the 1980s , Gadhafi banned restaurants , lawyers and the entire retail sector . Now he had performed an ideological U-turn and was apparently embracing capitalism . In 2007 , I had to travel everywhere with a government minder . I was permitted to spend only a single night reporting in the eastern city of Benghazi before being hustled back to Tripoli . The regime 's discomfort was prescient . Four years later , the barely contained political tensions in Benghazi exploded , and Libya 's second city became the capital for anti-Gadhafi rebels . Some Libyans clearly had had enough of `` mia mia . '' It was surprising , then , to see the Gadhafi regime still hosting journalists from the U.S. , France and England five months into an aerial bombing campaign that had been led by these three governments . The government was trying to shape international opinion . But it was doing so with the clumsiness one would expect from a regime that enjoyed absolute control over its own media for more than 40 years . Throughout the conflict , almost all foreign journalists have been housed in the luxury Rixos Hotel , which lost its Turkish management after Ankara turned its back on Gadhafi several months into the war . The only time we were allowed to film outside of the hotel was on government bus tours , surrounded by government escorts . Oftentimes , we would n't learn about the destination until the last minute . It was like trying to see Libya through a keyhole . When the regime did n't like our subsequent reporting , it did not hesitate to insult and intimidate . `` I think you are an agent of NATO . You work for Hillary Clinton , '' the head of the foreign media department told me when he summoned me to his office for one of several hourlong lectures . `` You are a criminal ! '' yelled his young assistant Issa . They were furious at my reported estimate that `` more than 10,000 '' regime supporters attended a recent pro-Gadhafi rally . They would have preferred the headline printed in the regime 's English-language Al-Jamahiriya News : `` More than Five Million Libyans organized in the Marches . '' Considering Libya 's entire population is estimated at just over 6 million , Al-Jamahiriya 's alleged rally would have been a remarkable event to witness , especially when broad swaths of the country were still under the control of the rebels . Sometimes , the bus tours backfired . On a visit to the front-line city of Zlitan , government officials brought us to a law school that had clearly been bombed by NATO warplanes . It was , they said , yet another example of the Western military alliance bombing a civilian target . But the campus of the bombed-out school was littered with military uniforms and empty wooden ammunition boxes . `` Those belonged to the school 's security guards , '' said a minder . We asked outside military experts to examine the serial numbers on the ammo boxes . They all agreed that Cyrillic letters clearly showed that one box had contained Russian-made 14.5 millimeter armor-piercing incendiary B-32 rounds . These are high-caliber munitions for the kind of machine gun that is typically mounted on armored personnel carriers and anti-aircraft guns . `` The guard would need to be about 3 meters tall to carry the gun for those , '' security analyst Zoran Kusovac wrote in an e-mail to CNN . `` But if Hulk Hogan was the guard ... '' The trouble is , the regime 's habit of exaggeration and outright lies was often matched by the outrageous claims of the rebels . The opposition fighters often claimed to control cities that later proved to be in loyalist hands . After last month 's killing of rebel military commander Abdul Fattah Younis , the Benghazi-based Transitional National Council issued wildly contradictory statements . Eventually , it emerged that a rival rebel faction killed Younis and set his corpse on fire before dumping it in a valley . NATO did n't help matters in the truth department . Throughout the conflict , Western governments stuck to their argument that NATO 's mission was to `` save civilian lives . '' But the aerial bombardment of loyalist positions just before rebels launched offensives against Gadhafi-held towns hardly resembled life-saving operations . Add that to the crippling economic blockade of Tripoli , and suddenly NATO 's mission appeared to be focused more on regime change than on protecting innocent civilians . The Libyan government could make a strong case that NATO had exceeded the mandate provided by a United Nations Security Council Resolution . But the Gadhafi regime was so obsessed with not appearing weak that it refused to let journalists see the hardships endured by Libyan citizens . I saw the extent of the crippling power shortages only when I sneaked out of the Rixos one night . In downtown Tripoli , I was stunned to see an entire neighborhood plunged into darkness , with families breaking their Ramadan fast by candlelight . Residents told me they had n't had any electricity in days . We also started hearing rumors of protests due to the lack of power . I asked Libya 's prime minister about these reports at a news conference the next day . `` The only rallies that came out on the streets in the last few days were those supporting the leadership of the country , '' Baghdadi Al-Mahmoudi said . `` Libyans are able to hold firm against these sanctions and this aggression . '' Another `` mia mia '' moment from one of the highest-ranked officials in the land . And who could challenge him ? As early as March , the regime shut down Internet access and cell phone text messaging throughout the entire country . One of the only exceptions was the Rixos Hotel , where government minders came to check their e-mail -LRB- and charge their cell phones , as the power shortages got worse -RRB- . The Rixos was where Libyan state TV talk show host Yousef Shakeer lived with his family . He broadcast from a studio in the basement , serving up nightly denunciations of NATO , the rebels and the foreign journalists in the hotel ... while predicting Gadhafi 's imminent victory over his enemies . Every night , gunfire rang out around the Rixos . Asked what it was , government officials always said , `` They are supporters of Gadhafi celebrating victory . '' Celebrating five months of near-constant victory must have been exhausting . When NATO 's nightly bombing runs struck closer to the Rixos , the strange collection of regime supporters who somehow could afford $ 400-a-night hotel rooms sometimes lashed out at foreign reporters . `` F -- off ! '' a Libyan man screamed at CNN producer Jomana Karadsheh , as she ran to film 2 a.m. explosions from the roof . Later , he apologized when he learned that Jomana was Jordanian . Seen through this bizarre lens and surrounded by antagonistic ideologues , reporters ended up questioning themselves on everything they saw . Was that person I interviewed actually a government agent ? Were the dead people in those coffins really civilians killed by last night 's airstrikes ? How many people really supported Gadhafi ? Imagine my surprise when on one of my last days in Libya , I sneaked away from government minders in the neighborhood of Souk al Jumma , which has been the scene of anti-Gadhafi street protests . There , I met a man named Tahir who told me he was being patient , waiting for the rebels to come from the Nafusa Mountains and Misrata to liberate Tripoli . `` Lies , all lies , '' he said when I asked him about the wild crowds of Gadhafi supporters broadcast nightly on Libyan state TV . `` Thank you , Britain ; thank you , America , '' a group of teenagers playing foosball yelled to Jomana and cameraman Joe Duran in another part of Souk al Juma . The best argument I ever heard for defending the dictator came from an interpreter named Mohamed . He was worried about his family 's safety , having heard rumors of rebels attacking dark-skinned Libyans . Never having worked with the rebels , I could not confirm or deny Mohamed 's claim . But it raised the specter of racial and tribal conflict in the event of Gadhafi 's overthrow . `` Report the truth , please , '' a Libyan man standing in line told me as a Tunisian customs officer processed my passport last week . I was about to leave Libya and at the end of my rope after a month of virtual house arrest . `` What is the truth ? '' `` Mia mia ?! '' No , the man said . He was fleeing to Tunisia with his family because there was no electricity in Tripoli and because Gadhafi 's forces had opened fire with machine guns on a recent street protest against the power outages . Another claim I could not independently confirm . For now , only one thing is certain . During my month in Libya , I watched a country slowly being destroyed , city by city , town by town . It does n't matter whether the damage is being caused by warplanes , rebel machine guns , loyalist rockets or the sudden departure of the foreign guest workers and educated Libyans who kept the economy working . The fact is , Libya is starting to look and feel more and more like another Arab country whose long-ruling dictator was overthrown with the help of foreign armies .

But could reports of significant rebel advances in recent days signal a decisive shift in momentum to their side , after months of apparent stalemate ? Col. Roland Lavoie , a spokesman for NATO 's military operation , told reporters Tuesday that `` anti-Gadhafi forces are now assuming control of the key approaches to Tripoli , '' the Gadhafi-held capital which has long eluded the rebels ' grasp . Describing the advances as `` the most significant anti-Gadhafi territorial gain we have seen in months , '' he painted a picture of Gadhafi 's forces on the back foot , losing `` considerable grounds '' on several fronts , as the rebels advance into the west . NATO deputy spokeswoman Carmen Romero also spoke of the use by government forces of an unguided short-range ballistic missile in a civilian area as a sign that `` Gadhafi and his regime are desperate . '' And an impassioned audio address by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi earlier this week in which he called on his people to `` be ready to fight to liberate our pure and good land '' could suggest he is under mounting pressure . The rebels themselves say they are now poised to seize the key town of al-Zawiya , which lies on a strategic supply route about 30 miles -LRB- 50 kilometers -RRB- to the west of Tripoli , and then to advance on the capital within days . Supporters outside the North African country are similarly optimistic . Dr. Mahmoud Traina , a 31-year-old Libyan-American cardiologist in southern California , called the rebel push into Zawiya in recent days `` a turning point , '' since Gadhafi had fought hard to maintain control of the coastal city . `` It shows the weakening of his regime , '' Traina , who was born in the Untied States but has family in Tripoli and Misrata , told CNN in a telephone interview . `` It cuts off his supply routes for his last remaining supply of fuel , and cuts supply lines for all products from Tunisia . '' He added : `` I think this is the end-game move before he 's out of power . At this point , it 's only a matter of time . '' But whether such hopes are well-founded is up for debate . Representatives of the Gadhafi government still maintain that it is doing well -- and analysts differ over what might happen next . Professor Malcolm Chalmers , a UK defense policy expert at the Royal United Services Institute in London , believes the military momentum is now with the rebels , after a period in which they made no advances . `` This has always been a war of attrition by NATO , based on the view that over time the capabilities of the regime would continue to diminish and at some stage -- especially since Gadhafi 's forces were having to fight on several fronts at once -- would start to crumble , '' he said . `` And indeed , that seems to be what 's happening . '' The progressive degrading of Gadhafi 's military capabilities by NATO strikes has levelled the playing field for the rebels , he said , who are also now benefiting from more access to funds . `` It 's become more and more difficult for -LRB- Gadhafi 's forces -RRB- to retake ground that they lose because their offensive weaponry is being destroyed , and their command and control ability is being destroyed , '' he said . If rebel gains mean the regime forces also lose their re-supply routes from Tunisia , as seems likely , `` that is going to accelerate the decline in military capability , '' Chalmers said , adding that he does not see them lasting `` more than one or two months , maybe less . '' However , Simon Henderson , a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , told CNN it was still too early to say whether the end-game was in sight . `` There has been so much to-ing and fro-ing in terms of advance and retreat by both sides , it 's hard to make the judgment at the moment that the opposition has made significant and permanent gains , '' he said . `` It 's still too early to say that the end of this is going to be a complete defeat of Gadhafi 's forces , '' he said , pointing to the fact that despite months of fighting the rebels have not managed to take Tripoli . `` It still seems as though Gadhafi is a long way from being pushed out , '' he said . Senior U.S. officials also caution that the rebels made real advances in the first months of the campaign , only to lose them and for the situation to remain stagnant for a while . The officials , who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity , say the current advances are `` significant , '' but that it remains to be seen how long Gadhafi can hang on and what supplies he still has . They say the end for Gadhafi 's regime could be tomorrow , or could still be a long way off . Nobody really wants to predict when it might come , they say -- but it wo n't be until people in Tripoli sense the end is near and rise up . Observers note that NATO action has been key to almost every significant gain the rebels have made so far in the five-month-old war -- and some question whether NATO is going beyond its mission of protecting the civilian population if it continues to target Gadhafi 's forces when they are on the defensive . Lavoie disputed that Tuesday , saying that the only side NATO took was `` the side of the people of Libya '' and that any targets hit were those that represented `` a threat to the local population . '' Although NATO says the rebels effectively control the territory around Tripoli , it is still by no means certain they can take the capital , a Gadhafi stronghold . After 42 years in power , the Libyan leader still commands the loyalty of many people and the city regularly witnesses large pro-Gadhafi rallies . While the rebels have now held towns along the way to Zawiya for the past few days , they have not so far been able completely to take control of Zawiya itself . And residents fleeing Tripoli told CNN they believed that if the rebels can not coordinate an attack from several fronts they will struggle to succeed , as almost all roads in and out of the capital are shut or heavily monitored by government forces . Nonetheless , Col. Ahmed Banni , military spokesman for the opposition National Transitional Council , said Tuesday that rebels hope to enter the capital by the end of the month . Rebel commander Col. Radwan Heid struck a similar note of optimism . `` These are the last days , God willing , '' he told CNN , referring to Gadhafi 's grip on the capital and the country as a whole . Morale among rebel troops in and around the western Nafusa mountains -- where NATO says local people feel safe enough from attacks by pro-Gadhafi forces to start to return -- also seems high , observers say . But a spokesman for Gadhafi , Ibrahim Musa , offered a different view this week . He said the government was `` doing very well '' despite problems with `` armed gangs '' in the coastal towns of Surman and Sabratha , which NATO said rebel forces had reached . `` God willing , we are able to lead this battle successfully . We will achieve peace and victory , '' Musa said . At a news conference Thursday , Libyan Prime Minister al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoodi said that the military is `` powerful enough to finish this battle '' to its advantage , but warned that the cost would be too high , calling again for dialogue to resolve the crisis peacefully rather than militarily . Al-Mahmoodi said the government 's call for a peaceful resolution comes from `` a position of power , not weakness ... we are able to continue the fight , but from the very beginning we chose peace . '' The government was currently in talks with all parties , he added . If the rebels ' military advances outstrip such diplomatic efforts , what might lie ahead for Libya ? Chalmers said that may hinge on whether people within the Gadhafi regime decide the game is up . `` One very plausible scenario for the next stage is that there will be people within the regime other than the Gadhafi family who seek to negotiate a cease-fire and a political settlement which involves the Gadhafi family leaving in some shape or form , but does n't involve a rebel military advance into Tripoli , '' he said . However , political divisions within the rebel ranks make it hard to be confident that they can form a credible national government even if they do achieve a military victory over Gadhafi 's government , Chalmers added . The big worry over the next month , he said , is that the regime simply collapses , leaving the country to fall into a mess of tribal rivalries and reprisals against government supporters , with Islamist groups also getting involved . `` It now looks as if the days of the Gadhafi regime itself are numbered , but who knows who will replace it ? '' Henderson agrees that the rebel forces `` still fail to impress . '' Their credibility was not improved by the murky killing last month of Gen. Abdul Fattah Younis in Benghazi , the city where the rebels ' Transitional National Council -LRB- TNC -RRB- is based , he said . `` They are far from being a united front and after the death of Younis they are short of professional leadership , '' Henderson said . Saad Djebbar , an international lawyer who negotiated the release in Scotland two years ago of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi , the man convicted of blowing up a Pan-Am flight over Lockerbie , believes it is vital to establish what he called a `` coalition of cultures '' which represents all regions , tribes and factions to ensure a stable Libya post-Gadhafi . He called on the international community to facilitate that coalition because `` Libyans do n't have the expertise to do it '' -- and told CNN Gadhafi is `` losing power by the minute . '' Omar Turbi , the Libyan-born president of a computer company who moved to the United States aged 18 and now lives in Laguna Beach , California , agrees that Gadhafi 's grip on power is weakening . The proximity of rebel forces to Gadhafi 's power base in Tripoli `` is a clear indication that he does n't have any fighting or any kind of power to fight , '' he said . Turbi , who says he works closely with the TNC in an unofficial capacity , said it planned efforts to prevent looting and reprisals once the Gadhafi regime falls . He speculated that the Gadhafi government would last no more than 30 days . `` We have a pretty strong feeling that something is up , '' he said . Maybe in a few days , things will start to crumble . '' Looking ahead , he said he hoped that any new government would incorporate all elements of Libyan society except for those with blood on their hands . `` Everyone in Libya should be welcomed back to take part in building the country or keeping the country together . '' Mansour El-Kikhia , 59 , a Libyan scholar and dissident , also predicted Gadhafi 's downfall within days . `` He 's going , he 's going down , '' he said . `` It 's just a matter of time , that 's all . I bet you , maybe 15 more days . '' Born in Benghazi , he left in 1977 to study in the United States and is now an associate professor and chairman of the Department of Political Science and Geography at the University of Texas , San Antonio . Recently , he visited relatives in Libya he had not seen in three decades . El-Kikhia predicted that Gadhafi will make any departure a messy one by firing missiles into oil fields in the rebel-held eastern reaches of the country and setting them afire . And he warned that with the main supply route for Gadhafi 's forces now closed , the humanitarian situation could rapidly worsen . Already , people in Tripoli are having problems , as shops are having difficulty getting goods and foodstuffs . `` It 's turning into being a disaster , '' he said . `` This really means that the rebels have to move fast .

It was a sight I could never have imagined in the 25 years I have studied Libya . But despite the recent rebel advances at Zawiyah , any expectation that the collapse of the Gadhafi regime is imminent - a statement made regularly by all of the NATO militaries now contributing resources to the anti-Gadhafi campaign - remains wishful thinking at this time . The Libyan uprising against the Gadhafi regime is now six months old , and there is no immediate end in sight . Long gone is U.S. President Barack Obama 's insistence that multilateral military action against Libya would be a matter `` of days , not weeks . '' For now , the scenarios most likely to bring the conflict to an end revolve around what many close observers refer to as `` catastrophic success '' - the sudden removal of Gadhafi by internal revolt or other means , which would leave a profound political and security vacuum - or extended negotiations between Tripoli and Benghazi led by a neutral interlocutor . The first seems unlikely for now , given the security measures that surround Gadhafi and the fierce loyalty of his immediate supporters . As for the second , although many sides have proposed road maps for talks between the rebels and the Gadhafi government , the prospect of direct negotiations remains distant . After all , road maps are of little value where roads are nonexistent . The two sides in Libya have put forward baseline demands that make a diplomatic solution unlikely : The rebels refuse to consider any negotiation that involves Gadhafi or anyone representing him , while Tripoli rejects any talks that would question Gadhafi 's legitimacy . Thus , it seems likely that conditions will have to get much worse before either side will blink . This leaves open the possibility that Libya 's civil war will be decided by a grinding , prolonged military conflict in which Gadhafi 's regime is gradually exhausted by NATO-supported rebel attacks . Conditions in Tripoli have already become uncomfortable for the Gadhafi government : supplies of food , gasoline , and even ordinary household items are in increasingly short supply . The regime might not have the resources to continue to buy loyalty for much longer . Although this may suggest that time favors the rebels , the killing of their rebel military commander , Abdul Fattah Younes , last month and the disarray that followed his death have shown that the rebels are plagued by their own internal divisions , which will only get worse as the conflict drags on . Put simply , the rebel government is in danger of losing strategic control over its campaign , with the climate of lawlessness and lack of control in eastern Libya threatening to upend whatever gains the rebels may make on the battlefield or in diplomatic circles . The press conference held by Mustapha Abdul-Jalil , the chairman of the National Transitional Council , in the wake of Younes ' death is just one example of the continuing weaknesses of the rebel government . As it fights to reunify the country , the NTC itself remains far from a truly integrated , unified movement . As Jalil spoke at the Tibesti Hotel , angry supporters of Younes emptied their guns into the hotel 's windows . For his part , rather than using the loss of Younes as a rallying call for greater unity , Jalil predictably blamed loyalist forces for the military commander 's death . The NTC was soon forced to recant this statement , however , when it became clear that an out-of-control militia on its own side was likely responsible . The fact that at the conference only members from Younes ' powerful tribe , the Obeidi , were seated around Jalil further belied the illusion that the NTC could function as neutral powerbroker and arbiter , not privileging one group or faction at the expense of others . Fearing retaliation , no top NTC members were present at the press conference or at Younes ' funeral the next morning . Although this does not necessarily mean that the rebels ' revolt will inevitably lead to inter-tribal fighting , as articles in The New York Times and elsewhere have suggested , it does illuminate one of the important fault lines : Powerful players in the country , in this case , a tribal group , need to be placated for fear of provoking unrest . The most problematic part of Jalil 's statement was his call to eliminate what he described as `` fifth columns , '' Gadhafi loyalists still active in eastern Libya . Such talk is dangerous and irresponsible in a place as lawless as eastern Libya , where retaliations , violence , and score settling remain common . Worst of all , as in all rebellions , trying to identify so-called fifth columns only antagonizes and alienates those people who are content to remain neutral but are forced willy-nilly to align themselves with the NTC and its policies for fear of being identified as traitors . Jalil 's speech was indicative of the unawareness and inexperience that the NTC continues to exhibit . In the aftermath of the killing , the picture in eastern Libya became both darker and more revealing . The temporary appointment of Suleiman Mahmoud al-Obeidi as the NTC 's new military commander and the dismissal of several individuals from the NTC 's executive committee were widely interpreted as a way to meet charges by the Obeidi tribe that part of the NTC had been complicit in Younes ' killing . For now , the changes have kept the peace , but the larger issue - that NTC structures and policies can be kept hostage to different groups ' interests - has been left unresolved . Although the focus on tribal rivalries took prominence after Younes ' death , several other fault lines are becoming increasingly visible : between those fighting on the front versus those staying behind in Benghazi , Libyans inside the country who have taken part in the uprising versus those outside the country , and rapidly organizing Islamists versus those with a more secular vision for Libya 's future . -LRB- Many rebels are also uneasy over the absence of Mahmoud Jibril , the NTC 's political leader , from the country ; he apparently has his own fears of assassination . -RRB- In all of this turmoil , the essential question for Libya 's future remains whether the NTC will continue to function as a credible , unified political movement , or whether its credibility will further decline as the civil war continues and other incidents inevitably reveal more internal cleavages ? In terms of organization and diplomacy , the NTC has made undeniable progress over the last two months . It has established offices in a number of major cities around the globe , and in July the International Contact Group for Libya -LRB- consisting of all the countries participating in the NATO-led campaign against Gadhafi -RRB- recognized it as the legitimate representative of Libya . Despite these successes , there are two almost contradictory sets of feelings palpable in Benghazi today . The first is one of invincibility and unwillingness to compromise , expressed by the soldiers doing the fighting and seen in the intransigence many NTC representatives have toward negotiations . The second is a lingering sense of uncertainty about the future ; no one will acknowledge this fear publicly , however , for fear of being considered disloyal . This uncertainty is caused by the sense that the NTC has so far spent much its time on procedural issues related to a new constitution and to other practical military , security , and social arrangements for a post-Gadhafi Libya . But many people in eastern Libya are afraid that these proto-state institutions will be increasingly undercut by spreading chaos and disagreements before their roots are allowed to take hold . One way the NTC could prevent the growing disarray that further civil war will bring would be to forge a compromise among its supporters for negotiations with Tripoli . In July , I took part in a workshop on negotiations in Benghazi , during which some NTC members , particularly those representing Tripoli , proved immovable . But ultimately they must remember that reconstructing Libya is not simply about creating the institutions of a future state , which , admittedly , the NTC has made good progress on . Instead , it is ultimately also about nation-building : instilling in Libyans a sense of unity and consensus , creating a common vision of what Libya should look like in the future , and of providing a sense of leadership to which most citizens can subscribe . And here the rebel leadership has faltered for a number of reasons : disagreements and suspicions rooted in the country 's history , the everyday constraints of waging a civil war , and the contradictory signals coming from the international community . Negotiating a way out of the current impasse before the civil war establishes a fait accompli would go a long way toward convincing many Libyans and the international community that the NTC has the courage and vision to compromise with its adversary . No matter how repugnant and seemingly unfair such a compromise would be - for example , that Gadhafi and those close to him are provided with immunity and are allowed to leave Libya - such a move would add to the NTC 's leadership credentials . It would also serve as one small but symbolically important step in setting Libya on its way toward the kind of national reconciliation that will need to follow any resolution of the conflict . The NTC should also realize that its current impasse over negotiations pales in comparison to its most difficult challenges in forging a united Libya , bringing the eastern and western parts of the country back together . Starting serious negotiations with Tripoli would be a significant step in creating a greater consensus - a step the United States and the international community should encourage , preferably through the UN special envoy to Libya , Abdul Ilah al-Khatib . If the rebels fail to overcome their growing fault lines and their reluctance to compromise , they may well win the war but lose the larger battle : the true unification of Libya as a modern state and nation , in which both former loyalists and former rebels can co-exist .

For months , rebel fighters -- who have controlled the eastern city of Benghazi and other areas -- have been trying to move closer toward Tripoli , in the west . They are seeking the ouster of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , who has ruled Libya for 42 years . International leaders have accused Gadhafi 's regime of committing human rights violations and killing civilians . Libyan officials have repeatedly accused NATO of killing civilians in airstrikes . Here are some key points CNN has reported in the conflict . Three days after the fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , calls go out on Facebook for peaceful demonstrations in Libya against leader Moammar Gadhafi . The Libyan leader , who has ruled over the country for more than four decades , voiced support for Mubarak during the Egyptian crisis . About 200 demonstrators protesting the arrest of a human activist take to the streets in the coastal city of Benghazi , witnesses say . Several of them are arrested amid confrontations with police . A highly placed source close to the Libyan government tells CNN , `` There is nothing serious here . These are just young people fighting each other . '' Libyan state television shows images of men chanting pro-Gadhafi slogans , waving flags and singing around the Libyan leader 's limousine as it creeps through Tripoli . In Benghazi , human rights groups and protesters claim they 're under attack by pro-government security forces . Among the tens of thousands of protesters who take to the streets , at least 20 people are killed and 200 are wounded , according to medical sources . Protests continue to turn violent , however the death and injury toll is unclear . In Benghazi , witnesses report bloody clashes with soldiers firing tear gas and bullets . Witnesses say protests have erupted in cities across the country . Human Rights Watch reports that 84 people have been killed in Libyan demonstrations since February 15 . Violence surges in Benghazi where a witness says protesters have taken control of the city and much of Tripoli . Gadhafi 's son Saif al-Islam Gadhafi appears on state television to warn demonstrators that the country could fall into civil war if their protests do not subside . The Libyan newspaper Quryna reports that the country 's justice minister has resigned to protest what he calls a `` bloody situation and use of excessive force '' by security forces against protesters .

The fighters hope to seize Zawiya , about 30 miles west of the capital , in an effort to advance on the capital of Tripoli in their fight to topple the Gadhafi regime that has controlled the North African country for decades . `` Most of Zawiya is now in rebel hands , but there are snipers and shelling coming from the east of the city , '' rebel commander Col. Radwan Fheid said . `` The snipers are near Zawiya hospital . They ca n't stay because of the shelling . These are the last days , God willing . '' Rebels are setting up checkpoints and field hospitals to treat the wounded , many of whom have been shot or struck by shrapnel . At a hospital in nearby Yefren , doctors said they had treated more than 200 patients over the past four days -- some of them rebel soldiers from any of several front lines , some of them civilians . Among the latter was a 9-year-old girl who was in her house when it was hit by a missile , sending shrapnel into her , a doctor said . `` Unfortunately , there is more than 90 % chance that she may lose her right arm here , '' he said . Medical staff said they were donating their own blood to keep their patients alive . One man , both legs wrapped in bandages , cried out in pain . Doctors said there were not enough staff members to properly take care of the patient load . Zawiya is west of Tripoli on a strategic supply route . Rebel control of Zawiya would represent a major advance toward putting a stranglehold on the Gadhafi-controlled seat of power . Col. Ahmed Banni , military spokesman for the opposition National Transitional Council , said Tuesday that rebels hope to enter the capital by the end of the month . The Obama administration has agreed to a NATO request for two additional Predator drones to conduct operations over Libya , a U.S. defense official said Wednesday , a day after the drones began flying . The United States has earmarked up to six drones for the Libya operation in recent months , although until generally only two drones have flown at any one time ; some have been armed with missiles . In Washington , the Libyan Embassy was officially re-opened Wednesday by its ambassador amid a crowd of proud Libyan Americans waving flags and singing Libyan songs . `` This embassy will serve as a symbol of the new Libya here in the U.S. , '' Ambassador Ali Aujali said outside the Watergate building in Washington where the embassy is located . `` We will work tirelessly not only to serve the needs of the Libyans studying , living and traveling in this country , but also to thank the United States government on behalf of the Libyan people everywhere for its continuing support for transition to a free and democratic nation . '' The mission now represents the Transitional National Council -LRB- TNC -RRB- , the rebel movement based in Benghazi , that the United States recognized as the rightful government of Libya on July 15 . The embassy was closed in March after the State Department expelled all diplomats loyal to Gadhafi . Aujali , who previously represented the Gadhafi regime in Washington , resigned his post in February , and has since represented the TNC in Washington . He was formally accredited as head of the Libyan mission last week . On Tuesday , Col. Roland Lavoie , a spokesman for NATO 's military operation , said that `` anti-Gadhafi forces are now assuming control of the key approaches to Tripoli . '' He described the advances as `` the most significant anti-Gadhafi territorial gain we have seen in months . '' Since the end of July , as the threat from pro-Gadhafi forces has diminished , thousands of people have returned to their homes in the western Nafusa mountains , he said . Since Friday , the northwest coastal city of Misrata has been free of pro-Gadhafi forces , he said . And the threat from nearby Zlitan has diminished as pro-Gadhafi forces are being pushed farther west , he added . Lavoie said rebels had occupied Surman and Sabratha west of Tripoli but added that the regions were `` still contested . '' However , Libyan state television reported that pro-Gadhafi forces and tribal fighters were `` cleansing the city of Sabratha from the gangs of traitors '' and had secured the coastal road , a key supply pipeline into Tripoli . Though the center of Zawiya was under rebel control , `` there 's still reports of fighting also in the suburbs , '' Lavoie said . A spokesman for the Gadhafi government offered a different view on Tuesday . `` We are doing very well , '' Ibrahim Musa said . `` It 's true that it 's a bit slow ; people are still saying that we 're not acting immediately and that we 're having problems in Surman and Sabratha and whatnot because of armed gangs . That 's true , but , God willing , we are able to lead this battle successfully . We will achieve peace and victory . '' He added , `` We are fighting NATO , not the tens or hundreds of armed gang members . Our war is with the crusaders . '' CNN 's Barbara Starr contributed to this story .

What was envisaged in March as a rapid engagement to prevent Moammar Gadhafi 's forces from razing Benghazi to the ground has evolved into a long slog . And increasingly NATO operations have dovetailed with those of the rebels -- with the aim of making pro-Gadhafi forces incapable of offensive action . The initial mandate set out by the United Nations Security Council resolution 1973 was to protect civilians under threat or attack , to enforce an arms embargo on the country and implement a no-fly zone . `` What was initially supposed to be a neutral intervention to protect civilians that were threatened specifically in Benghazi has morphed into being largely a one-sided affair to support the Libyan rebel force to overthrow Gadhafi , '' says Micah Zenko of the Council on Foreign Relations . Throughout the conflict NATO has continued to insist that all its actions are aimed at protecting civilians from pro-Gadhafi forces , and that it has not `` taken sides . '' On Thursday , the Royal Air Force spoke of `` precision strikes on former regime facilities at Sabratah -LRB- west of Tripoli -RRB- , including a commando base which had been used by Colonel Gadhafi 's men to launch numerous reprisals against the local people . '' But such missions are invariably close to areas where the rebels are trying to break through . In recent weeks , sustained NATO strikes around Brega , Misrata and in the western Nafusa mountains have helped tip the military balance in the rebels ' favor , to the point that Gadhafi 's opponents have become reluctant to enter the fray until air power has softened up the enemy . Derek Flood , a journalist and analyst with the Jamestown Foundation , has just spent several weeks in western Libya . `` I found the rebels had become almost overly dependent on NATO to the point they would n't act without NATO actually softening up the targets first . '' Rebels gaining ground in Tripoli Libyan rebels claim critical victory Video : Libyan rebels free prisoners Most recently , rebel efforts to take the vitally important town of Zawiyah , just 30 miles west of Tripoli , were preceded by several days of NATO sorties . NATO lists about a dozen `` key hits '' around Zawiyah in the past five days . The Royal Air Force also targeted a boat commandeered by several Libyan soldiers to get out of Zawiyah , but a statement said that `` since it was clear from their actions that these troops continued to pose a threat to the local population , the RAF patrol engaged the ship , '' which was destroyed . There appears to be growing coordination between NATO and rebel military commanders . Video footage emerged at the beginning of this month of a column of rebel tanks and pickup trucks , outside the city of Brega in eastern Libya , daubed with orange paint to distinguish them from government forces and ensure they were n't erroneously bombed . In previous days , NATO planes had hit several pro-regime targets around Brega . On a fluid battlefield , where military assets are poorly marked and often hidden in civilian areas , NATO needs forward air controllers to help with targeting . `` Western air forces do n't bomb without that direct ability to visualize the battlefield , especially when the regime has placed so many of its assets within civilian protected areas , '' Zenko says . NATO spokesman Colonel Roland Lavoie was pressed on the issue at a news briefing last month . `` NATO does not have direct coordination with opposition forces or rebel forces in Brega , '' he said . But he added : `` We follow the situation through allied information sources that are in the area . '' NATO wo n't comment on such arrangements . The arms embargo has been liberally interpreted by some , with Qatar and France supplying the rebels with weapons and military advice . Qatar is reported to have supplied the rebels with antitank missiles , flying them into Benghazi . And Derek Flood said he believes Qatar was also getting weapons to the rebels via the Tunisian border . In the western mountains `` there was support on the ground from Qatari officials as well as Emirati officials , '' he said . Tunisian officials deny weapons are crossing their border . Neither Qatar nor the United Arab Emirates have commented on such involvement . France acknowledged in June that it had air-dropped assault rifles and ammunition to Berber militia groups in the western mountains but said they were to help civilians protect themselves . At sea , NATO has operated a blockade -- in accordance with U.N. resolutions -- to prevent any resupply of Gadhafi forces . But in one instance in May a Canadian frigate stopped a rebel tugboat carrying howitzer rounds , ammunition and `` lots of explosives '' from Benghazi to Misrata . NATO commanders allowed the vessel to proceed on the grounds that it was moving from one Libyan port to another . More recently , there was the murky case of the oil tanker Cartagena , a vessel owned by the Libyan government but stranded at sea with 30,000 tons of gasoline since May . Rebels boarded the ship in international waters and diverted it to Benghazi with NATO permission . The unknown : Did the rebels have help in seizing the ship ? It 's not the sort of operation they are used to . NATO 's mission has shifted in another way . After hitting more than 3,000 military targets -- from ammunition dumps to tanks to radar and command-and-control facilities -- there are not many more left . So it has turned to the regime 's infrastructure . The satellite dishes of Libyan state TV were bombed on the grounds that the broadcaster was being used to `` incite violence . '' The radar at Tripoli airport also was taken out , and the sprawling Gadhafi compound in Tripoli has been targeted several times . NATO officials say operations will continue for as long as it takes , though how long it takes to do what is an open question . NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has said repeatedly that the conflict can only end with a political solution , but the outlines of such a solution are far from clear . Zenko says the goal from early on has been regime change , and the latest tactic is to try to cut off all economic and outside supplies to make it cease functioning . While the Libyan regime has lost access to much of the country and is losing critical routes to the east , west and south , Derek Flood says it appears to retain control of border crossings in the Sahara desert -- from Algeria , Chad and Niger . The military balance has tipped in the rebels ' favor . Flood says the capture by rebels of the important road junction at Gharyan 80 kilometers south of Tripoli can only further isolate the regime , cutting off fuel supplies from Algeria . Even so , it still controls large tracts of a vast country . NATO 's current mandate in Libya expires at the end of September . Its members may yet be asked to extend it once again .

Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim told CNN that Gadhafi and his family are staying in the country , countering rebel reports that the governments of Egypt , Morocco , Tunisia and Algeria have been asked to accept the family . U.S. and NATO officials also say they have no indication Gadhafi is making preparations to leave . Abdel Monem al-Houni , a representative of the rebel Transitional Council in Cairo , told CNN he was informed about the request by the Arab governments who received it . Rebels capture Zawiya oil refinery Kaim said the four governments could speak on their own behalf about the rebel claims . The reports come as U.S. officials say the embattled leader may be making preparations for a last stand in Tripoli as a months-long NATO air campaign continues amid reports of rebel advances . `` We believe he could be planning for a last stand , '' one U.S. official said . A second U.S. official confirmed a similar concern and said the Gadhafi plan could involve a final military offensive against civilians , launched from his last major strongholds around the Libyan capital . The officials , who have knowledge of the situation on the ground , did not want to be named because of the sensitive intelligence matters . In an address broadcast on Libyan state television Monday , Gadhafi urged supporters to take up arms and battle rebel forces . `` Move always forward to the challenge ; pick up your weapons ; go to the fight in order to liberate Libya inch by inch from the traitors and from NATO . Be prepared to fight if they hit the ground , '' Gadhafi said . Both U.S. officials emphasized that if a final push by Gadhafi happens , the United States does n't have a clear idea what form it could take . However , State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Friday that U.S. officials in Benghazi have been working with the Libyan opposition `` on exactly what it 's going to look like post-Gadhafi . '' `` Impossible to say when he 'll go , but it 's clear that he will go , '' Toner told CNN 's Brooke Baldwin . Meanwhile Friday , opposition forces said a former Libyan prime minister has left Tripoli and joined with rebels in the country 's western mountains . Abdel Salam Jalloud `` is in Zintan and he is a free man among the rebels , '' said Jumma Ibrahim , a spokesman for the Military Council of the Western Mountain Region , a rebel group . Kaim declined to confirm or deny the report . Jalloud was among members of Gadhafi 's inner-circle responsible for the 1969 coup that put Gadhafi into power . Jalloud fell out of favor with the regime in the mid-1990s . The speculation over a Gadhafi `` last stand '' comes as his troops are battling rebel forces on a number of fronts , including in the west , where fighting has raged for days over the strategic city of Zawiya , about 30 miles west of Tripoli and a major supply route to the capital . Fierce artillery fire could be heard around Zawiya on Friday . Rebels took a major oil refinery there , said Hobab Jomaa , a rebel fighter . They were in control of the western part of the city , but battles continued in the eastern part , he said . When asked when rebels might begin their move toward Tripoli , one fighter in Zawiya told CNN 's Sara Sidner , `` Two days , maybe by the end of the week . '' `` They are becoming more emboldened , '' Sidner said of the rebels . `` They feel like they can really have a chance at Tripoli . '' The International Organization for Migration said Friday that it is working to evacuate an unknown number of foreign nationals from Tripoli and other western cities `` who are increasingly vulnerable and now want to leave . '' Government spokesman Musa Ibrahim downplayed the movements Friday , saying rebel supply lines have been cut off from the coast and from the south , rendering them unable to advance . `` We have paid a heavy price , and we have nothing in front of us except the prize , and the prize is victory over those traitors who collaborated with the crusader enemy and transformed Libya into a bloodbath , '' Ibrahim said . Meanwhile , a NATO airstrike destroyed the home of Abdullah al-Sanussi , the head of Libya 's intelligence service and a brother-in-law of Gadhafi 's , neighbors and Libyan government officials said Friday . The strike also destroyed a school and medical store , neighbors and officials said . One person -- not al-Sanussi -- was killed , they said . In June , the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for al-Sanussi along with Gadhafi and his son Saif al-Islam for actions taken as a popular uprising morphed into civil war . The warrants are for `` crimes against humanity , '' including murder and persecution committed in Libya in February `` through the state apparatus and security forces . '' Gadhafi 's government has rejected the court 's authority . The attack on al-Sanussi 's house followed a NATO airstrike Thursday night that killed a brother of Ibrahim , the government spokesman , a Libyan government official said . Hasan Ali Ibrahim , a younger brother of Musa Ibrahim , was working as a civilian volunteer for the Gadhafi government , the official said .

For months , rebel fighters -- who have controlled the eastern city of Benghazi and other areas -- have been trying to move closer toward Tripoli , in the west . They are seeking the ouster of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , who has ruled Libya for 42 years . International leaders have accused Gadhafi 's regime of committing human rights violations and killing civilians . Libyan officials have repeatedly accused NATO of killing civilians in airstrikes . Here are some key points CNN has reported in the conflict . Three days after the fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , calls go out on Facebook for peaceful demonstrations in Libya against leader Moammar Gadhafi . The Libyan leader , who has ruled over the country for more than four decades , voiced support for Mubarak during the Egyptian crisis . About 200 demonstrators protesting the arrest of a human activist take to the streets in the coastal city of Benghazi , witnesses say . Several of them are arrested amid confrontations with police . A highly placed source close to the Libyan government tells CNN , `` There is nothing serious here . These are just young people fighting each other . '' Libyan state television shows images of men chanting pro-Gadhafi slogans , waving flags and singing around the Libyan leader 's limousine as it creeps through Tripoli . In Benghazi , human rights groups and protesters claim they 're under attack by pro-government security forces . Among the tens of thousands of protesters who take to the streets , at least 20 people are killed and 200 are wounded , according to medical sources . Protests continue to turn violent , however the death and injury toll is unclear . In Benghazi , witnesses report bloody clashes with soldiers firing tear gas and bullets . Witnesses say protests have erupted in cities across the country . Human Rights Watch reports that 84 people have been killed in Libyan demonstrations since February 15 . Violence surges in Benghazi where a witness says protesters have taken control of the city and much of Tripoli . Gadhafi 's son Saif al-Islam Gadhafi appears on state television to warn demonstrators that the country could fall into civil war if their protests do not subside . The Libyan newspaper Quryna reports that the country 's justice minister has resigned to protest what he calls a `` bloody situation and use of excessive force '' by security forces against protesters . Gadhafi appears on television to dispel rumors that he has fled the country , vowing he will never leave Libya , and `` will die as a martyr at the end . '' The United Nations Security Council issues a statement saying it `` condemned the violence and use of force against civilians , deplored the repression against peaceful demonstrators and expressed deep regret at the deaths of hundreds of civilians '' in Libya . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemns what he calls `` egregious violations '' of human rights as Libya tries to crush an ongoing revolt , telling reporters that those who have shed `` the blood of innocents '' must face punishment . U.S. President Barack Obama signs an executive order freezing Moammar Gadhafi 's assets . The United Nations Security Council imposes sanctions against Libya , including an arms embargo , asset freeze and travel bans for Gadhafi and his associates . It also refers Gadhafi to the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity . The opposition movement announces that it has picked a leader : former Justice Minister Mustafa Abdul Jalil . The European Union bans the sale of arms and ammunition to Libya and freezes the assets of Gadhafi and five members of his family , while imposing a visa ban on Gadhafi and 15 other people tied to the regime 's crackdown . The United Nations General Assembly adopts a resolution to oust Libya from its seat on the 47-member Human Rights Council . NATO begins round-the-clock surveillance flights of Libya as it considers various options for dealing with escalating violence there . The United Nations Security Council votes to impose a no-fly zone over Libya and take `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians . The resolution is approved with 10 votes , including those of the United States and the United Kingdom . There are no opposing votes on the 15-member council , but China , Russia , Germany , India and Brazil abstain . Germany says it is concerned about a protracted military conflict . Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa says the country has decided on `` an immediate cease-fire and the stoppage of all military operations . '' But sources inside Libya say violence continues . French , British and American military forces begin the first phase of operation `` Odyssey Dawn , '' aimed at enforcing the no-fly zone . More than 110 Tomahawk missiles fired from American and British ships and submarines hit about 20 Libyan air and missile defense targets , U.S. Vice Adm. William Gortney says at a Pentagon briefing . The operation is meant `` to deny the Libyan regime from using force against its own people , '' Gortney says . Gadhafi , speaking on Libyan state TV , says the U.N. charter provides for Libya 's right to defend itself in a `` war zone . '' Weapons depots will be opened , he says . `` All you people of the Islamic nations and Africa , and Latin America and Asia , stand with the Libyan people in its fight against this aggression , '' Gadhafi said . NATO agrees to take command of the mission enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya . A Libyan woman with bruises all over her body bursts into a Tripoli hotel housing international journalists , shouting that she was taken from a checkpoint and held for two days while 15 of Gadhafi 's militiamen beat and raped her . `` Look at what Gadhafi 's brigades did to me , '' Eman al-Obeidy says before government officials and hotel staff whisk her outside to car and drive her away . She is not heard from for more than a week . The Libyan government says al-Obeidy is mentally ill and drunk . Officials call her a prostitute . Later , the government changes its story and says the men accused of raping al-Obeidy are being investigated , but the suspects , in turn , file counter-charges for slander . Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa arrives in the United Kingdom and tells the government there that he has resigned . NATO announces that it has begun Operation Unified Protector in Libya , including an arms embargo , a no-fly zone , and `` actions to protect civilians and civilian centers . '' Gadhafi urges U.S. President Barack Obama to end the NATO bombing of his war-torn country , making an appeal in a letter to the American president . Gadhafi asks Obama to stop what he calls the `` unjust war against a small people of a developing country , '' adding that those in the opposition are terrorists and members of al Qaeda , the official said . In a speech , Gadhafi urges NATO to negotiate an end to airstrikes , accusing the international coalition of killing civilians and destroying the nation 's infrastructure in a bid to take over its oil production . NATO launches a missile attack on a house in Tripoli . The attack kills one of Gadhafi 's sons , Saif al-Arab Gadhafi , and several of his grandchildren . Al-Obeidy , who garnered worldwide attention for her vocal rape allegations against Gadhafi 's regime , says she has fled Libya , fearing for her safety . She tells CNN that she has crossed into Tunisia with the help of a defecting military officer and his family . A month later , she finds temporary sanctuary in Qatar before being deported back to Libya . The European Union opens an office in the rebel-held Libyan city of Benghazi . Several countries , including Spain and Germany are among the country 's that recognize the opposition Transitional National Council as Libya 's legitimate representative . NATO announces that it is extending its mission in Libya for 90 days . Libya 's oil minister defects to Italy and tells CNN he left because the suffering of the country 's people had become unbearable . South African President Jacob Zuma lashes out at NATO , arguing that the organization is misusing the United Nations resolution meant to protect civilians `` for regime change , political assassinations and foreign military occupation . '' The International Criminal Court issues arrest warrants for Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , his son Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , and his brother-in-law Abdullah al-Sanussi . The warrants are `` for crimes against humanity , '' including murder and persecution , `` allegedly committed across Libya '' from February 15 through `` at least '' February 28 , `` through the state apparatus and security forces , '' the court says in a news release . The United States and the United Kingdom join countries recognizing the Transitional National Council as `` the legitimate governing authority '' in Libya . After being granted asylum in the United States , al-Obeidy arrives in New York , then boards a flight to the destination where she will reside . Her arrival in the United States comes after she spends 54 days in a U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees facility in Romania . Rebel leaders announce that the commander of Libya 's rebel army was assassinated in Benghazi along with two senior officers , just hours after claiming big successes on the battlefield . Libyan Transitional National Council Chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil dismissed the rebels ' 14-member executive board , a spokesman for the council says . Gadhafi urges Libyans to fight opposition forces and `` cleanse this sweet and honorable land . '' In a speech broadcast on state television , Gadhafi says : `` The strikes will be over and NATO will be defeated . Move always forward to the challenge ; pick up your weapons ; go to the fight in order to liberate Libya inch by inch from the traitors and from NATO . Be prepared to fight if they hit the ground . '' Col. Roland Lavoie , a spokesman for NATO 's military operation , tells reporters that `` anti-Gadhafi forces are now assuming control of the key approaches to Tripoli . '' A spokesman for the Gadhafi government offers a different view . `` We are doing very well , '' spokesman Musa Ibrahim says . Libyan Prime Minister al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoodi says the military is `` powerful enough to finish this battle '' to its advantage , but warned that the cost would be too high , calling again for dialogue to resolve the crisis peacefully rather than militarily . Meanwhile , a brother of Moussa Ibrahim , the spokesman for the government in Tripoli , was killed Thursday night by NATO aircraft , a Libyan government official said . U.S. officials say Gadhafi may be making preparations for a `` last stand '' in Tripoli as a month-long NATO air campaign continues amid reports of rebel advances . Libyan rebels have taken their fight inside Tripoli , home to the embattled Libyan leader , a rebel spokesman says . Government spokesman Musa Ibrahim insists that all is safe and well . He says that the Libyan capital remains under government control . Libyan officials reject rebel claims that Gadhafi is seeking refuge for his family , saying that neither the leader nor his wife and children plan to leave the country . Faithi Baja , political affairs chief for the rebels ' Transitional National Council , said in a video statement that the rebel fighters ' freshly launched operation inside Tripoli is `` going easily '' and that they are inching toward Gadhafi 's Bab al-Azizia compound . But Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , a son of the country 's ruler and a top official in his regime , insisted on Libyan state-run television that the rebels were losing every battle .

CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : Hey , and thank you for joining us ! I 'm Carl Azuz , launching you into CNN Student News ! If you were with us last week , it 's great to have you back . If this is your first day , welcome to our 2011-2012 coverage . First Up : Crisis in Libya AZUZ : First up today , two very different views on how the civil war is going in the north African nation of Libya . This conflict started months ago . Longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi and his forces are fighting against rebels who want Gadhafi out . Other countries are involved in this , too , as part of a NATO mission to protect Libya 's civilians . There were reports that hundreds of people were killed yesterday during fighting in and around the Libyan capital , Tripoli . The rebels say they 're making significant progress , advancing toward Gadhafi 's headquarters . But the Libyan government says the rebels are losing every battle . Colonel Gadhafi went on the radio Sunday , urging his supporters to continue their fight . A CNN crew that 's been in Libya for weeks said this weekend 's fighting in Tripoli seemed to be the most intense fighting yet in the capital city . AZUZ : Violence increasing in another conflict , meanwhile , this one in the Middle East . It started with a series of attacks on Israeli civilians and soldiers on Thursday , and it 's turned into days of fighting between Israelis and Palestinians . These two groups have clashed for decades . And two regions -- Gaza and the West Bank -- have traditionally been at the center of those clashes . At least eight Israelis were killed in the attacks on Thursday . Israel then launched air strikes against what it called `` terrorist targets '' in Gaza . And in response , say Israeli officials , around 100 rockets have been fired into Israel . You can see some of the damage from those in this video . Israel 's government says it will respond to any attempt to harm Israeli civilians or soldiers . Palestinian officials are urging Israel to stop what it calls the `` unjustified aggression '' against the Palestinians in Gaza . STAN CASE , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Is this legit ? Storms in the Atlantic Ocean are given names when they become hurricanes . They get names when they are classified as tropical storms , which is one level below a hurricane . AZUZ : The 9th storm to get a name might be the first hurricane of the 2011 Atlantic season . Forecasters predict that Tropical Storm Irene is picking up strength as it moves toward islands in the Caribbean Sea . On Sunday afternoon , Irene had wind speeds around 50 miles per hour . Wo n't be considered a hurricane until those wind speeds reach 74 miles per hour . Experts think that could happen very soon . Officials announced hurricane warnings for Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic yesterday . Some predictions estimated that Irene could dump up to 20 inches of rain on parts of the Dominican Republic . There 's concern that heavy rain could trigger mudslides there ; that has happened before . AZUZ : Vice President Joe Biden has finished a trip to China . But this was the scene when he arrived in the country last Wednesday . He was there for five days meeting with Chinese leaders , and the biggest issue discussed during his visit was the U.S. economy . China has bought more U.S. debt that any other foreign country . So , officials there are concerned about America 's ability to manage that debt . During one speech , Vice President Biden explained why it 's important for the U.S. to protect Chinese and American investors . U.S. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN : I read that some Chinese are concerned about your safety of your investments in American assets . But please understand no one cares more about this than we do , since Americans own 87 % of all our financial assets and 69 % of all our treasury bonds , while China owns 1 % of our financial assets and 8 % of our treasury bills , respectively . AZUZ : All right , shifting gears now . About 1.6 billion people -- just over a fifth of the world 's population -- are Muslim . And we 're in the middle of the most sacred time on the Muslim calendar . It 's called Ramadan , and it lasts for an entire month . Although there are disagreements about when exactly that month starts . Dan Gilgoff explains that -- and more -- about this observance . DAN GILGOFF , CNN.COM RELIGION EDITOR : Ramadan is the Islamic month of fasting . It 's meant to be a month of reflection , prayer and charity , detachment from worldly affairs . A month of purification . It 's one of the 5 pillars , or duties , of Islam . Ramadan is believed to be the month during which the prophet Mohammed started receiving the divine revelation , the Quran , or the Muslim holy book , from God , or Allah . And so , the most holy night during Ramadan -- and of the entire Islamic year -- is called the night of power , and that 's the night which it is believed that Allah did start to reveal the text of the Quran to the prophet Mohammed in the year 610 . Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar . And the Islamic calendar operates according to the lunar cycle , the cycle of the moon . And so every year , Ramadan moves up around 11 days earlier than the previous year . It 's supposed to begin with the sighting of the first new moon of that cycle . And every year , there are debates about when that first new moon becomes visible , so that various countries believe that they see the first new moon on various days and Ramadan will begin on different days in different countries . The fast is broken each night with what 's called the iftar meal , and it 's a meal that 's often times communal or banquet-style meal that 's eaten in a mosque . The fast each night is often broken with dates , which is believed to have dated to the time of Mohammed . Every year during Ramadan the international sale of dates just skyrockets . The month of Ramadan ends with the holiday called Eid ul-Fitr . It 's often simply just referred to as Eid . It is the start of the next lunar month after Ramadan . It 's a break the fast holiday that 's marked by a lot of celebrations and feasting with friends and families . A lot of mosques hold carnivals for a couple of days after Ramadan ends . TOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Time for the Shoutout ! What historic figure once said , `` out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope '' ? If you think you know it , shout it out ! Was it : A -RRB- Queen Elizabeth II , B -RRB- Martin Luther King Jr. , C -RRB- John F. Kennedy or D -RRB- Mahatma Gandhi ? You 've got three seconds -- GO ! That phrase was part of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 's famous `` I Have a Dream '' speech in 1963 . That 's your answer and that 's your Shoutout ! AZUZ : When Dr. King gave that speech , he was standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial . Now , the civil rights leader will have his own memorial in the nation 's capital . The dedication ceremony being scheduled for next week . But we 've got a little virtual tour for you right now . The entrance , with the two stones that have been separated , is meant to symbolize the mountain of despair that Doctor King was talking about . And the single boulder inside is meant to be the stone of hope . There 's also an inscription wall inside the memorial featuring more than a dozen of Dr. Martin Luther King 's most famous quotations . AZUZ : Dr. King will join the other famous Americans who have memorials in Washington , D.C. . The question we 're asking on our blog is who else do you think should be honored with a national memorial ? Tell us your choices and your reasons why . We 're looking forward to your ideas . But please remember , it 's first names only on the blog . AZUZ : This Ohio mailman is used to delivering greetings to people on his route . Last week , he was the one getting the special greetings from all of them . That is because he was back home and delivering mail after spending a year serving in the Army National Guard in Afghanistan . Rob Lustig said he was overwhelmed by the homecoming . ROB LUSTIG , MAILMAN , AFGHAN WAR VETERAN , ARMY NATIONAL GUARD : I ca n't keep a smile off my face , because every time I look around there 's another sign . How are you doing ? I just want to thank my customers for the support and the balloons and their generosity and thoughtfulness . It makes me feel good . AZUZ : Makes us feel good , too . We 're going to stay in Ohio for today 's Before We Go segment and visit a national food festival . But these contestants are n't bobbing for apples . They 're bobbing for burgers ! And they 're doing it in a kiddie pool filled with ketchup . It 's just one of the competitions at the National Hamburger Festival . Another event : the hamburger eating contest . The winner there gobbled up a quarter pounder and 10 patties in five minutes . AZUZ : A victory like that deserves a patty on the back . It looks like there 's an a-bun-dance of fun going on there . We just hope you 'll ketchup with us tomorrow for more CNN Student News tomorrow . Man , these puns are making me hungry . I 'm Carl Azuz . Have a great day .

Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , the ruler 's son and a top official in his regime , insisted on Libyan state-run television that the rebels were losing every battle -- saying so hours after his father told supporters that the `` traitors '' and their NATO allies were lying and nearing their end . This perspective , however , contrasted with reports from CNN reporters , witnesses and rebel officials that government forces continued to lose ground all around the North African nation and faced fresh attacks in the capital . Faithi Baja , political affairs chief for the rebel 's Transitional National Council , said early Sunday in a video statement that rebel fighters freshly launched operation inside Tripoli is `` going easily '' and they are inching toward Gadhafi 's Bab al-Azizia compound . Rebels capture Zawiya oil refinery `` The revolution from inside Tripoli has officially started -LRB- Saturday -RRB- evening in many parts ... of Tripoli , and is expected to spread to all of Tripoli , '' Jumma Ibrahim , a rebel spokesman from the western mountain region around Zintan , said hours earlier . Heavy clashes broke out Saturday night in at least one neighborhood in Tripoli , marked by intense gunfire , explosions and people screaming as they ran through the street , a resident told CNN . Gunfire and explosions have become normal occurrences in the capital , but CNN personnel on the ground for weeks report that the fighting appeared to be among the most intense yet . `` Most of the neighhoods in Tripoli are rising up , '' Jumma Ibrahim said . But speaking just before midnight in Tripoli , government spokesman Musa Ibrahim insisted that all is safe and `` in excellent condition . '' He said that the Libyan capital remains under government control , adding that the nearby highways remain open . He blamed small groups of `` armed gangs '' -- a term that Gadhafi loyalists have frequently applied to rebels -- for the blasts and gunfire heard overnight Saturday inside Tripoli . He insisted that government forces had put down the fighters `` within half an hour , '' making the statement at the same time gunfire continued to crackle intermittently around the capital . About two hours later , Moammar Gadhafi echoed his spokesman in claiming rebel officials were lying about the situation in Tripoli and beyond while predicting the six-month-long conflict would climax soon . In his audio address , broadcast on state-run TV , the Libyan leader blasted the rebel `` traitors '' and the NATO forces backing them as unethical and intent on destroying the county and ruining lives . And as he had done in a speech six days earlier , he tried to rally citizens to his side . `` A great thing , anyway , that despite the Christian air raids , you continue to be up in Tripoli , '' he said , an apparent reference to those who listened to his speech from Green Square . `` March forward , march forward , march forward . ` Mayhem has broken out in Tripoli ' Libya rejects rebel claims about Gadhafi What could Libya be after Gadhafi ? `` They have lost and used everything , and their last resort is their lying campaign . Now , this is the ending , '' he added . The rebel spokesman , Jumma Ibrahim , claimed opposition fighters control the main intelligence operations building in Tripoli . He also said some Libyan army personnel had defected and joined the rebels in the vicinity of the capital 's airport , which he claimed the rebels were able to take over with their newfound support . Musa Ibrahim , the government spokesman , denied that the airport had switched hands -- insisting , as with the rest of Tripoli , it was safe and under the control of Gadhafi 's forces . CNN could not immediately confirm how significant the fighting was , including whether rebel fighters had taken control of any parts of the city , including the airport . Jumma Ibrahim , the rebel spokesman , said the clashes in Tripoli were `` planned by rebels inside Tripoli in the neighborhoods of Fashloum , Souq al-Juma , Ben Ashur ... and other places . '' This came after coordination with other anti-Gadhafi elements , added Baja . Musa Ibrahim confirmed that armed men had entered those three neighborhoods in the capital , but said they were confronted and defeated in a matter of minutes . Hours earlier , Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim rejected rebel claims that the governments of Egypt , Morocco , Tunisia and Algeria have been asked to accept Gadhafi and his family . And Gadhafi , in his speech early Sunday morning , stated unequivocally that he is still in Libya . Officials from the United States and NATO , whose forces have launched scores of strikes on Gadhafi 's forces , also said they have no indication the Libyan leader is making preparations to leave . Whatever his next move , international pressure on Gadhafi appears to be growing . Tunisia -- Libya 's western neighbor that , until now , had been neutral in the conflict -- joined a host of other nations in recognizing the Transitional National Council as Libya 's legitimate government . A U.S. official said Friday that Gadhafi might be preparing for a `` last stand '' in Tripoli as a months-long NATO air campaign continues amid reports of rebel advances . A second U.S. official said the longtime leader 's plan could involve a final military offensive against civilians , launched from his last major strongholds around the Libyan capital . The officials , who have knowledge of the situation on the ground , did not want to be named because of the sensitive intelligence matters . While uncertain of how upcoming events will unfold , State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Friday that U.S. officials in Benghazi have been working with the Libyan opposition `` on exactly what it 's going to look like post-Gadhafi . '' `` Impossible to say when he 'll go , but it 's clear that he will go , '' Toner told CNN . The fighting continues , meanwhile , on a number of fronts , including in the west , where fighting has raged for days over the strategic city of Zawiya , about 30 miles west of Tripoli and a major supply route to the capital . On Saturday , it appeared the rebels had taken control of all of Zawiya after pushing Gadhafi 's forces beyond the east gate , according to CNN 's Sara Sidner who is in the city . Artillery fire could be heard , and mortars were launched toward Zawiya on Saturday , she reported . Rebel fighters told Sidner that NATO had warned civilians to leave the main part of the city . NATO has not yet commented on that statement . Musa Ibrahim , the Libyan government spokesman , said late Saturday that Gadhafi 's forces are surrounding Zawiya and still control it . Earlier , the rebels seized a major oil refinery in Zawiya and controlled only the western part of the city , said Hobab Jomaa , a rebel fighter . But Saif al-Islam Gadhafi sarcastically laughed at the idea the opposition would take Tripoli . And he was emphatic that he , his father and their supporters would not surrender . `` We are in our land , in our country , '' he said . `` We have no problem if it takes six months , one year or two years -- victory will be ours . This is our country , and we will not leave it .
