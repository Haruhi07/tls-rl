{'source': [('Case study : Gulf of Mexico oil spill and BP On 20 April 2010 a deepwater oil well exploded in the Gulf of Mexico . The immediate effect was that it killed 11 people and injured 17 others . Oil leaked at a high rate which is difficult to calculate . Some estimates are around 40,000 barrels a day . The oil spill posed risks to the environment and affected local industry ',), ("By Richard Black Environment correspondent , BBC News The already threatened manatee could be a casualty of the oil leak How bad will the Gulf of Mexico oil spill turn out to be - for wildlife and for people whose jobs depend on wildlife , such as fishermen ? At the moment , the only completely accurate answer would appear to be : we do not know . For David Kennedy from the US National Ocean Service , it is `` a very very significant event , and of great concern '' . But Clifford Jones , an oil and gas engineering specialist from the UK 's Aberdeen University , suggests it should not be considered in the same category as the Exxon Valdez spill of 1989 , with which it is regularly being compared . It is a threat to the ecosystem , he allows , but says the Exxon Valdez leaked significantly more oil than is likely to flow from the stricken Deepwater Horizons drillsite before pressure in the well drops and stops forcing the oil out .

The prediction this year for the Atlantic is for an `` active to extremely active '' hurricane season , which officially began on 1 June . According to the US 's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , there is a 70 % chance of eight to 14 hurricanes , of which between three and seven could be major hurricanes with winds of more than 111mph -LRB- 179km\\/h -RRB- . I 'm of the belief that hurricanes are Mother Nature 's dispersant '' End Quote Prof Ed Overton Environmental scientist Apart from the possibility of damage and loss of life unrelated to the oil spill , there is a very obvious downside to hurricanes passing near the source of the oil spill . A hurricane would clearly disrupt the efforts to stop the leak , although BP has a plan to install a device in order to quickly disconnect and reconnect the link down to the spill site in high winds .

Some of the oil will be picked up by skimmers Oil which has not been dispersed or washed up on shore will be targeted by microbes . `` They use the oil as a food , '' says Prof Overton .

It exceeds the 1979 Ixtoc I leak - also in the Gulf of Mexico . It 's comfortably bigger than tanker releases such as the Torrey Canyon and Amoco Cadiz , and 20 times the size of the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill with which it is often compared . Now that BP finally appears to have the flow under control , an important question - perhaps the most important of all - is being asked : it may have been the biggest , but was it the worst ? It is a simple-sounding question , but devilishly hard to answer . What impacts are we talking about - on the coast , on the ocean surface , or the sea floor ? Which species are we including - fish , shrimp , insects , plants , birds , whales , turtles - or some combination of them all ?

The Plaquemines Parish Inland Waterways Strike Force claims oil was spotted in pictures of the dead fish . The group is now attempting to find if the BP oil spill was connected to the incident , known as a `` fish kill '' .

{'source': [('Case study : Gulf of Mexico oil spill and BP On 20 April 2010 a deepwater oil well exploded in the Gulf of Mexico . The immediate effect was that it killed 11 people and injured 17 others . Oil leaked at a high rate which is difficult to calculate . Some estimates are around 40,000 barrels a day . The oil spill posed risks to the environment and affected local industry ',), ("By Richard Black Environment correspondent , BBC News The already threatened manatee could be a casualty of the oil leak How bad will the Gulf of Mexico oil spill turn out to be - for wildlife and for people whose jobs depend on wildlife , such as fishermen ? At the moment , the only completely accurate answer would appear to be : we do not know . For David Kennedy from the US National Ocean Service , it is `` a very very significant event , and of great concern '' . But Clifford Jones , an oil and gas engineering specialist from the UK 's Aberdeen University , suggests it should not be considered in the same category as the Exxon Valdez spill of 1989 , with which it is regularly being compared . It is a threat to the ecosystem , he allows , but says the Exxon Valdez leaked significantly more oil than is likely to flow from the stricken Deepwater Horizons drillsite before pressure in the well drops and stops forcing the oil out . We have to hope for the best , but prepare for the worst , including a true catastrophe for birds '' End Quote Melanie Driscoll National Audubon Society There is no doubt that the oil is coming out much more slowly than is normal from a tanker spill ",), ("By Finlo Rohrer BBC News , Washington Some experts believe high winds could cause helpful dispersal The fight continues to stem the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , but could the arrival of the annual hurricane season make things worse ? The prediction this year for the Atlantic is for an `` active to extremely active '' hurricane season , which officially began on 1 June . According to the US 's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , there is a 70 % chance of eight to 14 hurricanes , of which between three and seven could be major hurricanes with winds of more than 111mph -LRB- 179km\\/h -RRB- . I 'm of the belief that hurricanes are Mother Nature 's dispersant '' End Quote Prof Ed Overton Environmental scientist Apart from the possibility of damage and loss of life unrelated to the oil spill , there is a very obvious downside to hurricanes passing near the source of the oil spill . A hurricane would clearly disrupt the efforts to stop the leak , although BP has a plan to install a device in order to quickly disconnect and reconnect the link down to the spill site in high winds . On shore , tasks like the laying of boom and rescue of wildlife would become more problematic ",), ("By Finlo Rohrer BBC News , Washington There have been many devastating images from the Gulf WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE OIL ? `` The good news is that oil is a natural product and is relatively easily degraded , '' says Prof Ed Overton , an environmental scientist at Louisiana State University . Some of the oil will be picked up by skimmers Oil which has not been dispersed or washed up on shore will be targeted by microbes . `` They use the oil as a food , '' says Prof Overton . There is an advantage in that the spill happened in the warm Gulf of Mexico , where conditions are good for decomposition . In colder climes , things can be harder ",), ("By Richard Black Environment correspondent , BBC News The oil has covered waters key to creatures such as crabs Following release of the US government 's latest estimate , the Deepwater Horizon disaster is confirmed as the biggest ever accidental release of oil into the oceans . It exceeds the 1979 Ixtoc I leak - also in the Gulf of Mexico . It 's comfortably bigger than tanker releases such as the Torrey Canyon and Amoco Cadiz , and 20 times the size of the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill with which it is often compared . Now that BP finally appears to have the flow under control , an important question - perhaps the most important of all - is being asked : it may have been the biggest , but was it the worst ? It is a simple-sounding question , but devilishly hard to answer . What impacts are we talking about - on the coast , on the ocean surface , or the sea floor ? Which species are we including - fish , shrimp , insects , plants , birds , whales , turtles - or some combination of them all ? Are we looking long-term or short-term , local or regional - and are we to include or exclude impacts from the use of chemical dispersants and fires and the other containment measures ? One thing that is clear is that different parts of the Gulf coast have seen very different levels of impact ",), ("Louisiana fish deaths raise oil spill questions The dead fish found at Bayou Chaland in Plaquemines Parish , Louisiana , include pogies , redfish , drum , crabs , shrimp and freshwater eel , officials say Officials in Louisiana 's Plaquemines Parish have called for an investigation after finding hundreds of thousands of dead fish near the Mississippi River . The Plaquemines Parish Inland Waterways Strike Force claims oil was spotted in pictures of the dead fish . The group is now attempting to find if the BP oil spill was connected to the incident , known as a `` fish kill '' . The cause of the fish kill has not been determined , but such events typically happen due to depleted oxygen levels . The types of fish affected at Bayou Chaland , near the mouth of the Mississippi River , include pogies , redfish , drum , crabs , shrimp and freshwater eel , Plaquemines Parish officials said ",), ("It took Louisiana 's oyster industry years to recover from Hurricane Katrina Louisiana 's oyster beds have not recovered from the US 's worst environmental catastrophe , the Deepwater Horizon oil-rig disaster , and some fishermen fear they never will . We were fishing at the end of the world - or at least a place that felt like it . Grand Isle is one of the final precarious fragments of land where the myriad bayous of the Mississippi delta give way to the open water of the Gulf of Mexico . Around us , hungry frigate birds watched as we headed for the oyster beds .

The Arctic contains vast stores of methane , and its release could quickly accelerate warming around the world . But scientists caution that the regions are very different . The research ship Pisces , operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- Noaa -RRB- , made several voyages into the Gulf in the months following the leak . `` There were thousands of different types of molecule coming out of the well , and by far the most abundant was methane , '' said research leader John Kessler , from Texas A and M University ",)], 'input_ids_dict': {'input_ids': tensor([[[6174,  692,  110,  ...,  526,  115,    1]]]), 'attention_mask': tensor([[[1, 1, 1,  ..., 1, 1, 1]]])}}

A containment device lowered over the well to funnel oil to the surface had to be moved on Saturday after ice-like crystals began accumulating inside it . Some 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons -RRB- of oil a day has been flowing into the sea since an explosion on a rig last month .

An attempt to use a larger containment dome failed on Sunday when it became clogged with ice and gas . The well is spewing out some 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons -RRB- of oil a day .

The attempt to divert the oil flow came as workers readied a so-called `` top hat '' containment dome to be lowered over the leak . Some scientists have significantly raised their estimate of the rate of oil flow , as the surface slick has grown to 3,650 sq miles -LRB- 9,500 sq km -RRB- . Several US senators have proposed a ban on drilling off the Pacific coast . Five thousand feet -LRB- 1,500 m -RRB- below the surface on Friday , remote-controlled robots were attempting to thread a six-inch -LRB- 15cm -RRB- tube surrounded by a stopper into the 21-inch pipe spewing crude oil and natural gas at a high rate into the water ",), ("US demands oil spill costs ` clarification ' from BP Thousands of barrels of oil a day have been leaking from the seabed The US government has demanded immediate clarification from BP over its commitment to pay for costs caused by the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
