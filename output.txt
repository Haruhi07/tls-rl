BP also said the cost of containing the spill and securing the original well is running at about $6 million a day. Experts have warned that the total cost of clearing up the spill, including compensation claims, could run into billions of dollars. Under US law, it is the oilfield operator that has financial responsibility, even if fault lies with a contractor. BP has already said it will pay the costs of the clean-up, though observers suggest it could pursue Transocean at a later stage to try to get some money back. The British oil giant has a two-thirds stake in the field and so its minority partners will also be liable for some of the cost.
