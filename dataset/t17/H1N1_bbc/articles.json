[{"uid": "558", "dct": "2009-04-25", "dates": [null, null], "text": "Susan Watts | 18:00 UK time , Saturday , 25 April 2009 Experts are clearly extremely concerned about the new swine flu virus which the World Health Organisation warned today has the potential to cause a pandemic . The virus has killed at least 60 people in Mexico and appears to have infected more than 1,000 . The same virus also appears to be behind infections in Texas and California , with suspected cases reportedly being tested in New York . Dr Alan Hay , director of the World Influenza Centre in London , told me this afternoon that we must take this seriously : `` It looks pretty ominous , one has to say . It 's difficult to look on the bright side at the moment . '' He stressed , though , that it 's still early days , there 's a lot we do n't know and he does n't want to be alarmist . What 's most worrying is that this new virus is affecting young , healthy adults - the same group affected by the pandemic flu virus of 1918 . Those usually vulnerable to flu , the elderly and the very young , were at less risk then and , it appears , now . According to Dr Hay this is key in trying to assess the likelihood of this virus causing a pandemic : `` That was the unusual feature about 1918 , it was the healthy young adults that suffered most ... and I think everybody understands the implications , '' he said . He described the situation in Mexico as `` totally different '' from the intermittent cases of H5N1 bird flu among people , because it appears to be spreading so fast . Sporadic bird flu infections in people have alerted the world to the possibility of a pandemic , but Dr Hay said this H1 swine flu virus is `` already worse than H5 '' , in terms of `` the number of cases , the number of deaths and the locality of the area affected ... This is n't sporadic , this is human '' . Dr Hay stressed that it may turn out that the situation is less alarming than it appears now , but this will be hard to assess until experts know clinical details of the cases in Mexico , such as the length of time from infection to death . Dr Hay 's laboratory in north London expects to receive samples from the new cases next week , via the US Centers for Disease Control . His team can then help to advise on the best possible vaccine . Already , his team and others around the world are working on a fast diagnostic test so that labs likely to see new cases can confirm whether or not people have the virus , as soon as possible . Speed will be of the essence in containing infections . There are eight genes in the flu virus . According to Dr Hay , this new one has six genes from swine flu viruses already known to have been circulating in the US , and two from swine flu viruses from Europe and Asia . The US swine flu virus genes in this new virus are themselves mixtures of swine flu , bird flu and human flu viruses - what 's described as a classic `` re-assortment '' - a combination feared most by those watching for a flu pandemic . Experts around the world have been warning for years that this is inevitable . The last pandemic was in 1968 and killed around a million people worldwide . The next few days and weeks will be crucial . One possibly hopeful sign is that of the eight cases in the US there has been only one hospitalisation , and no deaths . So it may turn out that there is some other kind of infection at work in Mexico , as well as the new flu virus .

So if you have a strong immune response -- ie are a healthy adult -- then you 're at extra risk from tipping over the edge . Hay is right , it is too early to panic about this yet . The infection is definitely spreading -- if it 's in New York and New Zealand , it 's almost certainly also in Beijing , London , Paris , Dubai and other major hubs -- but the lack of significant US deaths so far is an encouraging start . The next 48-72 hours will make it all clear . At 15:32 26th Apr 2009 , ebed09 wrote : US data is not that reassuring . If the mortality rate is about 3-6 % of clinical cases , as the Mexican figures suggest one would have expected no deaths yet from the US patients . On the positive side , this is a bad time of year for flu to spread at least in the Northern hemisphere .

The bits of information that I have seen so far suggest that people started getting ill in Mexico sometime in mid March . -LRB- This was when it started to be recognized -RRB- . It also appears that it has been during the last two weeks that the deaths have occurred in Mexico . It is possible that that there has been an inital mutation of the H1N1 swine flu into a form that is not terribly virulent - but is easily communicable between humans - and then a second mutation into a more virulent form . The first -LRB- milder -RRB- form will have spread more widely in the initial area and could explain why the cases now turning up in USA and NZ are less virulent than the killer version now presenting in Mexico . The next 7-10 days will give everyone a much better idea of exactly what is going on . Unfortunately when the next pandemic does come along the initial phase will probably look much like the current situation - that is why WHO and CDC have to take this outbreak very seriously - whilst being aware that they can not instantly stop the world from traveling every time a potential virus is identified .

The antibodies put up a huge fight against the virus and the virus put up even a greater fight . The result was like a war going on in their system and the result was death . Is this what is going on do they think ? Also , if this IS what is going on - what is the difference between them & those who survived the Spanish flu pandemic , like the writer , Katherine Porter ? What is essentially different concerning their antibodies ? Is there anything one can do ... or is it between genetics or the hope of a vaccination ?

As for a vaccine , that would be no problem -LRB- the same is true of H5N1 avian flu when that eventually jumps species -RRB- , the difficulty is it will take 4 months for the first doses to appear , such is the time it takes to produce vaccine whilst the number of factories in the world that produces vaccines is really no tthat high . In the UK we could expect production of half a million to one million doses a week . That 's a long while to wait until you get jabs .

My father works for the ECDC , and his opinion is that the two best places to be in Europe , in terms of receiving a vaccination , are the UK and Sweden . UK has already bought and payed for virtual vaccines that simply need editing to be put into full scale production . Do u know how big a business drugs are ? They can churn out lots more than 1mill a week . Its more of a distribution problem than anything else . However as yet there is no need for a vaccine , and the lack of info as to whether there is one definite strain of influenza . The reason I read why Spanish flu did not affect the middle aged and elderly was because a variant of that flu had been around in the late 19th century . Those living at the time had gained some immunity . Mortality rate was 1 % -2 % and , from beginning to end -LRB- there was the odd flare up after the main pandemic -RRB- , was about two years . People could be hale and hearty one day and three or four days later , dead . The whole thing was exacerbated by the tail end of WWI where soldiers and PoWs were crammed into crude , unhygenic camps . What the effects of much more widespread travel on a much bigger population will have with this strain remains to be seen .

It 's a recipe for complacency or panic , with not much room in the middle . Could you say something about how genes manage to jump species in this way .

'' Attention fear culture devotess : do you think following the What-Is-Called-News is enhancing your life ? grignard asked why are young people affected most ? In non scientific terms , in 1918 the pandemic flu killed more young people because young people typically had a healthier immune system and that version of the influenza triggered a stronger response from the bodies defenses . It was this strong response of the immune system that led to a build up of fluid in the lungs so that the healthiest people seemed to die more of pneumonia . John M. Barry 's `` The Great Influenza '' is the best description of what happened then . WHO does not yet know if this is happening this time but the similarity with 1918 is a worry . Any new strain that mutates from animal to human populations is potentially dangerous because the human population has less immunity . If it is a totally new mutation , the new influenza may be too efficient - killing too many people so that it dies out itself .

Contracting the virus may inevitable for many of us if the worst case predictions are correct but we can minimize the infecting dose by using good hygiene .

Swine flu illness in the United States and Mexico - update 2 26 April 2009 -- As of 26 April 2009 , the United States Government has reported 20 laboratory confirmed human cases of swine influenza A\\/H1N1 -LRB- 8 in New York , 7 in California , 2 in Texas , 2 in Kansas and 1 in Ohio -RRB- . All 20 cases have had mild Influenza-Like Illness with only one requiring brief hospitalization . No deaths have been reported . All 20 viruses have the same genetic pattern based on preliminary testing . The virus is being described as a new subtype of A\\/H1N1 not previously detected in swine or humans . Also as of 26 April , the Government of Mexico has reported 18 laboratory confirmed cases of swine influenza A\\/H1N1 . Investigation is continuing to clarify the spread and severity of the disease in Mexico . Suspect clinical cases have been reported in 19 of the country 's 32 states . WHO and the Global Alert and Response Network -LRB- GOARN -RRB- are sending experts to Mexico to work with health authorities . WHO and its partners are actively investigating reports of suspect cases in other Member States as they occur , and are supporting field epidemiology activities , laboratory diagnosis and clinical management . On Saturday , 25 April , upon the advice of the Emergency Committee called under the rules of the International Health Regulations , the Director-General declared this event a Public Health Emergency of International Concern . WHO is not recommending any travel or trade restrictions . They also claim the problem has been going on for at least 3 weeks . This looks problematic - governments should be stopping nonessential travel to and from the US and Mexico , and other confirmed index countries now .

The World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- says the situation remains serious but `` the picture is evolving '' . Several countries have reported suspected cases of infection - the latest were eight students in New York who were confirmed to have swine flu . But US cases of infections had not had contact with pigs , the WHO said . Swine flu is a respiratory disease found in pigs Human cases usually occur in those who have contact with pigs Human-to-human transmission is rare and such cases are closely monitored H1N1 is the same strain that causes seasonal flu outbreaks in humans , but the newly detected version contains genetic material from versions of flu which usually affect pigs and birds . The respiratory virus - which infects pigs but only sporadically humans - is spread mainly through coughs and sneezes . The WHO has warned the virus has the potential to become a pandemic , and has urged all governments to step up surveillance . Several countries in Asia and Latin America have begun screening airport passengers for symptoms . Although all of the deaths so far have been in Mexico , the flu is spreading in the United States and suspected cases have been detected elsewhere : Susan Watts , BBC Science editor The next few days and weeks will be crucial . One possibly hopeful sign is that of the eight cases in the US there has been only one hospitalisation , and no deaths . So it may turn out that there is some other kind of infection at work in Mexico , as well as the new flu virus . Eleven confirmed infections in the US In addition , eight suspected cases are being investigated at a New York City high school where about 200 students fell mildly ill with flu-like symptoms Ten New Zealand students are among a group which traveled to Mexico have tested positive for influenza A - making it `` likely '' , though not definite , that they are infected with swine flu , said Health Minister Tony Ryall In France , a top health official told Le Parisien newspaper there were unconfirmed suspicions that two individuals who had just returned from Mexico may be carrying the virus Spain 's health ministry says three people who returned from a trip from Mexico with flu symptoms are in isolation and being tested In Israel , medics are testing a 26-year-old man who has been taken to hospital with flu-like symptoms after returning from a trip to Mexico But a UK hospital conducting tests for swine flu on a British Airways cabin crew member said the tests proved negative . The Mexican government , which has faced criticism for what some see as a slow reaction to this outbreak , is now taking an increasingly hard line to try to contain the virus , says the BBC 's Stephen Gibbs in Mexico City . Public buildings have been closed and hundreds of public events suspended . There is a sense of chaos in hospitals and we do not know what to do BBC reader Antonio Chavez , Mexico City Schools in and around Mexico City have been closed until 6 May , and some 70 % of bars and restaurants in the capital have been temporarily closed . People are being strongly urged to avoid shaking hands , and the US embassy has advised visitors to the country to keep at least six feet -LRB- 1.8 m -RRB- from other people . Mexico 's Health Secretary , Jose Cordova , said a total of 1,324 people had been admitted to hospital with suspected symptoms since 13 April and were being tested for the virus . `` In that same period , 81 deaths were recorded probably linked to the virus but only in 20 cases we have the laboratory tests to confirm it , '' he said . Mexico 's President Felipe Calderon has announced emergency measures to deal with the situation . They include powers to isolate individuals suspected of having the virus without fear of legal repercussions . In Mexico , face masks are handed out , while the head of the WHO voices concern In the US , seven people in California , two people in Texas , and two people in Kansas have been infected with the new strain . In New York , city health commissioner Dr Thomas Frieden said preliminary tests conducted on the ailing students showed they were possible cases of swine flu . Further tests will clarify if it was the same strain that was detected in the other three states . Following a meeting of its emergency committee on Saturday , the WHO said the virus had the potential to become a pandemic but it was too early to say whether that would happen . 1918 : The Spanish flu pandemic remains the most devastating outbreak of modern times - infecting up to 40 % of the world 's population and killing more than 50m people , with young adults particularly badly affected 1957 : Asian flu killed two million people . Caused by a human form of the virus , H2N2 , combining with a mutated strain found in wild ducks . The elderly were particularly vulnerable 1968 : An outbreak first detected in Hong Kong , and caused by a strain known as H3N2 , killed up to one million people globally , with those over 65 most likely to die WHO Director General Margaret Chan said recent events constituted `` a public health emergency of international concern '' and that countries needed to co-operate in heightening surveillance . The WHO is advising all countries to be vigilant for seasonally unusual flu or pneumonia-like symptoms among their populations - particularly among young healthy adults , a characteristic of past pandemics . Officials said most of those killed so far in Mexico were young adults - rather than more vulnerable children and the elderly . There is currently no vaccine for the new strain but severe cases can be treated with antiviral medication . It is unclear how effective currently available flu vaccines would be at offering protection against the new strain , as it is genetically distinct from other flu strains .

Margaret Chan said the outbreak was a `` health emergency of international concern '' and must be closely monitored . Health experts say tests so far seem to link the illnesses in Mexico with a swine flu virus in the southern US . Several people have also fallen ill in the US , and the authorities there are watching the situation . A top US health official said the strain of swine flu had spread widely and could not be contained . Speaking after a meeting of the WHO 's emergency committee , Mrs Chan said that `` the current events constitute a public health emergency of international concern '' . Yeny Gregorio Davila , Mexico City The WHO is advising all member states to be vigilant for seasonally unusual flu or pneumonia-like symptoms among their populations - particularly among young healthy adults . Officials said most of those killed so far in Mexico were young adults - rather than more vulnerable children and the elderly . The committee has not recommended declaring an international public health emergency and raising the global pandemic alert level , a move that could lead to travel advisories , trade restrictions and border closures . At least some of the cases show a new version of the H1N1 swine flu sub-strain - a respiratory disease which infects pigs but only sporadically infects humans . The RC church has issued advice to its priests to help halt the spread of the flu H1N1 is the same strain that causes seasonal flu outbreaks in humans , but the newly-detected version contains genetic material from versions which usually affect pigs and birds . The virus is spread through coughs and sneezes and through direct and indirect contact between people . Mexican officials have confirmed 20 deaths from the virus and are investigating dozens more . Schools , museums and libraries have been closed across the capital 's region and people are being urged to avoid shaking hands or sharing crockery . Hundreds of public events have been suspended and schools in the Mexico City area have been closed until 6 May . Two previously sold-out soccer matches were played in empty stadiums to avoid potentially spreading the virus . Health officials are isolating individuals suspected of having the virus and inspecting their homes . The Roman Catholic Church in Mexico has recommended measures to avoid further contagion at Mass this Sunday . Priests have been told to place communion wafers in the hands of worshippers rather than in their mouths and to suggest to the congregation that kissing or shaking hands be avoided during the service . In the US , 11 people are now known to have been infected with the new strain - seven people in California , two in Texas , and two in Kansas . There are also eight suspected cases in New York City after 200 students at a high school fell ill . Specimens were taken from nine students , and eight were determined to be probable cases of swine flu , said city health commissioner Dr Thomas Frieden . Those samples are now being examined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- . No children had required hospital treatment and many had fully recovered , said Dr Frieden , but the school could remain closed out of `` an abundance of caution '' . He urged people to maintain basic hygiene , such and covering their mouths when coughing and sneezing , washing hands regularly and keeping surfaces clean . Dr Frieden said most people would not need to take antiviral medication if they fell ill , unless they had an underlying medical condition . CDC officials have said that with cases arising in so many communities , containment is unlikely to be feasible . There is currently no vaccine for the new strain . Swine flu is a respiratory disease found in pigs Human cases usually occur in those who have contact with pigs Human-to-human transmission is rare and such cases are closely monitored Tom Skinner of the CDC told the BBC that it was too early too tell how widespread the impact would be . `` We do n't know how well or efficiently this virus is spreading and how easily it is going to be sustained in the human population . '' He said it was not yet clear which side of the border the virus had originated . But the US was likely to take `` normal and routine '' steps within the next few days to screen passengers coming into the US and to distribute information , he said . The CDC plans to send experts to Mexico to help investigate the virus which has infected more than 1,000 people in the country . The BBC science editor Susan Watts says the new strain is a classic `` re-assortment '' - a combination feared most by those watching for the flu pandemic . Are you in Mexico or the US ?

Scottish Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said the patients had both displayed mild flu-like symptoms but were not giving cause for concern . Neither of the people involved had traveled in areas affected by swine flu outbreaks . The Scottish Government said it was closely monitoring the situation . It is understood the two travellers were admitted to Monklands hospital in Airdrie , Lanarkshire , after returning from Mexico on Tuesday . Precautionary tests are being conducted on them , with further tests expected over the next few days . Ms Sturgeon said there was `` no immediate threat to public health in Scotland '' . She added : `` The patients have displayed mild flu-like symptoms and their current condition is not causing concern . Monitoring of those who have been in close contact with the two people is also being carried out as an additional precaution . The patients have been admitted to Monklands hospital `` The Scottish Government , in conjunction with other administrations in the UK , are closely monitoring the situation and assessing the implications , if any , of this situation for Scotland . `` The situation is also being monitored closely and assessed by the international organizations dealing with the prevention and control of infectious diseases . '' As a precaution , the Scottish Government resilience room has been opened and is working closely with London to monitor the situation , Ms Sturgeon said . Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond chaired a meeting of relevant ministers and officials on Sunday , and Ms Sturgeon has spoken with UK Health Secretary Alan Johnson about the development . Ms Sturgeon said : `` The World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- has said UK planning for a flu pandemic is among the most advanced in the world but we can not afford to be complacent . `` The Scottish Government takes the threat of a flu pandemic very seriously and have been working with local responders for a number of years to ensure that Scotland is in the best possible position to manage an emergency on such a scale . `` The H1N1 swine fever virus is sensitive to the antiviral drugs Tamiflu and Relenza . We have significant stockpiles for Scotland . '' The WHO has warned that the new strain of the swine flu virus that has killed 81 people in Mexico could become a global pandemic . Several other countries have reported suspected cases of infection , including eight students at a New York school who were confirmed to have swine flu . There have been no confirmed cases of swine flu in the UK or elsewhere in Europe . Dr Jim McMenamin , consultant epidemiologist for Health Protection Scotland , said the two patients were being treated with anti-viral medicine which would prevent the condition becoming worse . He said : `` The evidence so far from the United States and Mexico is that the anti-virals , which would normally be used for the treatment of influenza , are effective for this condition . '' The doctor said : `` It is early days in our investigation globally about this phenomenon of swine flu . We will be kept continually updated by the World Health Organisation . `` Currently there is a public health emergency of international concern and we in Scotland have to play our part in any potential case being rapidly identified .

Swine flu is a respiratory disease which infects pigs . Caused by influenza type A , there are regular outbreaks among herds of pigs , where the disease causes high levels of illness but is rarely fatal . It tends to spread in autumn and winter but can circulate all year round . There are many different types of swine flu and like human flu , the infection is constantly changing . Can humans catch swine flu ? Swine flu does not normally infect humans , although sporadic cases do occur - usually in people who have had close contact with pigs . There have also been rare documented cases of humans passing the infection to other humans . Human-to-human transmission of swine flu is thought to spread in the same way as seasonal flu - through coughing and sneezing . In the latest outbreak it is clear that the disease is being passed from person to person . Is this a new type of swine flu ? The World Health Organization has confirmed that at least some of the cases are a never-before-seen version of the H1N1 strain of influenza type A. H1N1 is the same strain which causes seasonal outbreaks of flu in humans on a regular basis . But this latest version of H1N1 is different : it contains genetic material that is typically found in strains of the virus that affect humans , birds and swine . Flu viruses have the ability to swap genetic components with each other , and it seems likely that the new version of H1N1 resulted from a mixing of different versions of the virus , which may usually affect different species , in the same animal host . Symptoms of swine flu in humans appear to be similar to those produced by standard , seasonal flu . These include fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue . Most cases so far reported around the world appear to be mild , but in Mexico lives have been lost . Is it safe to eat pig meat ? There is no evidence that swine flu can be transmitted through eating meat from infected animals . However , it is essential to cook meat properly . A temperature of 70C -LRB- 158F -RRB- would be sure to kill the virus . How worried should people be ? When any new strain of flu emerges that acquires the ability to pass from person to person , it is monitored very closely in case it has the potential to spark a pandemic . 1918 : The Spanish flu pandemic remains the most devastating outbreak of modern times . Caused by a form of the H1N1 strain of flu , it is estimated that up to 40 % of the world 's population were infected , and more than 50 million people died , with young adults particularly badly affected 1957 : Asian flu killed two million people . Caused by a human form of the virus , H2N2 , combining with a mutated strain found in wild ducks . The impact of the pandemic was minimized by rapid action by health authorities , who identified the virus , and made vaccine available speedily . The elderly were particularly vulnerable 1968 : An outbreak first detected in Hong Kong , and caused by a strain known as H3N2 , killed up to one million people globally , with those over 65 most likely to die The World Health Organization has warned that taken together the Mexican and US cases could potentially trigger a global pandemic , and stress that the situation is serious . However , it is stressed that it is still too early to accurately assess the situation fully . Currently , they say the world is closer to a flu pandemic than at any point since 1968 - rating the threat at three on a six-point scale . Nobody knows the full potential impact of the pandemic , but experts have warned that it could cost millions of lives worldwide . The Spanish flu pandemic , which began in 1918 , and was also caused by an H1N1 strain , killed millions of people . The fact that all the cases in the US have so far produced mild symptoms is encouraging . It suggests that the severity of the Mexican outbreak may be due to an unusual geographically-specific factor - possibly a second unrelated virus circulating in the community - which would be unlikely to come into play in the rest of the world . Alternatively , people infected in Mexico may have sought treatment at much later stage than those in other countries . It may also be the case that the form of the virus circulating in Mexico is subtly different to that elsewhere - although that will only be confirmed by laboratory analysis . There is also hope that , as humans are often exposed to forms of H1N1 through seasonal flu , our immune systems may have something of a head start in fighting infection . However , the fact that many of the victims are young does point to something unusual . Normal , seasonal flu tends to affect the elderly disproportionately . Can the virus be contained ? The virus appears already to have started to spread around the world , and most experts believe that containment of the virus in the era of readily available air travel will be extremely difficult . What about treatments and vaccines ? The US authorities say that two drugs commonly used to treat flu , Tamiflu and Relenza , seem to be effective at treating cases that have occurred there so far . However , the drugs must be administered at an early stage to be effective . Use of these drugs may also make it less likely that infected people will pass the virus on to others . The UK Government already has a stockpile of around 33 million doses of Tamiflu , ordered as a precaution against a pandemic . It is unclear how effective currently available flu vaccines would be at offering protection against the new strain , as it is genetically distinct from other flu strains . US scientists are already developing a bespoke new vaccine , but it may take some time to perfect it , and manufacture enough supplies to meet what could be huge demand . The strain of bird flu which has caused scores of human deaths in South East Asia in recent years is a different strain to that responsible for the current outbreak of swine flu . The latest form of swine flu is a new type of the H1N1 strain , while bird , or avian flu , is H5N1 . Experts fear H5N1 hold the potential to trigger a pandemic because of its ability to mutate rapidly . However , up until now it has remained very much a disease of birds . Those humans who have been infected have , without exception , worked closely with birds , and cases of human-to-human transmission are extremely rare - there is no suggestion that H5N1 has gained the ability to pass easily from person to person .

The fear has been that a pandemic could cause tens of millions of deaths and official predictions here suggest the death toll in the UK could range between 50,000 and 750,000 . This is why there is so much concern about the spread of swine flu , but the plain fact is that no-one knows yet whether this is the virus which will trigger the first pandemic since 1968 . One puzzling element is that there have been no deaths outside Mexico . So although the virus is spreading internationally , it is not yet a global killer . It is possible that a new flu virus might spread worldwide causing mostly mild illness , or that it might mutate at some point and become more or less virulent . In the immediate future , two important tasks faced by scientists are to develope rapid diagnostic tests for swine flu and to identify the optimum strain of flu to be used in a vaccine . Live samples of swine flu are to arrive in UK labs imminently The National Institute for Medical Research -LRB- NIMR -RRB- , in north London , is one of only five World Health Organization collaborating centres for influenza research . In a high level containment lab , UK scientists are getting ready to receive live samples of swine flu , which they intend to analyze in the hope of combating this disease . The samples will come from affected patients in California , and possibly Mexico and Spain . The scientists at the NIMR will take different virus samples , grow them and infect laboratory ferrets with them . Ferrets get flu in a similar way to humans and produce an immune response . Scientists will analyze the antibodies found in the ferrets ' blood and see whether the virus is showing signs of antigenic drift - in simple terms whether it is adapting and changing as it passes from person to person . Swine flu is an H1N1 virus , but it seems quite distinct from the human H1N1 strain included in the current seasonal , winter vaccine . It is unclear whether the seasonal vaccine would give any protection . One theory is that while it might not prevent someone getting swine flu , it could lessen its effects . For the moment , swine flu is not a cause for alarm in Britain , and it can not be caught from food , although raw pork should be properly cooked .

It is new , but it is also familiar - 12 years ago , a new strain of bird flu emerged in Hong Kong that was seen as the possible start of a deadly flu pandemic . Six years ago came the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -LRB- Sars -RRB- epidemic . That too was centred on Asia but caused more than 800 deaths worldwide . Since then , there has been massive investment in dealing with a flu-like pandemic . Many individual countries learned painful lessons . Some , like China , found they needed to be much more transparent and to improve their basic surveillance and reporting systems . Scientists are now in a better position to make a vaccine quickly To stop spread , cases need to be identified quickly and effectively . Governments needed to accept that information must be shared globally , even if the political instinct was to avoid admitting the scale of the problem . The continuing anxiety about a bird flu pandemic has forced bodies like the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- to invest in prevention strategies . There have been years of developing strategy and training on how to handle a flu pandemic - and multiple workshops and mock exercises . Experts have been sent around the world to assess procedures on the ground and give advice . Although the threat in mind was from an H5 or H9 type flu , much of the training has been generic , so it is just as relevant now . Scientists say the investment in global research may pay off too . More people now recognize that it is better for everyone if they pool information , rather than sit on it They are now in a much better position than they were 10 years ago to make a vaccine quickly , one which is perfectly matched against a particular viral strain . Some experts in the field say that with the heightened level of co-operation that now exists , it may be possible to have a vaccine for this form of H1N1 ready to distribute in a matter of months . Scientists , as well as politicians , have learned to share information more openly . The culture of secrecy and competition that persisted 10 years ago was addressed during the Sars crisis - and largely resolved . More people now recognize that it is better for everyone if they pool information , rather than sit on it , and understand that the WHO will keep a stock of any resulting vaccine so they can help poorer countries have access to it . Governments who found themselves on the front line of previous crises have become some of the best prepared . Indonesia has brought back thermal scanners used for Sars and bird flu And where people have previously experienced a threat , there seems to be more readiness for the public to accept rules and procedures which might limit individual freedoms , but could help to protect them . Hong Kong , for example , has kept up the practice of facial thermal imaging , introduced during Sars . It automatically screens every new arrival to identify those with high temperatures - a possible flu symptom . Governments , especially those in the developing world , have to make tough decisions about how to use their limited resources . Is it better to invest in protection against a possible future crisis , like a flu pandemic , which may never happen ? Or to focus on meeting more immediate daily health problems ? Fundamental questions about this new strain still need to be answered and its progress is very unpredictable . But whatever course it takes , most countries which have already experienced bird flu and Sars have emerged from those crises far better equipped to deal with the next one .

Two British people admitted to hospital in Scotland after returning from a holiday in Mexico have been confirmed as having the virus . In Spain , a man has tested positive for swine flu and 17 other people are under investigation , officials said . EU health ministers are to meet on Thursday to discuss the outbreak , which health officials suspect has killed about 150 people in Mexico . The World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- raised its alert level late on Tuesday from three to four - two steps short of declaring a full pandemic . Personally , I 'd try to avoid non-essential travel to the areas which are reported to be in the center of the cluster WHO Assistant Director General Dr Keiji Fukuda said it signalled a `` significant step towards pandemic influenza '' , but added `` we are not there yet '' . The EU 's Health Commissioner , Androulla Vassiliou , has advised against non-essential travel to any affected areas . Besides Mexico , the UK and Spain , there have also been confirmed cases in the US and Canada . Suspected cases are being investigated in Brazil , Israel , Australia and New Zealand . `` Personally , I 'd try to avoid non-essential travel to the areas which are reported to be in the center of the cluster , '' Ms Vassiliou said . The precaution would `` minimize the personal risk and to reduce the potential risk to spread the infection to other people '' , she added . Germany 's largest tour operator , TUI , suspended all trips to Mexico City as a precaution - though holidays to other parts of Mexico would continue as normal . Scottish Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said both UK patients were recovering well in a Lanarkshire hospital from mild cases of the virus . Swine flu is a respiratory disease thought to spread through coughing and sneezing Symptoms mimic those of normal flu - but in Mexico more than 100 people have died Good hygiene like using a tissue and washing hands thoroughly can help reduce transmission `` The threat to the public remains low , '' she said . `` The precautionary actions we have taken over the last two days have been important in allowing us to respond appropriately and give us the best prospect of disrupting the spread of the virus . '' There are 14 other possible cases currently being investigated in the UK , though all the people involved are well enough to be managed in the community , British Health Secretary Alan Johnson said . In Madrid , Spanish Health Minister Trinidad Jimenez confirmed that a male patient in Almansa in the south-eastern province of Albacete had tested positive for the virus . The 23-year-old man had arrived home from Mexico with a fever last Wednesday , and was isolated in a hospital ward on Saturday night , she added . Ms Jimenez said his condition was not serious . At least 17 further suspected cases are under investigation in Spain , in locations ranging from Madrid to Mallorca , Barcelona to the Basque Country . The patients have all recently returned from Mexico . None of the cases is thought to be life threatening . Robert Madelin said it was clear that a ` novel ' flu virus was now being confronted Four people tested for the virus in France have been given the all-clear by doctors , French Health Minister Roselyne Bachelot has said . The WHO has said the swine flu virus could be capable of mutating into a more dangerous strain , but officials say they need more information on the virus to determine the threat it poses . They are advising all countries to be vigilant for seasonally unusual flu or pneumonia-like symptoms among their populations - particularly among young adults , a characteristic of past pandemics . The H1N1 virus is the same strain that causes seasonal flu outbreaks in humans , but the newly detected version contains genetic material from versions of flu which usually affect pigs and birds . There is currently no vaccine for the new strain , but severe cases can be treated with anti-viral medication . Earlier , the European Commission convened an emergency meeting of the health ministers from all the EU 's 27 member states on Thursday to discuss growing concern about the outbreak . Mexico : 20 confirmed cases -LRB- Mexico puts suspected deaths at 149 -RRB- United States : 40 confirmed cases Israel , Brazil , Guatemala , Peru , Australia and New Zealand : Suspected cases being tested `` The commission is following the situation concerning the swine influenza very closely , '' said Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso . `` We will continue to assess the information we are getting from the experts , evaluate the potential danger and decide together with member states on the measures to take . '' Further details about Thursday 's meeting have to be worked out by the Czech Republic , which currently holds the EU presidency . The commission 's director-general for health and consumer protection , Robert Madelin , said close co-ordination between EU members was the most effective way to tackle any pandemic . He said the EU was `` putting in place plans agreed in the last five years , ensuring that the level of risk management is appropriate to the risk - using our ` war-games ' experiences '' .

Swabs will be analyzed at the Leicester Royal Infirmary with results potentially available in four hours . The Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- has said `` some '' people are being tested for the H1N1 virus in the East Midlands , including two in Derbyshire . Dr Roy Fey , from the HPA , said the two had been told to stay at home but stressed there was no need to panic . Dr Fey said : `` We 're doing tests . A lot of people have come back from Mexico over the Easter holidays and around the country . There have been calls to our different health protection units - that is how the people in Scotland were detected . `` We are not taking people into hospital unless they need hospital care - we are taking swabs from them to see if they have the virus or not . `` Outside of Mexico all of the cases have seen people fall mildly ill , almost like seasonal flu , the H1N1 virus is something that has been around for 30-odd years . '' People are being told not to panic Dr Phillip Monk from the HPA said people with symptoms should seek medical advice . `` The most important thing is to contact your general practitioner , the second thing is isolate yourself - do n't spread anything you 've got around other people .

The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic was caused by an H1N1 form of influenza A With the UK confirming two cases of swine flu and the World Health Organization raising its alert level from three to four , how serious a threat does the disease pose to us all ? WHO says the virus , which has killed an estimated 150 people in Mexico , is showing a `` sustained ability '' to pass from human to human and is able to cause community-level outbreaks . The UK 's leading experts on flu give their views on what the future threat might be . PROFESSOR NEIL FERGUSON , WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION Clearly we are on track for a pandemic in the coming months . The good news is that we were all worried about so-called bird flu H5N1 which was a much more dangerous virus . Here , we are not in the same ball park . We might expect up to 30-40 % of the population to become ill in the next six months if this truly turns into a pandemic But we ca n't at the moment answer the question is it comparable to 1918 Spanish flu which killed a lot of people - or is it much more like Hong Kong flu . We are coming out of the normal time of year when we have flu circulating in the UK so we do n't really know what size of epidemic there may be in the next couple of months . It is almost certain that even if it does fade away in the next few weeks which it might we will get a sizable epidemic in the autumn . We might expect up to 30-40 % of the population to become ill in the next six months if this truly turns into a pandemic . We could get substantial numbers infected in the next few weeks . If I was to be a betting man I would say it would be a slightly longer period of time just because we are heading into the summer months . SIR LIAM DONALDSON , CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER FOR ENGLAND A new strain of flu is something to which we do not have natural immunity , and we have not been vaccinated against , because there is not a vaccine , so it does mean that many more people are vulnerable and so it spreads more easily and affects more people . But we do n't know enough about this virus yet . It is being studied by the top laboratories in the world . When we know more about it we will be able to give better predictions about who is at greater risk , and who is at risk of developing serious complications . At this point the picture coming out of Mexico is rather confused , and we ca n't make any firm statements about what is likely to happen , but we have to prepare for all eventualities . PROFESSOR JOHN OXFORD , VIROLOGY EXPERT AT BARTS AND THE LONDON If the avian flu H5N1 virus had spread from human to human like this then I would be extremely worried . It would be top of my Richter scale . But this swine flu worries me less because as a population we have a basic immunity to H1N1 . Outside of Mexico there have been no deaths , so it does n't seem so aggressive . And not only are we coming up to the summer , which makes it less likely for these viruses to spread as well , but Britain has enough antiviral drugs for half of the population . So we should not panic in any way . This does not look as though it is going to be a virus that sweeps the world and causes huge mortality . DR ALAN MACNALLY , MOLECULAR BIOLOGY EXPERT AT NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIVERSITY I still think we are a day or so away from knowing what the threat is . WHO has gone to stage four , so we know there will be an epidemic stemming from direct contact with these cases in Mexico . We will see more cases . But we will have to wait to see how it spreads to know if there will be a pandemic that sweeps nations . The key thing is how lethal a virus is it . Outside of Mexico it has not caused any deaths , which is good news . And we are prepared for it . We should have a complete picture in the next five to seven days to answer these questions . KEITH PLUMB , FELLOW OF THE INSTITUTION OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERS There is no evidence of pandemic in Europe at this point in time but should the threat increase , the UK has a wealth of scientific and engineering expertise which can be deployed to ramp up the countermeasures necessary to protect the population at large . Let 's keep things in perspective . This is not 1918 ; and with over 30 million doses of antiviral treatments , effective against H1N1 available in the UK right now we are well placed to combat any outbreak . We should also bear in mind that there are two flu-vaccine manufacturers in the UK -LRB- Novartis and Medimmune -RRB- and whilst there may be capacity issues , both companies are technically capable of producing appropriate vaccines . PROFESSOR HUGH PENNINGTON , LEADING BACTERIOLOGIST It 's a new virus - we 've never before seen this combination of swine virus and human virus genes . It 's very difficult to make any predictions when it 's not like any flu virus before . If there are no more cases in the next couple of weeks then we can maybe say with reasonable confidence that we 're out of the woods . But the flu virus is a pretty awkward customer and you have to be very circumspect . I do n't think the public health authorities will be giving the all-clear for some time yet . PROFESSOR ANGUS NICOLL , EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR DISEASE PREVENTION AND CONTROL We have a very confusing picture coming out of Mexico . We are not aware of how many people there are with mild infections out of Mexico . It may be that those few deaths represent just the tip of an iceberg which is a lot more much milder infections . Therefore we feel that one should not be looking at Mexico and saying that is the pattern we will necessarily be following in Europe . We do know from previous influenza viruses and previous pandemics that what you see at the start is not necessarily what you see six months , a year or two years later . Sometimes you get a second or third wave which is more vicious than the first . As a region , Europe - and particularly the European Union - is better prepared than any other part of the world . Unfortunately you can never prepare well enough . We are beyond the stage of being able to contain the virus , we can only mitigate it and there is still more work to be done - and a cool summer would give us time to do some additional work .

If the immune system has met a particular strain of the virus before , it is likely to have some immunity ; but if the antigens are new to the immune system , it will be weakened . The influenza A virus can mutate in two different ways ; antigenic drift , in which existing antigens are subtly altered , and antigenic shift , in which two or more strains combine . Antigenic drift causes slight flu mutations year on year , from which humans have partial , but not complete , immunity . By contrast , the new strain of H1N1 appears to have originated via antigenic shift in Mexican pigs The name `` swine flu '' is a slight misnomer as it is believed pigs acted as a mixing pot for several flu strains , containing genetic material from pigs , birds and humans . Most humans have never been exposed to some of the antigens involved in the new strain of flu , giving it the potential to cause a pandemic . The new virus has made the jump from pigs to humans and has demonstrated it can also pass from human to human . This is why it is demanding so much attention from health authorities . The virus passes from human to human like other types of flu , either through coughing , sneezing , or by touching infected surfaces , although little is known about how the virus acts on humans . BACK -LCB- current -RCB- of -LCB- total -RCB- NEXT Swine flu is a respiratory disease , caused by influenza type A which infects pigs . There are many types , and the infection is constantly changing . Until now it has not normally infected humans , but the latest form clearly does , and can be spread from person to person - probably through coughing and sneezing . What is new about this type of swine flu ? The World Health Organization has confirmed that at least some of the human cases are a never-before-seen version of the H1N1 strain of influenza type A. Symptoms usually similar to seasonal flu - but deaths recorded in Mexico It is a new version of the H1N1 strain which caused the 1918 flu pandemic Too early to say whether it will lead to a pandemic Current treatments do work , but there is no vaccine Good personal hygiene , such as washing hands , covering nose when sneezing advised H1N1 is the same strain which causes seasonal outbreaks of flu in humans on a regular basis . But this latest version of H1N1 is different : it contains genetic material that is typically found in strains of the virus that affect humans , birds and swine . Flu viruses have the ability to swap genetic components with each other , and it seems likely that the new version of H1N1 resulted from a mixing of different versions of the virus , which may usually affect different species , in the same animal host . Pigs provide an excellent ` melting pot ' for these viruses to mix and match with each other . Symptoms of swine flu in humans appear to be similar to those produced by standard , seasonal flu . These include fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue . Most cases so far reported around the world appear to be mild , but in Mexico lives have been lost . How worried should people be ? When any new strain of flu emerges that acquires the ability to pass from person to person , it is monitored very closely in case it has the potential to spark a global epidemic , or pandemic . 1918 : The Spanish flu pandemic remains the most devastating outbreak of modern times . Caused by a form of the H1N1 strain of flu , it is estimated that up to 40 % of the world 's population were infected , and more than 50 million people died , with young adults particularly badly affected 1957 : Asian flu killed two million people . Caused by a human form of the virus , H2N2 , combining with a mutated strain found in wild ducks . The impact of the pandemic was minimized by rapid action by health authorities , who identified the virus , and made vaccine available speedily . The elderly were particularly vulnerable 1968 : An outbreak first detected in Hong Kong , and caused by a strain known as H3N2 , killed up to one million people globally , with those over 65 most likely to die The World Health Organization has warned that taken together the Mexican and US cases could potentially trigger a global pandemic , and stress that the situation is serious . However , experts say it is still too early to accurately assess the situation fully . Currently , they say the world is closer to a flu pandemic than at any point since 1968 - rating the threat at four on a six-point scale . Nobody knows the full potential impact of a pandemic , but experts have warned that it could cost millions of lives worldwide . The Spanish flu pandemic , which began in 1918 , and was also caused by an H1N1 strain , killed millions of people . The fact that all the cases in the US and elsewhere have so far produced mild symptoms is encouraging . It suggests that the severity of the Mexican outbreak may be due to an unusual geographically-specific factor - possibly a second unrelated virus circulating in the community - which would be unlikely to come into play in the rest of the world . Alternatively , people infected in Mexico may have sought treatment at a much later stage than those in other countries . It may also be the case that the form of the virus circulating in Mexico is subtly different to that elsewhere - although that will only be confirmed by laboratory analysis . There is also hope that , as humans are often exposed to forms of H1N1 through seasonal flu , our immune systems may have something of a head start in fighting infection . However , the fact that many of the victims are young does point to something unusual . Normal , seasonal flu tends to affect the elderly disproportionately . Can the virus be contained ? The virus appears already to have started to spread around the world , and most experts believe that containment of the virus in the era of readily available air travel will be extremely difficult . The US authorities say that two drugs commonly used to treat flu , Tamiflu and Relenza , seem to be effective at treating cases that have occurred there so far . However , the drugs must be administered at an early stage to be effective . Use of these drugs may also make it less likely that infected people will pass the virus on to others . The UK Government already has a stockpile of Tamiflu , ordered as a precaution against a pandemic . It is unclear how effective currently available flu vaccines would be at offering protection against the new strain , as it is genetically distinct from other flu strains . US scientists are already developing a bespoke new vaccine , but it may take some time to perfect it , and manufacture enough supplies to meet what could be huge demand . A vaccine was used to protect humans from a version of swine flu in the US in 1976 . However , it caused serious side effects , including an estimated 500 cases of Guillain-Barr syndrome . There were more deaths from the vaccine than the outbreak . What should I do to stay safe ? Anyone with flu-like symptoms who might have been in contact with the swine virus - such as those living or traveling in the areas of Mexico that have been affected - should seek medical advice . But patients are being asked not to go into GP surgeries in order to minimize the risk of spreading the disease to others . Instead , they should stay at home and call their healthcare provider for advice . After the WHO raised its alert level over swine flu , the Foreign and Commonwealth Office began advising against all but essential travel to Mexico . What measures can I take to prevent infection ? Avoid close contact with people who appear unwell and who have fever and cough . General infection control practices and good hygiene can help to reduce transmission of all viruses , including the human swine influenza . This includes covering your nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing , using a tissue when possible and disposing of it promptly . It is also important to wash your hands frequently with soap and water to reduce the spread of the virus from your hands to face or to other people and cleaning hard surfaces like door handles frequently using a normal cleaning product . If caring for someone with a flu-like illness , a mask can be worn to cover the nose and mouth to reduce the risk of transmission . The UK is looking at increasing its stockpile of masks for healthcare workers for this reason . But experts say there is no scientific evidence to support more general wearing of masks to guard against infections . Is it safe to eat pig meat ? There is no evidence that swine flu can be transmitted through eating meat from infected animals . However , it is essential to cook meat properly . A temperature of 70C -LRB- 158F -RRB- would be sure to kill the virus . The strain of bird flu which has caused scores of human deaths in South East Asia in recent years is a different strain to that responsible for the current outbreak of swine flu . The latest form of swine flu is a new type of the H1N1 strain , while bird , or avian flu , is H5N1 . Experts fear H5N1 hold the potential to trigger a pandemic because of its ability to mutate rapidly . However , up until now it has remained very much a disease of birds . Those humans who have been infected have , without exception , worked closely with birds , and cases of human-to-human transmission are extremely rare - there is no suggestion that H5N1 has gained the ability to pass easily from person to person . Where can I get further advice ? Further information and advice on swine flu can be found at websites of leading health and research organizations around the world . The World Health Organisation gives background information on the virus . The UK 's Health Protection Agency advises the public about what to do if returning from an affected area . NHS Choices outlines how swine flu is different from other flu . The US government 's Centre for Disease Control is counting the number of cases in the US .

Edgar was not alone . Several hundred people in his home village of La Gloria , near Perote in the Mexican state of Veracruz had also been sick with a respiratory disease , some falling ill back in December . At the time , doctors told Edgar 's mother , Maria del Carmen Hernandez , that it was just a regular cold . ABC News ' Jeffrey Kofman speaks to Edgar Hernandez But after her son got worse , she decided to take him to hospital where he was treated with antibiotics . Luckily Edgar recovered , although he has told many of the reporters who have descended on his family 's home that he felt very bad at the time . What makes Edgar the focus of such attention is that swabs taken from his throat and sent to a Canadian laboratory for analysis tested positive for a new strain of the H1N1 virus , known as swine flu . The Mexican government believes he is the first person to have been infected by the swine flu virus . Officials say samples from other people who were sick in La Gloria show they had a common flu virus . What remains a mystery is how Edgar contracted it , and how the virus has been spread . Local people have blamed the outbreak of sickness on nearby pig farms . However , a spokesman for the farms said there had been no sign of symptoms of swine flu either in its herds or among its employees . Edgar has never left the area , the Associated Press reports , and his family neither own nor work with pigs . However , local officials say many people from Perote live and work in Mexico City and there was a lot of travel between the area and the capital over Easter . ADELA GUTIERREZ - FIRST CONFIRMED FATALITY Adela Maria Gutierrez , a 39-year-old mother of three , fell ill in early April in the southern state of Oaxaca , which borders Veracruz . She went to the Aurelio Valdivieso Hospital in Oaxaca , the state capital , on 8 April but died five days later . Doctors initially thought her death was due to pneumonia complicated by diabetes and her death only provoked further concern when other patients began to show signs of severe respiratory infection several days later . Ms Gutierrez 's samples were also sent to Canada for testing , and she , like Edgar , was found to have tested positive for a new strain of virus . Ms Gutierrez worked as a door-to-door census-taker for the tax authorities and could therefore have had contact with large numbers of people . Local health officials have , however , denied reports that Ms Gutierrez had infected 20 people as well as members of her family . Oaxaca is one of Mexico 's poorest states but its beaches , jungles and historic buildings attract many tourists .

The map above shows the location of eyewitness and BBC reports . For a map which charts the spread of the disease over time go here . My partner and I returned to Birmingham from Cancun yesterday morning at 08:20 am . There were no members of the health department there to meet us , over 400 people passed through without help or advise being offered . We returned home to our seven-months-old daughter and in-laws . Last night we developed many of the symptoms listed . I contacted the NHS Direct and after several hours we were asked to go to the hospital ourselves . We had to wait in A&E before being seen by doctors dressed in masks , aprons and gloves . We have high temperatures over 38 degrees , aches , coughing and sneezing , diarrhoea and nausea . The hospital prescribed us both with Tamiflu and told us to drive to a chemist in Coventry , we waited for 15 minutes surrounded by other people before we had the Tamiflu . The chemist informed us that they only had one dose available and that we would need to return the following day . This morning we were contacted by the HPA , we informed them of the situation and they told us that under no circumstances should we leave the house . We are waiting the results now , we are very concerned about our daughter and family around us as it looks like we have now infected them . WEDNESDAY , 29 APRIL , MEXICO AND USA It usually takes me about 40 minutes to get to work . Today it took me less than 20 minutes . There is no traffic , no parents taking their kids to work , no tourists . Buses are half-empty , with most passengers wearing face masks . The absence of tourists is striking . There are no tourists riding the bus or walking the streets . The virus has not traveled to Puerto Vallarta , but tourists have stopped coming . The almost palpable absence of the latter could turn out to be as bad as , or even worse than , the presence of swine flu . As locals half-jokingly , half-seriously , comment , `` If it spreads to Vallarta , the virus might kill us ; hunger will surely kill us . '' I am afraid to admit that Vallarta residents seem to have it right : no tourists , no money , no food . I wonder if our fear of a possible pandemic , along with all the preventive measures that are causing a serious economic slow-down -LRB- canceled flights , closed restaurants , etc. -RRB- , will not trigger an economic crisis much more deadly than the flu itself . I am on holiday in the Yucatan peninsula and everything here is fine . No cases of flu . Tourist arrivals have reduced greatly and therefore it is much quieter in the hotels and restaurants . People should remember that Mexico City is a vast city and the rest of Mexico is fine . Scott Bailey , London , on holiday in Mexico I am currently ` trapped ' with my family in a luxury hotel in Cancun . We are here for my daughter 's wedding , which sadly we have had to cancel as half of the wedding party are still in the UK after their flights were canceled . Contrary to reports we are not being repatriated by the tour operator -LRB- unless we pay -RRB- and the hotel wants to charge us for canceling the wedding ! I work in the `` ER '' of a rural hospital in the Glades and we see a large portion of our population who are migrant workers and the poor . We have only seen normal seasonal flu symptoms and are swabbing with nasal cultures for Influenza a and b and if that comes back positive then we swab with the special deep nasal swab for H1N1 , package it as per protocol and send it to the CDC lab site . So far we have not seen any confirmed cases of the H1N1 flu , but we are attempting to educate all the patients that come into the ER about hand washing , covering their mouths when sneezing or coughing , staying away from crowds , etc. . We are wearing masks when treating patients with cold like symptoms , and goggles , protecting gowns and gloves . But so far , so good , FOR NOW !! Blessings to all the people who serve in healthcare , your services are needed now more than ever before . I am a girl from Finland staying in a village in Oaxaca , Mexico , as an exchange student . On Monday , they told us that we would not be having classes until the 6th May . There are so many rumors here , but you do not know what is true , although it feels really creepy . I feel like its just a matter of time until we all get this flu . It seems like it spreads so quickly and so easily . This scares me a lot . I really want to stay here in Mexico , I have grown to love it so much during the eight months I have been here , but if this get worse I do not know if I have the guts to stay . I arrived in Mexico City on Saturday then flew on to Monterrey for business . I am now back in Mexico City and I have brought my meetings forward so I can leave Mexico and fly back to the UK as soon as possible . I have literally gone from hotel , to enclosed car , to clients office , wearing my newly acquired mask ! When I first arrived I was very blas about the swine flu outbreak but now I am concerned . I have been here dozens of times before . Mexico City is usually busy - you normally can not move , but now its very quiet . There is still traffic but the volume is so minimal . My trip from the airport took 20 minutes instead of an hour and ten minutes . I am staying at the Four Seasons and on my arrival the restaurants were closed . Apart from my meetings I wo n't venture outside the hotel . I think I am going to stay in my room This morning the breakfast service was available for the few guests staying . Whether they will open Tuesday night is another question . The spa and the bars are all closed . Apart from my meetings I wo n't venture outside the hotel . I think I am going to stay in my room . People are dying and I do not want to put myself in the firing line . I phoned British Airways to change my flight from Mexico City to leave as soon as possible back to the UK and initially they said my business class booking could not be changed . They have since updated this directive and I am booked to fly out tomorrow evening at 9.35 pm which is the next available flight . I have not done much business but at least I am going home . Stephen Kyle , Mexico City , Mexico I 'm a 24 years old male and live in Mexico City . Right now the principal actions taken in Mexico are of prevention . All cultural , cleric and scholar activities have been canceled , most recreation sites such as movie theaters and parks are closed too . At my work place last night they informed us that we can work from home , but for most people this is n't a possibility . I live in Mexico city ... I am actually studying here ! Mexico city is n't the cleanliest of places and people 's attitude make it worse . Nearly half of the 20 million people are not wearing their masks and some are acting as if it 's normal to have this flu with their ' I do n't care ' attitude . I give the Mexican government an E for effort . Rumours are flying everywhere and on the news here in Mexico its the same report over and over again . So yes , I am worried . I am living in Oaxaca state where reportedly the first death occurred from swine flu . The town here is known for its great surf and relaxed atmosphere , but even here the fear is beginning to enter people 's daily conversation . The mentality of those living here is varied , some feel it is almost a joke and only media hype , but then you have people like myself who just booked the first flight available back to the United States . Matthaios Tz , Puerto Escondio , Mexico MONDAY , 27 APRIL , MEXICO AND SPAIN This is something that we are taking very seriously , which is why the government and the authorities have implemented preventative measures - from the use of masks to our recommendation that they avoid greeting one another with a kiss or even a handshake . They have acted correctly . It makes me proud to know that we have such a good system of epidemiological health in Mexico . I think that we will see a lower number of new cases in the coming days Dr Alejandro Vargas , Mexico City The hospitals are coping well . Some people have complained of long queues - but these are mostly alarmist types . People should n't be going to hospital just because they 're sneezing . If too many people show up at emergency rooms then the system could collapse . But , we have many hospitals and they have all been working to implement the measures . We have enough anti-virals . I had the opportunity to speak with the person in charge of the purchasing of all medications for the Mexican Social Security Institute and they told me that they worked on this the entire weekend . There is definitely enough . The cases that are materialising now are those related to infections that occurred before the measures were put in place . However , it 's going to be a while before we get the results . I think that we will see a lower number of new cases in the coming days and I think the measures will prove to be successful . Dr Alejandro Vargas , Mexico City I 'm a doctor responsible for managing vaccines in the northern Mexican state of Nuevo Leon . Over the last two weeks we started seeing patients with high fever , muscle aches , sore throats and coughs . Those symptoms seemed a bit odd for us , but we did n't diagnose them with swine flu as we did n't know about it . On Sunday we had our first death in the area . It was someone who came from Mexico City . But we do n't have the means to confirm whether it was as a result of swine flu . We need to have the means to diagnose people and , most importantly , the means to offer them treatment Dr Vicente Torres , Monterrey , Nuevo Leon , Mexico More than anything , we lack equipment and laboratory kits . All we can do is look at the symptoms and make a clinical diagnosis . In the pharmacies , there is no Tamiflu available . They only have another medication and they do n't even have enough of that . So the vaccines we have are not enough we do n't have the medication required . People here are not aware that this flu outbreak can kill people . On behalf of all the medical community in Nuevo Leon I 'd like to ask for help to get the medication , so we can treat people . We need to have the means to diagnose people and , most importantly , the means to offer them treatment . Dr Vicente Torres , Monterrey , Nuevo Leon , Mexico I have been trying to purchase face masks for myself and my family - my wife and two children - but have n't been able to get one anywhere . I have visited six pharmacies in the area and all are sold out . None are expecting deliveries until Tuesday . I am concerned by this and do n't think it 's good enough , given it 's a measure the government is advising . However , I have n't seen any clear government advice on where people can get masks . My family and I are all at home and are taking general precautionary measures - such as avoiding any outside contact , going very carefully to the supermarket to do basic shopping and making no unnecessary visits or trips . I hope the government is being truthful - it certainly appears to be transparent in its information . The schools are closed , as are public buildings . People have been advised to stay at home and have been instructed with basic health precautions to take . Our health minister has just confirmed a positive case in a small town called Almansa , 50 miles from the capital of the province of Albacete , where I live . There are other suspected cases in the same province . It is very worrying , especially as there are concerns that the numbers of people infected will grow . The main hospital for the province is here in my town and people will be coming here for treatment . We have received no further information yet from the authorities , beyond the case being confirmed . We have just been told to stay calm . Meanwhile , everybody is texting each other asking what next ? This is another blow to the tourism industry in Mexico , even though non of the events that is taken place is anywhere near the tourist areas of Cancun , Playa del Carmen or Puerto Vallarta , the news comes across as all of Mexico is affected ! After wrong reports of drug related violence , military presence etc. in Cancun , which hurt the industry tremendously , now people think that all of Mexico is affected by a virus that is mostly present in the capital . I guess the problem is that this is a country where the capital carries the same name as the country , thus when people hear news about Mexico , albeit it refers to Mexico City , they assume it is affecting the whole country . I 'm a specialist doctor in respiratory diseases and intensive care at the Mexican National Institute of Health . There is a severe emergency over the swine flu here . More and more patients are being admitted to the intensive care unit . Despite the heroic efforts of all staff -LRB- doctors , nurses , specialists , etc -RRB- patients continue to inevitably die . The truth is that anti-viral treatments and vaccines are not expected to have any effect , even at high doses . It is a great fear among the staff . The infection risk is very high among the doctors and health staff . There is a sense of chaos in the other hospitals and we do not know what to do . Staff are starting to leave and many are opting to retire or apply for holidays . The truth is that mortality is even higher than what is being reported by the authorities , at least in the hospital where I work it . It is killing three to four patients daily , and it has been going on for more than three weeks . It is a shame and there is great fear here . Increasingly younger patients aged 20 to 30 years are dying before our helpless eyes and there is great sadness among health professionals here . Friends working in hospitals say that the situation is really bad , they are talking about 19 people dead in Oaxaca , including a doctor and a nurse I think there is a real lack of information and sadly , preventative action . In the capital of my state , Oaxaca , there is a hospital closed because of a death related to the porcine influenza . In the papers they recognize only two people dead for that cause . Many friends working in hospitals or related fields say that the situation is really bad , they are talking about 19 people dead in Oaxaca , including a doctor and a nurse . They say they got shots but they were told not to talk about the real situation . Our authorities say nothing . Life goes on as usual here . Young people are going to schools and universities . Buses and planes go and come from Mexico City as frequently as before . Even with two people dead locally , last night the local baseball stadium was full , mainly with young people . What 's really happening ? I know vaccines are good for nothing , and if you take care , maybe you wo n't die , so , why not acknowledge the real situation ? I know that the economic situation is not the best , and it will worsen with panic . But panic comes from a lack of information . Many people travel for pleasure or without any real need . Stopping those unjustified trips can help a lot to ease the situation . We must do something ! Alvaro Ricardez , Oaxaca City , Oaxaca , Mexico The truth is that it is very strange , what we are living through here . The streets are empty , we are all staying in our houses . People are only going out to the hospitals , drugstores and to buy food . The great majority have their mouths covered . Concerts , festivals , masses have all been canceled , the football matches have all been played behind closed doors . On the television and radio , every commercial break contains information on the symptoms , saying that if you have them to go to the doctor at once . Although we have been told to go to work as normal on Monday , I am worried because I am employed at a company where there are many people and believe that it could be highly contagious . They say on the news that the cases that are most critical involve people aged 20 to 50 . Nallely T , State of Mexico Everyone is very frightened , there are few people on the streets and we are all trying to be as safe as possible Right now the situation is quite scary . We 've never been living under such circumstances and it 's caught us completely off guard . We are a developing country so our health system is n't very effective , plus the fact that our city is overpopulated does n't help much ; the government is doing what they can but I do n't think it 's enough . So the future is n't looking too bright . Everyone is very frightened , there are few people on the streets and we are all trying to be as safe as possible . But not knowing exactly how the virus works and how it can be killed off creates a horrible uncertainty . I 'm being pessimistic but that 's how most people I 've talked to feel . It 's certainly been very quiet where I 'm living in the Historic Centre of Mexico City , whereas normally the center is almost uncomfortably packed at the weekend . Most people also seem to be wearing the face masks being handed out by the army around the city . There always seems to be a healthy mistrust of the government here , but I would n't say I 'm sensing a great deal of paranoia or panic . It does seem as though the unprecedented actions being taken by the government to contain the virus do n't match with the statistics being provided , however , so there is some doubt as to whether they 're just being overly cautious or whether things are a lot worse than what they 're telling the public . Right now , things are far from under control here . All the museums , zoos , and concert venues have been closed . Masses , football games , sporting activities , cultural activities , have all been canceled . All schools will be closed until 6 May , from kindergarten to university . We do n't know what to think , the truth is that the government is n't telling us the truth . This case is worst than we think , some people take this just like a joke but not me , this is serious ! Als it seems clear that this illness does n't appear to be affecting the whole country , just Mexico City , the State of Mexico and San Luis Potosi . I work as a resident doctor in one of the biggest hospitals in Mexico City and sadly , the situation is far from `` under control '' . As a doctor , I realize that the media does not report the truth . Authorities distributed vaccines among all the medical personnel with no results , because two of my partners who worked in this hospital -LRB- interns -RRB- were killed by this new virus in less than six days even though they were vaccinated as all of us were . The official number of deaths is 20 , nevertheless , the true number of victims are more than 200 . I understand that we must avoid to panic , but telling the truth it might be better now to prevent and avoid more deaths . Yeny Gregorio Dvila , Mexico City The situation in Mexico City is really not normal . There is a sense of uncertainty that borders on paranoid behavior in some cases . At this very moment , Mexican TV is showing how military forces are giving masks to the people in the streets . Moreover the news is sending alarming messages for the audience . Really , the atmosphere in the city is unsettling , a good example : pubs and concerts are being closed or canceled and people do n't haven thorough information . In this city -LRB- and country -RRB- there is an urgent need for assertive information , no paranoid messages from the government or the Mexican media . Patricio Barrientos and Aranzazu Nuez , Mexico City Massive events have been canceled at the National Auditorium - Mexico City 's largest indoor venue with capacity of 10,000 - which has been closed . Two soccer games have been canceled at the Olympic Stadium . A sold out game with 70,000 expected attendance will be played behind closed doors . Another game at the famous Azteca Stadium that would draw an attendance of 50,000 will also be played behind closed doors . Juan Carlos Leon Calderon , Mexico City It 's eerily quiet here in the capital . Lots of people with masks , Facebook communities exchanging gallows humor , everybody waiting to see if schools and universities will stay closed for ten days -LRB- as goes the rumor -RRB- . All masks have been used up , and we are waiting for new supplies . Dr Duncan Wood , Mexico City We will be sick soon and , well , do the math - 400 can infect at least another two per day Yesterday in my office it was a bit surreal walking in to see all in blue masks with deep cleansing of computer equipment and surfaces going on . Let 's hope it is contained and does not escalate . The local news is reporting 200 fatalities and reports of flu spreading from areas outside of Mexico City . Given the volume of daily commuter traffic on cramped busses and trains , this may not have to be too virulent to be disastrous in human terms . I wonder what controls there will be on flights in and out . I work for the government as a head of a computer infrastructure operations department . At work we are doing several actions to try not to expose workers . We sent several home . I support the Pumas football team and the very important match with the Guadalajara team will be played behind closed doors . My family and I are going to stay home all weekend . We feel a little scared and confused with the feeling that we are not given being told the truth . Many people think the numbers of dead people is higher than we are being told . The whole city is affected , I have a very bad feeling about this . Two of my friends at work are sick , they were sick for a couple of days , they went to the hospital and they sent them back to work . The doctor told them it was just a flu until Friday when the alarm was spread , then they were allowed to go home . I work in a call center and I 'm worried because there are no windows in the building so it can not be ventilated and around 400 people work there . We all have talked to our supervisor but no one has done anything not even sterilise or disinfect the area . We will be sick soon and , well , do the math - 400 can infect at least another two per day . The authorities say there 's nothing they can do since it 's a private company and I can assure you , the company I work for is not the only one like this in the whole city . Us workers do n't have much protection from our government and if we want to keep our jobs we have to go anyway . My sister got influenza like symptoms two weeks ago . She is fine now , thank god , but similar cases have been showing up since two weeks ago . I work for a bank and we were told to take our laptops because there is a high possibility to work from home . I have gone out to buy some face masks . I 'm a college student in Mexico City , and I can only say that the information that the media has provided does n't seem to be enough , we do not now how serious it is because they have failed to mention it . There have been two ways of responding to this event , the ones that have entered themselves into quarantine claiming that the government is hiding something much more serious , and those who take this as a joke saying that everyone is overreacting . To put a cherry on top all kind of crazy rumors are flying around - that they are going to quarantine Mexico City , that a school and some specific branches of offices and jobs are going to be suspended for days to come , and so on . I wish more info was available , for example how to prevent it ? Have there been many deaths ? Is there a threat of an epidemic ? I did n't hear about the flu epidemic until Friday night at 2330 . Yesterday the streets were almost empty compared to a normal Friday afternoon . The media is bombarding the same information over and over again , but the authorities have n't said anything new yet , only that they have enough vaccines for those with the flu and that we should avoid public spaces .

But officials warned the number of deaths likely to have been caused by swine flu has risen to 159 with more than 1,300 patients under observation . The number of cases globally is rising though no-one outside Mexico has died . Germany has become the latest country to confirm cases of the H1N1 virus , reporting three sufferers . Countries with suspected cases : Brazil , Guatemala , Peru , Australia , and South Korea , and seven EU states All three recently returned from Mexico , officials said . Spain and the UK earlier confirmed two cases each and six other EU states have been monitoring patients suspected of having the virus . At 64 , the US has the greatest number of confirmed cases outside Mexico . The state of California has declared a state of emergency and President Barack Obama is asking Congress for an additional $ 1.5 bn dollars to bolster the US response . A US federal health official , Dr Richard Besser of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said on Tuesday : `` As we continue to investigate cases here , I expect that we will see deaths in this country . '' Canada , New Zealand and Israel have also detected the virus , and other states with suspected cases include Australia , South Korea and Peru . In Mexico , there is some confusion over exactly how many people died from H1N1 , the BBC 's Stephen Gibbs reports . From Matthew Price in Oaxaca , Mexico The first fatal case of the virus is believed to have been contracted here in Oaxaca . It is a tourist center and the obvious concern is that when the visitors leave , they may take the virus with them . At the local cemetery , a group of gravediggers pointed me towards a freshly dug plot . The flowers on top had wilted under the sun but still had some color . Here was the grave of the first confirmed victim of the virus , Adela Gutierrez , 39 . One of the gravediggers , Sergio Castro Lopez , told me people here are worried . They are waiting for the authorities to tell them what they should do . I tried at the local hospital to get more information but the ministry of health has ordered its staff across the country to remain silent . This is largely because the government is now subjecting the samples it has from deceased patients to a more laborious verification process . Meanwhile , the search for the source of the outbreak continues , with the focus on the vicinity of a pig farm in the eastern part of the country . The Mexican government is urging against jumping to conclusions and is suggesting the possibility remains that the virus originated outside the country , our correspondent adds . The capital , Mexico City , has banned restaurants and cafes from serving all food except takeaways to try to prevent the spread of the virus . Schools across the country have closed , public gatherings are restricted and archaeological sites have been placed off-limits . California governor Schwarzenegger : ` We are taking strong and swift action ' Mexico City 's chamber of trade estimated restrictions in the city were costing businesses there at least 777 million pesos -LRB- $ 57m or # 39m -RRB- a day .

The World Health Organisation has called a meeting of scientific experts for Wednesday to discuss the situation and the exact nature of the outbreak . SYMPTOMS - WHAT TO DO Swine flu symptoms are similar to those produced by ordinary seasonal flu - fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue If you have flu symptoms and recently visited affected areas of Mexico , you should seek medical advice If you suspect you are infected , you should stay at home and take advice by telephone initially , in order to minimize the risk of infection Earlier , it confirmed that the flu was being transmitted between humans and called on countries to check their contingency plans for a possible pandemic . But the WHO also urged caution , saying measures like travel bans were unlikely to prove effective . Spain is one of the countries outside the Americas most vulnerable to the virus because of the sheer volume of its air passenger traffic with Mexico . It has two confirmed cases of swine flu and a further 32 people are undergoing tests . The government says the situation is `` under control '' , that no lives are at risk and that there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission within Spain . There is great fear among the medical community ... One of my colleagues that was exposed chose to stay in a hotel rather than run the risk of infecting her daughters Dr Guadalupe , BBC News website reader in Mexico Instead , it says all those under observation fell ill after visiting Mexico . All incoming passengers from that country and the US are being asked to fill in forms with medical information and contact details and airlines have been ordered to carry surgical masks .

It must continually evolve in order to evade its biggest threat - the immune system . Mammals , including humans , make antibodies , which recognize and target the virus . `` So it has to keep mutating to escape being destroyed , '' explains David Morens from the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . Despite these tactics , most of the strains that make people ill during the so-called `` flu season '' are sufficiently similar to infections most of us have been exposed to before . Our immune systems recognize common parts that these new strains share with their ancestors , and can launch an effective defense . Every so often , however , a different strain emerges and infects people - one that contains new genes from an animal virus . Its novelty is its most effective weapon against our immune defences . And if it is infectious enough to find its way easily into a new host - perhaps via an innocent sneeze - it can spread rapidly and cause a global epidemic - or pandemic . `` These events seem to be cyclical - they 've occurred about every 20-40 years , '' says Mark Honigsbaum a researcher at the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at University College London . `` And all of these pandemics have been associated with just a few strains , '' he says . Viral strains take their name from the various different types of two important proteins on their surface . Their initials are H for haemaglutanin , and N for neuraminidase . History teaches us that these pandemics ... are predictably unpredictable The haemaglutanin molecule protrudes from the surface of the virus as spikes , and enables it to lock on to receptors on the surface of cells . Neuraminidase allows the virus to be released from infected cells and infect new ones . `` There are 16 Hs and 9 Ns , but as far as we know , only H1 ,2,3 and only N1 and N2 have ever made it into a human virus , '' says Dr Morens . But beyond what is currently speculation that only a few strains may be transmissible among humans , the structure of flu gives us almost no clues about how it might behave and change . `` History teaches us to take these pandemics very seriously , '' says Howard Markel , director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan . `` But it also teaches us that they are predictably unpredictable . '' The first of the four pandemics was Russian flu - each takes its name from the country where the first case was reported - which emerged in 1889 . This was well before the science of virology had even been conceived . It rapidly spread through Europe , and reached North America and Latin America , lasting until 1892 and eventually killing an estimated one million people . Medical facilities were overwhelmed by the 1918 flu pandemic `` We have very little information about this strain , '' says Dr Morens . `` But in the mid 1900s , scientists started collecting , and more importantly preserving , serum samples from people who had been alive during the flu pandemic . So there is now some evidence that it could have been an H3 virus . `` If it turned out to be true that only limited types of influenza genes have the ability to work in a human virus , that would be important , because you could vaccinate the world 's population against the known possibilities of a pandemic virus , '' he says . Although at its early stages , work is already progressing on a universal vaccine - one that would stimulate human immune systems to recognize , and raise antibodies against parts of the influenza virus shared by all strains . But , during the last century , the virus has shown a deadly ability to change beyond recognition . In 1918 , an influenza pandemic started that became a global disaster - eventually killing more people than the Great War . Estimates of the death toll from the 1918 outbreak of Spanish flu range from 20 million to 40 million . Some historians argue it could have been as high as 100 million . `` There was a mild wave in the spring , but the very serious , lethal wave was in the autumn to the winter , '' says Professor Markel . `` Then a third wave in January to April 1919 , and a fourth wave in the winter of 1920 . '' This tendency for `` waves '' of infection and re-infection makes the virus yet more unpredictable . New vaccines for circulating strains are now designed every year At the time the medical consensus was that the disease was caused not by a virus , but by a bacterium called Haemophilus influenzae . So some countries , including the US and UK , distributed vaccinations against the wrong disease-causing agent . `` Another problem was that the authorities stuck their heads in the sand , '' says Mr Honigsbaum . `` Their priority was the war and they did n't have the resources to deal with the health crisis . `` There 's an argument that if they 'd been more proactive , and diverted doctors and nurses from the front to civilian needs , they could have saved more lives . '' Dr Morens refers to the 1918 H1N1 strain as `` the mother of all pandemics '' . `` In the category of Influenza A , which is the category of virus that has caused all human epidemics and pandemics , every virus circulated since 1918 has been a descendent of this virus in one way or another , '' he says . `` Descendants of the 1918 pandemic are still infecting human beings , but they have mutated again and again and again to be able to survive . '' The 1918 influenza pandemic gripped a vulnerable , unprepared human population , but its ability to `` reassort '' - or exchange its genes with other viruses - was what made it `` dangerously novel '' . We had two lineages of the disease , both of which have persisted National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases `` Every species has its own flu - when those species live together , and they can transmit their flu to different species , the virus itself changes its structure , '' says Professor Markel . Since our immune systems recognize and respond mainly to the H and N part of the molecule , scientists suspect that pandemics arise when a strain emerges with a big change in the structure of one of these proteins . But how exactly the virus adapts to enable it to attach to receptors on the cells of a different species , is an `` unanswerable '' question , says Dr Morens . `` With only four pandemics in over 100 years , our sample size is too small to say , but it seems that a new H -LRB- on the surface of the virus -RRB- has been the major factor , '' says Dr Morens . `` We do n't know where the 1918 virus came from , but the evidence is that it was a new virus . `` At the same time that it infected humans , it also infected pigs . And at that point , we began to have two lineages of that disease - the human virus , and the pig virus , which persisted too , '' he adds . The progeny of the 1918 influenza strain evolved and mutated as they were transmitted from one host to another . And on two further occasions , these strains incorporated completely new genes and spread globally once again . `` That 's what happened in 1957 and 1968 - a hybrid formed of the 1918 virus with genes that were never part of it before , '' says Dr Morens . In the case of the 1957 Asian flu outbreak , a human H2N2 virus combined with the genes of a strain found in wild ducks . The pandemic killed an estimated one million people worldwide . An outbreak of H3N2 Hong Kong flu in 1968 , when avian and human virus genes combined once again , claimed another million lives . In both cases , the impact was minimized by health authorities , who identified the virus , and made vaccines available . `` Now , every year , around summer time , a group of flu experts get together and see what strains are circulating so they can design an appropriate vaccine , '' says Dr Markel . And in the last few years , principally because of the global concern about avian flu , anti-viral drugs that target influenza , such as Tamiflu , have been introduced . The emergence of a virus that crosses a species barrier is extremely rare But Professor Markel points out that , despite having reached new levels of medical preparation , `` we live in a world of emerging infectious diseases '' . `` We have learned to take avian flu very seriously , and we have learned to take the animal kingdom very seriously , '' he says . But in the rare event that a virus does develop that is able to cross the species barrier , he points out that the close proximity of domestic farm animals to humans provides an opportunity for human infection . `` Human beings travel farther and faster than ever before . All of this means that we are set up for a potential epidemic or pandemic , '' concludes Professor Markel . `` We learn more every time , but the story of flu pandemics is still very much a story in progress .

It 's a story which has involved our reporters in Mexico , the US , Europe , Scotland and the rest of the UK , plus our medical and science specialists . And it has challenged us to think hard about our public service role on this kind of news story . In order to see this content you need to have both Javascript enabled and Flash installed . Visit BBC Webwise for full instructions . If you 're reading via RSS , you 'll need to visit the blog to access this content . Essentially , our task is to give you the facts ; to tell you what we know , but also explore what is n't known ; to give you the best scientific and medical information and to inform but not to alarm . There is a great deal of coverage in all the media which has led to a debate about whether the threat is being overplayed . With any public health story , there 's a risk that raising awareness can raise concern . We have sought at every step to report the science soberly and responsibly , with due weight given to the uncertainty of what will happen . We know that audiences have many questions . For the first couple of days , the comments and questions were coming in thick and fast , though they have now slowed . The majority has been from the UK , but there are considerable numbers from Europe and the US too . Yesterday , BBC Radio 5 Live did a phone-in , taking listeners ' questions about the outbreak 's impact and attempting to answer them using medical and travel experts . Those contacting the network had a range of questions : `` My son 's an hour and a half from Mexico City - how exposed is he ? '' `` Are anti-viral drugs safe for pregnant women ? '' `` I 'm booked to go to Mexico on 30 April ; the airline wo n't let us cancel and get a refund , what are our options ? '' To satisfy those members of our audience who 've been contacting our programs and website with questions , we put together a comprehensive Q&A . In our current Have Your Say debate on the subject , many contributors have now said they believe that the government and media are over-reacting . And World Have Your Say - the World Service global discussion program - was presented from the rooftop of a hotel in Mexico City yesterday . It asked its audience if the world was over-reacting to swine flu . We heard from many , including Abdullah in Abuja who e-mailed to say that there really was no comparison between swine flu and the kind of diseases many African nations deal with on a daily basis . There are voices raising important questions about media coverage of this virus . Ben Goldacre - a medical doctor who writes the Bad Science blog - says that he 's been struck by the number of people contacting him to say `` Is swine flu just nonsense ? '' and that the media is `` utterly '' mistrusted on its reporting of health issues . Simon Jenkins , writing today in the Guardian , has said the media has whipped up a panic in order to posture and spend . So far , the balance we have been trying to achieve is to report what we know and , critically , what is n't known , using the science available - for instance from the Chief Medical Officer for England , Sir Liam Donaldson and the World Health Organization - as well as what respected scientists are telling us about the possible pattern of this illness . At our editorial meetings , we have been regularly discussing how to get the approach , tone and use of pictures right , and to make sure that we offer our expertise and subject depth via our website . Interestingly , the signs so far suggest that the public is not panicking - listeners contacting BBC Radio 1 's Newsbeat are showing a distinct shift in opinion . Two days ago , they were expressing serious concern , but now - for many - it 's receding : `` Swine Flu has changed what I 'm doing . I yawned at the last radio update . I 'd probably not have done that if Swine Flu was n't mentioned . '' This virus - and this story - may fade away , or it may grow . At this point , as our correspondents are saying , we simply do n't know . I hope that our reporting in the past few days will help you make sense of what emerges in the next few days , whichever way it develops .

The potential consequences of a pandemic are not purely the medical consequences , the economic impact alone could significantly exacerbate the effects of the current recession . Disruption to public services , transport , food distribution , access to money , power generation , water supplies , processing of state benefits etc etc. . All of these processes and functions we take for granted and they all involve people going to work . This is the real danger posed by a potential pandemic , particularly to a society that relies so heavily on goods and services . We as a country have become so reliant upon others for almost everything we need and the failure of this infrastructure is what the government fear the most .

Mutation might occur naturally but not gene splicing ! `` An influenza virus especially one genetically manipulated for increased virulence would be an attractive weapon for bioterrorists '' I can understand -LRB- although not approve -RRB- of the general scaremongering amongst tabloids and commercial news channels . Unfortunatley , they require sensationalism to sell their stories and gain viewers . I do n't see why the BBC has to join in the media frenzy for that reason . There are no advertisers to please or sales to present , a full coverage of daily news is what I require and pay for , not a single story . The difference in mortalities in epidemic and in pandemic influenza is a factor of ten . Epidemic influenza regularly `` accelerates '' the deaths of many hundreds of thousands of people every year . The viral mutations make it difficult to control or inhibit . Anti-viral drugs have not been tested for effectiveness across large populations where mortality may be expected to be high . It is almost impossible to give accurate figures for the number of deaths wholly caused by the virus as compared to deaths assisted by the virus . Influenza spreads very quickly and easily . Even with a double handed protective cup against a sneeze the viral aerosol is sufficient to reach ten or maybe twenty people on a closely packed bus , coach , train or aircraft . All of these people will carry the virus and some will suffer the symptoms of illness at varying levels . One or two may become quite ill , whilst others may experience a day or so of discomfit . Some will experience no illness at all apart from sneezes or coughs which spread the attack still further . Deaths may occur with very young children or infirm elderly from complications e.g. pneumonia . The genetic manipulation of viruses similar in activity to influenza is a potent way to disable population groups and cause high numbers of deaths . It is almost impossible to secure against influenza even through vaccination . There are vaccines and treatments for almost everything that afflicts Africa . There are vaccines for meningitis , cholera and malaria ; there are mitigating therapies for HIV disease . There are cheap water filters in the world that would make cholera non-existent . What there is no known treatment for is the corruption of African leaders , bureaucrats and middlemen who make fortunes for themselves out of every aid effort organised from outside Africa . It is up to the diverse populations of Africa to do what has been done by other populations that have known great misery & affliction : organise themselves to get rid of the worst corrupt elements and install reasonably functional people in positions of authority . This has already been demonstrated to bring some relief in countries such as Brazil , Russia , India , and China , not to mention Pakistan or Indonesia . The number of suffering regions in the world is indeed great , but only diligent effort by sufferers themselves actually leads to effective improvements in local , regional and national governance . History proves there are no short-cuts to this process . The problem with the H1N1 alarm has to do in part with the possibility that in Mexico a second and potentially even a third set of factors complicate health security . The very nature of this puzzle becomes a compelling driver for unraveling the knots in the story , so that we can not only deal with the problem , but also understand more and prepare better for a potentially fraught future . For as long as Africans look to the affluent societies for assistance , they will need to accept that threats to the richer countries also imply worsening conditions in Africa . Please understand that most people in the US are in fact living hand-to-mouth , day-to-day ; there are plenty of Americans whose life circumstances are no different from average wage-earning Africans ' , and these people are indeed at risk : the 2 % -5 % of Americans -LRB- I am only using US as an example because it is next door to Mexico & essentially there is an open border between the two countries -RRB- who are indeed so wealthy they appear to be invincible to others -LRB- and of course they are anything but -RRB- represent a tiny minority living in a cocoon . It is wrong of people in Africa to lump other kinds of people into a single pot of `` the rich we are entitled to resent '' , just as it is wrong for people in prosperous countries to dismiss this looming pandemic as `` a problem for the low-caste people who do n't really matter much and so what . '' Every serious health crisis humans face , including all the problems complicating life for Africans , links back to a problem with population . Reckless procreation -LRB- and no , I do not mean accidental pregnancies that befall very young people out of naivete , but rather the deliberate intention , through marriage and polygamy and conscious promiscuity by African males -RRB- to beget as many souls as possible exacerbates all problems . When in times of famine grown people insist on conceiving new children only to watch them die in agony , over and over again , the chance of finding effective solutions for the diseases that plague malnourished and immunity-depressed populations withers on the vine . Any married person knows that it is not necessary even to have available contraceptive devices , instructions , medicines or treatments to regulate the frequency of children being conceived . All that is really required to have a reasonable number of offspring -LRB- and for some people ` reasonable ' might mean Zero -RRB- is common sense , a little reason , a good heart and some self-control . There are many ways to be close and happy together that do not involve creating new people or risking infections . Every nation and even every family that has ever advanced in life has done so because it exerted great effort , even in the face of dreadful odds . Japan overcame the horrors of Hiroshima & Nagasaki . The list of other awful tragedies is long , and you know it . When people stop making excuses and blaming others , and get busy working out what they do indeed personally control that they can through personal dedication change , suddenly everything becomes a lot easier to accomplish .

Of course this is partly an effect of the move toward the generation of constant drama and fear by the public health industry itself . One day the headlines shriek about how bacon has been ` found ' to cause cancer , the next some talking head is claiming that a BMI of 25 is no longer good enough , and every conceivable convenience of modern life has some kind of potential health drawback . Meanwhile health concerns are no longer expressed in terms of their potential real-life impact on ordinary people but in apocalyptic prose such as ` worse than terrorism ' or ' a bigger threat than climate change ' or ` the potential to destroy the NHS ' . Whilst even formerly reputable organizations such as the BMA and WHO are busy trying to grab a slice of the action , the vast majority of these sort of stories still seem to emerge from hitherto unheard-of ` think tanks ' and ` research centres ' such as this week 's predictable round of fat-bashing from the world-reknowned ` London School of hygiene and Tropical Medicine ' , desperate for notoriety , a research grant and fifteen minutes of fame . Where the BBC has a part to play is in being more discriminating about which of these claims it decides to publish and how prominently they feature on the site . Anyone can set themselves up as a ` researcher ' and put out a press release nowadays , and hence the currency of the ` expert ' has been hugely devalued . Just Google MeMe Roth whose grandly-titled ` National Action Against Obesity ' is run from a back bedroom , and yet the American media fawn over her as though she really is the ` president ' of this hugely influential organization . The BBC is probably unique in that it can afford to employ people in its health department who actually have some knowledge of the issues under discussion rather than relying on press releases paraphrased by overworked journalists . And yet I trust its health output about as far as that of the Daily Mail , with which the top stories are frequently -LRB- and disconcertingly -RRB- interchangeable .

I am not an expert , however , when organizations such as the WHO repeatedly over-inflate the risks , then I become cynical , as it seems do most of the posters to this blog . As for the BBC reporting on this swine flu outbreak , it has been thus far reasonable , keep up the good work . I am a little confused about the attacks on WHO information which reaches us via the media NOT directly from the Organisation itself . Any spin is applied -LRB- censored , edited etc -RRB- before it is released to us , not only afterwards . If one wishes to compare and contrast media manipulation of data released by WHO then inquire as to why the media have perpetuated `` passive smoking '' myths when WHO are amongst the few who say '' -LRB- passive smoking -RRB- does not exist as a measurable risk '' . When , however , requested to estimate the risk of a particularly unpleasant influenza strain -LRB- e.g. avian ` flu -RRB- what the WHO actually said is that `` if the virus mutates the ability to jump person to person '' we face a potentially high mortality rate , possibly in hundreds of millions '' . That was accurate science reported by most media inaccurately . The problem with Type A influenza is that , in common with almost any infection , it is deaths that make news first , not the numbers who contract the virus and recover . If just one person survives a ` flu -LRB- epi - or pandemic -RRB- attack then we have the anti-bodies and potential survival . In the case of Type A for all we know there are millions of Mexicans -LRB- etc -RRB- who have recovered and survived without the use of Tamiflu or any other anti-viral medicine . Healthy people can withstand virus attacks in 99.999 % of cases . So please do not enter into a argument about responsible journalism , irresponsible WHO . No such animal as responsible journalism is alive and kicking in the west at the present time . Even the BBC is in a competition to be `` best '' and that is sad .

Answering questions on the evolving pandemic in Abuja yesterday , the IPHF boss admonished against unnecessary sensationalism of the issue by the media and advised journalists to give the public accurate information that can assist in mitigating the spread . He also reacted to statements by public officers like US Vice-President Joe Biden that was credited to have advised Americans against some forms of transportation . He advised that whenever possible notable figures should endeavor to have a perspective of WHOs global and public health posture on such issues before making categorical statements . The Forum is wholly in support of the direction , drive and leadership of the WHO , and agrees with Keiji Fukuda , Assistant Director-General of the UN Health body the epidemiological picture is still evolving and heightened vigilance and improved reporting structure is critical , especially in view of the sustained human transmission that has so far been seen particularly in Mexico and other countries . He further advised that the term H1N1 should be used rather than the swine flu which is to some extent misleading a lot of people into the impression that the flu is actively being spread by pigs or circulating amongst them . In this sense , he reiterated that the case is not exactly the same as experienced with the H5N1 -LRB- Bird flu -RRB- .

How can that be considered to be `` Sweeping across the world '' ? Please keep your language under control when dealing with an event like this flu epidemic . Some of the information given has so far been extremely helpful and I think the BBC has done an excellent job of keeping the public calm . However I do think that saying that Swine Flu is `` sweeping '' across the world is more than a slight exaggeration with only very few confirmed cases .

One of the things we may not understand is that dosing people up with Tamiflu and trying to limit spread are actually playing into the hands of future pandemics because the crucial factor in influenza is the production of antibodies by the would be host . People will die because of type A influenza infection , so called swine variant or not . That is a fact of life and one of the risks that have to be taken to ensure that the majority have the capacity to produce antibodies that will mitigate against future variants .

"}, {"uid": "635", "dct": "2009-04-29", "dates": [null, null], "text": "Stephanie Flanders | 14:44 UK time , Wednesday , 29 April 2009 For anyone who has spent the past two weeks thinking about Britain 's finances , here 's one big thing what happened while you were away : people got a lot more optimistic about the Chinese economy . I had a good chat with Jim O'Neill , Goldman Sachs ' chief economist yesterday . He could scarcely contain himself on the subject . The Chinese authorities have impressed the world before with their response to economic crises - for example during the Asian financial crises of 1997-8 . This crisis is of a different order . But so has been the response . As a share of the US economy , China 's fiscal stimulus measures this year are larger even than America 's . While the loosening of credit conditions is greater than any that O'Neill has ever seen . All this policy seems to be having an effect . He 's just raised Goldman Sachs ' forecast for Chinese growth this year from 6 % to more than 8 % , and next year 's from 9 % growth to nearly 11 % . This optimism gets support from stories on the ground . Qu Hongbin and Sun Junwei , of HSBC , just returned from a tour of three big cities in inland provinces , which were never as dependent on exports as the coast . They say that firms there are already benefiting from all the new infrastructure projects that the government is putting on stream . And consumer spending is holding up as well , growing at annual rates of close to 20 % . The national picture is also looking up . The volume of bank loans grew by nearly 30 % in the first three months of the year . While the British were obsessing over their finances , China also reported a record month for car sales in March . Is the domestic demand-led growth we may see from China this year a sign of things to come ? None other than Dr Doom himself , Nouriel Roubini , recently returned from China saying that the authorities recognized the need for change . But there is plenty of room for doubt . The government may have put on the domestic spending taps to avoid recession this year -LRB- and we should all be very grateful that they have -RRB- . But when global demand for toys and everything else eventually picks up , there will still be plenty of Chinese firms eager to meet it . More important , without further reforms , the Chinese economy that comes out of this crisis will still be hard-wired to save a ridiculously high share of its national income . Thanks to a distorted financial system , firms - especially small ones - will still save a lot more of their profits than they do in other countries . And the sparse-to-nonexistent social welfare system will still mean that families save every penny they can , not just for retirement but for health and education expenses and to insure against the risk of being laid off . As Dr Roubini 's own RGE Monitor points out , only 10 % of the $ 600bn Chinese stimulus package this year is allocated to social welfare spending . Even with reform , China would probably be a high saving economy . But it could save a lot less than it does . The excess means that it inevitably ends up with more than it can possibly invest at home . As I 've discussed many times before , this export of Chinese savings is the flipside of its massive exports of goods . No-one expects that imbalance to go away as a result of the authorities ' efforts to date . Indeed , the IMF thinks that China 's current account surplus will actually go up again this year , to nearly $ 500bn , though that 's a smaller rise than in past years . In short , it is very good news that China 's economy seems to be picking up . But it 's too soon to judge whether it will manage the long-term turnaround the global economy dearly needs . So now we 'll be able to borrow more Chinese money to buy Chinese manufactured goods , so they can afford to lend us more money . Unless the Chinese are prepared to spend rather than lend we are just increasing borrowing . Only an economist could call this good news .

Figures do n't lie , but liars figure ... . this has certainly become more apparent worldwide but China has always been in the forefront of enhanced projections . Unemployment , that could lead to soical unrest is still a concern and the uneven distribtion of income between urban and rural areas continues to grow . Individual investors with particular manufacturing interest do not reflect the reality that China will have a difficult time if the other nations are not purchasing their products . Do you really think China will realize high percentage growth by selling toys ?

Is it not possible that the rapid increase in domestic consumption and consumer spending could lead to a nvestment of all those savings in domestic production capacity - and a positive spiral of domestic growth ? In which case we should not hold out breathwaiting for the Chinese money to flow back into our economy . This could also result in a measure of price and wage inflation in China , which would mean that Chinese goods would gradually become more expensive over here . That is what I thought everyone meant by rebalancing : and fair play to them .

All in all , China is not likely to help us out of recession . Instead , it 's more likely that China will simply end up owning the best bits of Britain , as we 're forced to sell the family silver in order to put food on the table ... Exports from the USA have just fallen by 30 % , which does n't suggest the US is benefiting much from China 's `` optimistic economy '' .

This is definitely a win-win scenario and the Chinese are serious about mitigating the effects of their industrial development . Do n't forget that the Chinese are trying to do in a very short time frame what we in the west have done over two centuries or more . From what we see of China the population is disciplined about saving rather than spending which is how our popualtion behaved in our grandparents generation ; when there is no welfare state people have to rely on themselves . Good for them I say . Perhaps we could re-learn this lesson and not be so greedy for material goods as we have been . There is still a massive disparity in China between the largely rural peasant population and the mainly younger people living in the cities and if I were in the position of the Chinese government I would be looking to spend on basic state welfare provision and stimulating an internal market for goods and services . China is such a massive country it could easiy survive without the rest of the world and be self-sufficient in food , energy manufactured goods etc. . We have created our own problems in the west and maybe the Chinese could help us out but they do n't really need to and we 'd do well to remember that .

That means inward rather than outward investment . The imbalances in the world economy need to be shifted back to balance and we should never go back to the bad old ways of borrowing to waste .

Please define 3rd world standard . If you want to see 3rd world standards roads , hospitals , schools , look to Africa , India , Caribbean Island . They are real eye openers there for you . You are quite oblivious to the amount of money China has to pump into rural infastructure , roads every year . All those nice skyscrapers you see in Beijing and Shanghai are and were mostly funded by Chinese companies as well as foreign corporations . Even the new Beijing airport got a fair share of private companies money in there as well . The amount of subways and metros China is building every year is just simply too staggering and yes subways and metros are for ordinary people , not only that huge amount of money pump into getting better , faster trains to boost efficiency . Have you ever been to an US subway before ? I bet ya did not , go there and see how a 3r world standard subway look like for you . You know sometimes we can not even guarantee that everyone in any particular country can be taken care off . Take the US healthcare system for example , the welfare system ... etc. ... It is so poorly managed . Airports : Not for show certainly , as the capacity of air travellers increases as well as the influx of tourists , there is a need for new aiports , you do n't necessarily build it for show , you build it for tourists and travellers and consequently boost the local economy . Stadium : For the Olympics , certainly yes after the Games it is just standing there but it attracts huge amount of inbound tourists . Good for local economy and boosting jobs . Skyscrapers : For big companies and any other overseas companies wish to open offices in China , or independently funded by conglomerates who wish to have their own building .

At 23:37 29th Apr 2009 , krazykaju wrote : Saving is what makes an economy grow and it 's partially why China has had such spectacular economic growth . Saving means lower interest rates because it : 1 -RRB- Reduces demand for credit . 2 -RRB- Increases supply of credit -LRB- if put in a bank -RRB- . Lower interest rates mean that manufacturers have more money to borrow . This , in turn , means that manufacturers are able to buy more machinery , hire more workers , and\\/or buy more land\\/factories\\/etc . This increases productivity , thereby increasing economic growth . Even more important is that this form of credit is not inflationary . Since it is not created via the banks by fractional reserve banking and it is not created by central banks like the BOE or the Fed , it will not drive up prices . When someone else saves so that you can borrow , prices can not rise because you refrained from purchasing $ X worth of goods so that someone else could do so and eventually pay you back with interest . This prevents asset bubbles from arising , since there is no such thing as `` excess liquidity '' to cause them . All periods of high economic growth have been associated with high savings rates . Take the `` Golden 50s and 60s '' in America as an example . Data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data -LRB- FRED -RRB- shows that during this time period , saving was high . The reason the West is in such a dire economic crisis is because of overconsumption caused by artificially low interest rates . People no longer had to save to get a house or buy a car , and thus were able to spend recklessly while racking up loads of debt . Eventually , unemployment began to rise and companies became less profitable , causing a fall in asset prices and leading to the current bust . Re # 6 by Tweedy and # 8 by Janchild I believe the main problem with the situation is that except for international businessmen , most people in the West only know about China in terms of Tibet , etc ! While there are obvious undesirable features in the present Chinese government , it is also true that they have done a lto for their citizens . Janchild said it all -- the country is so large it can actually be an integrated economy in every way . It would be good if the general public in the West is given a more balanced view of China . They would then be more awake to the opportunites open for the taking . The West is not short of products , material , intellectual , and others that it can offer to that country if only it would open it 's eyes more . For UK one of it 's strong offerring could be education which is highly valued !

On this point as far as I can understand China has a long way to go . There were some 70,000 demonstrations in China in 2008 . Civil unrest usually means peopel feel deprived of what they perceive should be theirs . The reponse from officials is frequently some form of exercise of power .

The child - one of 91 cases of swine flu in the US - had been visiting relatives in Texas when he fell ill . The World Health Organization said the virus was still spreading , even though it was now from person to person . And Spain says it has confirmed the first case of swine flu in a person who has not traveled to Mexico . US : one death , at least 91 confirmed cases The Mexican boy had arrived in the Texan border city of Brownsville on 4 April and developed flu symptoms four days later , the Texas Department of State Health Services said . He was later transferred to a hospital in Houston , where he died on Monday night . The cause of death was confirmed on Wednesday by Dr Richard Besser , acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . `` Unfortunately this morning I do have to confirm that we have the first death of a child from H1N1 flu virus , '' he told US TV channel CBS . Speaking in Washington , President Obama offered his condolences and said the federal government was doing the utmost to contain the virus . SYMPTOMS - WHAT TO DO Swine flu symptoms are similar to those produced by ordinary seasonal flu - fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue If you have flu symptoms and recently visited affected areas of Mexico , you should seek medical advice If you suspect you are infected , you should stay at home and take advice by telephone initially , in order to minimize the risk of infection He also urged local public-health bodies to be vigilant and said schools with confirmed cases `` should consider closing '' . Texas Governor Rick Perry said closing the US border with Mexico was an option , but added that taking that step now would be `` a little premature '' . The assistant director general of the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- , Keiji Fukuda , said that although the virus originated in pigs , it was now being transmitted from human to human . `` It is clear that the virus is spreading and we do n't see evidence of it slowing down , '' he told reporters from WHO headquarters in Geneva . He added that moving the pandemic alert to five - the second highest - from the current four would be a significant step , but was not necessary at the moment . He said the WHO would do so if infected people in at least two countries were spreading the disease to other people in a sustained way . The WHO has said measures like travel bans were unlikely to prove effective . France will ask the European Union on Thursday to suspend all flights going to Mexico because of the flu outbreak , Health Minister Roselyne Bachelot said . From Matthew Price in Oaxaca , Mexico At the local cemetery , a group of gravediggers pointed me towards a freshly dug plot . The flowers on top had wilted under the sun but still had some color . Here was the grave of the first confirmed victim of the virus , Adela Gutierrez , 39 . One of the gravediggers , Sergio Castro Lopez , told me people here are worried . They are waiting for the authorities to tell them what they should do . In Spain , the government said the first person to contract swine flu without having traveled to Mexico was the boyfriend of a young woman who had recently returned from there . Spanish Health Minister Trinidad Jimenez said such cases were to be expected . In total , the number of confirmed cased in Spain rose from two to 10 on Wednesday . None of them are seriously ill . In Mexico , the search for the source of the outbreak continues , with the focus on the vicinity of a pig farm in the eastern part of the country . The Mexican government is urging against jumping to conclusions and is suggesting the possibility remains that the virus originated outside the country . Schools across Mexico have closed , public gatherings are restricted and archaeological sites have been placed off-limits . Mexico City 's chamber of commerce estimated restrictions in the city were costing businesses there at least 777 million pesos -LRB- $ 57m or # 39m -RRB- a day . Have you been affected by swine flu ?

The race for a vaccine is on . Manufacturers are currently working on the seasonal flu vaccine It is a global endeavor and will bring the public and the private together , but it could still take several months before a safe and effective jab is available . Yet amid all this activity , the answer could in fact be right under our noses . Tests are being carried out to establish whether the current seasonal flu vaccine could provide cross protection against what we are seeing at the moment , as there are similarities between the H1N1 human flu viruses and the new H1N1 swine flu . If that were the case - and it 's certainly not impossible - we would in the words of one virologist be `` home and dry '' . Even if this does not confer protection , the picture does not appear to be a bleak one . The spread of bird flu amongst humans several years ago sparked fears that a pandemic was imminent . Plans were developed , expertise harnessed and facilities built for mass production . If this had happened six years ago we would really be in a fix - we are in a better position than we have ever been in the history of this planet to combat this Barts and the London School of Medicine The vaccine industry has started to attract new investment and government subsidies after years of being a pharmaceutical backwater . `` It was a fantastic dry run , '' says Professor John Oxford of Barts and the London School of Medicine . `` If this had happened six years ago we would really be in a fix - we are in a better position than we have ever been in the history of this planet to combat this . '' The World Health Organisation says it is already in touch with vaccine manufacturers - although is not at this stage putting in orders - but initial work is already underway in national laboratories . The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which is looking at the molecular properties of the virus and why it appears to have been more virulent in Mexico is hoping to have produced a `` reference strain '' to send to vaccine manufacturers around the second week of May . The same process will take place in the UK , once the Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- receives samples of the virus at its laboratories in Potters Bar . `` We will take this virus apart and reassemble it with two genes from the swine virus and the genetic information code for a laboratory virus called PR8 which grows very well in hens ' eggs and is safe for human infection , '' said Dr John Wood , from the HPA 's National Institute of Biological Standards and Control . `` When we have recreated this new hybrid virus this will be grown in cells and hens ' eggs ready to distribute to vaccine manufacturers . '' This , he said , should be done within three to four weeks . But it may be at least four to five months before a vaccine is ready . Clearly , if you make a swine flu vaccine and the pandemic does n't actually occur , we could end up with no seasonal flu vaccine Safety is - unsurprisingly - paramount , as vaccines can often be worse than the disease they are trying to combat . An outbreak of swine flu in 1976 infected 200 people in the US . Only one of them died , but a vaccine administered to 40m people killed 25 and led to 500 others developing Guillain-Barre syndrome , which can be fatal . For those countries now entering the summer months with the flu season behind them , a delay in vaccine is not a real cause for concern . But in the southern hemisphere where countries are entering their winter months the picture would be different if the outbreak were to worsen . One way of administering the vaccine could be by adding a swine flu component to the seasonal flu jab given out in the autumn . But while production facilities are much more extensive than they once were , it could still take several years to produce enough swine vaccine to match global demand if the virus continues to spread and becomes more virulent . And in the rush to combat swine flu - from which there have been fewer than 10 confirmed deaths - manufacturers still have to keep their eye on producing an effective vaccine for seasonal flu as they do every year . In the US alone there are an estimated 25-50 million cases reported each year . These result in 150,000 hospitalisations and 30,000 to 40,000 deaths . Worldwide there may be as many as half a million deaths each year . `` Clearly , if you make a swine flu vaccine and the pandemic does n't actually occur , we could end up with no seasonal flu vaccine , '' warned Chris Viehbacher , chief executive officer of Sanofi-Aventis . In any event , swine flu appears to be responding well to anti-viral treatments like Tamiflu and Relenza . These drugs do not attack the virus itself but an enzyme that allows it to spread within the body . Taken promptly , they can reduce the severity and length of the illness . But production of sufficient quantities - were they needed - could again be problematic , although pharmaceutical giants GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Roche Holding AG have both said they are stepping up production .

Up to 169 people are believed to have died in the outbreak - all but one of them in Mexico . Confirmed cases of swine flu have been reported in numerous other countries , including New Zealand , Spain , Austria and Canada , but most have been mild cases . Many of those victims had been to Mexico , prompting airport screening for passengers displaying potential flu symptoms . Egyptian authorities increased numbers of medical staff at Cairo airport to check passengers arriving from Mexico and will monitor them during their stay . Egypt suffered during the outbreak of bird flu , between 2004 and 2008 , with 22 deaths reported . The latest swine flu is a variation of H1N1 , which causes seasonal outbreaks of flu in humans on a regular basis . However , this strain contains genetic material that is typically found in strains of the virus that affect humans , birds and swine . Pigs can act as a `` melting pot '' for several flu strains . "}, {"uid": "278", "dct": "2009-04-30", "dates": [null, null], "text": "How can we avoid a swine flu pandemic ? The World Health Organization says countries must not lower their guard in the response to the swine flu outbreak . What are your concerns about the virus ? Almost 900 cases had been confirmed across five continents , the WHO said , and authorities have to remain vigilant . Viruses increased and decreased in activity , it said , and it was too early to tell whether the outbreak had peaked where it emerged in Mexico . The number of confirmed cases of swine flu in the UK has risen to 18 . The increase , comes as health chiefs await the results of more than 600 tests for the disease . What precautions are you taking to prevent the spread of swine flu ? How have your government and media reacted to the outbreak ? How concerned are you ? Are you in Mexico ? Are streets and beaches deserted ? Send your pictures of deserted areas in Mexico to yourpics@bbc.co.uk or text them to +447725100100 . If you have a large file you can upload here . This debate is now closed . The extensive media coverage of swine flu is a welcome distraction from the potentially destabilising economic crisis . It makes us realize how lucky we are . Where as I thought the media had panicked people with the stories of this virus , I do think that it has helped to contain the spread , by making people more cautious over the flu . Basic hygiene , avoid lifts and wash hands frequently during the day . Alfred Penderel Bright , Harrogate , North Yorkshire . I 'm honestly surprised we do n't die of other illnesses already . The amount of people I see leaving public toilets without washing their hands both out and about and in the workplace appals me . Personal hygiene is so easy yet a lot of people do n't seem to care . Honestly , I 'd rather be tongue bathed by my dog than touch the handle of a public toilet . Andy Craddock , St Austell , Cornwall How do we get the media to start reporting news again instead of everything being hype , emotion and sentimentalism - the real virus is the daily toll of exposure to this stuff . it 's got to the point where the ` news ' is a reality gameshow ` Flu is not the bubonic plague where mortality is around 50 % . The best way to avoid any viral infection is to stay at home and let it pass . Modern antibiotics make mincemeat of bacterial infections like bubonic plague . The best way to cope with viral infections is to have a vaccine if one is available , otherwise use anti-virals . As a last resort keep vitamin D levels up - walk regularly in the sun . I am not worried about swine flu . Thousands of people across the world die of regular flu every yea . This has not been the mass killing illness which was feared . Of course take a few extra measures , but it is no different to any other illness like washing your hands , sneezing into tissues . Its stuff we should be doing anyway . Basic hygiene Darren Spraggs , New Malden , UK By Not panicking ... its getting all out of hand ! Shoppers panicking about shopping trolleys not being clean ... what 's next not wanting to pick food off shelves because the stackers might have a cold ... COME ON PEOPLE ! How do you think you catch colds anyway ? Wash your hands more ... sneeze into tissues , catch it bin it , kill it ! . . up your hand hygiene if worried buy hand gel cleaners but do n't over use and definitely do n't use when smoking after all its alcohol based !! Just shut ports borders and airports , simple answer yes trade would suffer but would reduce the risk tenfold . It 's the quality of life that matters not the quantity and dying from swine flu is probably no worse or better than dying from other diseases . At least if we are all supposedly dead we wo n't have to watch the world go to hell in a handbasket and have to listen to terrible media hyperbole anymore . Every cloud has a silver lining . My concern is cross contamination through supermarket basket\\/trolly handles and yet on checking , with various supermarket head offices I have n't found one store in England that has implemented a deep cleansing routine or even offered disinfecting wipes out to their customers when entering their stores . No wonder we all catch flu these days . ` Flu is not the bubonic plague where mortality is around 50 % . The best way to avoid any viral infection is to stay at home and let it pass . Trouble is employers would take a dim view of that . It will get us in the end . I do n't see how the health secretary can say it is being `` confined , contained and treated '' . I do n't see that it is being contained if there are cases of people who have caught the virus by contact with people who have been to Mexico . People who have traveled to affected areas should have remained in isolation . Schools are not closed if a pupil has not been symptomatic yet the first man to catch the virus who had not traveled appears to have done so through a carrier who had traveled to Mexico but was not displaying symptoms . It seems to me that the authorities are just accepting the inevitable and allowing it to spread but are unwilling to say so . I do n't understand the necessity to close schools & then for parents to possibly transmit the virus at work , or for brothers\\/sisters in other schools to also possibly spread the virus . If there is serious threat to health , and to have any serious effect in stopping the spread , then surely whole families should be quarantined & not just parts of it . Present policy is nonsensical , non practical , and unrealistic with stopping any pandemic . But then again we are used to half hearted non-sensical policies from this negligent inept government . Thank you to the government for a measured response , sensible information and good forward planning . Hopefully this is a mild outbreak and the death rate will be the same as or even less than normal flu . But that is still additional deaths and there is still the potential for an autumn out break . Yes there has been media hype - it is what sells papers ! - but the reality is that if we had taken this approach with other viruses then many lives would have been saved . The UK focus now must be on maintaining sensible precautions and looking to help countries less able than us to manage an outbreak . What is the WHO alert level of seasonal flu ? It would be interesting to know as a comparison - might help put things into context\\/rationalise this new threat ! The Swine flu pandemic has brought a lot of anxiety for many people especially some of us in the Developing countries . We depend on you people from the developed countries to share with us the symptoms and the precaution to be taken if we are faced with the same . Paul Kuyela Kolala , Ndola , Zambia How can we avoid a swine flu pandemic ? Just by constant education by those who know how to deal with this virus . Stop the sensationalist journalism . The gist of what you have been reporting in the last week is `` 15 people caught the flu in the UK and they are now recovering from it '' ! That 's all there is to it . Is that really first page news ? If you 're gonna get it , you will . It 's obvious what to do . Isolate those who do have it , and give meds to every household . That will prove if we really were prepared . In history there have always been periods of mass infection and disease . We are human after all , so we ca n't avoid it . If Swine Flu does n't get us then there 'll be another one along soon . Firstly by ignoring hyped press - As a nurse I know we have a good infrastructure-however when people are directed to A&E or to just to the pharmacy you wonder who is paying attention . I want to know if in Birmingham the plane was grounded and cleaned from those passengers carrying the virus-small things like this count-planes are invariable landed quick cleaned and out again which potentially infects more people . I agree with most of the comments that have been posted on this page . I can not believe how far this ` flu ' has been blown out of proportion . Stop wearing masks that do nothing and continue with normal civilized life !!! I would stop all flights and travel abroad to contain this spread The World Health Organization rightly says countries must not lower their guard in the response to the swine flu outbreak . The only way to avoid catching a virus is to stop breathing - the consequences of that however are far more serious . The WHO have no authority over the flu virus , if you catch it then rest , have plenty to drink , look after yourself . Stop panicking and get on with life . With the overwhelming number of cases here in Britain I fear it is far too late . All we can do is sit back and watch as the numbers increase to 100 or more . Too late and resulting in needless cases of mild flu . People , come to Mexico and do n't be afraid of the flu , or of Mexicans . I just got back from a tour of Northern Mexico , and I heard of 2 cases of flu in all of northern Mexico . Two cases , and northern Mexico is bigger than France . Come on , what 's the deal ? if you want problems walk around Detroit at 3am John Paul Cline , Guadalajara , Mexico Hey , what do you know ? Swine flu has not been as bad as the media and government wanted us to believe , but do n't stop panicking , because it could get worse again in the autumn !! Another over-blown scare from a government trying to take our sights off the economy and the mess they are in . The best way to avoid it is to steer well clear of the source i.e news media . Swine flu is like normal flu only milder , yet you would think it was The Plague by the way it has been blown all out of proportion . I 'm sorry for the 900 , but 900 out of five continents , God only knows how many billions of people , hardly constitutes a `` pandemic '' . As other articles point out , five or more orders of magnitude more people die EVERY YEAR from normal seasonal flu . So this is a major media hyperbole pork non-event . Shame on the broadcasters . Wash your hands and get on with life . If the media did n't report on daily or weekly news , we would know nothing at all , we would all be sneezing and spluttering on everyone , none of you can say you have n't took their words into advice and made a little more effort over this , fair enough they sell more papers but we buy them regardless . If it was n't for the media scaring us a lot of the human race would carry on coughing in any direction you walked in . Just stop it BBC . Stop with this race to find the next bogeyman to scare us with . You and the rest of the media , you may have noticed this time that more and more people are failing to fall for this shtick , and the more you delve into speculation and scarifying the more eroded your once-great reputation becomes . Swine flu has come along at just the right time for us all to forget about MPs ' expenses and the failing economy ... How convenient ! I know Tories want to blame everything on Gordon Brown but get real a mild -LRB- ish -RRB- version of flu starting in Mexico that has got to be Brown 's fault . The reality is around 10,000 die each Year in the UK as a result of flu infections and the excessive concentration on this virus by the media is only likely to result , given finite production capacity , in vaccinations being produced in lower quantities for the likely winter virus . PS BBC sort your system out its been 3 days now . I believe the WHO is correct in all its assertions . They are a research organization put in place by the government to inform , study , control , and treat all health related topics . We as a public need to be cognisant of all the information given and do as instructed and follow all information given for ourselves our families and everyone . I am glad all information including scientific research information has been given freely to the public . We need to escape the last 5 years of governmental silence in which no one was informed of anything . We have two cases of swine flu in our town outside of Chicago and I am not worried at all . Both of the people , a 12 year old , and a 25 year old , were treated and are recovering quickly . This whole thing is just media food to scare us . This is just a diversion from the economic problems . People die from the flu every year , what 's the big deal . Please report on who is stealing all our money . Why all this `` Scare and hype tactics '' around a regular influenza virus ? We have approx 41 million people world wide with HIV , 3000 people die every day from malaria and here we have an a minute fraction of the world 's population with a `` flu '' virus and yet again the WHO and media outlets try to create massive profits for the pharmaceutical industries by adding fuel to a minute out break of flu . Please get this in perspective and desist from creating unnecessary panic . Charts showing the spread of the disease did indeed confirm how easy it was to invade populations . Reasonable precautions taken have had a good result . Do n't pooh-pooh the containment as proof that measures were unnecessary . But the real test comes down the road to see if the `` bug '' mutates further in the fall . I personally think that its just a regular cold . All the symptoms have an explanation other than swine flu . We have no reason to think its anything other than the common cold , with maybe a few small changes . I do n't know a whole lot about it , and I 'm not some brilliant doctor , but all my friends are basically competing for `` person most likely to have swine flu . '' One of the teachers will send you home with the slightest cough or if you lay your head on the desk . It 's no big deal . We are also hurting Mexico . We 're blaming it on them and now no one will go there for a while . I think its stupid . Pandemic - do n't make me laugh . A couple of hundred suspected cases and only a hand full of fatalities proven to be caused by swine flu . If the governments and health organizations have finished trying to scare everyone can we please get back to real issues . Cough into a hankie . Everyone take care of their own hygiene and everything will be fine . And the media should stop scaring everyone !!! No one can tell in which way a virus is going to evolve in advance . This strain of H1N1 has turned out to be just like a normal flu - for the moment - but it could just as equally become deadly to humans , simply due to an unlucky mutation . So , instead of criticising the media and the governments for informing the public and taking preventive measures against such a potential threat to human lives , maybe we should be glad that there is enough transparency in the media and that politicians are willing to take action for our health first - not always for the health of the economy . Do you think it is possible for swine flu to be transmitted through the air system on aircraft , as I understand the air is internally circulated - so many people come back from holidays with chesty colds ? Fifteen out of fifty nine thousand have got swine flu . We seem to have one new case every day . Hardly evidence of an imminent flu pandemic . Of all the viruses that have caused mayhem and havoc , Norovirus is the most problematic . It has caused more infections than flu . Just ask the cruise lines ! Actually I 'm quite glad that the fact that flu passes from one person to another is no longer dominating the headlines . Whatever would we all do without the media to report bad science and whip up unnecessary panic ?? I think they should change `` swine flu '' to just `` flu '' , it seems no worse than seasonal flu . Do n't avoid it . It is a weak flu -LRB- all flu 's kill , but this one not many -RRB- and it might give you immunity to a deadlier H1N1 that is yet to come . '' `` The WHO have cried wolf . The next time they issue another pandemic alert , nobody will believe them . '' '' I 'm going to stop buying their records ... ... Could this whole thing be a distraction to get our minds off the economic situation ? Just wondering ... I have noticed recently that a large portion of the BBC ` News ' is given over to speculation : Bird Flu wiping out humanity ; extreme weather due in thirty years as a result of global warming ; running out of oil ; worst recession since 1920s etc. etc. . Should n't you just stick to reporting on what has happened ? What a panic over nothing . A relatively mild flu virus has broken out in several countries - and apparently it is enough to bring the world to a grinding halt . Some perspective is needed . I probably wont get it . If I do , I will have mild cold\\/flu like symptoms . The media storm however is causing panic , has already caused a great deal of damage to Mexico , and could cause a great deal of damage here , at a time when we are fragile economically as it is . The question is , in whose interests is it that we are afraid . Alan Davies interview this morning was scaremongering . The best way to avoid a swine flu pandemic here in the UK - would be to get rid of the current government as fast as possible . Then maybe their spin doctors might not have to work so hard to distract the populous from the social disintegration they have caused by their greed . I remember reading about the 1918 epidemic several years back . I recall the records that indicated alcoholics had a high survival rate . Could it be that alcohol has the effect of combating the virus . If we could refine the connection and perhaps find an antiseptic just as effective and less dangerous to our overall health than alcohol . When we are facing such a crisis it 's any port in a storm . Grampa Borley So much fuss over a natural method of population control . It 's sickening to see all this hulabaloo over a minor flu when thousands are being infected with the HIV virus every day . Wake up to the real problem BBC and stop sensationalising . Talk about hype - it 's the media whipping the world into a frenzy for they have little else to stir up at the moment . It 's like the Kentucky Derby , increase hype and frenzy for two days , and then it is all over in sixty seconds . Get real everyone and stop panicking over nothing . What a surprise BBC panicking the world and causing major problems to Mexico 's tourist industry by printing stories telling people not to go to Mexico . Should they be issuing a rather large apology to the world . Um yes I think so ... How can we avoid a swine flu pandemic ? Stop reading the papers . This flu is a load of rubbish the government is playing with us . What 's baffling me is news that the ` flu is being contained , but every day another person is affected . A look at the world map defies that it 's being contained at all . Not scare-mongering , but am extremely worried . Preventing contact with infected individuals is key to preventing a pandemic outbreak . Anyone who thinks this has been ` over hyped ' must n't realize how significant it is when a never before seen virus mutates to infect humans . This virus did n't exist 3 months ago , it is brand new , and considered a mild strain . What happens if it allowed to transmit to others and mutate further ? People really have no idea but this disease is being handled exactly as it should , by containing infected individuals by quarantine . According to a good friend of mine , who is a doctor in the US , 10,000 people died last year in the US from influenza A. swine flu is an influenza A virus so let 's get it in perspective ! Let 's avoid the media rather than people . How bad is it ? Really ... So far I do n't think so , yes some people have died , very bad that , but on the whole , not that many . Is n't the problem that the flu has jumped species ? Let 's have something to compare figures to as well , like how many people does ordinary flu kill , of how many people died of malaria last week ? I think it 's time for some balance here , not panic and scaremongering . More ridiculous hysteria from the British media . Does n't normal flu kill people who are weakened by other ailments or old age every year ? We had a particularly hot summer a couple of years back and the heat killed several thousand people in France for example . Does this mean we should all be scared of summers ? Get a grip BBC editors and stop making stories up over nothing , and that goes for the rest of the media too . Let 's maintain some hygiene everywhere as we do not know how it is transmitted . People in Mexico must n't travel anyhow at the moment because it will be difficult to handle when it comes to Africa where resources are none . I am not taking any precautions other than making sure I wash my hands more ! I 'm following protocols set by the NHS and not panicking . Manchester , UK is well prepared for any sort of outbreak . It 's the media that is hyping it all out of proportion ! You should be praising the governments for their work , as oppose to decrying them . So we should be praising the governments for saving us from a crisis that even the Mexicans are saying is non-existent ? I know Australia panicked over this one big time , unlike New Zealand which actually had some cases , but what you are saying is ridiculous . Ah , the man of action ! Well Bob , a vaccine wo n't be ready until September at the earliest by which time all those going to die from this virus will have done so . Otherwise , a great plan Bob , why did n't anybody else think of it ? Andrew , Norwich , UK This story is ridiculous , thousands of people die from normal flu every year and yet we never hear about how that could end humanity or raise the alert to level five or whatever . This story has been blown massively out of proportion . Also the phrase `` deaths have occurred in the US '' needs to be changed to `` death '' , there has only been one . I think the media have over-reacted . I winced when BBC Breakfast asked their resident doctor her views ... it completely undermined everything the BBC had been saying . I 'm surprised the producer did not cut her off . In 1976 Americans were inoculated needlessly . Why not just quarantine ? It 's ironic , because BBC recently ran a series called ` Survivors ' , about people that survived a major pandemic . '' I have lost a lot of faith in the BBC . vCJD , SARS , bird flu , swine flu ... I wonder what 's going to kill us all next . '' Well , in case you have n't noticed , vCJD has killed hundreds in this country including someone I know , and there is a massive risk of it still looming over us , SARS killed hundreds in the East and very nearly became catastrophic , bird flu is still a high risk , and swine flu , even if we do not all get it now , could mutate and we could all get it much worse in winter . This is what the science and facts say . I 'm not saying we should panic , just that taking all reasonable precautions and impartially informing people of the risk seems pretty sensible to me . Keep the population in a state of panic and they will do anything . The media are doing an excellent job . We can forget about all the real problems and worry about catching a cold . While precaution is always better than cure , this swine flu is causing an alarm pandemic among world populations . Mexico has reported only a hundred deaths so far by this epidemic flu , out of thousands of deaths in that country every month by road accidents and drug related murders . In an average day many thousands are killed by ordinary cold flu in the world . Many thousands are killed in many parts of the world every day by man-made armed conflict , so the swine flu is not that big a challenge to human society today . What is there to prevent ? It is out there already . Only the public statistics have not caught up yet . I am pretty sure I 've had it and I know where I got it from , but nobody else knows . Are n't we all lucky that this is only a mild strain ? The only Pandemic we have at present in the UK is a Media Pandemic . However this is not to say the populous has forgot how to conduct themselves in public . I recently worked in London and took the Tube to work for 4 stops . The hygiene and etiquette of the people was appalling . People sneezing , coughing and clearing phlegm from their throats on the train . No tissues , nothing . No wonder disease spreads so rapidly today in England no manners or etiquette left . I commented to one female whom sneezed with no protection and all I received was a grunt . Ignorant and illiterate despite an education . Remember the hysteria built-up around that ? Here we go again . Completely over the top reporting and headline grabbing as usual . Anyone who 's had it here appears to be showing ` remarkable ' signs of recovery considering the `` deadly '' nature of this flu . We saw a crying mother and child outside a school on the news , worried about the terror about to spread the nation . The Red-Top rags whipped-up their vision of doom . Seen any canceled big crowd events ? No , of course not . Still expect any mother who has a child come home to them with so much as a sniffle and it 'll be straight to the Max Clifford 's ... sorry that should read ` Doctor ' . The world & media are reacting the way they should ! Measured concern is desirable . Precaution by WHO , governments and individuals is a must . We know that it 's a blow on the countries ' economy and on their citizens but the spread must be contained before it 's too late . Let 's bear it patiently and intelligently . The next time you catch a train consider that statistically about 1 in 60 people on that train will die this year . That might be 5 people on your train and it could even be you . So stop using the trains because some people will die ? This pig flu scare is ridiculous when the chance of getting it is almost nil and the chances of dying from it are even lower . `` Stop talking about it and give every one a vaccine '' Bob , Cambridge As yet there is no vaccine for Swine Flu . It takes about six months to produce one from the Blood-serum of an infected person Meanwhile , until the Vaccine is available , those testing positive for the A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- Virus can be given the anti-viral Tamiflu which is a treatment not an A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- - specific Vaccine . When are we going to get responsible media that report facts and not hysteria ? If this swine flu is not new , I believe it has been in nature from the beginning of our world , then we have to admit we are losing our body immunising capability to adapt to nature . Medicine , drugs and our living habits have changed our body from nature . The more we live far from nature , the more we will sicken . How to avoid a swine flu pandemic ? Stop the sensationalist reporting by irresponsible news media . Jeff Piper , Stanley , United Kingdom Everyone who is saying `` it was all a media generated panic '' needs to take a course in public health . The reason we have preventative measures -LRB- such as those that were taken -RRB- was so that we could prevent thousands of people from dying . What is the point in starting preventative measures when thousands already have the disease ? Would you prefer it were like Hurricane Katrina ? `` Oh it 's just a big storm , there is no need to take any preventative measures before it gets here '' . The whole point of preventative measures is so that we can prevent a catastrophe from happening . You should be praising the governments for their work , as oppose to decrying them . Good work people , good work . If this virus is truly not so virulent at the moment , would it not be better just to catch it and get some immunity in case it emerges , deadlier , in the winter ? Whatever - the media itself may be being fed disinformation . But how ironic if by paying more attention to hygiene , the result was a cut in all infections . Booo hoo , a man in Ireland sneezed 15 mins ago , Breaking news ! Please , this is a non story , stop trying making it into something it is n't and wo n't be and start reporting on something important . Even with the slightest chance of getting this complaint , we really are very relaxed in our attitudes to disease . Stop talking about it and give every one a vaccine . How many cases of this flu have we in the UK ? We get 15 people an hour go down with the flu in my company in winter . The people who had ` died ' from this flu , have actually died from secondary complications ; in part due to the appalling health conditions in Mexico . The over blown reporting of this is ridiculous . Some chap gets the sniffles and he is filmed on his mobile commenting about his flu like symptoms . Wow , sensational stuff . You know , he might be suffering from a bit of hay fever . The WHO have cried wolf . The next time they issue another pandemic alert , nobody will believe them . I reckon it 's a conspiracy to take our minds of the recession . One should be careful about cleanliness of their surroundings and should eat hygienic food , particularly meats . Also the government should take certain actions regarding this . To what extent is this allegedly possible pandemic connected to the stocks of flu vaccine and the expiry date of that vaccine ? I wonder how many children have died from malaria\\/diarrhea , in the world since the outbreak and hysteria about swine flu . What I do n't get is that at the moment we 're at level five , the same level for Spanish flu -LRB- 1918-1920 -RRB- . So far swine flu has killed say a couple of hundred if you count all the suspected deaths Spanish flu killed millions of people . There is no evidence of the swine flu virus spreading in a sustained way outside North America , a top World Health Organization official says . Looks like no pandemic to avoid . Another media generated storm in a tea cup -LRB- or is it sneeze in a hanky ! -RRB- Swine flu has come along at just the right time for us all to forget about MPs ' expenses and the failing economy ... How convenient ! Very concerned , it seems to me the less animals we eat or mess around with is better for us all I do n't have any concerns simply because it has been an over reaction to something that is at the end of the day a very bad cold . The real swines wear 3 piece suits and work for the banks . We 'll be lucky to get rid of them before they get rid of us . Swine flu has turned out to be no worse than `` normal flu '' . So , will the media , including the BBC , now apologise for the mass panic they caused . I have lost a lot of faith in the BBC . vCJD , SARS , Bird Flu , Swine Flu ... I wonder what 's going to kill us all next . With every passing day it becomes clearer that the media and many people here on HYS were in panic mode . Mexico way over-reacted ; many of the deaths attributed to swine flu were from nothing of the sort ; and this is a very mild virus overall . Peter Nelson , boston MA USA I think WTO 's officials and health department of every country must take serious action to control such a dangerous swine flu . If we do not take serious action now it ca n't be controlled . Many of the countries do not have enough facilities to control this flu . If we go to the rural areas people are not aware about this world flu . I request all the countries to take the action now and show the world 's power ... The pandemic that 's really worrying is the hysteria pandemic of governments . Although it is a bit too early to say , this appears to have been handled very well by our government and others . The spread of a virus has been tracked and scientists will have gained insight as to how such viruses spread . Although the virus does not appear to be as severe as first thought , this may be a trial run for when a more serious virus does evolve . Perhaps we are on the way to eliminating flu . How can a responsible media like BBC report on overreaction as if it were negative . A vigorous response is the only response to imminent threats . In retrospect we all know the answer to how serious the threat really was , but we always need to assume the worst initially . The Mexican Government did the right thing and deserve praise for not delaying . America is indispensible in solving this problem , regardless of what the haters write and say . My concern is that everytime the WHO and the media hype a story about an epidemtic or pandemic which turns out not to be the case , that they 're creating a `` cry wolf '' senario . When there REALLY is a serious problem , no one will believe it . Avian flu , SARS , swine flu ... stop with the overdramatization of illnesses . Life today is one crisis or disaster after another . People in all nations panic at every turn . I guess Chicken Little was right . `` The sky is falling , the sky is falling '' . We are becoming a sad and sorry lot . Your new headlines is . . `` Did Mexico Over-React ? '' ermm answer `` NOPE '' . Like everything else these days the MEDIA over reacted ... we are heading for a `` cry wolf '' situation ... end of . In Canada we do not take any type of precautions , other than washing our hands after we go to the toilet or whenever we touch another person Wayne Webster , WPG , MB CANADA Typical BBC scaremongering , put about by those who have no scientific background ; only hype and stupidity . My advice is , if you feel the symptoms of ` flu coming on , which in itself is a rare thing , I get the hottest curry available : either a Vindaloo or Bangalore Phal or even a hot Texas Chilli , if I ca n't get a curry , and wash it down with a load of ice cold beers and whisky chasers . Feel great , then if you are a BBC wimp ? I have suspected all along this panic over flu was premature or might even be false alarm . The only case in Hong Kong is a Mexican man who just happened to get sick here . So far , not one other person has come down with the swine flu . I live in Mexico City and can say that the media has exaggerated this plus it has been quite inaccurate including the BBC -LRB- sorry -RRB- . Yes , the streets are empty in the center - of course , everything is closed ! I 'm sick of that BBC reporter what 's - his-name that was here telling us that there is less traffic thus less pollution and so the skies are blue again for the first time . The sky is always magnificently blue in Mexico City and I have 100 's of photos to prove it . He must only have been here before in the winter when it 's overcast . Just these little untruths become really annoying for the people that live here . Yes , people are worried but not terrified and there 's certainly no panic . It 's 9:30 PM here , I just went to the chemist and everything is normal apart from some people wearing masks , including myself . We need to follow the news much less these days for some peace of mind . I know my mother back home almost had a stroke from the worry . This whole thing has been a media fed frenzy of paranoia and panic . The situation has grown completely out of hand on the back of very little supporting evidence and now -LRB- it turns out -RRB- those ` in charge ' have admitted they may have over-reacted . The problem is that the media love throwing the term Pandemic around in an End Of Days fashion and people hear the word without truly knowing what it means and assume the very worst . I can only hope that perhaps the media -LRB- and the BBC as as guilty as everyone else of this -RRB- learn something from this whole situation . It 's even dafter than the Bird Flu & SARS scares of a couple of years ago . Cancer , AIDS , Malaria -LRB- and many others -RRB- are the ones we need to worry about and focus on . Where 's your media frenzy for them ? I have suspected all along this panic over flu was premature or might even be false alarm . The only case in Hong Kong is a Mexican man who just happened to get sick here . So far , not one other person has come down with the swine flu . I 've said right from the beginning that there was no evidence to support the official panic over this . Politicians used to have more courage and , dare I say it , much better judgement . Some people have died of a new flu variant , and always will - that 's the nature of viruses . There is nothing new here to merit action outside countries adjacent to Mexico . The official count of 160 cases of swine flu in the US is a gross underestimation in my opinion . In Culver City my uncle started to show flu symptoms . After contacting multiple doctors , pharmacies , emergency rooms , and even the CDC , he was given absolutely no help . He was told that the anti viral drugs are not available , and that he needed to stay at home . How many more people are showing flu symptoms , and not being tested ? Why are we being lied to about the amount of help available ? Chris , Huntington Beach , California , USA According to World Health Organisation the spread of the disease is not as bad as first thought , so pandemic headlines are all wrong . Still usual scare mongering from BBC and government Tom Smith , Newcastle upon Tyne I think the WHO and governments have been stupid about how bad they thought this outbreak was going to be . We had the same with SARS and bird flu and both came to nothing , so why should everyone panic and why should the media make everyone panic . Only if the outbreak got really bad should the media let us know how bad it is and what are the consequences of it . But as it looks like that is not going to happen they should let people forget about it and get back to normal lives . England , Scotland and Wales can not avoid a possible pandemic . Reason , well we live in vastly populated regions , take England as the example , here people only live on about 30 per cent of the country , the rest is uninhabited . The WHO comments of about 40 per cent of people being infected in a pandemic , is short of the mark in my opinion . The situation could turn nasty if it not properly contained . Back in 1918 the Influenza pandemic began around the same time as we see the swine flu pandemic starting now -LRB- March to April -RRB- . It did n't pose as a serious threat as cases were as minimal as we see today . It was only until around October in the same year that cases and fatalities rose sharply -LRB- due to the recirculation of contaminated air more common in the winter period when people are indoors for longer -RRB- . And over the winter period the world saw one of the worst pandemics in recorded history . The only problem is , that I think that we are falling into the same trap of this false sense of security that it dose n't look to bad at the moment . Hopefully the governments of the world will realize this sooner rather than later . I think that all of this media hype is quite necessary , and we should not just shunt the threat to the back of our minds and continue worrying about the current economic climate . Philip Leonard , Southport Great Britain Seems to me that every 10 years or so a really new strain of the flu virus comes to the front and all panic . We have survived Asian and Bird flu amongst others so what is the panic about ? The only people at risk are those with poor immune systems and those in warm countries where normal winter flu provides immunity . All flu kills so what is new , or are the government about to remove more of our civil liberties and need a diversion . Suddenly the world economic crisis does n't matter , the US torture memos disappeared , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are distant memories ... suddenly all we hear about is the swine flu . I 'm not concerned about swine flu . I even wonder if it really exists . The WHO know what is going on better than all of us and they have a much better understanding of Swine Flu than we do . Experts say that the virus is extremely contagious , the only reason why this is hard to believe is because those people with it in the UK are being treated and are being kept away from other people . If the medical care was not there I am sure that we would have suffered the same effect that Mexico has . Therefore , should n't we just trust the professionals ? Without this awareness , people would not be taking precautions and would still be flying to many places , including Mexico then many more people would have it ! We should be grateful for all the information that we have been given . It is obviously extremely serious , the WHO are not going to exaggerate how serious this actually is . And as for `` living our lives in constant fear '' -LRB- Daniel , Folkestone -RRB- , I would much rather be scared , take precautions and not get swine flu than live complaining about the media etc and get it . Please please stop broadcasting so much hype about a flu that is affecting so few people , more people die of ordinary flu . I am sick of hearing about it Typical of BBC to kill a story by continually talking about it . It 's flu , now change the record , people die each year from flu here and abroad . I am already very aware of how unhygienic many many people are . I have to be aware as my partner had a kidney transplant and her immune system is very low due to anti rejection medication . If we go out for a meal , she is normally ill for a couple of days , going out for a drink is a rare occasion and quite risky . I do the shopping , so she can avoid contact and contamination in public places where there are a lot of people . Going on public transport is not even entertained . Most public toilets in bars , restaurants , shops and even hospitals are badly designed and are where most people get contaminated with other peoples faeces and urine , as well as other bacterial\\/germ infested fluids . Doors of all public toilets should open outwards or have Z corridors without doors . It is madness to wash your hands & then get contaminated by others who do not wash their hands , when you open the door to get out . I should think that public toilets are a main area of cross infection for many illnesses & sicknesses\\/upset stomachs etc. . The way I 'm thinking about this `` Pandemic '' is by NOT thinking about it . There is nothing that WE , the public , can actually do about it apart from taking hygienic precautions . There is no need to worry because if we get it , we get it . We ca n't just get rid of it and it 's just another annual scare we have . Bird flu , Spanish flu , they 're all the same . The media , mainly newspapers are blowing the whole `` swine flu '' out of proportion just to preoccupy ourselves from other crisis ' around the world , eg : war and economy . How can we avoid a pandemic ? Well , we obviously need governments with enough spine and guts to shut down travel and borders to prevent disease from spreading . We are lucky it is n't a more deadly virus because we allowed it on every plane , boat , car and rail out of Mexico and it has now traveled the globe because of our inability to say , `` People before profit '' . All we hear is how it would damage the economy . I do n't want the people in charge of these matters to consider my health at the same table they consider economics , because the people will lose to profit every time . It 's a wake up call . I 'm not worried and I think it is all being over-hyped by the media and government to take our minds off other things . Anyone would think this is the Ebola virus . The way I look at it is you die eventually anyway , so if it 's my time , then it 's my time . No sense in worrying over it . We ca n't avoid it but we can control how we manage it . People are more able to cope with flu during the summer and less resistant during the winter . We could therefore elect to have the flu this summer and minimize the effects . Once caught , the body is immune . Goodbye worrying about it too . We could have a national flu week or if that stretched our health resources too much we could elect to have flu weeks by age group . You ca n't prevent a pandemic in this age of cheap flights , once the disease has started it can be transported all round the world before the governments even know there is a problem . Jim Maguire , Newcastle Upon Tyne , UK Above everything do not take any notice of the media . A revised death toll in Mexico gives a total of 101 deaths . While the whole planet panics over this flu , how many thousands have died in road accidents ? People catch flu all the time and sadly , some of them die . Sending a leaflet on how to wash your hands , to every household in this country , just means another rainforest gone ! Knowing that we had the first confirmed case of Swine flu in the UK on Monday , the Government should have said that all 10,000 Brits on holiday in Mexico , who are now flying back early from their holidays , should be made to wear masks through the airport as a precaution , and so as not to spread the virus to all and sundry . Instead the media are stopping them for a chat to get their views ! 90,000 people have died of malaria since the outbreak of the swine flu . There is no over-the-counter medication to treat malaria . So , no , I am not at all worried about the swine flu . Tricia Casper , Pasadena , CA , USA I think that the only way we can avoid it is by : Wearing masks and Obeying all the doctors and Health Departments are saying . By panicking we are going nowhere . People please calm down !! We live in what is now the biotechnological age , having advanced beyond the dangers of the nuclear age , into new perils . That means that every new , infectious , illness causing , organism , must be responded to as if it is a deadly threat to human survival as soon as it is detected . We can never be certain whether nature or human actions were the root cause of a new infectious organism , and even though that might be determined later , that question is never a valid basis for deciding what to do in response to infection . It 's so over rated . Millions die of normal flu every year and we have like 500 cases and everyone is worried . I am shocked at some of the comments on here . How can people possibly say that this is just the media causing a panic amongst the ` naive ' , when it is documented fact that flu can kill millions , and likely will again . Is it not wise to keep the public informed ? I 'm not panicking but I am certainly concerned -LRB- I agree that this government especially would have trouble containing it 's spread -RRB- . If this flu fades away into obscurity like bird flu appears to have , for the time being , we should consider ourselves lucky . However , I suspect it 'll just be a great opportunity for the smug to say ' I told you so ' to the media and WHO . Oh , and I am a doctor of microbiology , so ` naivety ' does not come into it , I 'm afraid . Surely the sensible thing to do is to not try to contain the current strain of H1N1 as the symptoms are mild and usually not fatal . By allowing the virus to spread around the world , people who contract the virus would have immunity against a much more potent strain which is likely to be going around in the autumn , before a vaccine has been created and effectively distributed ? By trying to contain the current strain , governments are storing up a nightmare scenario for later in the year . In all seriousness the `` big one '' will happen when something like Ebola Zaire jumps on a plane and comes visiting . Even the non weaponised version has a kill rate of approx 80-90 % with no cure and no treatment . We had a scare with this a few years in the UK when a plane landed and they thought someone had the disease -LRB- luckily it was a false alarm -RRB- . They isolated him but let the other passengers back out into the main population ! Do you mean a swine flu pandemic or a media swine flu pandemic ? The former is n't a problem anyway , the way to solve the latter is to stop reporting on it . I called the NHS direct as my son had been in contact with his boss who had come back from Mexico Sunday last . They were very quick to re-act . They were pretty sure that he did not have the swine flu . They said that he would have to be seen by a doctor . This was at 10.15 am . I was called by seldoc four times asking the same questions , and at 3.10 pm they called and said he did not need any further attention and they would not send a doctor out . If we are going to contain this we need more commitment from GPS . We are still not sure if he has the virus or not . This episode has been very interesting in that the media seems to have been completely taken in by the hysteria while the public have not believed a word and have maintained a much more calm and balanced view of the situation . Nobody trusts the media any more , and judging from they way it has reported this flu virus , we 're right not to . I do n't hear much about what the preventive therapeutic measures are for people who are not yet affected . Should they take vitamin c or an inhalation of some type ? What type of food to be avoided etc ? I think areas affected should be sprayed by a helicopter with some kind of germicide . Even homes should be smoked with some kind of germicide . Ashok , St Petersburg , FL , USA And so it begins . The media starts it 's inevitable climb down by stating that ` officials ' are ` cautiously optimistic ' that things may not be as bad as first thought . When I was a kid my mother worried about illness : smallpox , diphtheria , scarlet fever , polio - all killers . I caught Asian flu in the '57 pandemic and spent a week in bed . Not pleasant but not life threatening if you took care . Anti-virals did not exist . The advice was to keep warm and not go out until the symptoms had gone . No schools or businesses shut down and there were no quarantines . The present outbreak seems much less severe so far . This is flu , which many catch every year . It is not plague , or ebola or typhus . We should not lose our sense of proportion . David Rushworth , Hemel Hempstead , UK From what I understand , an infected person is\\/maybe contagious from day one before they display any symptoms . If this is so , why not take blood samples or whatever from all passengers before they board the airplane . By the time they reach their destination -LRB- hopefully , we can know if there are any cases on board before they reach their destination -RRB- necessary action may then be taken . It may be a bit of a hassle but its better than sitting on our hands . Also I dunno why closing borders does n't make sense - if the reason is economics , then I say it 's either `` a stitch in time saves nine '' ... or `` Penny wise pound foolish '' . How many farmers and their families were ruined last time the country over-reacted to a media ` pandemic ' ? I remember watching a documentary on TV not so long ago , it was about some scientists who decided to exhume the corps of a man who died of the Spanish flu virus pandemic in 1918 . I hear now that the SWINE flu virus -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- is the same virus !!! They have the original Spanish flue virus in their hands , in some super safe , high tech lab , -LRB- we all hope so anyway -RRB- , I am asking a simple question ; Did this virus escape when they opened the lead lined coffin ? Avoid the swine flu by following health safety standards for other diseases . Avoid crowds , air travel , infectious persons and wash hands frequently . For now practice quarantine and then stop herding huge numbers of pigs into a small confined space full of their own excrement . And do n't allow fowl and humans to live in close proximity to them . Better yet stop eating pork so there is no reason to keep these garbage eaters confined in the first place . As long as we do n't know how it is being transmitted to one another we should take precautions like staying away from infected people . It 's not easy to not to talk and approach people as this is a big part of life , for example shopping , schooling .

The 23-year-old man from Islington , north London , and 29-year-old man from Westminster , central London , have mild symptoms , the DH said . They are being treated at their homes and are among eight people in the UK known to have caught the H1N1 virus . Doctors said a 22-year-old man from Barnet , north London , was responding well to treatment for the virus . The Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- said it was investigating 230 possible cases , all of which were associated with travel to Mexico . It added that people exposed to a `` probable or confirmed '' case of swine flu in the past seven days , for more than one hour and within a distance of 1m -LRB- 3.2 ft -RRB- have been offered anti-viral drugs `` as a precautionary measure '' . A DH spokesman said : `` The preparations we have in place and are continuing to make will help to ensure we respond well in the event of a pandemic . '' Transport warning over swine flu Swine flu is a respiratory disease , caused by influenza type A , which infects pigs . Until now it has not normally infected humans , but the latest form of the virus can . The man from Barnet caught the virus during a recent visit to Mexico and was admitted to the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead on Wednesday . A spokesman for the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust said he was `` brought to the trust in a secure , specialist ambulance '' . `` Staff are scrupulously following infection control procedures to ensure no other patient or member of staff is at risk , '' he added . London authorities said they were working closely with other agencies to monitor and deal with any issues from the outbreak . London Councils ' Chairman Councillor Merrick Cockell said : `` London 's local authorities have been preparing for the possible outbreak of a flu pandemic for the last five years so are primed to respond to any issues arising as a result of swine flu in the capital . '' "}, {"uid": "386", "dct": "2009-04-30", "dates": ["2009-04-30"], "text": "Guards at the border crossing in El Paso are still being kept busy El Paso is a border town in more than just name . It is where the Mexican and American cultures merge into a colorful mixture of language , culture and food . Tex-Mex is the predominant dining experience here . It is also one of North America 's largest and most important border crossings . Each day , about 100,000 people crowd onto four small bridges , making their way from Ciudad Juarez into El Paso . Essentially , this is one city that happens to have two names . The situation here is starkly different from that of Mexico City . Instead of empty streets and orders not to gather in large numbers , people here are huddled together on the bridges in huge numbers on a daily basis . The fact is that most have to make the crossing . They study at the university , work or have family here . The need to keep making a living seems to be outweighing fears about the H1N1 virus . There 's no way to monitor folks if they decide to cross from Mexico to the United States There is also some anger among residents . Many people feel that they are not being given enough information and few are bothering with paper masks . On the border , though , agents say they are carrying out a procedure known as `` passive surveillance '' . It means that if anyone is seen with symptoms of the virus he or she can be pulled to one side and possibly quarantined . Although there has been a great deal of talk about closing the borders , such a move seems highly unlikely . President Barack Obama has acknowledged that isolating America and closing an economically important border is not feasible . `` I 've consulted with our public health officials extensively on a day-to-day basis , in some cases an hour-to-hour basis . At this point , they have not recommended a border closing , '' he said . `` From their perspective , it would be akin to closing the barn door after the horses are out , because we already have cases here in the United States . '' On Thursday , an entire school district in Texas was closed down as a precaution and 80,000 children were sent home . The first death in the US also happened in this state . A hundred miles east of El Paso , in the tiny town of Fort Hancock , there are no high security fences and security cameras . Like much of the border between the US and Mexico , there are plenty of places to cross , albeit illegally . `` We 're not out here 24\\/7 , '' says Deputy Sheriff Robert Wilson , who patrols the border as part of his duties . `` There 's no way to monitor folks if they decide to cross from Mexico to the United States and if someone was infected with the disease then they would enter into the United States undetected . '' The situation here is evolving rapidly , but there is also a measured calm . People on both sides of the border are concerned , and perhaps a little frustrated , that more information is not being given out . But there is also a need , primarily driven by basic economics , for Mexicans and Americans to keep on crossing this and other borders . Mexico City , to many , feels like a distant place . But as schools close and the number of confirmed cases inevitably rises , it is getting closer .

She said Europe was well prepared and there was `` no need to panic '' . She was speaking after an emergency meeting of health ministers on ways to contain the virus , which has been confirmed in six EU countries . The ministers rejected a French proposal for a continent-wide suspension on flights to Mexico . After the talks in Luxembourg Ms Vassiliou said : `` We are worried , but we are on top of things . '' US : one death , at least 109 confirmed cases New Zealand : 3 confirmed , 13 probable cases The Netherland , Switzerland , Austria : 1 confirmed case each Peru case now ` unconfirmed ' by national government She added : `` The fact that we have been preparing ourselves in the EU for an event such as this for some years now , and the experience gained so far , puts us in a much stronger position . '' None of the dozens of cases of swine flu reported on the continent so far has been severe . The health ministers agreed to work `` without delay '' with pharmaceutical companies to develop a vaccine . Rejecting the French plan on suspending flights to Mexico - the main focus of the outbreak - they said it was up to member states to set their own policies . Several countries have restricted travel to Mexico and many tour operators have canceled holidays . Earlier the UN 's World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- - which increased its pandemic alert to five on Wednesday - said it had no immediate plans for a further rise . `` We do not have any evidence to suggest that we should move to phase six today , or any such move is imminent right now , '' said WHO Assistant Director General Keiji Fukuda . The White House said a security aide who had helped arrange President Barack Obama 's recent trip to Mexico has become sick with flu-like symptoms The Netherlands confirms its first case of swine flu , in a three-year-old boy recently returned from Mexico . Cases have also been confirmed in Switzerland and Costa Rica The number of confirmed cases in the US rose to 109 in 11 states Japan reported its first suspected case of swine flu Health Minister Oscar Ugarte said tests on Peru 's sole suspected case had proved negative , reversing an earlier statement SYMPTOMS - WHAT TO DO Swine flu symptoms are similar to those produced by ordinary seasonal flu - fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue If you have flu symptoms and recently visited affected areas of Mexico , you should seek medical advice If you suspect you are infected , you should stay at home and take advice by telephone initially , in order to minimize the risk of infection In Mexico , the number of confirmed cases rose to 260 - up from 26 on Wednesday , something experts attributed to many laboratory results coming in . The Mexican government increased the number of confirmed deaths from swine flu from 8 to 12 . President Felipe Calderon has urged people to stay at home over the next five days . The US has announced that it will buy 13 million new courses of antiviral treatment and send 400,000 of them to Mexico . Meanwhile the WHO says it will now call the virus influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- rather than swine flu - which it says is misleading as pork meat is safe and the virus is being transmitted from human to human . Egypt has begun a mass slaughter of its pigs , and Ghana is the latest country to ban pork imports as a precaution against swine flu . Have you been affected by swine flu ?

John McConnell is Editor of The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal One person has died in the US and cases have now been confirmed in 12 countries over three continents . Mexican officials say the spread of the virus is slowing , but international experts are more cautious . The World Health Organization has raised its pandemic alert to five , the second-highest level , but says it has no immediate plans for another rise . Here John McConnell , editor of the Lancet Infectious Diseases medical journal , answers a selection of your questions about the epidemic . How can you differentiate swine flu from the common and seasonal flu ? Mvula Zakeyo , Lusaka , Zambia How do the symptoms of swine , or `` novel '' flu differ from those of a regular flu , if at all ? It would most likely ease widespread panic if people knew what to look for aside of sneezing and nausea . Adam Cullen , Tallinn , Estonia Mr McConnell : Unless you have access to a virology laboratory , you probably ca n't distinguish the two . Symptoms of swine and seasonal flu include fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , headache , chills , and fatigue . Patients do seem to be reporting diarrhoea and vomiting more often with swine flu than is the case for `` normal '' flu , but in practice the two forms are probably indistinguishable . I was surprised to be told that wearing masks can actually increase the risk of getting the infection rather than not wearing one at all . The area around your mouth and nose becomes very warm and moist , which is a perfect breeding ground for the virus and that wearing a mask does not reduce the risk at all because it can filter through the holes . Samantha , Redditch Mr McConnell : The virus breeds in tissues of the respiratory tract , not on the skin however warm and damp it may get . Surgical masks , as seem to be handed out in Mexico , are designed to prevent transmission of disease rather than prevent its acquisition . Masks will certainly become less effective as they become damp and more porous , so masks would have to be changed several times per day to be of any value . The UK government has not stockpiled masks as part of its pandemic preparedness plan , although there have been reports of the government now ordering supplies of masks . The Spanish Pandemic killed mainly due to cytokine storms which I understand to be the immune system overreacting . Is the swine flu similar ? If so , would drugs to lower the immune system in young adults with the virus help lower mortality rate ? Trebor Evans , Llandudno , North Wales Mr McConnell : There is no evidence as yet that the Mexican swine flu virus causes the so-called cytokine storm . I would be very wary about doing anything to dampen the immune response of someone ill with flu . There is so much publicity on the swine flu . How do we know that the flu has become pandemic at a more local level ? What precautions should the general public who do not travel to any infected region take to minimize the risk of infection ? Does a rise the temperature contribute to the spread of the virus ? Rozie A R , Sg Buloh , Selangor , Malaysia Mr McConnell : We will know the virus is causing local epidemics when there is a continuous chain of transmission from one person to the next within a country . There is no guaranteed way to avoid infection while carrying on the activities of daily life . Employers should instruct staff who do not feel well to not come to work . People who feel ill should stay at home and call their healthcare provider for advice rather than trying to visit the clinic . The flu virus seems to prefer cooler winter temperatures , for reasons we do n't understand , hence the annual winter flu seasons . I am on immune suppressant medication for rheumatoid arthritis . What implications does this have if I come into contact with swine flu ? Susan Seal , Birmingham Mr McConnell : You may be more liable to become infected by the virus if you come into contact with it , and the infection may cause more severe illness . You should consult your GP for advice on this question . Is the virus strain in Mexico stronger than that in the US and elsewhere ? Does it have to do with the treatment , immunity , or something else ? Eneida Rista , Tirana , Albania Mr McConnell : I wish we knew . The virus does not seem to differ inside and outside Mexico . Access to healthcare may be poorer in Mexico , hence the apparently high mortality rate , but we do n't have enough data on illness and death among confirmed cases to even say whether the apparent high mortality rate is `` real '' . I understand that Mexico City has a population of almost 9 million . Assuming a large proportion of the population has been exposed to the virus is n't 150 deaths rather a small figure , probably surpassed by what we would normally expect as a seasonal outbreak ? John Williams , Bromley Mr McConnell : Similar to the answer to Eneida Rista 's question above , we do n't yet have sufficient data to determine whether the mortality rate is exceptional . What is clear is that the Mexican swine flu virus is a variant of the H1N1 virus new to human beings , is not the same as the seasonal flu viruses that have been circulating this year , and is causing illness and death among human beings . Why are drugs companies permitted to recommend that workers with seasonal flu take a flu remedy and continue at work when infectious and yet we have a panic over swine flu with isolation ? Could the Health Protection Agency work with drugs companies and employers to remind individuals that seasonal flu is contagious , serious and that if you do have flu you must stay at home to minimize risk of transmission ? Maybe I 'm a cynic but is this not all hyped up to take our collective eyes off the deepening economic situation ? Jean Howard , Street , Somerset Mr McConnell : I think the point you are getting at is that drugs against flu are marketed on the basis that they reduce the duration of illness and thus allow earlier return to work . The reason that the NHS does not prescribe Tamiflu and Relenza routinely is that the drugs are expensive and flu is for most otherwise healthy people a self-limiting illness from which they will recover within a week or so . I agree that people who are ill with flu should stay at home and not risk spreading it to work mates or traveling companions . Indeed , if you have flu you will know about it and not want to get out of bed for a couple of days . Anyone who tells you they 've had `` a touch of flu '' has had a cold - flu is far more debilitating than a cold . A flu pandemic will likely deepen the economic recession , so it 's not the diversionary tactic I would have chosen were I in government ! I do n't understand why this is so important . Only nine people out of hundreds of millions have died from this . Do n't more die everyday from regular flu ? Are n't there other more serious illnesses that are killing people ? Hope Lomas , Chagrin Falls Ohio USA Mr McConnell : Around the world , every day thousands of people are dying of AIDS , tuberculosis , and malaria . AIDS is treatable , tuberculosis and malaria are curable . Diarrhoeal and respiratory diseases , which are almost certainly infectious in origin , kill millions of children under the age of five every year . Even in the fat , wealthy developed world , infectious diseases such as pneumonia -LRB- particularly among the elderly -RRB- and sepsis -LRB- particularly among those with underlying medical conditions -RRB- kill hundreds of thousands of people every year . Indeed , overall , infectious diseases cause 15-20 million deaths every year - the cause of about one third of all deaths . Swine flu is notable because it 's an exceptional event , something above the everyday toll of deaths caused by infectious diseases . A pandemic similar to that of 1918-19 , which killed at least 50 million people , would be a catastrophic event because it would double annual worldwide mortality . However , I think the chances of a repeat of 1918-19 are very small . What swine flu , and the media reaction to it , does highlight is our willingness to accept the `` routine '' toll of infectious diseases with little apparent concern . However , `` Mother dies of TB in Zambia and infects her three children '' is not a headline that sells many papers . Mr McConnell : A short and sweet answer : Yes .

It is believed that a further mutation would be needed in order for the H1N1 virus to cause the mass deaths that have been estimated by some . But at this point , it is impossible to predict with any accuracy how the virus will continue to evolve . UK experts at the National Institute for Medical Research outlined on Friday the work they are due to start on samples of the virus sent from the US . The research , being done at the World Influenza Centre in Mill Hill , will be vital for working out the structure of the virus , where it came from , how quickly it is capable of spreading and its potential to cause illness . Analysis done so far suggests what they are dealing with is a mild virus and nowhere near as dangerous as the H5N1 avian flu strain that has caused scientists so much concern over the past decade . Influenza A viruses are classified according to two proteins on the outer surface of the virus - hemagglutinin -LRB- H -RRB- and neuraminidase -LRB- N -RRB- . Less severe symptoms , but can be deadly Spreads easily between birds but human transmission rare The swine flu strain is a H1N1 virus , the same type as seasonal flu which circulates throughout the world every year , and kills roughly 0.1 % of those infected or higher in an epidemic year . Professor Wendy Barclay , chair in influenza virology at Imperial College London says initial indications suggest there is nothing about the genetic make-up of the new virus which is a cause for particular concern . The key to its potential lies largely in the H1 protein . `` There are two aspects - one is which receptors the virus tends to bind to and what we see is that it is binding to the upper respiratory tract rather than deep in the lungs . '' Attaches to receptors in the upper respiratory tract causing mild illness A pandemic is thought to be imminent When a flu virus binds to the upper respiratory tract , it tends to cause mild illness but can be easily spread as people cough and sneeze , Professor Barclay explains . If a virus binds further down in the lungs , it tends to cause much more severe illness , as in the case of the H5N1 avian flu virus which has caused concern in recent years . `` With the H1 gene we also look at the cleavage site , '' she adds . `` The virus has to be cut into two pieces to be active and it uses an enzyme in the host to do that . `` Most influenza viruses are restricted to the respiratory tract because they use enzymes in the lungs . `` But some , like H5 viruses can evolve to cut into two pieces outside the lungs , so they can replicate outside the respiratory tract . '' These initial indications are largely guesswork from looking at the genetic sequence of the virus and comparing that to what is known from work on other influenza viruses . It will take weeks and months of biological analysis to properly get a handle on the potential of the H1N1 virus . The team at Mill Hill , one of four World Health Organisation 's centres for influenza research will be working in close collaboration with the Health Protection Agency who are carrying out testing in the UK , and their findings will also feed into the development of a potential vaccine . What this outbreak does highlight is how difficult it is to predict new pandemic strains Professor Jonathan Ball , Nottingham University Soon , the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge will begin the genetic sequencing of the virus and will also be monitoring any mutations or changes in how virulent it is . However , there is one other reassuring aspect about what is known so far . That is there seems to be nothing unusual as yet in another protein in the center of the virus , called NS1 , which is linked to the strength of the immune response the virus produces . In some more pathogenic viruses , it is this NS1 protein which initiates a `` cytokine storm '' , a particularly severe immune reaction that can be fatal in even healthy young people . Scientists have also played down concerns that the milder H1N1 virus , could combine with the more dangerous H5N1 avian flu virus , causing a super virus that has the ability to both spread easily between humans and cause severe illness . This is unlikely - or at least just as unlikely as it ever was and the H5N1 virus has been around for a decade without combining with normal seasonal flu . Professor Jonathan Ball , an expert in molecular virology at the University of Nottingham said : `` The chance of swine H1N1 combining with H5N1 is as likely as any other strain recombining . `` What this outbreak does highlight is how difficult it is to predict new pandemic strains . `` Many people suspected that H5N1 was the most likely candidate for the next pandemic strain , but now it appears that this was a mistake - but that 's not to say H5N1 or another reassortment containing parts of H5N1 may not happen in the future . `` That 's the trouble - you ca n't predict .

Some pupils at Downend school have been seen wearing face masks at the school and others have been given Tamiflu as a precautionary measure . A letter has been sent to parents with the symptoms and parents to contact their GP if exhibiting symptoms . The girl tested positive for virus A H1N1 , also known as swine flu .

Their efforts are under way at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control -LRB- NIBSC -RRB- in Hertfordshire . The NIBSC is one of a small group of influenza centres around the world which will create a seed vaccine strain which could then be grown in bulk by manufacturers . Its scientists need a steady hand to drill a hole in a hen 's egg . For that is the first step in the creation of a vaccine against the swine flu virus . Scientists at NIBSC , which is part of the Health Protection Agency , say eggs are ideal for growing up flu viruses . `` They are like virus production factories , '' its principal scientist Dr John Wood explained . Manufacturers are halfway through producing their normal vaccine to combat winter flu . If they are asked to stop - there will be shortages of the normal seasonal vaccine `` Eggs have been used for decades to make flu vaccines . It 's an old technology but it works very well . '' I was allowed into one of the containment labs which will be used to make the vaccine but not where the live virus is being used . This is not because of infection but because I might contaminate the vaccine production process . It involves scientists painstakingly injecting a small amount of virus into each egg which will then be incubated over the weekend . By Monday , they should have enough virus to begin the next stage . Two different techniques are being used . First , `` reverse genetics '' , where scientists take the H and the N surface proteins from the H1N1 virus and mix them with a laboratory virus known as PR8 . This creates a harmless hybrid virus which can be used for the vaccine . The second technique involves injecting both the H1N1 and PR8 viruses into eggs and allowing the hybrid strain to be created through a natural re-assortment of their genes . The vaccine will work by tricking the immune system into thinking it has been infected with the H1N1 swine flu virus so that it creates antibodies against it . Then , if subsequently exposed to the virus , the immune system will destroy the invader before it can cause illness . The first seed strain of H1N1 swine flu vaccine should be ready in three to four weeks . It will then take another four or five months for vaccine manufacturers to produce the vaccine in bulk . On Wednesday , when the WHO raised the threat level to five - one short of a pandemic , its director general stopped short of asking vaccine manufacturers to switch to an H1N1 strain . Dr Margaret Chan said this was because it was not yet clear how severe the virus would be . `` It will be an extremely difficult decision for the World Health Organisation and governments to make , '' said Dr Wood . `` Manufacturers are halfway through producing their normal vaccine to combat winter flu . It could take manufacturers up to five months to mass-produce the vaccine `` If they are asked to stop doing that it means there will be shortages of the normal seasonal vaccine and vulnerable people could be susceptible if there was an epidemic of ordinary flu this winter '' . The WHO has a matter of weeks in which to make that decision if it does not want to lose valuable time . No-one should expect a swine flu vaccine to be available before the Autumn . In fact most of us will have to wait a lot longer . Around 300 million doses of seasonal flu vaccine are produced globally each year . The vaccine includes three different strains of human flu so each dose takes three eggs to produce . If manufacturers switched to producing a single pandemic strain vaccine , they might feasibly triple the number of doses to around 900 million . But it may not be that simple . We do not know how well the virus will grow in eggs or how much antigen will be needed to create an effective vaccine . It may require two injections to provide adequate immunity . With a world population of more than six billion , there clearly will not be enough to go round and the disease will hit poorer countries hardest because they can not afford to buy the vaccines . The UK government has contracts with two manufacturers to produce 120 million doses of pandemic vaccine - enough for two doses per Briton , if required . But unless you are a front-line healthcare worker or someone involved in an essential service , do not be surprised if you are not among the first to receive it . If a pandemic is declared and vaccine production begun then most of us are likely to have to wait until well into next year before we are offered it . That is why it is so important to try to prevent an epidemic in Britain now . That would buy us valuable time in which to create a vaccine .

The archives of all the student , teacher and staff blogs are still available here to read but commenting has closed . Here is the link to the new system : First of all , I want to thank everyone put his comment on the first entery and I promise I will reply to most of these comments as soon as possible ! Unfortunately , my second entery is not that pleasent . On the last few days the world was stunned by the news of the outbreak of swine flu epidemic . Here in Egypt , people are terrified especially after they learned that this disease is fatal and can be transferred from ahumanbeing to another , and there is a general pessimistic attitude throughout most of Egyptian community . As a full-time pharmacist in a community pharmacy , I can tell how people are deepely concerned . Many customers , who enter the pharmacy these days , with common cold symptoms ca n't now treat this whole matter simply as the past and some of them do n't hesitate to ask me if they cought swine flu . Also , I used to be asked about the availability of `` Tmiflu '' and protective masks . Of course I answer these poor patients with a big a smile on my face that there 's nothing to worry about with many of `` Stop it ! '' and `` Do n't bother yourself ! '' . Frankly speaking , I 'm really ... . really worried and afraid to some extent . Medically speaking , Most types of influinza , including the swine type , share the same symptoms of the the regular flu and we ca n't reach an exact diagnosis without laboratory test . Also , the WHO says that the current anti-influinza vaccines and the widely known antiviral drug `` Tamiflu '' showed little effectiveness against swine flu . Added to that , I 'm not sure that using protective musks is adequate to protect ourselves from this virus whish is still classified as the strongest micro organism on earth . Absolutely disappointing !!!!!!! Is n't it ? But have you realized that some international reactions was to some sort childish and showing a great degree of lack of responsibility and even sense towards an epedimic that threats the all humanbeings ? Especially , these animal rights defending organizations who condemned the Egyptian authorities disicion to slaughter all pigs as a preemptive action to avoid a swine flu outbreak in Egypt . Very rediulous !!!! So what to do ? Just wait and see ! The WHO says that a time period of 3 to 6 monthes is needed after the isolation and the identification of the genetic map `` genome '' of the virus to produce an effective vaccine . Until that time , we should follow strictly the widely known precautions including washing hands properly , wearing protective masks , which I still do n't believe in its effectiveness , avoid the change of climate and , of course , stop eating pork . Next entery , I promise , will be less disappointing ! I know that the title may be a little bit strange , but it was just to tell you that I call your name withot the proper way `` Mrs Rachel '' to avoid violation of the friendly image of the blog . I hope that it wo n't be percieved as a humulation or a disrespect to you . Anyhow , I want to ask you to stress in your next enteries on the proper use of punctuation marks . Besides , I will wait impatiently for your tips and remarks on my way of writing to enhance my writing skills and make my essays more understandable and acceptable . On the other hand , I consider speaking is the most troublemaking skills for me . Due to the nature of my proffission as a pharmacist and the location of the pharmacy I have to speak English , in many cases , to native speakers . You ca n't imagine how terrible I become when I have to speak , my face flushes and I sweat heavily and my body temperature spikes suddenly , and how many naieve mistakes Imake . For example , a British woman came to the pharmacy to buy her medicine and after I gave it to her I asked her , when I realized her accent , `` Mam , you seems to be British '' She smiled and saied , '' Yes '' I think you now noticed how bad I need to fix this ability of fluent speaking . Comments on many comments : -RRB- Oh my God ! I do n't believe that the first week passed so quickly like that ! Anyway , this is the proper time to reply to some of your wonderful comments I was impressed and surprised that my introductory entery recieved 20 comments . That was a very warm welcomming attitude I have never expected ! On the other side , I have to tell you that my enteries focus intensively on parts of everyday life in Egypt which , as I think , you will not read about in tourism booklets and , maybe , you ca n't have the chance to learn about when you visit Egypt as tourists . I hope this will not disappoint you . Cheik Vall from Mauritania and Soroush from Toronto : The advice about avoiding eatin pork was said by many well known physicians and specialists in Egypt . I know that this disease is airbourne , but I think that this virus has the strength and the fatality of bird flu -LRB- H5N1 -RRB- and the ability to transfer from a human to another of the human flu -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- . This makes the way of the disease transfer unpredictable . This is , of course , regardless to the other health hazards of eating pork and the fact that Islam bans eating pork which needs no notice . Here in Egypt we have alot of well-equipped labs that can analyze thousands of samples within short time . I think that the real problem is not the availablity of equipments . It 's all about how to control the outbreak of the swine flu if happened . This is the chief concern of everyone in the globe . Cristina from Buenos Aires , Argentina : I ca n't agree more with most of what you said except about eating pork and the role of pigs in this dilemma . 3-To Rachel , with all respect : -RRB- Also the huge number of comments was absolutely impressive . I ca n't tell you how grateful I am . Thanks alot for your supportive comments and useful advices . 4 - Dusting dusty dustingly dust !!!!!!! You are 100 % right . Spring is not supposed to be that bad , but this is the bitter truth in Egypt . Actually , autumn is the best season in the year in Egypt . Unfortunately , it 's the beginning of schools activities , so , I can rarely enjoy the fine weather of this season , Cristina from Buenos Aires , Argentina : Well , the sales was n't that good in this day . It was another slow day . Anyway , every thing emproved after that . Actually , I am afraid of that too !!!!!! But I can do nothing !!!! Wish me a good luck , brother !!!! It 's nice to know that Egypt is not alone in suffering . Thanks Hyoshi Thanks again for your sweet comments and I apologize for those whom I did n't reply to their comments . once upon atime in a line ! How long have you standed in a line inside or outside a bilding to do any thing ? And what was the longst duratione you have done that ever ? Well , letme break your personal records !!!!! So , ladies and gentelmen ! Now we will celebrate the new world record !!!!! SIX HOURS !!!!!! HURRAY !!!!!!!!!!!!! Ladies and Gentelmen , let 's applause to our Herooooooooooooooooooooooooo !!!!!!!!! Seriously , Egyptians , especially in Cairo , are used to this kind of tidious activity . This is supposed to be natural especially if we are talking a bout a big city with more than 20 million residents . An Egyptian journalist described that as '' The worst and most brutal punishmint for your sins ! '' Three weeks ago , I had to go to the National Records authority to issue a new copy of this : Egyptian identity card : image removed by BBC Learning English This is the `` The national ID card '' which is the most important document in an ordinary Egyptian life . In fact , you ca n't make a passport , enroll in courses or buy a car without it , and in many cases your identity is denied if you missed yours ! Actually , I had to change some details in my ID in order to issuing other important documents . And that was the very begining of the story . 10.00 am : I reached the national records building . I supposed it was early ... . . What a stupid thought ! Unfortunately , I found an extremely long line of people extended from the basement to the first floor , department of national IDs . So , I have to take my position in that line . Some people told me that they were here from 7.00 am till this moment !!!!!!!! 11.00 am : The line moved slowly and I put my exhausted feet on the stairs towards my destination . 12.00 am : The electrecity cut off suddenly ! This meant , with no doubt , many other precious minuets would be wasted just like that ! 1.00 pm : The electricity was back ... . . The line resumed moving with the same slow speed after meaningless stop . 3.00 pm : Finally , I reached the clerk responsible for finishing my papers . But that was n't the end of the suffering . She , by the way she was a woman , showed me an ugly smile and said , `` This is the end of my shift ! ... ... ... . . Please , do n't lough !!!!! 4.00 pm : After another hour of waiting that left me and rest of the people very furious , the other clerk arrived . Me and the people behind me were so exhausted and tired , my blood pressure dropped and I was near to faint , to blame that man or yell on him . He finished my paper and this drama , that seemed to be endless , reached its end ! Finding a bus that drove me home was n't that difficult and I layed down on my bed on 5.45 pm !!!!!! Thanks alot for your last enteries , especially the last one . They were absolutely useful . I 've read the leaflet and , as you , found it strange to read an expression like '' flu friend ' . But actually , the statement '' Catch it , Bin it , Kill it '' is my favorite . This reminds me with a widely used term in medical books '' Typhoid Marry '' . Marry was a cook used to process meals to many high class families in USA in the third decade of 20th century . Many children and even elderly members of these families died with typhoid that was a fatal bacterial disease at this time . Physicians found typhoid in the samples of food prepared by Marry and , later on , in her blood smear . She had typhoid in her blood but did n't harm her . Nowadays , This term is used to define people like Marry who can spread a dangerous disease , viral or bacterial , unitentionally . In another words , they are called `` carriers '' You are right about new situations that give birth to new words . This is also true about Arabic . Anyway , languages are described to be adaptable , I spent more than ten minuets to remember this word . On the other hand , new situations can give '' life kiss '' to some words that was thought to be burried forever in language books . For example , many English language students , like me , had to deal with words like `` terrorism '' , `` tolerance '' , `` mass destruction weapons '' , `` pre-amptive '' , ... . etc after 9\\/11 attacks . During the swine flu crisis , many people I meet and many TV programs presenters used the word H1N1 in stead of swine flu . I thaught that this word would still forever used only by medical specialists . I was , as usual , wrong . That 's it for now . See you soon , Rachel . Oh yes , I caught flu and I am very sick . Actually , I did n't figure out the cause , but I realize that I have to move temporarily from being a flu friend to a flu victim or even a flu prey . I am just fine right now and it seems like I will pass this anyway . In one of your enteries you said , `` Could you take some photos of yourself at work ? I am interested to see what your pharmacy looks like ! '' Well , Rachel , I ca n't refuse any thing you ask . I took some photos of the most important moments in my work day . So , let 's begin . 10.00 am : I open the pharmacy doors myself Now , it 's time to clean up all this mess of the previous busy night . I have never been good in cleening my room and making it tidy , and it was hard at first to do that in pharmacy . By time , the whole task has become easier . I used to sweep this floor then clean it using a mop every day ... ... Not bad for a young man , is n't it ? It 's the time to have my morning tea break . I drink one cup of tea with milk two times daily . After a while , my mother comes to the pharmacy . She is the manager . She is a kind woman , but when it comes to work she becomes serious . I learned from her many things about managing the pharmacy and how to make my pharmaceutical information very useful . She is a good pharmacist and a great manager . During this , I have to deal with the new drugs coming to the pharmacy . I arrange them in categories , write down their expirey date in the records , put the price lables then puting them in shelves . At 3.00 pm my morning shift ends . I leave y mother in the pharmacy and stay at home for three hours . At 6.00 pm the night shift begins . During this shift nothing important happens . I spend some moments watching TV . I spend most of the night shift with my father . He was a surgeon , but he had to retire early when he was 29 because of Parkinsonism , a central nervous system disease . In spite of that , he takes part in the management of the pharmacy with my mother and plays successfuly his rule as the leader of the family . Also , he gives medical advice to people gratis . In fact , he is a brave man . I hope you have enjoyed these pictures and looking forward for your comments . See you after the weekend . When the technology lets you down !!!!! Nowadays , we are sorrunded by many forms of advanced technology . Many of us have computers , hold a mobile phone or a pocket pc in the trousers pockets , keep flash memory in hand bags , take photos with digital cameras , ... ... etc. . These fancy devices are supposed to make our life easier and that makes us depend on modern technology all the time . But what if I tell you that some of these gadgets can let you down and ruin your life ? Ther is an old proverb in English , `` The friend in need is the friend in deed '' . Well , what my computer and mobile , for example , do is very opposite to a friend action . When I was student I used to deal with the computer breaking down suddenly and in critical times . I had to spend long nights trying to figure out many problems happened without a just reason during finishing urgent works . Last month , my younger sister , by the way I have also a brother , was writing her college assignment . She spent 2 days to gather information and 5 long hours typing the report using the Microsoft Word . Unfortunately , and before writing the last page , a strange error message appeared and the computer shut down without any warning . Yes , the work of 5 hours vanished just like that . What do you expect my sister to do ?!!!! Of course she bursted in tears and had to rewrite the report with the tears on her cheaks because the report had to be handed the next day . . Yesterday , also , I had to contact the internet service provider to fix a technical problem that cut the internet connection for three days . Besides , I ca n't count the number of times my mobile phone turned off during an important call . Sometimes , I feel that what happened and happens is , somehow , intentional and these devices do these crimes against me with cold blood because they know that I ca n't afford discarding them right now . I know that some of you think that this is a stupid illusions , but I wish that I can treat these idiots like humans and give them a piece of my mind !!!!! From flu victim to flu friend ! Roger !!!!! : -RRB- Thanks Rachel for your post . I am very glad that you like the photos and I hope I could make you any favor you want .

Experts warn swine flu could spark a global pandemic . BBC News online put a number of your questions to flu expert Maureen Baker , Head of Pandemic Planning at the Royal College of General Practitioners . Is there a proper definition of how severe a disease is before it can be classed as a pandemic ? Chris Bonnello , Birmingham Dr Baker : I believe a pandemic is a disease that spreads round the world . In the context of flu , this is when a new strain of influenza virus emerges to which people have no previous resistance , meaning it easily spreads from person to person and from country to country . I 'm pregnant and wondered if pregnant ladies will get preference for any vaccination ? Sarah Murray , Northamptonshire Dr Baker : If a vaccination for swine flu becomes available , this will not happen for several months . As and when that happens , we expect that guidelines will be issued regarding which groups of people should be higher priority for vaccination . I have a six-month old baby and we are due to visit a friend who has just returned from Mexico . Would you advise staying clear of those individuals who have had recent travel to affected areas ? Sarah Jones , London Dr Baker : It is difficult to give specific advice as it probably depends how long ago this friend was in Mexico and whether your friend feels well . You should probably weigh these things up and then decide whether to meet your friend just now or not . Is swine flu going to be the same as bird flu , i.e. a moral panic , or should we actually be concerned ? Chris Berry , Wirral Dr Baker : I believe we should be concerned but not get into a panic . Clearly there is significant potential for this outbreak to develop into a pandemic but , as yet , this is not inevitable . Any flu is more serious than a cold as a small number of people can develop complications of flu , such as pneumonia . The other factor that concerns us in respect of pandemic flu is that large numbers of people can fall ill within a short period of time and this has major implications for health services . How long can the virus survive in the air after an infected person has coughed or sneezed ? Matthew Sheldon , Derbyshire Dr Baker : Sorry do n't know . I expect this information will become available as we learn more about this particular virus strain . My husband is nearing the end of a chemotherapy course and we would like to go on a cruise but his immune system is low , will travel be a problem ? Marion Vanner , USA Dr Baker : I would suggest you keep a close eye on the developing situation over the next few weeks . Your husband should consider consulting his physician for advice nearer your intended travel date . Will washing your hands kill the virus on your hands and is an antibacterial soap better ? Tim Smith , London Dr Baker : Washing with soap and water is an effective way of cleaning hands . Should people who were asthma sufferers as children be worried by this outbreak ? Graeme Pearce , Birmingham Dr Baker : So far , we have no information to suggest that people who have a history of asthma are at any higher risk of complications from this strain of flu . My friend has recently got back from Mexico and has been feeling ill and now I have developed what seems like a normal cold . I have had it for about four days and there is no sign of getting better . I have n't been to the doctor . What do you advise ? Sarah Woollard , Lincolnshire , UK Dr Baker : I think if you have symptoms of a cold - and have had these for four days - then this is almost certainly a normal cold . For more detailed advice -LRB- or if your friend wants further information -RRB- it might help to contact NHS Direct . What is the incubation time of swine flu from point of exposure ? Mrs Catherine Edwards , Cardiff , UK Dr Baker : I do n't believe we know enough yet about this illness to be able to say . I would expect this sort of information to become available over the next few days . Is the basic flu jab sufficient to protect against this virus ? Janice Ward , Banbury , UK Dr Baker : No - so far as we know at present . When flu symptoms arise we are told not to bother the doctor , stay at home , keep warm and drink water . Good advice usually but in this case , how do you know when it is necessary to contact the doctor ? Lesley Buckley , Ely , UK Dr Baker : It is good advice . However , people will be able to get more information from NHS Direct . If swine flu develops into a pandemic , and reaches the UK , then the public will receive information on leaflets , and from television , that will advise on what to look out for , in terms of worsening symptoms , that should prompt seeking help . How does ` flu ' actually ` kill ' someone ? How long does it take from becoming infected with virus to death , if that is the outcome ? Graham Munn , Stevenage , UK Dr Baker : Flu is an unpleasant illness but one that normally leads to complete recovery within a week or so for most people . The danger from flu is mainly from complications , especially pneumonia . If people who have flu become much worse , especially if they start to have breathing difficulties , pneumonia should be suspected . If pneumonia develops , that probably needs to be treated in hospital with antiviral and\\/or antibiotics . Some patients with pneumonia can deteriorate very quickly , others may have an illness over a number of days or even weeks . The swine flu is from Mexico but how did it come about and is it going to spread in the UK ? Sana Mir , Birmingham , UK Dr Baker : Presumably a new strain of flu developed in pigs and then passed to humans -LRB- probably people who work with , or live in close proximity to , pigs -RRB- . At present , we do n't know if it will spread to the UK but the authorities are closely monitoring the situation . Is there a risk that if the emerging swine flu H1N1 virus comes into contact with the established bird flu H5N1 virus that the two could mix and cause an even bigger pandemic risk ? Sarah , Coventry , UK Dr Baker : Any new strain of flu poses a risk of developing into one that can quickly spread and turn into a pandemic . Even if these two strains were to meet and lead to evolution of another new virus , I would have thought that would take some time and were it to happen would probably be neither more or less dangerous in itself than any new strain of flu . We have booked a holiday to Cancun Mexico in August we have got young children , should we cancel and go elsewhere ? Myroulla Christoforou , London , UK Dr Baker : Hopefully by then the outbreak will have passed , however travel advice is regularly updated on the Foreign Office website . Let 's hope you are able to go and have a lovely holiday ! We are a GP surgery with over 8,000 patients . We are obviously awaiting guidance from the Dept of Health . In our pandemic flu plan we have been advised by our local PCT to provide 8 masks a day per member of staff - could you clarify the projected usage of a mask - ie : should they be treated like surgical gloves and disposed of after one use ? Caroline Dray , Ramsgate , UK Dr Baker : Masks become ineffective when they become damp or after a few hours . There has been a lot of debate on the use of facemasks and some authorities say that , in the community , the most effective use is to give to patients who may have symptoms when they present in the surgery - that should help reduce the infectivity of that patient to surgery staff and other patients . I expect the Department of Health will issue guidance on use of facemasks if we move into a pandemic phase . I have no spleen and I 'm concerned that I will find it hard to fight the flu virus if contracted . Is there anything I can do to pre-prepare myself ? Stella Lawrence , Norfolk , UK Dr Baker : You should be very careful in having meticulous hand hygiene , washing your hands frequently with soap and water or using alcohol hand rubs . Should this become a pandemic strain , some patients -LRB- and people who have had splenectomies may be in this group -RRB- may be directed to take a course of antibiotics if they develop flu symptoms . If this course of action is recommended , then GPs will receive guidance and arrangements will be made for patients for whom such treatment is recommended .

Non-essential government services have halted and many businesses like cinemas and restaurants are closed . Traditional May Day rallies have been canceled . Mexican officials say the spread of the virus - suspected in more than 160 deaths - is slowing , but international experts are more cautious . China has now confirmed its first case , taking the tally of nations hit to 14 . A Mexican man who had traveled to Hong Kong via Shanghai tested positive for the virus , said Hong Kong 's leader , Donald Tsang . The hotel in which the man briefly stayed in Hong Kong has been cordoned off and the alert level raised to emergency , although the authorities have urged residents not to panic . In cases outside Mexico the effects of the virus do not appear to be severe , although one death of a Mexican child has been confirmed in the US . The WHO has set its pandemic alert level at five - but says it has no immediate plans to move to the highest level of six . The shut-down in Mexico covers two public holidays and a weekend . US : one death , at least 109 confirmed cases New Zealand : 4 confirmed , 12 probable cases Israel , Costa Rica : 2 confirmed cases each The Netherlands , Switzerland , Austria , Denmark , Hong Kong : 1 confirmed case each Countries with confirmed cases of secondary transmission City authorities say initial evidence suggests infection rates there are slowing . Some factories will stop production and schools are already closed . Residents have been urged to stay at home . But some people say they will ignore it because they can not afford not to work . There is also growing concern at the effect the virus could have on Mexico 's already-struggling economy . The number of confirmed cases of swine flu infection in Mexico now stands at more than 300 , officials say . Mexican Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova said on Friday that three more deaths from swine flu had been confirmed , bringing the toll to 15 . The virus is suspected of causing more than 160 other deaths . Announcing the figures , Mr Cordova said that new cases of the virus were levelling off . `` The fact that we have a stabilisation in the daily numbers , even a drop , makes us optimistic , '' he said . But Dr Keiji Fukuda , acting assistant director general of the World Health Organization , said fluctuations were to be expected . `` If it did n't do that -LRB- it -RRB- would be very unusual , '' he said . The US has announced that it will buy 13 million new courses of antiviral treatment and send 400,000 of them to Mexico An aide to US Energy Secretary Stephen Chu who helped arrange President Obama 's recent trip to Mexico is being tested for swine flu , AP reports , although the aide is said not to have been in contact with the president The head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is fine for people without flu symptoms to fly and use the subway , a day after Vice-President Joe Biden said he would advise his own family members against using public transport Denmark reports its first confirmed case of swine flu German authorities confirm that a nurse who treated a patient with swine flu also contracted the disease , in the first person-to-person transmission in the country Test results confirm the UK 's first person-to-person transmission of swine flu , in a friend of a couple from Scotland who were first in the country to be diagnosed with the virus Mexico says it will lodge a formal challenge at the World Trade Organisation demanding explanations from countries that have banned imports of Mexican pork products On Thursday European health ministers held an emergency meeting on measures to tackle the virus , which has now been confirmed in seven European countries . SYMPTOMS - WHAT TO DO Swine flu symptoms are similar to those produced by ordinary seasonal flu - fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue If you have flu symptoms and recently visited affected areas of Mexico , you should seek medical advice If you suspect you are infected , you should stay at home and take advice by telephone initially , in order to minimize the risk of infection EU Health Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou said Europe was well prepared to handle swine flu and there was `` no need to panic '' . The ministers agreed to work with pharmaceutical companies to develop a vaccine , but rejected a French plan to suspend flights to Mexico . Several countries have restricted travel to Mexico and many tour operators have canceled holidays . The WHO , meanwhile , says it will now call the virus influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- rather than swine flu - which it says is misleading as pork meat is safe and the virus is being transmitted from human to human .

No doubt the media believes that we have become desensitised to the constant reporting of the global financial crisis , we now need something else to worry about - well done for spreading panic BBC . What will be the next scaremongering news exclusive you will bring us when this pandemic swine flu is forgotten about in two weeks ' time ? Why do you wish us to live our lives in constant fear ? What if someone is diagnosed with this and refuses to take the medication ? Is there a goverment , local or nation directive in place ? As some people will refuse treatment , how can quarantine in one 's own house work without guards ? Andrew Lindop , Connahs Quay - I could n't agree more with your comment . Over Christmas I had a terrible flu and had to work on Christmas Eve 8pm to 9pm despite being terribly ill . This is because we are not allowed to call in sick over the Christmas period ! As a result a couple of people caught the same flu not long after me ! I think we should all stay indoors and play video games , eat cakes and listen to Elvis . This is the UK therefore we ca n't contain any pandemic . Remember bluetongue , foot and mouth and all the others that this shambolic government failed to contain . We 'll get more of the same again . But it wo n't be anyone 's fault , it never is . I think the media has really hyped this up way out of proportion before gathering all of the facts , the WHO has n't helped by escalating it to a five either . I expected more from responsible adults , than flapping around causing a mass panic amongst the naive . Look , there have been 17 deaths confirmed due to the swine flu virus worldwide , all of them Mexicans . How does this justify the global panic about this non-event ? It 's about the same as the number of people killed every two days on Britain 's roads ! I just would like to say well done to Hong Kong that acts more seriously and better than other countries to prevent spread of flu virus . Quiet news week is it ? Get a grip folks , new strains of flu are a regular occurrence - this is not news . We should follow the example of China and quarantine travellers from Mexico until the incubation period for the virus has passed . What precautions do I take before swine flu reaches our city ? Something which governments have realized over the centuries is that the populace is far easier to control if they are in fear . First there was the War on Terror and people fearing that fundamentalists were going to destroy their way of life . Next came the recession and people being in genuine fear for their jobs and livelihoods . Now comes swine flu and people fearing for their lives . The global media has been complicit in scaremongering and overhyping the issues until the problems have become a reality . In an average flu season , many people die and this is no worse . As swine flu has not been shown to be fatal in the UK perhaps we should catch it and get the immunity while it 's not . Note : I 'm not a Doctor . Spike Milligan was right , illness is good for you . News correspondents and newspapers are making a fortune out of this latest scare story . We should keep a close eye on activities in government while this distraction is in place . Employers these days ` expect ' people to work whilst ill and it is frowned upon and made difficult through rules and legislation to have time off when you are ill . Hence many of us struggle on whilst contagious . Until attitudes change this will continue and your swine flu will spread quite nicely . The one thing I would like to come out of this is that it should become socially unacceptable for people to go to work whilst ill . Also , people who send their children into school when they have heavy colds and flu should be forced to keep them at home , whether they can be bothered to look after them or not . It would seem , that , we in Britain , with our abundance of drugs dismiss this threat easily . Most of us miss the larger picture here however . Britain does not produce it 's own food supplies , only a small percentage of it in fact . While we have our drugs and comfortable existence , how do we expect to fair when we have no food supplies coming anymore ? Simply put , we can stop our population being ravished by swine flu , we have drugs against this . Our food suppliers , whom we have become dependant do not . When they all start dying and stop working out of fear , we all start suffering from hunger . This is scenario which governments do not talk about and would prefer not to be addressed . Should this become a pandemic ... Gloom and doom . What will we all die from next ? Will there be a new strain of Peruvian common cold ? Or will we be told that potatoes are potential killers ? One day , wine is good , next day it 's bad . The `` 5 a day '' will likely be rubbished soon , too . Live you lives to the fullest , in moderation , is all I can say . Ignore the `` advice '' from the `` Scientists '' . The advice changes daily . It is relatively mild thus far ... in the UK . But are we just to think of ourselves and forget about developing countries who do not have stocks of tamiflu and can not afford to buy it ? After reading the webpage about how different countries are responding , it is abundantly clear that there is not enough of the antiviral drug stockpiled in many , if not most , of them , should the virus spread like wildfire . If we are blase about the risks and take no precautionary measures , then certainly , our well-stocked country might find it to be no more than a blip in our day-to-day lives . But while we are being blase , we are traveling all over the world , visiting developing countries who are not well-stocked with anti-virals , who could end up in a crisis situation due to their being continually and repeatedly infected by countries who do n't care because they can treat it . There appears to be no need to panic as yet , but we do have an obligation to attempt to contain it , even if we can treat it easily , because other countries ca n't . The usual over reaction caused by a media who will publish anything gloomy . Flu has been on the go , in different strains for thousands of years . Mankind is still alive and kicking . I am more worried about the rise in food prices . Yeah so we have it here just 2 miles down the road . This is totally irresponsible behavior allowing people from flights to enter the country unchecked . They should have quarantined people off flights immediately to monitor them , not let them enter the community to spread disease . For goodness sake we are an Island , wake up . Now for the sake of putting those people in quarantine we have a school closed with hundreds of children disrupted , and another person to person infected . So they say that if they have closed flights it would have affected trade etc well if thousands get ill and cant work and even worse die then what will happen to economies . Again there was no reason for this virus to be let loose onto our island . Avoid a pandemic by just admitting that it 's not a pandemic ; or else when a real one comes folks will be desensitized . Furthermore , I think that the coverage is very insulting to the millions who die every year of real pandemic like malaria . How can we avoid a swine flu pandemic ? But it does n't seem too dangerous . I would far rather take my chance with it now rather that next winter . So please stop ` protecting ' me . Also if it does mutate into something really nasty I would rather my immune system had been ` primed ' with the current version . It occurs to me that no-one has seriously considered the possibility that the strain of H1N1 that has caused mortality in Mexico is not actually endemic to that region . Instead , it is possible that the strain has been introduced to the region from abroad and has impacted the local population disproportionately due to their lack of endemic resistance to the strain . This would be consistent with epidemiological data on reported rates of mortality within and outside Mexico . If this is true , then the pandemic - or international transmission of the virus - has actually been underway for much longer than has been considered and\\/or reported . I would be interested to hear back from an expert to refute this hypothesis based on the current evidence that we have . The difference between this flu and the other types of flu which kill thousands is that this one promotes such a strong immune response that healthy young people are now at risk rather than the older\\/compromised patients that your ` average ' flu kills . This is why this strain is getting coverage . So yes people should be more worried about swine flu but as yet it has n't picked up any mutations that could make it a truly deadly threat . Are you media people not over this issue yet . It 's a prolonged flu season . 150 people have died world wide . Has anyone done the comparison with a usual flu season and the number of deaths ? I am Mexican and have lived in the UK for many years now , after watching and following the news regarding the current events with the swine flu ; I am really disgusted how the scare mongering media has ruined the economy of a country . It is unfortunate that it was Mexico where this virus originated . If it was a `` developed '' country I am sure that the media would adopt more careful balanced reporting . Currently Mexican people arriving in other countries have been abused and treated as lepers . Do you think that this is right ? Please stop being so alarming and concentrate on the facts . You are causing more collapse of the world economy and more unemployment in Mexico where people are not nursed by the government like here ! ` We 've been preparing for a flu epidemic for ages ' they tell us . I believe them ; all the different agencies have been working together , doing their bit , but , just as they prepared for terrorist attacks , not one of these agencies or Government thought to consider how to communicate with the public , what duty they owe us . In both cases it was clear it had n't even been thought of , never mind worked out . We are not in the equation , which is n't surprising , given the total contempt those in power have for us , the public , who are just a problem to be negotiated , handled , if we can be bothered to rouse ourselves . Truly , we do n't deserve any better , since we 've let them get away with murder , literally , for centuries . You , the media are as bad ; you know better , but still do n't hold them to account You know what would be way more harmful than swine flu ? Shutting down economies that people depend on for their livelihood . Creating global panic and fear . I 'm very concerned about this `` shut down the borders '' attitude . I 'm sceptical about the swine flu `` pandemic '' in multiple ways . So it might mutate into something a lot more serious ... but for now it 's apparently just like normal flu but a bit nastier . But not necessarily deadly . At the moment , if it 's just flu , it should be fairly easy to get over . but the stress of being told we 're all gonna die is n't helping ... stress makes the body more vulnerable to disease . No one cares about plain old flu , but when it 's swine flu which is just a slightly worse case of flu , global panic . If it gets to the point where we are actually all in serious danger , go crazy . But right now it does n't sound much more than flu . Last year 34,000 people in the US died of ` common ' influenza viruses without so much as a byline in the press . Vaccines have been widely and freely available and still they became infected and died from failure to take the vaccine . It is impossible to stop all cases of common flu let alone new swine flu . The response has been alarmist as if it 's the end of the world . Media driven story frenzy is very much to blame and politicians react to hysterical public pressure . This is not the Black Plague . Would n't be too worried about it at the moment , it is a slightly harmful bug at present . However I do n't understand the people getting complacent about this . Yes Bird Flu ended up being a scare . People are forgetting viruses and bugs are in fact extremely clever , and can form defences to anti-viral drugs etc. . If swine flu mutates ... we could be in trouble . Mark B , London - As an Infection Control Nurse , I am more than capable of explaining to my children , -LRB- who are old enough to understand what is going on - they are not that little -RRB- what is happening , and how to take precautions themselves . Yes , this virus may only be `` just flu '' but people die of the complications like Pnuemonia . The fact that it has been reported in the news that a school has been closed because a student has contracted the virus , and other children may also have it , has brought it closer to `` their world '' . Children do not normally have full blown flu ! When I said people were being complacent , I meant that it will be sorry state of affairs when all those who say `` it 's only flu '' find themselves or family members struck down with it . For all those who say its not serious , why worry ? What about people who are susceptible to flu ? My mother is , she has weakened immunity and -LRB- any -RRB- unvaccinated flu is likely to kill her . I am not joking but very , very serious . She lives in self imposed quarantine during the winter and the same now . Until there is a vaccine for this one I wo n't see her until she has had it . She only lives two miles away ! It would be nice if people -LRB- especially the government -RRB- took this more seriously as its clearly not just flu but the pneumonia that can arise from it , that 's the killer . Please stop being so blas about it , what is one mans little bug is another mans killer and a fear we have to live with all of our lives in this family . With Mexico 's epidemic status , a certified self-quarantined program , eg 7 days without symptoms in an enclosed home etc , before international travel will establish a first line of defense . The current heavy handed quarantine-shutting down 1 hotel due to 1 visitor - is obviously unsustainable if you allow 500 visitors -LRB- 1 plane-load -RRB- with flu to come through with no effective checks before boarding . Although I am not a biologist . I Did take enough of the sciences to know that it 's important during any outbreak that the WHO identifies as a risk to take special care to follow their advice . What will be interesting to see is the relationship between stress on countries like economics , their state of being as far as how developed they are , their cultural histories in how they deal with medical emergencies and how they fair with this particular event . That data should signal to the world how important is it for us to focus more on sharing our subsistence strategies and not on how much money we have or whether or not `` our way '' is `` the way '' . Panickers on HYS still cling to their fear - now they 're saying that ` sure it 's mild now but it might mutate ! '' . ANY virus might mutate . Seasonal flu also mutates - 2 years ago it mutated so much that the vaccine from the start of the season was only 50 % effective . And seasonal flu kills 35,000 people in the US in an average year . But it 's no reason to panic . Peter Nelson , Boston MA , USA It firsts starts of as a minor outbreak , this has happened in the past before as well . nd before we know it , it will spread rapidly . so everyone should be careful in what they touch , especially dirty surfaces -LRB- see the swine flu advert -RRB- . It seems to me there is a mountain being made out of a mole hill by the media . It is sad that so many people have died but so far there are no other deaths . The flu kills every year and this one seems no different . How does that turn into a pandemic ? Either the media has latched onto this story and has run with it or there are missing parts to this story . Either way , I have stopped listening until there is something new to hear . Wearing face masks gives a false sense of security . It certainly helps in prevention of spread of the flu but it certainly does not help in contracting the flu from someone who is infected . Yes , maybe its all hype to most of you . But if you are old , or on immunosuppressants , or a transplant patient , or pregnant , or have a chronic chest , or have HIV , this is a pretty big deal . Are any such people allowed to even have Tamiflu at home so they can take it right away if they get ill ? Nor can they buy it online as our wonderful government will even stop you saving yourself . Meanwhile corporate Britain can buy tons of it to dose up perfectly fit people . This is ` flu , a mutation as all ` flu viruses are . Why is this being blown up into such a crisis . Even if you catch this particular ` flu , just use common sense although that seems to have one out of the window . Stay in bed , drink plenty of fluids and you will recover . Do not waste health professionals time if you sneeze just the once ! You should check your facts . The swine flu information line is an 0800 number , therefore a free number . NHS direct is a 08454 number 5 pence per minute . How can we avoid a swine flu pandemic ? By NOT creating it with an influx of media and global hype . People who sneeze , cough and get the chills will `` think '' they 've got it . Stupid media strikes at the heart of our minds once again . For the people who complain it is all being ` overblown ' by the media . You are partly right . There is an over abundance of coverage on this issue . However , If the ` swine flu ' mutates into a form that is anywhere near the virulence of the ` Spanish Flu ' from 1918-1920 we could be looking at millions of deaths worldwide . I think a 7 day period of ` over caution ' in order to avoid even a slight risk of millions of death is worthwhile . How to spread diseases ? Pack a couple of hundred people in a ` plane with constant recirculation of the same old stale air for a few hours and let one infected person sneeze . How to prevent this happening ? Put a stop to all unnecessary flights . Alex the Hat , Cardiff , UK I can not believe the fear and anxiety being whipped up and perpetuated by the media about this flu . It 's flu not bubonic plague . The poor people in Mexico who died did not have our standard of living nor our health care . Of a population of over 60 million and only 9 confirmed cases , this is overkill taken to the extreme . There is very little news here . Of course it may serve a discredited government to have the population in fear to keep them in line and to divert attention from their many failures . Excuse me but has everyone forgotten how many millions of people in Africa and Asia die every year from MALARIA ? Oh sorry they live in the 3rd world and do n't have broadband\\/satnav\\/lcd tv\\/ipods so they do n't matter do they ? Wake up people to the rubbish you are being fed by your governments every day of your lives to keep you in check . By promoting good hygiene but it 's mostly down to luck now ! Alan Shirley , Kingston upon Thames The Mexican pig-flu is giving our health systems the MOT , and those countries with a poor public health system are exposed . Reading through the comments , i have noticed so many people trying to think this is another media hype . Honestly do you think that all those government officials , scientists , WHO officials and many other people are stupid ? The WHO pandemic phase 5 was declared after great consideration into the matter . Well some say more people die of other diseases , but why ? Ever thought about it ? Because those diseases spread out fast , and became hard to control whenever they started . If we do the same , i.e. ignore the current flu problem , then one more deadly virus will be out and about , killing even more people . I think that the press are making this sound bigger than it actually is as hundreds of people die every year in Mexico from normal flu . How do we know that these people have not all died from normal flu , and only a few from swine flu ? `` Swine flu appears to be as mild an illness as the regular flu . Yuri '' Had it ever occurred to you that WHO scientists are aware of something that you do n't know about ? What virologists know -LRB- but the public is blissfully ignorant of -RRB- is that flu viruses can easily mutate . That 's how viruses survive . A global flu pandemic can easily last a year . What scientists are concerned about is that what started out as a comparatively mild strain of flu can suddenly mutate into a strain that 's highly virulent and deadly . There can be a ` second wave ' of a pandemic that 's much more destructive than the first . I wish we could have a five day siesta like the Mexicans . We have 5 probable cases of the flu in Wisconsin too . Why ca n't we have five days off work ? This whole event is totally silly . I have sympathy for those very few people who have lost loved ones but the hysteria is ridiculous . If this is what happens when a different and mild flu strain comes along what will happen when a real crisis happens ? There are fewer people who walk through the streets not wearing masks to protect themselves after the announcement made by the Hong Kong government that the first confirmed case has occurred . I have no idea why Hongkongers ignore the alert as this deadly flu has just reached our place . We should be fine if we neglect reading the media . They get us all confused . You ca n't avoid a pandemic . The world is a lot smaller nowadays and people travel across the globe 24\\/7 . This is just life in modern age . The point is not how serious this illness is now but how serious a form it will become . While I obviously denounce any panic at any stage in this outbreak , anyone with medical expertise would agree with the WHO that this situation needs to be closely monitored and people kept informed , although sweeping tabloid headlines are not the way to do this . There should be a program whereby key workers can volunteer to be exposed to the virus now so that when the epidemic really hits in the autumn , there will be people who can keep things going when the rest are laid up in bed . I ca n't believe that the NHS phone number for help on swine flu is a premium number !! I 've been making the very same comment myself re why not stop the flights in and out till the storm has passed over is this not logic ? Strict hygienic measures were taken to effectively control cholera in Peru in 1991 after demonising , mistakenly , fish . Now the Peruvian 's ordeal seems to be repeating in Mexico , but this time it 's not fish , it 's pigs instead . Added to the virtual panic over economic problems in the capitalist world , this flu and the hype accompanying it makes it easy for people leap into the news media-generated abyss . Part of the problem has been US government 's misinformation and nearly hourly change-of-mind announcements . The US Centre for Disease Control has been a monument to confusion since the flu first began , which only adds to many people 's hysteria . So many comments , so much ignorance . Spanish flu was mild early in its spring appearance , devastating in the fall - when it killed `` just '' one or two percent of the infected in North America . The virus has n't fully adapted to humans yet , we have no idea what 's to come . Yes it 's true , this cloud will probably pass , but it still pays to come in out of the rain . As for official medical ignorance - we discovered this year that Vitamin D is also a hormone that down regulates the immune system , so young people at risk ought to be advised to take it to prevent cytokine storm . Studies after SARS proved that N95 masks were VERY effective in preventing infection , contrary to what had been thought -LRB- and is still often said . -RRB- They are very cheap -LRB- for industrialized nations -RRB- , and should be in every first aid kit . Joe Thorpe , New York , USA I 'm scared of swine flu , I hope it does n't affect us . Lets hope the engineers can make the perfect cure . Everything is pretty controlled here , pretty calm . We have not had a single case , the population is tranquil even despite the massive fear that the media world is causing . Yes it is true it can be contagious , but give us a break . Hundreds of thousand of people get infected by regular flu every day and no one ever paid attention to it . The economical damage that the media is provoking to these country is enormous because of the fear they have created , I lost my job and so have thousands . I live in a city that can be an easy target , I do n't have it , my friends and family do n't have it and the friends of my friends they dot not have it either . I ca n't see what all the worry is about . Very few have died , much less than in a regular flu season . It seems like a lot of hype to me . According to the BBC website we have 484 confirmed cases from a world population of 6.8 billion . Am I alone in thinking this is all an unnecessary panic generated by the media ? In a way it is a good thing this came along , as now no one appears to be worrying about the global economy . Trev The Sparky , Newcastle , UK My advice would be to catch this flu early while the NHS is offering red carpet treatment . Unpleasant and risky it may be but at least you will not be in a queue for treatment . What concerns me is that , as Jack commented , the 1918 flu was deadliest for those people with the most effective immune systems - young healthy people - and this swine flu is likely to be the same . Mexican borders should be closed until this situation calms down . Anyone who even considers going on holiday to Mexico in the near future is obviously not too bright and needs to be saved from themselves . Extreme poverty kills more than swine flu might do every year , yet we see none of the media hype about that . Even in wealthy Britain the old can die from lack of enough heat or food . Perhaps it 's the fact that flu takes no account of wealth that has got everyone so excited . After all , the rich might die too ! Do what your mother told you : Cover your mouth when you sneeze , stay home in bed when sick , do n't spit or snot , wash your hands and keep your distance out of others ' personal space . As for the rest of it ? It is all complete hysterical tosh including flu jabs and face masks . It 's just the flu with a different name !! Dave B -LRB- Brit ex-pat -RRB- , Uxbridge , Canada Keep healthy , stop tiring yourself and doing dangerous life threatening sports . Our immune system is more about our everyday health , so keeping well , or not getting flu , is about being able to fight these viruses off . Unfortunately our cleaning and so called health industry have got their sticky fingers into the here and now , rather than prevention . So far this virus is behaving exactly like regular flu , killing only the very vulnerable and those living in poor conditions . This is not big news , people . Someone who said that it would be a good idea to have alcohol hand-gels like Purrell for home school and bus are talking foolishness . Purrell does kill 99.9 percent of germs , but the other .1 percent are resistant to the alcohol , so they mutate and reproduce , creating viruses that are completely immune to it . Warm water and soap is enough !! Why do you keep on about this swine flu ? More people die every winter from regular flu . Stop scaremongering and report some real news . Swine flu appears to be as mild an illness as the regular flu . More and more cases are coming from Mexico , common sense would dictate that if you stop the flights from Mexico , you therefore minimize the number of new cases entering the country . Therefore why are we being told by the EU Health Ministers that there is no point in a travel ban . For example , when we had foot and mouth in UK , there was a worldwide ban on imports of meat from UK to many countries . Therefore it is common sense to stop arrivals from Mexico to stop the spread of swine flu . Whatever happened to common sense ? This sort of news is exactly what keeps us alive : Drama and Chaos in an otherwise dull day in the US suburbia ! `` The BBC is now spreading misinformation . It is no longer called the swine flu - please correct your stories lest more people think it can be spread through pigs or eating pork . Alex , Boston , USA '' While pork products are safe pigs can be infected by avian influenza and human influenza viruses as well as swine influenza viruses . Ged , St Pete , Florida , USA One way to avoid the pandemic is not to believe all that our hysterical media are pumping out . Every illness is some tragedy , and 168 deaths that may be related to H1N1 are serious , but many more people die from obesity every month . Have n't you guys got something better to write about ? What about a sense of proportion for a change ? Andrew Dundas , Ilkley , UK & Florida In the past when there was no cure for TB , smallpox or other such killer diseases people would be in severe panic when any of those broke out , but now they take such diseases very slightly because they know there are dependable preventive and curative treatments . I wonder , why are we not yet succeeding to find preventive and curative treatment against ` bird flu ' or now ` swine flu ' ? Men have conquered land after land and some space planets too as well as lots of inventions and discoveries . Why do they not care to conquer these killer diseases ? The only ways of avoiding swine flu for now is to reduce family outings . Governments should make sure that all those places which are congested such as schools , cinema halls and others are closed until this deadly flu is contained . Use common sense , wash hands frequently . Remember , in most cases the flu is mild and self-limited . Do not panic after listening to excessive and sensational media coverage . We need to stop the media-induced mass hysteria and get on with our lives . I think I might be worried if I lived in Mexico but , frankly , I 'm unconcerned here . There are far too many deaths each day from other causes , and if my number 's up , then so be it . The BBC is now spreading misinformation . It is no longer called the swine flu - please correct your stories lest more people think it can be spread through pigs or eating pork . We have experience SARS and seen the horror . But it was contain only in Asia . But ` swine flu ' will most surely be global and this only that we are all one irrespective of countries or race . Lets us all be united . Some of the comments on here are laughable : Jo from Berkshire ... no wonder your kids are scared if you 're incapable of speaking sense to them . No one has died in the UK from it , yet we 're all being complacent ? We do n't know much about it , but it could be the next pandemic ? Please , for the sake of your children , turn off the TV and worry about something else . This is a media storm purely for the benefit of the media . Up to 0.5 m people die a year from normal flu . Are your children worried that they might die from that too , as it seems far more likely ? Or do you just scare them with what they papers tell you to scare them with ? Our citizens are being told not to make physical contact with anyone in public . As an `` air kiss '' on the cheek or an handshake is the normal greeting , it is causing stress at a cultural level . Patricia Stenlund , San Ramon , Costa Rica Why are plane loads of passengers coming from Mexico having sat in a confined space together for several hours being allowed to disembark and come into direct contact with hundreds of people . Would some form of quarantine and monitoring not reduce the chances of the virus spreading through our communities . Where is the common sense approach . Fact outside of Mexico 1 person has died out of 150 + cases a mortality rate of less than 1 % Fact in Mexico there is no clear idea who has died of swine flu and how many cases , there are 7 confirmed deaths . NVCJD was going to kill millions . Spanish flu came after WW1conditions were perfect for it to spread thousands of soldiers coming home in mass transports poor health systems in ravaged economies . Let 's try and keep a sense of proportion . In the school days I knew about Flu and Dengue fevers . Then recently we came to know about SARS and bird flu . Now swine flu is alarmingly scaring all mainly by the media reportage from USA , Europe , etc. though it has started from Mexico . Precautionary measures should be popularized to avert in other parts of the world . If public hygiene is maintained this can not happen again . Pollution is the main problem that causes all crises along with diseases as this pandemic one ! Clean world is the best solution and panacea for healthy life for all ! T A Ramesh , Pondicherry , India Media fear mongering , end of story . Regards , vast majority of people -LRB- thanks for reflecting our views -RRB- If the government warns us , and if the media warns us , then they are over reacting , if both the Government and the media fail to keep us updated , then they are incompetent , Makes you think ? Look , we need alcohol gel hand wash in school and for home , everywhere , really . Oh and we should have them on buses Why do n't the governments of the world do what Mexico do and shut the country down , sure it will have an economic impact but is n't saving lives more important . This virus has the potential to mutate again and become more dangerous so governments around the world need to act now or face losing lives . Why do they not put their emergency plans in action now , before it is too late ? Has anybody noticed that the majority of deaths have been in Mexico , who , let 's face it , has a poor health system ? Much like Bird Flu , where the majority of deaths were within communities where those who died either spent their lives around birds or were close to those who did . Keep clean , keep alert , but do n't panic . That 's my advice . Why is this any more dangerous than any other form of flu ? New versions of the flu virus continue to evolve . Flu can be fatal so what 's special about this one ? About ten people died yesterday on the roads , why is the money not available to control this ongoing waste of life ? Why panic over something that happens every year ? flu kills hundreds of people in this country every year ! If you are worried , take a low dosage vitamin C supplement . It wo n't stop you from catching the Flu , but you will recover from it quicker and have it milder than every one else . While i believe that the mass hysteria is largely misplaced , it has in its own way helping to keep a serious pandemic at bay - people are aware now and are going out of their way to keep good hygiene and watch for symptoms . From the information at hand I 'm of the opinion that we are just going to see something similar to a ` nasty outbreak ' of winter flu - Genuinely unpleasant and not without casualties but certainly not Armageddon . What a joke ... media are whipping up a stupid and gormless public ... get a life and get back to work At the moment I 'm not that worried swine flu . So far the vast majority of people that have contracted it have only had mild symptoms . As with any flu virus some people suffer worse then others , and deaths as a result of flu is not unheard of . I do n't see that point of people wearing masks and rubber gloves , as it really is n't going to provide you with any real protection . Let 's get those bins back in the underground so tissues can be binned instead of left on seats , which is what happens . Also food outlets should provide hand washing facilities rather than insist that you buy food \\* before \\* using their toilets . With a world population of almost seven billion , thirteen confirmed deaths ? Why so much panic ? Undoubtedly more people have died from regular flu this year . Practice proper hygiene , avoid crowded placed , but do n't panic . This will be contained in the near future . So far I have not read or heard ANYTHING to justify the mass hysteria being whipped up by the media - we 're now being told this is just a normal , every day flu bug , so why is the WHO whipping it up with ` pandemic ' alerts and people talking about travel bans and ` shutting down ' services ? I 've got a holiday booked in Mexico in July and I 'm not going to let the threat of a bout of flu ruin it . The way to avoid a pandemic which is created by a virus that is not capable of jumping continents is to stop people from traveling . It 's simple , less migration , less impact by viruses such as swine flu . Oh and I saw a rather apt cartoon in one of the free papers on the train the other day , it 's caption was along the lines of `` and over to our health correspondent , who will make things sound 10 times worse than they really are '' ... Raven Morpheus , Braintree , Essex , UK Sounding the warning is a good preventive approach . However , over sounding it could have detrimental effects . If people are dissuaded from going about their regular businesses , obviously the economy would be harmed . Masks and gloves are a bit too much of a precautionary measure at this time as it may generate pandemonium . Simple hygiene procedures : washing ones hands regularly , covering mouth when coughing etc , should be encouraged . But most importantly paying proper attention to what , where and how one eats\\/drinks should be top priority . In cases were symptoms are clear , medical attention should be sought immediately . This virus is worrying . We have no way of knowing whether it will escalate into a more severe flu or not . My children are terrified that they may contract it and die from it , even though , so far no one in the UK has died from it . Too many people are being too complacent about it . Yes , we have had scares in the past with SARS and Bird Flu , but this one may be the pandemic scientist have been worried about ! It is a virus that wo n't distinguish between race , religion , age , sex or dietary preferences ! Daniel , Philadelphia , PA , USA If one good thing comes out of this situation , it will be educating those who do not cover their mouths\\/noses when sneezing\\/coughing . `` When all 's said and done , it 's merely flu . I 'd be worried if it were a serious illness , but flu ? `` Megan , Cheshire , UK `` Merely '' flu ? Influenza is and has always been a killer among vulnerable groups . The reason most do n't understand this is because so many people confuse flu with a bad cold or have only been mildly affected . If you 've ever had a serious dose of flu you 'll know the difference . I do n't want to play into the mass hysteria here , but I think to say that flu is not a serious illness is the sort of comment that only comes from people who have never had it . Real flu is not a bad cold with aches and mild pain , I have had real flu and I did n't know if I was going to make it . ALL kinds of flu are dangerous , respect that and follow good hygiene procedures . I think if you have had contact with anyone who has it , or is suspected of having it , stay home until the incubation time has passed as by the time the symptoms are showing you have already passed it on . Dumbest thing I 've heard yet . `` If you have a cold you ca n't get the flu . '' The govt are doing nothing to stop this spread . What is the point in the WHO when alls they say is that closing borders does not work , get on with it in your own country . No isolation for people coming in from Mexico ? What about those five ill men on the plane with the Honeymoon couple ? Why has Obama set up lots of camps in America and ordered thousands of troops to patrol America in Peacetime ? Its like they want us to catch it . Then they can gain control . Do n't trust the government to look after you , look after yourselves and your families . Nothing to worry about ? Why are the army coming home a month before schedule ? Its no good spouting about how many people die from normal flu , this strain may be mild now , but if it mutates or merges with normal flu in the winter months , it will make the normal flu season look like a walk in the park . Even if it does n't hit too hard in the spring , I am preparing for the winter . Stock up on supplies just in case . You never know ... Swine flu is a cause of concern to the world . Human Life value is much more important than any thing else on the planet earth . Mexico has a big challenge on hand . They need to fight this swine Flu with minimum damage to human race and come out as a winner as early as possible . God and world will help them in this mission . Me and my countries prayers and good wishes are with them and rest of the world where ever this Swine Flu has spread . I think it 's already too late ... we 're doomed ! In case anyone 's interested I 've built a bunker from old copies of the Daily Express and Government leaflets on how to avoid the flu ... why not come and join me ! Sorry , no pigs aloud . You ca n't avoid it . You might as well say how cab we hold back the sea with an egg cup ! You ca n't avoid other people and each person carries germs . Perhaps now , communication over the Broadband network will come into it 's own with people working from home . This will not prevent an epidemic but will at least cut down on the amount of germs moving about . Stephen Robertson , Dinnington , South Yorks I live in Scotland just three miles from Airdrie and I 'm not that worried about it as long as you keep good personal hygiene you should be fine and watch what you touch Railings in shopping centres desks people etc. . . I think we will have it under control soon I just hope that the death toll does not go up I hope I have helped . This is an excuse for martial law . It is made by the US government , tailored to their needs . A worse one is coming , mark my words . Whatever does n't kill us makes us stronger . I 'm looking forward to being stronger . By not talking about it so much - is the media crying wolf ? These types of flu come and go quite quite quickly - so the best way to control it is probably the Mexican way - stay at home for five days . Also , if this flu is like the 1918 flu , it was those with the most effective immune systems that died -LRB- by suffocating from the excessive mucus in the lungs -RRB- . It is only flu . we get this every year in the UK and people die from it . I fail to see what all the fuss is about . In the last 10 years I have lived in six countries which means extreme climate changes , water , food , bacteria and germs . I also spend six months attending to someone who was terminally ill - in hospitals and hospices daily ; yet more germs . I caught one snuffle and one cold during that period . I rarely get sick . Until this past Christmas when I caught a flu I am still recovering from , four months later . I was unable to last much longer than two hours at a time for the first two months . Prelude to swine fu ? Whatever this is , do not dismiss or disregard it . It 's not an average flu bug . If I had a weaker constitution I suspect I might be dead by now . I think everyone should take a leaf out Mexico 's book and shut down and stay at home at least then there be a less of a chance of spreading the infections to people Let nature take its own course . If this virus originated in Africa , no body would have noticed . This is a rich man 's hysteria because Mexico is a one of the rich man 's major destination . Deadly opportunistic virus like ebola come and go and that how nature operates . This virus was there and will be but now it got the conditions right to mushroom and with time will return to its normal state . What really concerns me is the fact that large pharmaceutical companies can greatly benefit from Pandemics , boosting product sales by a considerable amount . Surely much tighter restrictions\\/regulations should be put into place in a pandemic\\/epidemic situation . We have all seen what greed and lack of regulation can do to an industry and the negative impact on humanity . We can not allow the same to happen within the pharmaceutical industry . I 'm more worried about the pandemic stupidity which appears to have broken out over this issue . You are more at risk of dying in a car accident this weekend that of getting swine flu let alone dying of it but is anyone suggesting not getting into a car ? Would n't staying in Mexico be much safer than herding any more waiting travellers together into aluminium tubes , to infect each other as they fly half way round the world . Or is mass infection just inevitable and best get it over with -LRB- and cultivate the antibodies -RRB- sooner rather than later ? I plan to do nothing and hope the media finds a different story to sensationalise soon . The BBC may edit your comments and not all emails will be published .

The 25-year-old man , who is now in hospital after testing positive for the virus , had traveled from Mexico via Shanghai , Hong Kong 's leader said . Local TV footage showed police wearing masks guarding the hotel exits . Meanwhile , the UK joined Canada , Spain , Germany and the US in reporting person-to-person transmission of the virus . On Friday , French Health Minister Roselyne Bachelot said two people were infected with swine flu , France 's first confirmed cases . South Korea has also confirmed its first case , local media said . The announcements take to 16 the number of countries where swine flu has been confirmed . Mexico , where the outbreak began , has shut down parts of its economy for five days in a bid to curb the virus 's progress . Late on Friday , Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova announced the confirmed death toll from the virus had risen by one , to 16 . `` The mortality rate is n't as great as could be expected , '' said Mr Cordova . `` The majority of the deaths are women . '' Mexican officials say the spread of swine flu - suspected in more than 380 deaths - is slowing . International experts are more cautious - but one , Nancy Cox , chief of America 's Center for Disease Control 's influenza division , said the new virus lacked the traits that made the 1918 pandemic so deadly . `` We do not see the markers for virulence that were seen in the 1918 virus , '' she said . In cases outside Mexico the effects of the virus do not appear to be severe , although one death of a Mexican child has been confirmed in the US . The WHO has set its pandemic alert level at five - but says it has no immediate plans to move to the highest level of six . In Hong Kong , the authorities have raised the alert level to emergency but urged residents to carry on life as normal . US : One death , at least 141 confirmed cases New Zealand : 4 confirmed , 12 probable cases The Netherlands , Switzerland , Austria , Denmark , Hong Kong , South Korea : 1 confirmed case each Countries with confirmed cases of secondary transmission `` I stress we do n't need to panic . '' The Mexican man is said to be in a stable condition in Hong Kong 's Princess Margaret Hospital , after seeking treatment on Thursday night after becoming unwell . The Metropark Hotel in Wanchai district where he briefly stayed will be sealed off for seven days , health officials said , and the antiviral drug Tamiflu given to about 200 guests and 100 staff there . Medical staff wearing protective clothing were seen carrying boxes of equipment into the building . Efforts are also under way to trace people who traveled on the same flights as the Mexican , and taxi drivers with whom he came into contact . BBC China Editor Shirong Chen says confirmation that the man has tested positive for the virus has set alarm bells ringing beyond Hong Kong . Chinese Health Minister Chen Zhu said the virus was very likely to enter mainland China and urged the country to prepare for an outbreak , as millions start traveling over the May Day long weekend . In South Korea , a 51-year-old woman who had recently returned from Mexico was confirmed as the country 's first case , Yonhap news agency reported . Two other people are being tested for the virus , the agency said . Meanwhile , the authorities in Mexico hope a nationwide shut-down ordered from Friday , covering two public holidays and a weekend , will help curb the spread of the virus . SYMPTOMS - WHAT TO DO Swine flu symptoms are similar to those produced by ordinary seasonal flu - fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue If you have flu symptoms and recently visited affected areas of Mexico , you should seek medical advice If you suspect you are infected , you should stay at home and take advice by telephone initially , in order to minimize the risk of infection Some factories will stop production and schools are already closed . Residents have been urged to stay at home , but it is not clear how widely the shut-down order will be followed . The number of confirmed cases of swine flu infection in Mexico now stands at more than 300 , officials say . Mexican Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova said on Friday that three more deaths from swine flu had been confirmed , bringing the toll to 15 . Announcing the figure , Mr Cordova said that new cases of the virus were levelling off . But Dr Keiji Fukuda , acting assistant director general of the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- , said fluctuations were to be expected . The US announces that it will buy 13 million new courses of antiviral treatment and send 400,000 of them to Mexico A flight from Germany to Washington DC is diverted to Boston after a female passenger complains of flu-like symptoms An aide to US Energy Secretary Stephen Chu who helped arrange President Barack Obama 's recent trip to Mexico is being tested for swine flu , although the aide is said not to have been in contact with the president The head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is fine for people without flu symptoms to fly and use the subway , a day after Vice-President Joe Biden said he would advise his own family members against using public transport Denmark reports its first confirmed case of swine flu German authorities confirm that a nurse who treated a patient with swine flu also contracted the disease , in the first person-to-person transmission in the country Test results confirm the UK 's first person-to-person transmission of swine flu , in a friend of a couple from Scotland who were first in the country to be diagnosed with the virus Several countries have restricted travel to Mexico and many tour operators have canceled holidays . The WHO , meanwhile , says it will now call the virus influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- rather than swine flu - which it says is misleading as pork meat is safe and the virus is being transmitted from human to human .

As tests suggest the swine flu virus in Mexico may be less virulent than first feared , the BBC 's Stephen Gibbs in Mexico City looks at whether the response was an over-reaction . Pedro Aparicio stocked up on food so his family would not need to go outside Pedro Aparicio shows me his receipt from the supermarket . `` My wife thinks I spent too much , '' he says . Just before the partial shutdown of this country , the primary school teacher stocked up on everything he thinks he , his wife , and their young daughter Naomi will need for the next five days . `` Milk , beans , tuna fish , everything , '' he says , as he shows me his fully-stocked fridge . `` We are under quarantine . '' I remind him that the country 's partial shutdown of the economy does not include supermarkets . `` But we do n't want to go out , it might be risky , '' he says . A little over a week ago , this global health crisis was triggered when the Mexican government announced that it had detected a new strain of flu virus , and was closing all schools . It informed the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- that it suspected 60 people had already been killed by what soon became known as swine flu . So many deaths , after apparently a very short time , worried the Mexican authorities . `` We were spooked , '' one government official admitted to me . `` People seemed to be dying , and we did n't know why . '' It takes several days for tests for swine flu infection to be verified But when those first figures were released , the word `` suspected '' was crucial . Mexico was not certain at that stage that 60 people had been killed by swine flu . And it still does not know . It takes several days for tests to be properly verified . The current , confirmed , death toll stands at 16 . Initial data indicates that apparent mortality rate is comparable to that of seasonal flu . In the grandiose health ministry building in central Mexico City , I sat down with the country 's Health Minister , Jose Angel Cordova . As a nod to the enduring risk of infection , he prefers not to shake hands these days , instead offering the sleeve of his perfectly cut suit . I asked him whether he thought that his government had initially over-estimated the deadliness of the virus . `` Maybe , yes , '' he said . But he stressed that his experts were dealing with so many unknowns at that stage . What they did know was that the virus was potentially virulent and potentially deadly . Humans had no natural resistance to it . As they tried to work out who was dying of what and why , it is worth remembering some complicating facts , which are peculiar to Mexico . You can imagine that right now there is a lot of paranoia Most of the suspected fatalities were , and still are , in the capital , Mexico City . The city is at an elevation of 2,300 m -LRB- 7,540 ft -RRB- . It is home to almost 23 million people . Most days , a thick polluted smog can be seen hanging over the vast metropolis . Every year , swine flu or not , over half a million cases of respiratory problems are reported in the city . `` You can imagine that right now there is a lot of paranoia , '' says Dr Franciso Moreno , an expert in infectious diseases at the ABC medical center in Mexico City . `` About 90 % of the patients who have come to the hospital in the last few days have mild respiratory problems , from other causes . '' The deluge of suspected cases has made it extremely difficult to tell who has swine flu , and who does not . H1N1 has had consequences which few would have ever predicted . Something which possibly began in rural communities in Mexico has led to the quarantine of a luxury hotel in Hong Kong , and the slaughter of all the pigs in Egypt . And has this all been a global false alarm ? The Mexican health minister says it is still too early to say . He says that the threat of new viruses should not be under-estimated . As he spends the bank holiday weekend watching TV with his family , Pedro Aparicio says he thinks that the government did exactly the right thing . `` You ca n't be too careful , '' he says .

China says the steps it has taken are lawful and justified . Some 400 people have been quarantined in China since the virus was confirmed in a man who arrived from Mexico . Most are in the Metropark hotel in Hong Kong , where the infected man checked in , but the number also includes his fellow passengers . No-one else has displayed any symptoms .

Mexicans are being held in hotels and other sites across China , including in Shanghai and Hong Kong . There are reports of international flyers being tested for the virus Ambassador Jorge Guajardo said many of them had no connection with the Shanghai-Hong Kong flight which carried the infected Mexican man . `` We are objecting to the fact that they are holding Mexicans in isolation for fear that they might have the flu virus , even though they have no signs of having the flu virus , '' he said . Mr Guajardo tried to visit 10 Mexicans quarantined in Beijing 's Guo Men hotel but was denied access by Chinese officials . On Saturday Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa criticised China , along with Peru , Argentina , Cuba and Ecuador , for cutting flights to Mexico . She also urged Mexicans to avoid travel to China , accusing its government of discrimination for the quarantine measures . Chinese Ministry of Health spokesman Mao Qunan said extra protection was needed after the virus reached Hong Kong . `` The confirmation of this case clearly raised the risks of A-H1N1 flu entering our country , '' he said , quoted by state media .

All 1,200 pupils plus staff are receiving Tamiflu antiviral drugs . On Monday night , it emerged another school , Dolphin School in Battersea , London , had also been closed as a precaution - the fifth in the UK . A spokeswoman for NHS Wandsworth said that the two Dolphin pupils confirmed with swine flu were siblings of pupils at Alleyn 's . Since displaying symptoms , the pupils had not attended school . A message on the Dolphin School 's answering machine said : `` As a precautionary measure , the governors and senior team have decided to close the school for the next few days . `` You will be informed by the end of the week when children should return . If you or your family is unwell please contact your GP in the normal way . '' The two other new cases confirmed on Monday were adults who had visited Mexico . Alleyn 's , which is an independent school , has said it will be shut for at least seven days . Dr Ann Marie Connolly , director of public health at Southwark Primary Care Trust , said the symptoms were `` relatively mild '' and all five Alleyn 's pupils were responding well to treatment . She said the source of the outbreak was being investigated and all the contacts of each of the pupils were being offered antiviral treatment . Headmaster Colin Diggory is contacting exam boards to reschedule some exams , he said in a statement on the school website .

Swine flu has closed three other schools - South Hampstead High School in north west London , Downend in South Gloucestershire and Paignton Community and Sports College in Devon . Classrooms at South Hampstead have been closed until at least Thursday after a 14-year-old girl from Barnet in year nine was diagnosed with the virus . Antiviral drugs have been been offered to her year group and special arrangements are being made for upcoming exams . In a letter to parents on its website , the independent school said the girl was `` at home and well '' . An 11-year-old girl from south-west London who had visited the US as well as a man from Ayrshire are also amongst those who have contracted swine flu . The Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- said the 11-year-old 's school will remain open as the child `` did not attend school while symptomatic '' . Several Britons are still under quarantine in a Hong Kong hotel after a guest there became China 's first confirmed case of swine flu . Eddie Sweeney and his wife Terry , from Buckinghamshire , checked into the Metropark Hotel on Thursday for two days but were told on Friday they and about 300 other guests would be confined to the building for a week . Mr Sweeney told BBC News : `` Effectively we 're in our rooms , apart from going to collect meals . Some of us are using the stairs as a way of exercise . Otherwise we 're confined .

Cases have been confirmed in Newcastle , Oxfordshire , Devon , Merseyside , Worcestershire , Gloucestershire , as well as London and Central Scotland . A six-year-old girl in Oxfordshire diagnosed with the flu has made a full recovery , doctors have told the BBC . Health chiefs are awaiting the results of around 300 more tests . Environment Secretary Hilary Benn told GMTV the outbreak was less severe than first thought , but people should `` play safe '' . Two previous cases had seen Britons falling ill without having traveled to Mexico . Barry Greatorex , 43 , from South Gloucestershire , had been in contact with a traveller to the country .

Viruses increased and decreased in activity , it said , and it was too early to tell whether the outbreak had peaked where it emerged in Mexico . Meanwhile in the UK , from 5 May all households are to receive leaflets giving information about the virus and advice on how to prevent its spread as five schools across the country remain shut after pupils fell ill . In Britain , the number of confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus has risen to 27 . What precautions are you taking to prevent the spread of swine flu ?

If the virus only produces mild symptoms why is so much effort being put into containing it ? Surely it would be better for most people to have this mild version rather than the catch it during wave two when we are told the virus will be much worse ? The first British couple affected by the swine flu caught it when on their honeymoon in Cancun , how is that possible when there has not been a single case of swine flu in Cancun ? Besides , by their own words they presented normal flu symptoms and magically they were told it was swine flu . Every year 36,000 people do die in the US only for seasonal influenza ... so what 's the real deal here ?! Make everyone who has it stays at home until they get better ! And wash your hands to stop it spreading . Also , it would just be gross anyway if you did n't wash your hands . Here in Wisconsin we have 3 confirmed cases -LRB- no deaths -RRB- of H1N1 flu and the governor has declared a state wide health emergency . Many closed schools and general panic and hysteria on the TV and radio . Meanwhile 2 people die daily of HIV in the state and in Washington DC the death toll is about 41 people daily . This , apparently , constitutes nothing . Get some perspective for goodness sake . This is a mild flu and would have gone unnoticed but for the Mexican health ministers hysterical over playing the case and WHO cynically using it as an opportunity to test their preparedness for a real emergency . Why not provide a universal call number such as 944 so that a suspect is seen by a Health Organization at once and given Tamiflu if required ? George Wu , Chula Vista , U.S. . It would seem that some think its nothing to be worried about , and they 're right , concerned would be a better word . But for those who think this is scaremongering , I wonder if these same people would be the people who would want heads to roll if nothing had be done to halt it . I 'm not from a clinical background , but I do know that a pandemic has been expected for quite some time , in fact it 's long overdue . The bottom line is , we should let our guard down until we know for certain its not going to be a pandemic . None - as there is nothing I can do about it . I already use a handkerchief , tissues , etc. . This has never stopped me getting flu & probably not stopped me from passing it on . The high death toll in 1918 was a consequence of 4 years of war and resulting stress , poor health care and diet . While sympathising with those who have died , most who catch the virus live . There will not be 20 million or more deaths this time . We are overreacting to a false threat . I returned from Cancun on the 17th April just before all the panic happened . I am perfectly healthy and went on holiday as I needed some sunshine to recover from a series of colds over the winter . We probably take more virus into Mexico than we bring out . Cortez and his army brought Mexico the cold virus first . I 'm soon going to repatriate to the USA . While some countries are over-reacting to this swine flu epidemic there is no hiding the fact this virus will spread irrespective of draconian airport procedures , quarantining measures or culling pigs . It is important for these various governments to act responsibly and disseminate accurate information to their citizens instead of creating panic and clear cases of discrimination against Mexican citizens .

I saw a big painted sign on a piece of machinery the other day that said , if I recall correctly , `` finger trapping hazard '' . The first sign of frost and someone will pop up to remind us that ice can be slippy and we should be careful when walking along . The weather warms up and there is a well-meaning reminder that sunburn can be a bit of a problem . It 's the same story on aeroplanes . `` Do take care when opening the overhead locker '' . I am sure there are people who have thrown one open without a second thought and suffered concussion after an unexpected meeting with a heavy overnight case . But it appears I am not alone in having to suppress a rebellious and irresponsible response . Michael Bywater , who wrote the excellent book Big Babies on just this phenomenon , remembers the moment he became aware he was being treated like a toddler - and inevitably then wanted to behave like one . `` Walking from the aeroplane to baggage reclaim , I idly started to notice the notices . There were , I soon realized , almost a hundred of the things -LRB- not counting advertisements -RRB- between jetway and carousel , all admonishing , warning , ticking me off for something I had n't done , had no intention of doing , had n't even thought of doing until I saw the notice . Voices shouted at me about the moving walkway ; bleepers bleeped ; lights flashed ; strange obsessions took root . Having been forbidden to do so , I found myself yearning terribly to take photographs in the customs hall . I wanted to find a child , specifically so that I could allow it to ride on my baggage trolley . But most of all I realized that I was being treated like a big baby ; and not just there , but everywhere . '' The `` duty of care '' that organizations have to their clients and customers has been translated into endless bits of homespun counsel . I am sure there are lawyers who advise firms that it makes perfect sense to put the warning `` this product may contain nuts '' ... on a packet of nuts . The trouble is that we come to expect authority to tell us how to be careful . And if we are foolhardy , we then blame `` them '' rather than ourselves . We must all learn how to assess risk . How to adjust our behavior to avoid significant threats . When it is safe to cross the road . But we have proved ourselves pretty poor at judging the chances that something bad will happen and increasingly rely on others to judge risk for us . So , elderly people may lead less fulfilling lives because they are encouraged to overestimate the risk from violent crime . Children are bred in captivity because parents read so much about the -LRB- very low -RRB- risk from sexual predators . No-one in authority wants to be open to the charge that they did n't take enough care . But few worry about the charge that they did n't take enough risks . Without risk , life is just existence . They say `` you ca n't be too careful '' . But I worry that you can . At 5:49 pm on 05 May 2009 , GiniaHickley wrote : I like it when you get hot drinks from fast food outlets which say `` Caution .

Their concern is not that harm may come to you , but that you do n't hold them accountable for this harm . They do n't care if you drop dead , as long as nobody sues them for it . Everybody moans about the proliferation of litigation , but this cold-hearted capitalist approach is the very reason why these ` no win , no fee ' lawyer firms are increasingly successful . They recognize that if employers are going to use the letter of the law , rather than the spirit of it , then their clients have to respond in kind .

How hot is a hot drink ? Hot enough to drink as soon as you get it ? Hot enough to stay hot as you carry it from the cafe to wherever ? Hot enough for it to still be hot as you work your way through the crossword ? Hot enough for it to strip the skin of a child 's head ? You do n't like warnings .

However , one traveller quarantined in Beijing told Mexican radio that soldiers were guarding the hotel gates . `` This is like a kidnapping for us , '' Mirna Elisa Berlanga said , while Mexico has issued strongly-worded statements over the past few days condemning Beijing 's response . Meanwhile , another diplomatic row could be brewing after Canada asked China to explain why a group of at least 20 Canadian students had been quarantined in the north-eastern town of Changchun . Canada said none of the students had shown any flu symptoms . The US embassy said on Tuesday that four American citizens had also been quarantined in China due to swine flu fears . Speaking on Mexican TV late on Monday evening President Felipe Calderon praised the country 's precautions against swine flu and said children would soon begin returning to schools closed at the height of the scare . Chinese authorities are taking no risks with the quarantined Mexicans Large parts of Mexico 's economy have been shut down since 1 May in an effort to stem the spread of the virus . `` Thousands of lives have been saved not only in Mexico but in the world , '' Mr Calderon said . Hailing the `` energy '' with which Mexicans tackled the previously-unknown virus , Mr Calderon said the nation 's `` enormous effort '' was helping the country avoid a major tragedy . `` The number of deaths recorded has notably decreased , and the numbers of cases of people infected with the virus has also reduced . '' Pupils without symptoms of flu will begin returning to school on 7 May , the president said , adding that school buildings would also undergo a deep clean to limit chances of contamination . Mexico will also begin a worldwide effort to repair the nation 's tarnished international image in the hope of convincing tourists from around the world to continue visiting Mexico , including reducing entry and exit taxes for tourists .

The leaflet campaign is the first of its kind since the 1980s The leaflets also advise people to set up networks of neighbors , friends or relatives who would pick up medicine and other supplies in the event of someone having to stay at home due to flu . England 's chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson told BBC Radio 4 's Today program that the last time a leaflet had been sent to every home in the UK was after the outbreak of the Aids virus in the 1980s . `` It reinforces the basic hygiene principles that can play a very important part in halting the spread and reducing the risk to individuals , '' Sir Liam added .

Five of those diagnosed were year seven pupils at Alleyn 's School in Dulwich , London , which announced it would close by for at least seven days .

Scottish Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon told a press conference that no health minister could ignore World Health Organisation warnings about the possible impact of a flu pandemic . `` It 's absolutely right that we prepare for the worst here , that 's what we 've been doing - not that we 're necessarily expecting the worst , but we are preparing for that because it 's the right and responsible thing to do , '' she said .

It reports there has been a 50 % increase in the number of detected so-called `` zombie '' computers since 2008 . The true number of newly hijacked PCs is likely to be higher than those detected by McAfee alone . The figures come as a report from Deloitte said a global approach to cyber-security was needed . `` Doing nothing is not an option , '' said Deloitte 's Greg Pellegrino . Everything that depended on cyberspace face unprecedented risks , said Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu -LRB- DTT -RRB- . `` This issue is moving so quickly , and with so much at stake economically and in terms of safety and security for people , we do n't have 100 years to figure this out , '' explained Mr Pellegrino , who is a global public sector industry leader at DTT . McAfee also revealed that the United States now hosted the world 's largest percentage of infected computers at 18 % with China a not too distant second with just over 13 % . `` The massive expansion of these botnets provides cyber-criminals with the infrastructure they need to flood the web with malware , '' said Jeff Green , senior vice-president of McAfee . `` Essentially , this is cyber-crime enablement . '' The DTT findings revealed a growing awareness of the role the internet plays in so many different aspects of our lives from security to commerce and from transportation to communication . Better cyber-security measures will benefit global commerce , says the report `` We are seeing this change from protecting the internet to a conversation about how we succeed and prosper in cyberspace , '' Mr Pellegrino told the BBC . `` Security spending is growing at a rate never seen before while the threat environment is growing at a pace of 40 % a year . `` In terms of volume and severity of incidents , the math does n't work and we have to come up with a different approach that requires public and private sectors working together , '' Mr Pellegrino said . `` We are talking about daily living , '' said fellow author Gary McAlum , who is a retired US Air Force colonel and senior manager of security and privacy services at Deloitte . `` There is a lot of discussion about the economy and the military and the public and private sector , but we have now reached a sense of urgency about the interconnectedness of all these areas . '' That view was echoed by a member of the US military top brass who just gave evidence to a branch of the House Armed Services Committee . `` Our economy , the nation 's critical infrastructure , and many of our military operations depend on unfettered access to cyberspace , '' said Lt Gen Keith Alexander , the director of the National Security Agency -LRB- NSA -RRB- who also heads the Pentagon 's new Cyber Command . `` Maintaining freedom of action in cyberspace in the 21st Century is as inherent to US interests as freedom of the seas was in the 19th Century , and access to air and space in the 20th Century . '' He has called for the creation of a digital warfare force for the future and has stated that the US needs to reorganise its offensive and defensive cyber-operations . The Deloitte study included interviews conducted with government officials and industry experts from around the world . While it revealed a patchwork approach to the problem it also showed it was one that was gaining prominence . There are 32,000 suspected cyber-attacks every 24 hours , says the NSA `` We were very pleased that there was a similar tone and awareness and leadership effort coming from different countries across the world , '' Mr Pellegrino said . `` Clearly this particular issue has a different context depending on where you are in the world . We can not afford to go backwards . '' In America , President Obama has made the issue of cyber-security a priority . Shortly after taking office he ordered a 60-day review that has now been delivered to his desk . It is understood the release of the review has been delayed by the ongoing H1N1 swine flu crisis . When the report is made public , it is expected that the president will also announce his choice for cyber-security tsar to lead the charge . While the Deloitte research said security in Asia-Pacific needed to `` catch up '' it noted that the United Kingdom was in the process of writing a national cyber strategy with an emphasis on public-private partnership . On the continent , the European Commission has urged member states to co-ordinate on cyber-security measures , while in Latin America the report authors conclude that there is a `` diversity of approaches '' . Canada has completed its own cyber-security review and this year will be implementing the National Cyber-Security Strategy as well as creating a new Directorate of Cyber-Security with a mandate to engage closely with the private sector . Despite all these efforts , the Deloitte authors point out that time is of the essence . `` Not only do we have to take action , we do n't have enough time , '' warned Mr Pellegrino . Mr McAlum agreed and said mapping a clear strategy was crucial . `` We need to get our house in order first so that we can interact with the rest of the world with one voice , with clear roles and responsibilities aligned .

Manny Pacquiao was scheduled to return home on Friday , after his knockout victory against Britain 's Ricky Hatton in Las Vegas at the weekend . But Philippine Health Secretary Francisco Duque urged the champion to postpone his flight . There is no suggestion that the boxer actually has swine flu . But his fight last weekend was in Las Vegas , where confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus have been reported . The health secretary told reporters he wanted Mr Pacquiao to delay his triumphal return to the Philippines until at least next Tuesday . Mr Duque explained that it takes about five days for swine flu symptoms to appear , and he was hoping Mr Pacquiao and his entourage would impose `` self-quarantine '' until then , to be absolutely sure they had not contracted the virus . The Philippines was due to hold a `` national day of celebration '' for Mr Pacquiao this Friday , in honor of his win . But Mr Duque said there were concerns that the motorcade , which was due to drive through Manila in celebration , could pose a risk of spreading the virus . There are no confirmed swine flu cases in the Philippines , although some patients are under observation . According to the latest figures from the World Health Organization , nearly 1,500 people around the globe have been infected with swine flu , most of them in Mexico . Two fatalities have been reported in the United States . "}, {"uid": "963", "dct": "2009-05-06", "dates": [null, null], "text": "A school in London is shut after pupils there tested positive The World Health Organization says 1,490 people around the world have so far contracted the H1N1 swine flu virus . What are your concerns about the virus ? Some 26 people have died of the virus in Mexico , but only two fatalities have been recorded outside that country . In the UK , delivery begins of specially-produced leaflets offering advice on swine flu and advice on how to prevent its spread This debate is now closed . A selection of your comments appear below . We are having serious technical problems with the usual Have Your Say service which our engineers are working to fix . A selection of your comments to this debate appear below . We apologise for any inconvenience . The government 's leaflets are on about the same level as the governments instructions in the Raymond Brigg 's children 's books , to seal the windows in case of a nuclear attack . Using a tissue wo n't stop a pandemic ? but then there have meant to be so many of those , have n't there ? Of course , the leaflets will waste a lot more of my money , and yours . There have been two suspected cases of Swine Flu in this city and one in the vicinity -LRB- Cameron County at the southern end of the state of Texas -RRB- . The local school district has canceled all classes until May 10 , the local university campus -LRB- University of Texas at Brownsville - Texas Southmost College -RRB- is still open but it is under `` health guard '' , some students , staff and even indoor food vendors , are wearing masks . The atmosphere is nervous in the lower Rio Grande Valley since just across the border lies Mexico , where a more serious condition related to swine flu is occurring . Just arrived in India on flight from UK . They are taking lots of precautions - spraying plane internally before landing , medical questionnaires and interviews with doctors , everyone at airport wearing facemasks . Makes you realize we 're ones at center of epidemic . We ca n't avoid a pandemic but we can make things easier for ourselves whilst it is going on . Pandemic only means it is global and established in communities . It does n't mean it is serious . It spreads like this because it is a new virus , a mutating virus . That 's what makes it unknown and all we can do is be prepared . I think there is no overreaction on the flu so far . I 'm just glad I live in a country which has the resources to manage the situation unlike other poorer countries . Still these figures are less than the normal winter flu bugs that hit us every winter ! I am not panicking it is common sense and good hygiene practices ! I did smile today as all hand alcohol gel in my local supermarket had been sold out ! What does that tell you ? It is amazing to witness the negative repercussions for a country that acted responsibly towards a world threat . It is unbelievable that China has treated Mexican people as if they were disposable trash . It seems that nobody remembers that they hid the bird flu for several weeks until it got out of control . This situation only demonstrates the lack of knowledge about epidemic crisis management from these and many other countries . Everybody should rise their voices and congratulate Mexico and its people for their commitment and responsibility . The WHO Says that 1,200 people worldwide have contracted it ? While their own website says that a child dies of Malaria EVERY 30 SECONDS . Why is so much attention being paid to this ` pandemic ' is it because it is something we might catch in our sanitized developed world ? I am so angry about the way the communist Chinese authorities have treated the Mexican citizens that simply happened to be in China at the time of the outbreak . How dare they lock up and confine a load of innocent people who , even after testing , proved negative for even a common cold let alone Human Flu . Samantha Mace , Mexico City , Mexico It might be too early to say that swine flu is `` mild '' , but clearly it 's not as deadly as `` normal '' flu . Hundreds of thousands die each year from normal flu , but a significantly smaller amount of people have died directly as a result of swine flu . Deaths in Mexico have apparently been caused by poor health care causing complications , yet all we see are sensationalist headlines and irresponsible press releases from organizations that should be trying to minimize the impact it 's having on our lives . Paul Trundle , Wakefield , West Yorkshire Ooh , specially produced leaflets - well that 's us saved then , eh ? Why go to all the trouble of stopping the disease entering the country and quarantining those who 've come back from infected parts when you can distribute specially produced leaflets ? Honestly ... I do n't think we can avoid it , it just something that will happen at some point . What worries me is if the virus is only mild , is dishing out tamiflu like its going out of fashion going to help if it a -RRB- becomes resistant and b -RRB- becomes less mild . Same happened with antibiotics ! I am 12 and I feel the media have over-reacted about Swine Flu . People should not be as worried as they are , there are people at my school thinking that you can catch Swine flu from pigs , which is not true . News programs , newspapers etc. have definitely responded more strongly than is necessary and I think you need to reassure people that this is not a crisis . We ca n't avoid it ; it 's already here and already the ` spin machine ' is in action to re-assure us that adequate arrangements have been made to protect us ! If you believe that , well !!! It seems to me that the advice of the WHO is eminently sensible . There is no reason for panic but , at the same time , none for complacency . It may turn out that this particular flu strain is no more life-threatening than the strains that kill people every year all over the world . The extreme reactions such as slaughtering pigs or banning their import are obviously not based on scientific or medical grounds , but political ones . It seems to me that reducing peoples contact with each other is the best way forward . Maybe by discouraging large scale events and reducing the working week temporarily would reduce chances of a pandemic . But with capitalist ideas prominent in society these changes would never happen . Would n't we all be better off catching it while it 's mild and partially inoculating ourselves against it before it mutates into something more serious -LRB- if in fact it does rather than going the other way -RRB- ? Keep healthy with reasonable diet and exercise . Wait for next panic inducing national crisis but meanwhile get on with life . Why has the government wasted thousands if not hundreds of thousands of pounds on leaflets , I think the country already knows about Swine Flu , why not make an educational advert and show it on the BBC repeatedly , direct to peoples homes , will be passively taken on board , we all are aware of the steps to be taken following a stroke after being bombarded by the FACE adverts , these leaflets are a massive waste of money and a gimmick by the government to win support . Leaflets are a waste of time . If people sneeze and cough into their hands , or in the air , a leaflet wo n't change their filthy habits . No wonder Britain has so many cases of STD , dirty public . Better issue tissues and slap a heavy fine on people caught having ` unprotected ' coughs and sneezes ! No offence BBC but if people want to avoid the epidemic of swine flu then they should avoid reading any media related articles about it and have the common sense -LRB- and the pamphlet being distributed -RRB- to look after themselves and see a GP if actually necessary . As long as we have these slave-driving , despicable employers who insist on ill employees coming in to work to spread the ` love ' , we will have the potential for a dangerous epidemic . Any employer caught mistreating an employee who is trying not to spread this disease should have their company closed down in reprisal . What a lot of rubbish about swine flu . . How many people die each day from ordinary flu ... It 's a farce ... whipped up by the media . . Basically news programs are on 24 hrs a day ... just looking for something to get their teeth into ... The drug companies must be rubbing their hands in glee . . Millions more in their pockets ... The British public are so gullible . . see it in the papers and news and its true ... I DESPAIR What a complete farce . How many people have died of ordinary flu ? How many people have died from malaria , or leprosy or the common cold . There 's 6 billion people in the world and we are being swamped by the government and media over less than 200 deaths . My wife was asked by a checkout assistant at the supermarket if she was sure she wanted to buy the sausages and bacon she had put on the conveyor belt because of the risk of swine flu . She went on to inform her that she and her boyfriend had boycotted all forms of pig meat as a precaution . Perhaps the media have blown this flu out of proportion and are starting to needlessly worry some people ? We should not over-react , stop sensationalising it . In a few weeks we will all be saying `` What was the fuss ? '' I suspect a cry wolf scenario will develop over the years to come . Eric de la Harpe , Reading , UK Own shares in some pharmaceutical companies ? Then it 's good news so stop worrying . This outbreak of more `` dangerous-than normal flu '' will be a nice boost their income . It 's good to know that these large corporations know how to boost sales in a recession . It is time for people to take some personal responsibility and develop good hygiene practice . Sadly lacking in many I see using public toilets and not washing their hands . Coughing , sneezing and worst of all spiting in public places . Since influenza spreads through aerosols and contact with contaminated surfaces , it is important to persuade people to cover their mouths while sneezing and to wash their hands regularly Good personal health and hygiene habits , like hand washing , are reasonably effective in avoiding and minimizing influenza . It wo n't stop it but will limit the spread of the virus . Please do n't spread your germs In the US this flu has been mild and the few infected recover quickly . I would guess that where there is widespread poverty and malnutrition this flu could be far more fatal . Some scientists are saying that a pandemic starts with a mild outbreak in the spring , abates , and then comes roaring back . But this is speculation . Looking at the current facts on the ground there is no fear of a pandemic , at least not in North America -LRB- including Mexico -RRB- . The chief cautions would help : avoid eating at restaurants and fast food places , wash your hands often , do not shake hands , avoid having people over to the house . Above all , stay home when sick . Let 's hope that no-one in the leaflet distribution depot has swine flu ! More seriously , is this media panic not a glorious opportunity to postpone June 's council elections ? If , as is now believed , this swine flu virus is mild , I think the level of panic is unnecessary . Surely , if it is mild , let it spread through the population so that immunity to a more serious outbreak predicted for the autumn can be built up . Is this too simple an attitude ? You Sneeze then go and wash your hands . But having washed your hands you then turn off the tap that you last touched with your flu hands and re contaminate your self . We need surgeon style Scrub Up taps that you operate with your elbows . We should NOT be trying to avoid contact with this flu ! It is very mild and by being exposed , we may well get some immunity if it comes back later and more virulent . This is another `` hype '' to make news and to help the governments of the world get away from the money crisis Is this a very strange and rare co-incidence or was it man made ? How can four strains of a virus co-mingle from different continents and become swine flu ? Not the hand of god but the hand of man getting an experiment wrong or is it more sinister ? No it 's natural . The Flu 's RNA is in 8 pieces , so if a single cell is infected by more than one strain , those pieces get mixed up and a new strain is formed . It 's totally natural . In readiness for the severe bout of flu which is destined to hit us this winter , why do n't Companies , Schools , Train Stations , Airports , Bus Stations and anywhere people congregate , have bottles of the gel used in hospitals at strategic points , so that anyone passing these points can use the gel . It just may cut down on the numbers of people who may catch any strain of flu . A pandemic in the US would be 30 million sick and 3 million dying . To date none , zero , zilch US citizens have died and only a very small hospital size group may or may not be sick . This is just more global warming and Y2K `` consensus '' parading as pseudo science nonsense . Almost everyone has had flu at sometime in their lives and yes it can kill the weak and older people but we live with that on a daily basis . This flu is no different and no more deadly so why all the fuss and media hype - Ever heard of crying wolf ? I had a friend at school who was always off because he was ill . His mum sanitised everything and he had to wear coats every time he left the house , even in summer . I wonder why he was off all the time ??????? Have not all previous pandemics in Britain occurred at a time before the Second World War , when we were less knowledgeable about transmission and hygiene ?? Not worried at all . This is just the latest variant of the ` we are all going to die horribly ' syndrome that seems to regularly infect people for no logical reason ... nuclear war , new ice age , global warming , Sars , Aids , Millennium bug , foot and mouth , bird flu ... I should be dead many times already if the media are to be believed . Swine flu has killed less people than die in road accidents over one weekend , so how about getting a sense of proportion ? it 's not exactly Ebola is it ! Iran or North Korea getting A-bombs is far more worrying but nothing is being done . I 'm presuming that this is largely an ingenious plan to stimulate the world economy through creating a rush on medicine and medical products . After all , who is going to have the greatest ability to produce these - largely the wealthy countries who are `` suffering '' most through the recession . Yes people have died and that is awful , but I have yet to see any evidence that the problem is as big as we are told it is . If I do , then I will take ` precautions ' . I already wash my hands and sneeze into tissues - it 's all basic commonsense ! Let 's all have swine ` flu parties now so that we have some immunity for when the more severe form strikes in autumn and winter . Jo - As an Infection Control Nurse you should allay the fears of your children better than you seemingly have been doing . As for those saying that there should be mass fear because ` some ' people may be more susceptible . This is like saying no one should cross a road because some people are more susceptible to getting knocked over . If you 're got a problem with your sight\\/balance ... do n't go crossing roads unaided . If you 're more susceptible to flu , take better precautions yourself . I think that it is over the top and we should all just calm down about it . We should take it with a pinch of salt . Is it more dangerous than , for instance : street gangs ? Or drink and driving ? Plus , if we want to do something about mutant , virulent and resistant viruses , how about treat the problem at the source ? For instance take a good look at animal farming and how it is done ? I heard that Swine Flu contains the viral code fragments from : Swine flu from Europe Swine flu from Asia Is this a very strange and rare co-incidence or was it man made ? How can four strains of a virus co-mingle from different continents and become swine flu ? Not the hand of god but the hand of man getting an experiment wrong or is it more sinister ? The question should not be ` can we ' , but ` should we ' : Surely the flu organism has aright to share this planet with us - are we mercilessly exterminating it just because it does n't have a furry coat and big brown eyes ? Equal rights for flu bugs ! It seems we already have , 1000 cases worldwide , 20 dead and the few that caught it had no more than a sniffle . What a load of sensationalist rubbish . Still it kept the real news off the screen did n't it . I think that all the schools in the area should close where the infection has been verified . When the infection has gone they should return . Kids mix with other kids from other schools which will tend to be local to there area so there is a good chance to spread those schools too Do we really need the government to tell us to wash our hands , cover our mouth when we cough and use a hankie when we sneeze ? I am more concerned about what is going on whilst the government is blowing this out of proportion . What do they not want us to know ? Is it really necessary to send a leaflet to every home in the UK ? How much is this costing ? It seems to be such a worthless exercise . Many of the great pandemics in history spread because humans did not change their behavior . It may seem we are overreacting now , but better now than if it mutates or claims more lives , just as flu occasionally does . Firstly The 1918 Flu pandemic killed less than 1 % of those it infected - it just infected a lot of people . I for one think they should let this ` mild ' version run rampant - so that if it reappears in a more hostile form we will already have immunity . Less than 200 have died due to this flu - in the same period over 5000 have died from ` seasonal ' flu . Psycho B Delic , Brighton , UK It is strange that when I looked on have your say yesterday there were many recent posts talking about how out of hand the media had become with the way they no longer report news but hype and distort it . Interesting that now the Have your say page is ` having technical ' problems and the recent post the BBC have decided to display while the tech problems are sorted out are not these same posts ... Come on BBC news get back to being a decent news provider not a gossip and fear creator This is just the excuse that Governments need to bring in more draconian measures to ` protect ' the public whilst eroding their civil liberties . Stop listening to the hype and get a life . This is flu and some people will die from it but the overwhelming majority will survive with no lasting effects - just like any other flu . WHO has unfortunately blown this one completely out of proportion and as a result , this panic is affecting markets around the world . In the economic climate in which we currently are , bodies like the UN , OECD etc. should be extremely careful in making dire pronouncements . Unfortunately the UN type pundits are not directly affected by market vacillations and they frequently jeopardize others lives by their `` erudite predictions '' . I hope there is a law against these people . Yawn , yawn , yawn . Mild flu grabs the headlines and everyone is making a meal of it . Firstly , I think everyone should adhere to proper hygiene that means using warm\\/hot water and washing hands with soap\\/anti-bacterial liquid handwash , do n't just run your hands under a cold tap that is n't going to kill germs that may be on your hands & under finger nails . Perhaps some hand gel through every door with the information leaflet on avoiding spreading germs ? I think this country has poor hygiene standards to start with . The amount of times I have been in a public toilet and watched in horror as women leave without washing their hands ! It does not inspire confidence in the general publics ability to take extra precautions if they already find basic hygiene a challenge ?! Some shock tactics would heighten peoples awareness . Could we place pictures of heighlighted germs on taps and door handles in public toilets ? The TV ads and the leaflet , what a complete waste of money , telling us things like use a tissue if you sneeze . What a dumbed down country we have become . Totally overblown and a fuss about nothing Easy way to avoid the pandemic : Forget about it . Even if it reaches your area , the chances of catching it by person-to-person infection are very low . Even then , just go and get some Tamiflu and go home . Chris Horner , Wakefield West Yorkshire People could stop being so selfish and irresponsible when they have a couch or cold and try using a hanky ! They could also stay home to avoid passing it on . I think it is up to countries how they curb the spread of swine flu . These governments have one mission in mind which is to prevent the transmission of the swine flu . WHO is not helping in any way by telling governments not to close borders . i mean we are scared for our lives and hence look up to our governments to protect us . this means they have to do anything to protect us and if that means closing borders then that has to be done . At the moment swine flu does n't seem dangerous outside Mexico . Would it not be better if we catch it now , -LRB- rather than in winter when they say it will be worse , -RRB- so we then develop immunity and do n't get it when its a worse form ? Does anyone know why authorities are not doing this ? The Media , as usual , have blown it completely out of proportion . On Monday night 's BBC news there was a report of a ` MASS breakout ' of flu at a school that had subsequently closed . Were 600 pupils infected ? NO - there were 6 pupils infected !!! Since when has 6 pupils in a group of a few hundred or more constituted MASS ? Try giving us the facts instead of a deluge of spin and hype . My advice would be to switch of the TV news and cancel your newspapers - it 's no worse than any other flu that we 've been exposed to ! Here in Hong Kong , the response has been quick and very efficient . Some may say an over-reaction by the people , or scaremongering by the government . However in a country which suffered so badly during SARS and one where H5N1 flu has been encountered , who can blame anyone ? There are more people on the streets in masks but they 're a fairly common sight anyway . Otherwise people do n't seem overly concerned and it is business as usual . Richard Ackroyd , Tung Chung , Hong Kong Sneezing into 1 . a tissue or 2 . ones sleeve are essential habits left over from the time of the Black plague . In China they also take off their outdoor shoes and wear indoor slippers , also provided for guests . It was learned by hard experience in the land where both swine and bird flu originate . Would n't this be another useful habit to encourage here ? We need to have this flu if our immune systems are to remain strong . If we insist on living in near sterile conditions we are making ourselves more vulnerable . The more pertinent question is `` How do we contain the media driven panic ? '' You 're supposed to be a public service - not a scaremonger\\/gossip machine . Did you know that , worldwide -LRB- over the last 12 months -RRB- , over 5000 people have died from ` seasonal ' flu ... Man up . I live in Hong Kong and was here during the SARS outbreak . Both that and the Swine Flu have been horribly over blown - the reaction has been extreme and costly . There are flu outbreaks every year . In the US 36,000 people every year year die of it . In that context this outbreak is insignificant . Why the big fuss about this particular strain ? We probably ca n't avoid spread of an infection that could be brought in from any country in the world now - so we should not try to quarantine any suspected infected person . all we can do is take sensible precautions to minimize spread within families and workplaces . It is only flu ! The mortality rate is not known but appears to be very low and most people are not seriously ill . lets have some perspective from media reports please . Throwing the full might of precautions put in place to fight a ` deadly ' H1N5 flu on a milder H1N1 flu seems wastful and costly . There will be carnage if this outbreak is followed by Bird flu and all the anti-virals have been used up or anti-viral resistance gets passed on to H1N5 . The `` pandemic '' scare serves to keep many highly paid doctors and scientists in jobs at flu crisis centres all over the world . If there are no scares they loose their job , so we are guaranteed a good scare every couple of years -- remember the bird flu which was going to kill us all . The trouble is that to keep their taxpayer funded jobs , they ruin the livelihoods of thousands of people , poultry farmers and pig farmers spring to mind . They should be made to pay their salaries in reparation . If this happened I and sure the number of scares would drop drastically . I am astonished and disgusted by the number of people who sneeze without covering their noses and mouths . I thought this was something everyone learned at their mother 's knee . I 'd like to know why spitting is also not listed this a known way of some viruses being spread . I can not see this mentioned . Nothing is that brilliant here in the UK we have people wandering around yet a third world country takes more proactive approach with scanners . . ! Mark E said the the high death toll in 1918 was `` a consequence of 4 years of war and resulting stress , poor health care and diet . '' This is not true . The 1918 flu killed the strongest people . This was because the 1918 flu caused the immune system to overreact : those with strong and healthy immune systems overreacted most and died . The weaker members of society , ironically , had a better chance of surviving . I am not taking any precautions . I have just as much chance of getting ordinary flu as I am of getting swine flu and if what everybody is saying is true it wont be any worse . Where was all the precaution awareness in winter when the flu was going around then ? People still became ill and hospitalised where was all the government warning then ? The same preventative measures apply as well . At this time , the virus is relatively benign . The only way to be protected is to get immunity . In the great Spanish Flu , those that got it the first time around were much more likely to survive the following waves . Quite frankly , I would really like to be exposed to this virus now while the symptoms are mild , so that I can develop immunity . I 'm beginning to think that the hysterical isolation of all infected persons may be what will make future waves more lethal From what experts say , the most worrying possible outcome would be , if the strain mutated into a much harmful form and came back with strength during the autumn flu season . Would it be better if we all caught the mild form now ? It 's as simple as that . As a Government , all that realistically can be done is to ensure that sufficient treatments are on hand to help those infected to recover . Happily , it appears that in the UK we have amassed a large enough stockpile . I have already had spam scam e-mails trying to sell me cut-price Tamiflu and\\/or utterly useless protective masks . The tone of these has been `` buy this drug\\/mask now or die , or your family will die , the choice is yours '' This sort of thing really makes the red-mist descend . Philip Le Roux , Aldershot Hampshire The good thing is that more information is available through TV and the web . The bad thing is that there 's so much information being sent out it 's difficult to absorb what 's right and wrong . Taking the usual cleanliness precautions is good . Most people have already been vaccinated against previous flu strains . So we all have some built-in immunity against this new strain . Jon Schuller , Charlotte , NC USA It seems to me we are eventually going to reap what we have sown . If you intensively breed and farm animals and keep them in overcrowded , unclean conditions , disease is going to spread . Parts of Mexico City remain deserted in a bid to stop the disease spreading If I hear the word pandemic once more , I will scream . I can not believe the amount of hype attached to this non issue . People get the flu every year , and yes some people die . This is a weak strain and not avian flu . Let 's move on . I think we are lucky to have the media communications that make it possible for us to know almost immediately when there is a potential flu outbreak . We are also very lucky to have government programs made to monitor such cases . Without the communications and knowledge we have today these flu outbreaks could very easily turn out like the flu epidemic of 1918-1920 . I think that we do not have to become crazy as this illness is affecting all the world but as long as we respect , and follow all the measures , we can help to avoid the spread of it . While sympathising with those who have died , most who catch the virus live . While some countries are over-reacting to this swine flu epidemic there is no hiding the fact this virus will spread irrespective of draconian airport procedures , quarantining measures or culling pigs . I think the poverty pandemic will kill more people in the third world through starvation , malnutrition , lack of clean drinking water , malaria , typhoid , cholera , sleeping sickness etc. . Maybe if we spent the swine flu money on those `` items '' instead more lives would be saved . How convenient that swine flu came at a time when it could take our minds off economic meltdown ! Face masks are utterly useless as a defense system ! The only use of them is for sufferers , to prevent them coughing and sneezing their viruses to the rest of mankind ... in fact , when worn in defense , they definitely do far more harm than good ! Keep your hands clean -LRB- wash with soap and water , or better still an alcohol-based cleanser , regularly -RRB- , and ` catch coughs and sneezes in your handkerchiezes ! ' , you know , just as we did in the 50s ! In my opinion countries need to be far better prepared in these days of global mass transportation , by ensuring that Airports and to a degree , all Sea-ports use correct monitoring not just at arrivals but also at the point of departures . By using thermal cameras and to have health officials and computers with health information in multiple languages are available etc. . Also on long haul flights and cruses if a passenger -LRB- s -RRB- is found to be unwell , and displaying the right type of symptoms that they are tested and other passengers informed , and given preventative treatment and specialist advice , also major events should be postponed the F.A cup for example . Matthew Jones , Barry , UK The Swine Flu Pandemic can be controlled just like Mexico is doing . If a country manages to avoid crowded gatherings , it will cut the beginning of the spread of the disease .

The pig , a curiosity in a country where pork products are illegal , lives at the zoo , where he had previously enjoyed grazing next to deer and goats . However visitors expressed fears that the animal could be carrying the H1N1 virus and he was moved into isolation . The director of the zoo , Aziz Gul Saqib , says the pig , whose name is Khanzir , is strong and healthy . Speaking to the BBC World Service , Mr Saqib says : `` The only reason we moved him was because Afghan people do n't have a lot of knowledge about swine flu , and so when they see a pig they get worried and think they will get ill . '' The animal , known simply as Khanzir , the Pashtu word for pig , was given to the zoo by China in 2002 . The zoo director says Khanzir has been moved to a large space with lots of windows and fresh air and that he hopes the pig will be quarantined for only a few days . Acknowledging that being Afghanistan 's only pig is a lonely existence , Mr Saqib says he hopes to find Khanzir a female companion soon . However , he says , because of swine flu , `` it is a dangerous and difficult time to get a new pig for our pig '' .

Confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus have been reported in Las Vegas , but there was no suggestion that Pacquiao actually had the virus . But Mr Duque said there were concerns that the motorcade , which was due to drive through Manila in celebration , could pose a risk of spreading the virus .

Researchers say swine flu has `` full pandemic potential '' , spreading readily between people and is likely to go global in the next six to nine months . Although one in three who come in contact will likely become infected , the Imperial College London team declined to estimate the death toll . The study based on Mexico 's experience is published in the journal Science . The number of laboratory-confirmed swine flu cases has reached 5,251 in some 30 countries around the world , with 61 having died from the disease , the World Health Organization has confirmed . Working in collaboration with the WHO and public health agencies in Mexico , the researchers assessed the Mexico epidemic using data to the end of April and taking into account factors like international spread and viral genetic diversity . Lead researcher Professor Neil Ferguson said it was too early to say whether the virus will cause deaths on a massive scale , or prove little more lethal than normal seasonal flu . His `` fast and dirty '' analysis of Mexico 's swine flu outbreak suggests that the H1N1 virus is about as dangerous as the virus behind a 1957 pandemic that killed 2 million people worldwide . But it 's not nearly as lethal as the bug that caused the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic , which caused an estimated 50 million deaths in 1918 . Its full impact on the UK is not likely to be known until the annual flu season in the autumn and winter , when a `` really major epidemic '' can be expected in the northern hemisphere , says Professor Ferguson . Prof Ferguson , who sits on the World Health Organisation 's emergency committee for the outbreak , told the BBC Radio 4 Today program : `` This virus really does have full pandemic potential . It is likely to spread around the world in the next six to nine months and when it does so it will affect about one-third of the world 's population . `` To put that into context , normal seasonal flu every year probably affects around 10 % of the world 's population every year , so we are heading for a flu season which is perhaps three times worse than usual - not allowing for whether this virus is more severe than normal seasonal flu viruses . '' His study suggests swine flu could kill four in every 1,000 infected people . Professor Ferguson said his findings confirmed that decisions must be taken swiftly on vaccine production . `` We really need to be prepared , particularly for the autumn . At the moment , the virus is not spreading fast in the northern hemisphere , because we are outside the normal flu season , but come the autumn it is likely to cause a really major epidemic . `` One of the key decisions which has to be made this week by the world community is how much do we switch over current vaccine production for seasonal flu to make a vaccine against this particular virus ? I think those decisions need to be made quickly .

So is it time for pig flu parties , to spread a mild version to build immunity ? As this is a new strain of H1N1 , we have no herd immunity Dotted up and down the UK , Tamiflu has been dispensed to swine flu sufferers and those who may have been exposed to the highly contagious virus . Some fret about taking the powerful antiviral drug - with its unpleasant side effects - and wonder if it might be wiser to catch swine flu now , priming our bodies to fight back if a more vicious form surfaces in winter . `` It would be quite a dangerous thing to do , '' says John Oxford , professor of virology at St Barts and the Royal London Hospitals , Queen Mary College . `` The scenario is that you get your mates together to spread swine flu . But then you take it home . Perhaps you take your dear old granny a cup of tea . You might recover fast , but those you expose might not It 's highly contagious , with the potential to infect many people Anyone can develop serious complications For this new version of H1N1 is highly contagious . Someone in rude health might recover quickly , albeit after enduring a fever , vomiting and diarrhoea . But they might pass it on to someone less able to fight it off - someone with diabetes , asthma or a weak immune system . `` A swine flu party would only work if you all then put yourselves in quarantine , or returned to your hermit hole , and did not touch anyone for at least 10 days . '' And while chickenpox or rubella parties were once popular as these illnesses are more straight-forward in childhood , swine flu is in a different league , warns Professor Oxford . Chickenpox can be fatal - but that is rare Although chickenpox can be fatal - that is rare . Dangerous complications can happen in a small number of healthy children or those with other chronic health problems . People have died from swine flu and less is known about the current strain . Health authorities do n't yet know enough about it to predict how it will affect individuals , how it will mutate and whether it will come back . The effects have so far been less dramatic than initially feared - Mexico has scaled back its death toll from 159 to 56 , and precautions such as school closures seem to have slowed its spread . But it has `` full pandemic potential '' , the World Health Organization says . A pandemic occurs when a new flu virus appears against which we have no immunity , resulting in outbreaks worldwide . Already cases have been confirmed in 30 countries , from Mexico to New Zealand , Canada to Thailand , Germany to the UK . `` What 's reassuring is that the UK has stockpiles of antiviral drugs , enough to treat those who contract swine flu or who are exposed to it , and to protect frontline medical staff , '' says Professor Oxford . `` My daughter 's a GP . If -LRB- swine flu -RRB- takes off and people come in to see her , she can take it prophylatically , one tablet a day for six weeks . '' A regular part of the BBC News Magazine , Who , What , Why ? aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines And although swine flu is a new virus , our bodies encounter other strains of H1N1 in the seasonal flu that does the rounds each year . `` We 're not as vulnerable as we were in 1957 's pandemic , which was a totally new virus . We 've come into contact with distant relatives of swine flu before . If you catch it , your body will say ' I know this family , I 've fought off its cousin , six times removed ' and go to work to fight it off . '' Prior exposure , through seasonal flu or swine flu vaccination when one becomes available , prompts the immune system to produce suitable antibodies to fight off the invader . `` And once exposed , you have lifetime memory of those antibodies and can produce them again , '' says Professor Oxford .

But there 's one question that I 've always forgotten to ask : when does old age actually begin in this country ? There are a few clues in the way people address one another . In China , when you 're young , you can be called `` Xiao '' - which means little . If you 're older , you can get the prefix `` Lao '' - which means old . So , at what age can you get promoted from Xiao to Lao ? Thirty five , says a friend of mine . However , whether you 're called Xiao or Lao also depends on whether or not the person you 're talking to is older or younger than you . Still , if you 've hit 35 and you 've managed to win yourself the prefix Lao , you do n't automatically qualify to be seen as old . For that , apparently , you may have to join a dance troupe . The Chinese dancers appear to be in their 40s or 50s - each of them apparently healthy and vigorous . However , the picture caption refers to them as `` local elderly . '' -LRB- I ca n't imagine they will take this as a compliment . -RRB- In China , respect for age seems to be mirrored by an equally powerful desire to delay the moment when you will be seen as old . The Communist Party 's most senior leaders - the nine members of the Politburo Standing Committee - do not appear to have a single gray hair between them . It 's a fairly astonishing achievement for a group of men well into their 50s and 60s . The only time you tend to see a government official with gray hair is if he has been arrested and put on trial - where he is deprived both of his freedom and , apparently , his hair dye . Where does this comment come from ? `` The only time you tend to see a government official with gray hair is if he has been arrested and put on trial - where he is deprived both of his freedom and , apparently , his hair dye .

The only time you tend to see a government official with gray hair is if he has been arrested and put on trial - where he is deprived both of his freedom and , apparently , his hair dye . Image has become more and more important not only for government officials , but also for ordinary Chinese people . Guess people are more image conscious nowadays . Who knows , hair transplant will be next on the list . Beauty is only skin deep after all . Hair dye will probably be the last thing on his\\/her mind , when he\\/she is arrested for corruption charges etc. . BTW , dont criminals have to shave their head or at least keep their hair very short while in jail ? Whats the point of hair dye ??

It 's almost assumed that once the grandchildren are born they will take on the role of carer whilst the parents are off earning the dosh . Even for Chinese living in the West , the grandparents will fly half way around the world to a strange land where they ca n't understand a word of the language to look after the little one . This is truly admirable . At 1:49 pm on 18 May 2009 , Jiansu wrote : `` I ca n't imagine they will take this as a compliment . '' . No , these middle-aged Chinese did not take this as a compliment . In China , the retirement age is 55 for women and 60 for man . When people -LRB- in middle age -RRB- find out that they are approaching their retirement , they start to consider themselves old -- it does n't mean they are pleased by their age or take `` elderly people '' as a compliment . In many cases , they just make fun of themseleves . At 2:32 pm on 18 May 2009 , ghostofsichuan wrote : The vanity of human beings crosses all cultural lines . Look at what they sell on television commercials and billboards ... youth . Time is linear , it does not stop or change directions . In Chinese history poverty combined with a very hard life made a long life a rarity , so the achievement of old age was unusual and therefore revered . The First Emperor , Quin Shi Huang-Di , was reported to have died from taking `` the Elixir of Life . '' Over 2,500 years ago the Buddha taught that human beings should accept the evident impermance of all things and human beings have continued to reject the reality of aging and death . Fortunes have been made on creating the illusion of youth . We know that in the world of politics illusion is primary , look at the world financial crisis . The financial crisis was simply the creation of the illusion that profits could be made without placing collaterial at risk or not having any at all . Human being have been cursed with a large brain that they do not have the ability to discipline . We have stumbled a half step out of the cave and mistake our ignorance for intelligence .

I like everything current and change since I have lived through a mirriad of changes in my life . I first discovered I was getting old when I did not like RAP . This is the music of the current generation , and I wanted to be current , not to avoid being old , but to avoid not being current . One must look for the signs and signifiers of being old , not of aging because aging is a zero sum game : either you are in , or you are out of life , so aging is part of life . Now that I am senior , I can look back on life and criticise with accuracy because I have lived over half a century and seen every president from Eisenhower to Obama . But the Queen has always been the same . The Chinese have change , but I still prefer Mao . There is a difference between reverence for age and desire for young-looking appearance .

The World Health Organisation reported the number of infected people to have reached 9,830 across 40 countries . The virus , which is thought to have originated in Mexico , has now spread as far south as Australia and as far east as Japan . With over 170 reported cases , Japan has one of the highest instances of infection in Asia . In response , Japan , like many other badly infected regions , has tried to contain any further spread of the virus . One measure taken has been the temporary closure of 4,000 schools , colleges and nurseries in and around Hyogo and Osaka . Students have been advised to stay at home until further notice but a few restless individuals have found a more entertaining and musical way to spend their new-found free time . It appears some Japanese students are not spending their time worrying about the virus , but spending it practising their singing instead . In fact , a few karaoke club owners in Japan have reported record numbers of customers . One club manager told the AFP news agency : `` We suddenly had a number of high school students after 2pm yesterday , right after the announcement that schools would close for a week . '' Neither students nor club owners appear overly worried about the virus . So just how concerned should they be ? Well , according to a recent statement from Dr Margaret Chan , Director General of the World Health Organization : `` With the exception of the outbreak in Mexico , which is still not fully understood , the H1N1 virus tends to cause very mild illness in otherwise healthy people . Outside Mexico , nearly all cases of illness , and all deaths , have been detected in people with underlying chronic conditions .

I do not feel that it is being taken seriously enough either by the powers that be or the public . How is it that the UK is now the 5th or 6th worst affectd country in the world and the worst BY FAR in Europe ? At one point Spain had more cases than we did and yet now we have several times more cases than they do and many times more cases than the rest of Europe , who by the BBC 's figures , have less than 100 cases each . I share the concerns of slpslp who commented this morning , regarding whether the UK government has the backbone to take more drastic measures such as closing things down to slow the spread ? Unfortunately I have my doubts that they do . Whilst some may critisize countries like Mexico for not being as advanced as others , at least they had the courage to close areas down to try to gain control . The same can be said for air travel - a lot of the new cases I am reading about come about after travel to America - can we imagine the government or airlines stopping flights out there ? I hope they would be brave enough . I think some responsibility also rests with the UK public - I for one would not be traveling to badly affected areas and yet people selfishly still are . What is more important - people 's lives or a holiday ? And I know the stock answer that is trotted out -LRB- when there is anything about swine flu on the news or in the papers - which is suspiciously not as often as I would have expected . But that 's another subject -RRB- - that in most cases it is mild and some cases had underlying health issues . That can not be comfort for those seriously ill or who may fall ill or their families . And why risk anyone 's health - there must be millions with underlying health issues and anyway a large portion of serious cases have been in healthy people . The public should be reminded that it is not something to be casual about and I think better quarantining of infected households not just individuals should be put in place . I hope to goodness that people who are told to stay at home for the requisite number of days are not disobeying that . Could it be a criminal offence if they are ? I just feel that there should be more concern as to why the UK is so badly hit and better attempts to get it under control . Surely the more people who have it going into Autumn\\/Winter and flu season the more worrying the potential for it to mix with seasonal flu to create something different ?

Have you found out anything about what percentage of people with some of these ` underlying conditions ' need hospitalisation - as opposed to what percentage of people needing hospitalisation had a particular condition ? For instance , rather than knowing only that 40 % or so of people needing hospitalisation had asthma , it would be good to know what percentage of people with asthma -LRB- and having a confirmed new H1N1 infection -RRB- needed hospitalisation . That would help to make the risk clearer . First they create the problem them give you the soloution . I believe , and there are sources to back this up that this so called flu has been purposefully engineered to create fear and panic and death . I have read many articles about how many vaccines contain carciogenic substances and other harmful ingriedients and there is also evidence for this too . Also this means there are massive profits to be made out of this whole senario by the big Pharma 's . I feel we as human beings are having our freedoms gradually eroded and we now have to make a stand for our rights as human beings and say no to this tyranny . A key element of this story which does not seem to have been covered in any depth is the manner by which the virus is transmitted . A significant risk here is from the airborne transmission of tiny droplets from coughing and sneezing . At the moment , the Government and the HPA seem to be in a state of denial about the risk of swine flu spreading through the atmosphere ; particularly indoors where high numbers of people create a high ` bio-load ' . The truth is that the risk of airborne transmission is significant , but because it can not easily be assessed or contained it is largely being ignored even though the technology exists to greatly reduce the risks .

As the mother of an active 2 year old with special educational needs who attends regular nursery and hospital sessions I am really concerned about the anticipated treatment of the ` under threes ' with regard to swine flu . The virus now appears to be predominant in one to four year olds and this category also shares the highest predicted mortality rates . Despite this reality , Professor Salisbury 's June letter to pandemic coordinators fails to place ` under threes ' in any priority grouping at all for the swine flu vaccination program . I completely fail to comprehend the reason for this !! In Salisbury 's priority breakdown younger infants come in last place amongst the general population , after the over 65 's , whilst children over three come somewhere near the top of this list . Can you clarify for me whether this continues to be the position given the latest confirmation that ` under fives ' and pregnant women officially rank amongst the highest risk groups for this disease ? On a personal level , I am obviously concerned first and foremost about the health of my child but also the effect on children , their parents and the economy if nurseries have to close as young children get sick while the vaccine is available but appropriated elsewhere . Are parents with young children really expected to quarantine themselves away at home indefinitely until the middle of next year . Thanks to you -LRB- and the BBC -RRB- for this excellent blog . I 'm definitely going to add this to the BBC blogs I visit . First , will you be covering the H1N1 outbreak and its effects outside the UK ? Second -LRB- and this is somewhat of a plug -RRB- , I 'm taking part in a pandemic flu awareness\\/simulation game run by the Hawaii Research Center for Futures Studies . There are several people from the UK who are taking part in this game as well .

Considering children are vulnerable to the virus and one of the main pieces of advice to reduce the spread of the swine flu virus is hand washing then this is deeply worrying . For example , my kid 's school only has bars of soap and the head teacher deemed it unnecessary to install pump dispensers during the school hols to protect his pupils on their return . Fergus Walsh said in his report today that it would be impractical to close schools in the Autumn , so at least give the kids a fighting chance of protecting themselves . I spoke to local governemnt and was informed that they have no power to do anything about this and have to wait for the say so from Central Government ! The person I spoke to even said , `` maybe something will happen in September when things get worse '' . This seems crazy - why no make use of the school holidays to prepare each and every school with soap pump dispensers , as the most basic hygiene requirement . It seems schools are either apathetic or confused about the situation and they are responsible for the health of hundreds of children ! I also have established that the general ruling by the Public Health Protection Agency on soap dispensers versus bars of soap -LRB- which my kid 's school have -RRB- is that soap dispensers are more hygienic . To me , this is common sense . Who would be happy with a bar of soap these days in a public place such as a hospital , airport or restaurant . These days children are accustomed to using soap dispensers in most places , including their own homes , anyway . Action needs to be taken by Central Government immediately to prepare schools for September by providing all schools with soap dispensers and informing all head teachers of uniform guidelines to end the confusion and apathy . This would never happen in another country such as China or U.S.A. Considering , we are dealing with a Pandemic , this situation beggars belief and is a very fundamental problem that must be solved immediately .

This is clearly impossible and it is a shame that this point was n't pressed . Most of the UK 's critical care provision consists of level 2 or High-Dependency beds , which offer support for single organ system failure . Only level 3 or Intensive Care beds can offer full or multisystem critical care . The reality is that existing anesthetic rooms , operating theaters and recovery wards will be turned into temporary critical care spaces - most already have the equipment to deliver rudimentary critical care . This is fine in the very short term , but there are two major problems with this solution : 1 . There simply wo n't be nearly enough skilled staff to look after these extra critical care beds on a 24\\/7 basis , and 2 . Routing operations will almost certainly have to be canceled .

A second girl on the same trip was also infected , officials later told reporters . Tokyo and the surrounding districts are home to around 36 million people . Most of Japan 's cases so far have been in areas around the city of Kobe to the west where a high school student who had not been overseas was found to be infected on Saturday . Since then the numbers have risen steadily and more than 4,000 schools have been closed as a precautionary measure .

It is a `` crucial step '' for manufacturers to start large-scale production of a virus against the H1N1 strain , they said . The National Institute for Biological Standards and Control is one of a handful of laboratories globally working towards a vaccine . US researchers also recently produced a candidate `` starting strain '' . To get a strain suitable for vaccine manufacture , scientists have to create a hybrid virus which is a cross between the H1N1 virus which is causing disease and `` a tried and tested laboratory strain '' . Using a technique called reverse genetics the researchers took gene sequences encoding parts of the swine flu virus that are recognized by the body 's immune system and combined them with gene sequences from laboratory strains . I am delighted that they have been successful so quickly The aim is to make a virus that is recognized by the human body as the swine flu virus but that is safe and easy to grow up in large quantities by manufacturers . It is the same process used for the creation of seasonal influenza vaccines that are produced every year . Without these `` starting strains '' vaccine production could not begin .

This will now be sent to vaccine manufacturers who will get it ready for full-scale production as and when the World Health Organisation declares a flu pandemic or directs them that the time is right to switch from production of seasonal flu vaccines to a pandemic strain . NIBSC received its original swine flu virus from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- in Atlanta which is co-ordinating the scientific response to this novel form of influenza .

This new vaccine is a radical departure from traditional vaccines . The new vaccine , called Sialivac , works by blocking entry of the virus into the body . Traditional vaccines work by producing systemic antibodies to neutralise the virus once it is in the body . Sialivac contains a unique two pronged attack in one vaccine . It prevents ingress of the virus into the body and also removes any attached viruses already in the body , while stimulating an immune response against further virus infection and possibly cross reactive against all strains of influenza viruses . This means this single vaccine could be stockpiled against any future mutation of the virus . It has had extensive field trials in Indonesia where the disease is endemic , where it has proved 100 % effective in controlling HPAI H5N1 . The Sialivac vaccine is also effective 2-3 days following vaccination . Current vaccines can take up to 28 days to produce sufficient protective antibodies . The new vaccine is delivered by nasal drops , not needles , following the same path as the virus 's entry point into the body , stimulating the body 's natural innate mucosal immune system .

Two adults in London and a child in east England make up the other new cases of the H1N1 virus , reports the Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- . The London cases involve one returning traveller and one linked to a previously confirmed case . Eton College , near Windsor , is currently closed for half-term and had been due to re-open on Sunday 31 May , but will now remain closed for another week . A school spokesman said the boy had a mild illness and was recovering at home . It 's a balance between minimizing the risk of a spread on the one hand - which is the national interest - with this all-important time for boys The school 's bursar , Andrew Wynn , told the BBC News website the decision to keep the school closed had , in effect , been taken by the Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- . `` The school is hardly likely to ignore the strong advice of the HPA . We have had long discussions all day with them , '' he said . `` Clearly they are wanting to stop the spread of it . '' Boys taking public examinations are being allowed to return to do so under controlled conditions . `` One of the things we have agreed is that boys be allowed back to take their exams , '' said Mr Wynn . `` So it 's a balance between minimizing the risk of a spread on the one hand - which is the national interest - with this all-important time for boys . '' He said it was too soon to have had any reaction from parents . Worldwide there have been 95 deaths reported from swine flu and an estimated 13,450 cases . Eton College was founded by King Henry VI nearly 570 years ago . It has 18 British prime ministers , including the Duke of Wellington , Sir Robert Walpole and Harold MacMillan , among its former pupils .

Arriving at Beijing 's airport right now is a bit like turning up at a laboratory . I 've just come back to Beijing following a few days in the UK . As our flight came in to land , the cabin crew handed out H1N1 health forms issued by China . These forms asked us to list our seat number and our contact numbers in Beijing . We also had to answer the question : `` Have you had close contact with pigs within the past week ? '' When we landed , we were told to stay in our seats . A team of Chinese health inspectors wearing masks then boarded the plane . The inspectors proceeded slowly down each row , pointing what I can only describe as a temperature gun at each passenger 's forehead -LRB- we made their jobs easier by politely tilting our foreheads to the inspectors as they went by -RRB- . A few minutes later , the inspectors escorted one passenger in an orange t-shirt off the plane . He looked pretty embarrassed . Inside the airport terminal , we passed through a further two checkpoints staffed by guards checking for anyone with a fever . Leaflets warned us : `` It is the responsibility of every citizen to self-monitor at home for seven days after coming back from abroad . '' In case that man with the orange t-shirt is diagnosed with H1N1 , the Health Ministry has enough information to track us all down and put us all into quarantine for a week . This report is objective , good work James ! And , thank you for being polite and cooperative in the inspection process . Wish the flu can come to an end soon . So this is pretty much an admission from the CCP that SARS was handled appalingly .

However , travellers should fully understand that it is good for everybody .

My employers frequently complain that the commuters in our office are ill - I think the reason is obvious ! Just on Wednesday I saw something that made me laugh : A young lady wearing a face mask . I thought to myself `` At last ! A responsible fellow citizen ! '' But no , a few moments later she slipped off the face mask , sneezed violently into the air and slipped the mask back over her mouth and nose .

"}, {"uid": "937", "dct": "2009-05-31", "dates": [null, null], "text": "On yesterday 's Talk Back , a Presbyterian Mutual Society saver explained why he , and others , would be holding a protest at the opening session of this year 's Presbyterian General Assembly . Mervyn Redmond , a spokesman for the Shore Street PMS Action Group in Donaghadee , said , ` We feel betrayed ' by the Presbyterian Church . ` We and our families and forebears have always turned to the Church in times of serious difficulty , but during this desperate situation we are reduced to confronting the Church leaders and elders because they have refused to take a compassionate and fruitful initiative , ' he said in a press statement . I 've asked many Presbyterian ministers , elders and memebrs just how serious a challenge to the church is posed by collapse of the Presbyterian Mutual Society . In short , no one can remember a comparable public controversy involving the church . Some say this has been the greatest challenge to the leadership of the Presbyterian Church in the denomination 's history . Serious questions are being asked by PMS members about the way this crisis has been handled by Church House officials , and some of those questions may be raised during the debate on Tuesday . Was enough done to respond practically to those PMS members who have been placed in financial difficulties as a consequence of the mutual 's collapse ? Just how close is the association between the church and the mutual society ? They share a website and email address , and they once shared a building . Some PMS members say the communications and PR material they receieved from the Mutual Society and the church gave the impression that the mutual was an agency of the church . Even though they accept the church official statement that the two organizations are `` legally separate '' , those investors are asking who is responsible for giving that impression of a closer association ? When I asked Mervyn Redmond what he wanted to see now from his church , I was struck by his answer . He said he wanted the church to look like they cared , that they were listening , that they were interested in the plight of PMS members who thought they were helping their church when they placed money with the mutual society . On Tuesday afternoon , at the General Assembly , Mervyn Redmond and others will be listening carefully for clear answers to those questions , and for signs of a compassionate and caring response . Update : The leaders of the Catholic , Methodist and Anglican churches in Ireland have released a joint statement : `` We have become increasingly aware of the difficulties faced by people whose access to their savings has been blocked by the Presbyterian Mutual Society being placed in Administration . Since assistance has been offered to others , it is our hope that the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK Government will take urgent action to resolve these difficulties . '' The statement is signed by Cardinal Se n Brady , Catholic Archbishop of Armagh , Archbishop Alan Harper , Anglican Archbishop of Armagh , and Rev. Aian Ferguson , President of the Methodist Church Patsty McGarry of the Irish Times has been writing about last week 's edition of Sunday Sequence , and how our program may have influenced the public debate about how the church should repond to child abuse . Money quotes : ` Then , at the weekend , Cori felt unable to supply BBC Northern Ireland 's Sunday Sequence program with a representative for a discussion on the Ryan commission report . It seemed there would be no one to represent the church on the program . Further inquiries led to Cardinal Brady 's general assistant Fr Tim Bartlett going forth , like Noah 's dove , to test the waters , while speaking in a personal capacity . We now know he did so with the permission of Cardinal Brady , who was also aware of Fr Bartlett 's strong personal views on the subject . On the program , with some prompting by Sunday Sequence presenter William Crawley , Fr Bartlett eventually crossed the ecclesiastical Rubicon and called on the congregations to revisit the deal . ' ` The umpire had struck . Within a very short time Fr Bartlett 's own bishop , Most Rev Noel Traenor , Bishop of Down and Connor , rushed in where angels might not tread . He praised Fr Bartlett for his views and his courage , ringfencing his priest from the likely consequences of such courage where the congregations were concerned . Then Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan discovered his voice and called on the congregations to contribute more to the State redress scheme for former residents of institutions . A momentum was building . ' The research findings are not without controversy , but it 's claimed that this fossil , nicknamed ` Ida ' , is a significant transitional form -- in fact , the missing link and , thus , our earliest ancestor . Read the key research paper making that claim here . A reproduction of Ida arrived in London 's Natural History Museum today , ahead of David Attenborough 's television documentary about the fossil find , which has just been screened . Ida was named after the young daughter of one of the leaders of the research team that investigated the find . It 's been given the scientific name Darwinius masillae , a designation honoring Charles Darwin . As you might expect , creationists are less than impressed by the fossil . According to Answers in Genesis , ` Nothing about this fossil suggests it is anything other than an extinct , lemur-like creature . ' They also wonder why ` Evolutionists only open up about the lack of fossil missing links once a new one is found . ' One thing is sure : we 'll all be getting to know Ida pretty well over the next few weeks . An aside : I 've been watching Richard Dawkins in conversation with Paul Davies at the 2009 Origins Symposium , and Dawkins suggests that Charles Darwin never actually completed his degree at university . Paul Davies appears to agree with that claim . At the risk of challenging Dawkins on Darwin , I 've always understood that Darwin finished a degree in theology at Cambridge -LRB- Christ 's College , ironically enough -RRB- , having abandoned his earlier studies in medicine at Edinburgh . Hence , the use of the 'M . A. ' postnominal on the title page of The Origin of Species . Perhaps Dawkins is referring to the abandoned medical degree . In any case , it 's an interesting conversation . The basic beliefs and practises of Scientology are listed here . When Tom Cruise mentions `` KSW '' , this is what he has in mind . The Church of Scotland 's supreme court has agreed to end public debate about homosexuality for a period of two years , while a special commission investigates the theological and legal issues surrounding the appointment of gay ministers within the church . The General Assembly has instructed all authoritative bodies within Scotland 's national church to avoid any public comment on the matter -- including press releases , briefings to the media , and blogging -- and to avoid taking any decisions in relation to ` contentious matters of human sexuality , with respect to Ordination and Induction to the Ministry of the Church of Scotland , until 31 May 2011 ' . The Assembly also made it clear that the moratorium is not retrospective , and emphasized that its earlier decision to uphold the installation of a gay minister in Aberdeen stands . Some conservatives on the floor of the house pointed out that the Assembly 's decision , on Saturday evening , to sustain a call from a parish in Aberdeen to a gay minister , the Reverend Scott Rennie , left open two possible legal challenges before any installation could take place . First , the minister 's current Presbytery would have to take a decision to permit the Rev Scott Rennie to leave his parish , and , second , a service of Installation or Induction might also be construed as an action of a court inconsistent with the moratorium . The Moderator , Dr Bill Hewitt , emphasized , with the support of the Assembly 's Acting Principal Clerk , that the spirit of the decision on Saturday evening was clear : the Reverend Scott Rennie was permitted to accept the call to a parish in Aberdeen and , there being no other legal impediments to his installation , that he could be installed . The Acting Principal Clerk , Dr Marjorie MacLean , advised Mr Rennie not to rob any banks before his installation , since this could constitute a legal impediment ; but his sexuality , and the fact that he lives openly with his partner , is not . We wait to see whether today 's decision will have any ramifications for the Irish Presbyterian Church , whose General Assembly meets in the first week of June . Will any Presbyterian ministers seek to introduce a resolution responding to the historic events of this week in their mother church ? I suspect not ; but time will tell . Not according to the archbishops of Canterbury and York . Rowan Williams and John Sentamu have picked up the gauntlet thrown down by the BNP , whose recent ad campaign featured Jesus and the question , ` What would Jesus do ? ' The archbishops have penned a joint letter which essentially calls on Christians to vote for parties other than the BNP . Money quote : ` Christians have been deeply disturbed by the conscious adoption by the BNP of the language of our faith when the effect of those policies is not to promote those values but to foster fear and division within communities , especially between people of different faiths or racial background . ' That 's how the Presbyterian Moderator , Dr Donald Patton -LRB- pictured -RRB- , responded to last night 's decision by Scotland 's national church to approve the appointment of an openly gay minister who lives with his partner . When I asked him if he could envisage a future in which the Presbyterian Church in Ireland would make a similarly inclusive decision about gay ministers , Dr Patton replied , ' I think our Assembly simply would n't tolerate a situation like that . ' Watch an interview with the gay minister at the center of this controversy , the Rev Scott Rennie , here . Mr Rennie explains that the 18-month ordeal of the appointment and appeal has taken its toll on him : ` I 've been personally hurt and , as you can image , it 's made life pretty stressful . ' Here 's what happened . It seems that Tony Curtis , who took our call while doing a book signing at Harrods in London , had forgotten that we would be broadcasting live , otherwise he would n't have used the language he did on the show . When he realized it was live , he was very upset about the language he 'd drifted into -- an F-word and two B-words -- and apologised profusely . In fact , he was concerned that the people of Northern Ireland might be angry with him when he visits here next week to talk about his recently published memoirs . I assured him that Northern Irish people are very understanding , that his reputation as a Holywood legend remained intact , and ended this edition of Talk Back by suggesting that this program would go down in history as one of the more ` unpredictable ' moments in broadcasting . Now , members of the public are coming up to me in the street to ask that we pass on their best wishes and admiration to Tony Curtis . I suspect many more will turn out to warmly greet Mr Curtis when he visits Northern Ireland on Wednesday . When I got back to my desk after yesterday 's program , one of the letters waiting for me was from a listener who was concerned because she had heard me use the word `` gosh '' on a previous edition of Talk Back . Also enclosed in the envelope was a booklet explaining that `` gosh '' was a euphemism for `` God '' ; my use of the term , according to the letter , amounted to ` taking God 's name in vain . ' It 's a funny old world . That 's how one victim of clerical abuse described his experience of physical and sexual violence at the hands of Catholic religious brothers in Ireland . Mr Justice Ryan 's five-volume report contains an horrific litany of abuse carried out against vulnerable children in 250 schools over a period of six decades . The report describes ritualised beatings , torture , sexual humiliation , and rape perpetrated by priests , brothers and nuns in church-run institutions . Mr Justice Ryan says rape was `` endemic '' , and church authorities covered-up abuses . The Ryan Commission 's report is a catalogue of horrific violation ; it is an account of one of the darkest episodes in the history of the Irish state . We committed almost all of today 's Talk Back to covering the Ryan revelations . Some of out callers told their personal stories , some simply expressed their shock , their deep confusion about how supposedly spiritual people could commit such appalling crimes against children . More than one compared the torture revelations to what we 've heard about the mistreatment of prisoners in Guantanemo Bay . Children were scolded , burned , waterboarded , flogged , sexually abused and violently raped by men and women who said they had religious vocations . Our program , which is available on the BBC iPlayer , began with Mike Philpott 's deeply personal reflection on this story . The Ryan Commission accounts triggered memories for Mike he would sooner forget . Mike has permitted me to reprint his reflection below the line . He 's beginning to look like the Malcolm Tucker of the Catholic Church . Peter Jennings -LRB- pictured -RRB- , press secretary to the new archbishop of Westminster , has gained a certain reputation amongst Britain 's religious press corp. . He 's been my guest a few times on Sunday Sequence and he 's always been charming and very articulate . But that 's not been everyone 's experience , it would appear . Last month , he verbally mauled the Daily Telegraph 's religion correspondent . This month , it 's alleged that he 's been hurling the same four-word scatalogism at an Oxford University student . Matthew Tye , a 22-year-old postgraduate student , has written a letter of complaint to Archbishop Vincent Nichols and claims that Mr Jennings repeatedly called him a s \\*\\*\\* at an event held in Blackfriars , Oxford , which was attended by Francis Campbell , the UK 's Ambassador to the Vatican . Peter Jennings has told the papers that he ` deeply regretted the incident and any embarrassment caused ' , although he regards the matter as ' a typhoon in a tea spoon ' . Some well-known church leaders from Northern Ireland have added their names to a petition encouraging the General Assembly of Scotland 's national church to prohibit a gay minister from taking up a new pastoral position in Aberdeen . The petition , organised by the Fellowship of Confessing Churches , a conservative campaign group within the Church of Scotland , also calls on the General Assembly to support a controversial Overture -LRB- or resolution -RRB- that `` this Church shall not accept for training , ordain , admit , re-admit , induct or introduce to any ministry of the Church anyone involved in a sexual relationship outside of faithful marriage between a man and a woman '' . To date , more than 11,000 people have signed the online petition . Of those , more than 2,000 are members of other churches throughout the UK , including Irish denominations . The list includes a number of former Presbyterian moderators -LRB- Dr Alistair Dunlop , Dr John Lockington , and Dr Ivan McKay , and others -RRB- , a former president of the Irish Methodist Church -LRB- Rev Jim Rea -RRB- , and executive level administrators within the Irish Presbyterian Church -LRB- Rev Trevor Gribben , Deputy Clerk of the General Assembly ; Rev David Bruce , executive secretary of the Board of Mission in Ireland ; and Rev Ronnie Hetherington , Director of Ministerial Studies -RRB- . Other signatories include the Rev Martin Smyth , former South Belfast unionist MP , and the Rev Bobby Liddle , who authored the Presbyterian Church 's 2007 report on homopbobia , alongside ministers from various denominations , elders , theological lecturers , students and church members . The history of the church is littered with theological battlefields . In the distant past , churches debated , and divided over , questions about the person and work of Christ , and the relationship between the Holy Spirit and the other persons of the Trinity . In the medieval world , churches devided over the metaphysics of the eucharist , and issues of power and authority . In the twentieth century , churches divided over the role of women in the church , and the politics of race . Then came ethical debates about abortion . But in recent years , particularly within Protestantism , homosexuality has become the key battleground issue . The presence and role of gay and lesbian Christians within churches has not only divided liberals and evangelicals , it has also divided ` conservative evangelicals ' from ` progressive evangelicals ' . Homosexuality is now , without doubt , the most divisive theological issue facing the world 's major Protestant denominations . The argument within Anglicanism has been likened by some to a theological civil war -- with no sign of a ceasefire anytime soon . Now , the Church of Scotland , Scotland 's national church and the mother church of Irish Presbyterianism , is about to face its most challenging debate about homosexuality to date . Some say this debate has brought the Church of Scotland closer to schism than any other issue since the Year of Disruption in 1843 . Next week , its General Assembly votes on whether a gay minister can be appointed to a parish in Aberdeen . `` From a natural justice perspective I feel a justifiable exception would be the fairest manner to deal with the current situation . '' That 's how one MP , in 2006 , tried to claim for a # 3,100 Sony 40 inch TV set . The ` John Lewis List ' suggests that # 750 is a reasonable expense for a television , and no one would deny that MPs need to have access to the media from their home . There 's an engaging dialogue about the ethics of remuneration here , involving two philosophers and a remuneration expert here . Test case : One Conservative MP claimed 78p for two tins of pet food . Is it ethical to expense your pets ' needs ? Professor James Connelly : This reminds me of Plato 's The Ring of Gyges , where Plato asks : `` What would you do if you put on a ring that made you invisible ? '' Some MPs seem to think they were wearing the ring when they put in these claims . Now they look pretty stupid . Baroness Warnock : Absolutely not . They can feed their own bloody pets . Last night , to mark the 30th anniversary of Margaret Thatcher 's election as prime minister , BBC Parliament re-ran the entire TV coverage of election night , presented by a youthful David Dimbleby , with political interviews conducted by Robin Day at the other end of the studio . It was , I am not ashamed to admit , a great night of TV . In her first speech to the cameras , delivered on the steps of Downing Street after returning from the palace , Mrs Thatcher quoted words attributed -LRB- probably wrongly -RRB- to St Francis of Assisi -- and we marked the 800th anniversary of his conversion on last Sunday 's program . I thought today it would be interesting to recall a later speech about religion by Mrs Thatcher , in which she appeared to use theology to provide a justification for her political and economic policies . This speech , given to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in May 1988 , was nicknamed `` the Sermon on the Mound '' by the press -LRB- the mound being the hill upon which the church 's Assembly Hall stands -RRB- . Read the speech in full here . So , a woman will lift her head from the sieve of her hands and stare at the minims sung by a tree , a sudden gift . Some nights , although we are faithless , the truth enters our hearts , that small familiar pain ; then a man will stand stock-still , hearing his youth in the distant Latin chanting of a train . Pray for us now . Grade 1 piano scales console the lodger looking out across a Midlands town . Then dusk , and someone calls a child 's name as though they named their loss . Inside , the radio 's prayer - -LRB- from Mean Time -LRB- Anvil , 1994 -RRB- -RRB- Listen here to Carol Ann Duffy read some of her poems . ` Capitalism is nothing but a false religion , with Mammon as its god and Adam Smith as its high priest . ' ` Communism is nothing but a false religion , with -LRB- INSERT -RRB- as its god and Karl Marx as its high priest . ' ` Under capitalism , man exploits man . Under communism , it 's just the opposite . ' Bill Maher 's film Religulous redeploys the claim , often made , that the biblical story of Jesus is a re-run of the Egyptian myth of Horus . Did the writers of the New Testament ` borrow ' from a older myth ? Is the gospel account a kind of mthological plagiarism ? It 's said that Horus , like Jesus -- or Jesus , like Horus -- was born of a virgin , had twelve disciples , walked on water , delivered a ` sermon on the mount ' , performed mircles , was executed beside two thieves , rose from the dead and ascended into heaven . We 'll be exploring the similarities between Horus and Jesus on Sunday morning , with an Egyptologist , a humanist and a Christian theologian . If you 're in Derry tonight , you mighty like to hear a lecture from one of the world 's leading eco-theologians . Mark Wallace will be speaking on ` Christianity in an Ecological Age ' at 6.30 tonight in the University of Ulster 's Magee campus . Mark Wallace is Professor of Religion at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania . He is the author of the forthcoming Green Christianity : Five Ways to a Sustainable Future -LRB- Fortress , 2009 -RRB- , and has written Finding God in the Singing River : Christianity , Spirit , Nature -LRB- Fortress , 2005 -RRB- , Fragments of the Spirit : Nature , Violence , and the Renewal of Creation -LRB- Continuum , 1996 ; Trinity , 2002 -RRB- , amongst many other publications . Here 's the abstract for Professor Wallace 's Magee campus talk : ` The great work of our generation will be to develop sustainable lifestyles that kick the habit of dependence on cheap fossil fuels , the primary source of global climate change . A return to animism - indigenous communities ' belief that the natural world is charged with sacred presence - has the power to fire the imagination and empower the will in order to break the cycle of addiction to nonrenewable energy . The environmental crisis is a crisis not of the head , but of the heart . The problem is not that we do not know how to stop climate change , but rather that we lack the inner strength to redirect our culture and economy toward a sustainable future . The time has passed for new technologies to quick-fix the problem - only an attitude of attunement to the presence of spirit in all things can save us now ' . BBC Northern Ireland presenter William Crawley discusses the often controversial political , religious and ethical issues of the day .

Professor John Oxford , an expert on virology at Queen Mary School of Medicine , University of London , says that children going back to school , universities reopening and people going back to work after the summer break would give swine flu the `` opportunity '' that it needs to spread . Another fifteen cases of swine flu were confirmed yesterday by the Health Protection Agency , bringing the UK total to 244 . One of the cases was in Wales and is believed to be the first there . But Professor Oxford thinks that many cases are going undetected : `` Already , sporadic cases in the UK have been shown that are not linked with cases that have traveled . That does suggest that the virus is silently spreading around . '' However , he said that people should behave as usual , as far as possible , if a pandemic strikes . `` What we do n't want is people stopping at home and not going to work , because then you have an economic problem on top of a pandemic , '' he said . `` The best advice is to carry on as normal but to be sensible about it . `` This includes a bit of social distancing and shielding people from coughs by coughing into the crux of your arm . '' Professor Oxford said that in the next few months , global health officials will be keeping a close eye on what happens to the H1N1 swine flu virus in countries like Australia and South Africa . The southern hemisphere is entering its winter and the peak period for flu . On Friday , the World Health Organization reported that Australia has had 147 confirmed cases ; Argentina has had 37 ; and none so far in South Africa . What happens in the southern hemisphere in the coming months will be a good indicator of how the virus will behave in Europe and North America later this year . There would be particular concern if H1N1 mutated substantially to become a more virulent illness . Thankfully , there are no signs of that yet . The Australian Science Media Centre is an excellent resource for anyone wanting to know what experts are thinking about the spread of the virus there . The Science Media Centre in London has lots of reliable specialist comments on flu and a host of other issues .

If a million people had died in Mexico we would have something to worry about , but as it is this flu seems no worse than normal flu , even though it has an unusual origin . Unusual does not equate to dangerous and I wish that the relative risks had been far better explored before the Beeb had decided to follow the herd and jump off the deep end . Thousands of people die of flu every year , whilst millions die of diahorrhea so perhaps you could instead whip up some hysteria where it is 100 % justified and could genuinely help to reduce the number of preventable deaths in the world .

I am still going to work . I have an appetite . I do not think it is flu - I have had it - in Royal Air Force many years ago - temperature of 102 etc. . Should I get it checked out ? I do not normally go to Doctors . At 7:45 pm on 01 Jun 2009 , Ikarus wrote : I 'm trying to remember the government predictions recently circulated . I believe they predicted that 25 % -50 % of the population would catch swine flu at some stage - probably next winter . Of these , 0.25-1 % would die . So the scenario for swine flu related deaths in the UK is : Anywwhere between 37,500 and 300,000 deaths . I presume these numbers were a prediction for the next 12 months . I do n't believe this is reason to panic . It is , however , reason to have some concern . One would expect hospitals and health care to get very stretched , probably overstretched , in six month 's time . One would expect some level of disruption . The scariest thing : One would expect to experience a bereavement in the next year . This flu is not the equivalent of the Great War - but neither is it just the equivalent of a Heat Wave , in terms of its likely impact . I find advice telling people to sneeze hygienically stupid : It does not benefit the sneezer , and it only might benefit the sneezed at people . I do n't want advice on `` how to keep your illness to yourself '' - I want advice on `` how to not get ill , or minimize the impact if you do '' . If I were the government , I would advise people to try and keep their immune system strong this year , at least until the flu season has passed . If that means healthier living and less excess for a year , then so be it . I 'd rather catch the flu after spending six months eating and drinking sensibly , than after weeks of poor nutrition and binge drinking . As for Tamilflu - I would like to know how bad the side effects are -LRB- and the likely mortality from those -RRB- before I 'd consider taking it .

Money first , citizens second . . we need to understand the priorities . N1H1 can mutate as it spreads and become resisitent or become more lethal . World travel makes the problem difficult to contain and the incubation period adds to the difficulties . We are in a world with a severe economic crisis , global warming and poor air quality and suspect pulbic health systems ... . . and now the bad news .

Stay at home , rest up and get over the virus . Don t go out and infect other people you come in contact with , that is irresponsible . I have always followed this advice , thereby sparing others from suffering your fate . I would have thought this to be a common sense approach . Now we get various types of advise from the medical field , the media , the economists etc. , all telling us to carry on as usual . That s just plain stupid advise , sorry !! I work in retail , other family members in the health industry and one thing we all agree upon is , if you are infected with the cold , the flu or any other affliction , such as the plague , measles , small pox etc , do us a favor , stay at home ... we don t want it either !!! At 07:28 am on 02 Jun 2009 , Shi-Hsia wrote : It seems that a lot of people have misunderstood what the word `` pandemic '' means . It just means a disease outbreak that has spread around the world , not doomsday . The word describes the spread of a disease , not its lethality . By saying that a swine flu pandemic is imminent neither the BBC nor the government or universities are guilty of scare-mongering . People who accuse them of being so are guilty of being too lazy to use a dictionary or check the WHO website . By the way , I 'm a virologist and I 'm sticking with calling it swine flu rather than H1N1 because it has been shown to be mostly from swine lineages . There are so many circulating H1N1 strains of human origin that calling it swine flu is about as helpful as telling a policeman that you were hit by a silver car , instead of a Toyota Corolla with licence plate ABC 1234 . At 07:31 am on 02 Jun 2009 , Shi-Hsia wrote : Oops sorry , I meant '' ... that calling it H1N1 is about as helpful ... '' At 08:33 am on 02 Jun 2009 , sensiblegrannie wrote : As the global problem of ` swine flu ' develops , those countries at a more advanced stage of infection , have learned a few new things . Mr Fergus Walsh could at least bring some of the new learning into the discussion . It should not be up to us , the bloggers and twitters to spell out necessary changes to government and populations that are needed to reduce the speed of infection to a manageable rate . One of the ideas put forward is the protection of agency workers , to enable them to go off sick if they become ill . Many agency workers have to take risks and work whether they are ill or not , because they are not covered by the usual protection that a regular employee enjoys . A regular employee can take comfort in the fact that they know which days they will be working , have holiday pay , have normal sickness benefits etc etc. . An agency worker is called in to cover a worker who has gone off SICK . The government has already advised certain work groups to keep a list of agencies to whom they can get cover when their workers go off sick . Should there now be greater protection for agency workers ? After all agency workers help out when there is no-one else available , and without them , some key work areas could find themselves seriously compromised . Very mild symptoms which would have been missed if I had n't found out by chance that she 'd had contact with a confirmed case at school . That was last Thursday . So far neither my husband nor I have any symptoms and our daughter has fully recovered . She was given Tamiflu to hasten recovery , but we would prefer not to take it ourselves as we do n't have any symptoms and want to build up our own immunity in case this flu returns in a nastier form . Our family has been quarantined , but the ` contain ' policy is being reviewed as more schools are closing and more cases confirmed . Victoria -LRB- where we live -RRB- has the majority of cases in Australia - almost 400 here alone . My suggestion is to be cautious and let common sense prevail . There is a lot you can do to prevent the spread of flu , but it 's proven to be more of an inconvenience than a threat so far . Thanks to drmattprescott for your comments . Have a good look in the blog and on the BBC coverage and I 'm confident that you wo n't find any hysterical claims from correspondents about swine flu . If you watched the Six or Ten o'clock news on BBC1 on Friday you would have seen me do a report about the threat of drug-resistant malaria . I have also reported several times on HIV\\/AIDS , TB and child mortality - from a variety of causes - including diarrhoea . You are quite right to say that thousands of people die from flu every year - the WHO global estimate is 250,000-500 ,000 . I have pointed this out several times . Death estimates for flu are not simple but it 's thought that between one and two million people died in each of the last two pandemics , many times more than with seasonal flu . Clearly that is not as many as die from malaria , TB and HIV\\/AIDS , but a pandemic , even of largely mild illness , would have a huge impact both in the UK and internationally . In Britain , hundreds of thousands of people might be off work during the peak periods of infection and that would have a major economic and social impact - far more than with seasonal flu . I ca n't give personal health guidance on this blog - not least because I 'm not medically qualified . If you are ill you should probably seek medical advice of some kind , via NHS Direct , or NHS 24 in Scotland . It 's generally not a good idea for people with coughs , colds or flu to take the virus down to their GP surgery . Hope you feel better soon . Thanks for your comments Ikarus . An earlier post `` Explaining flu '' gives you the predictions about mortality in the UK in a pandemic . Like all drugs , Tamiflu has potential side-effects , nausea being a common complaint . RE Comment 5 : Let me clear up any confusion about what Professor Oxford 's comments . He is advising that healthy people should carry on life as normal , in the event of a pandemic , although they should follow sensible hygiene guidance . But sick people should stay at home and keep the flu virus to themselves . RE Comments 6 and 7 . It 's interesting that the CDC and WHO stopped calling it swine flu sme time ago . The CDC goes for `` novel influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- '' and the WHO `` influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- infection '' . Both are a bit of a mouthful for when I 'm reportng on TV or radio . I tend to call it H1N1 swine flu when I mention it first and then shorten that to swine flu or H1N1 virus afterwards . RE Comment 9 , thanks very much for getting in touch . It 's very good to know what is happening on the ground in Australia and to hear that your daughter is ok . Please let me know how she gets on with the Tamiflu and whether she suffers any of the reported side-effects such as nausea -LRB- which seem to be very mild -RRB- . I 'd be interested to get some first-hand accounts of the disease and the treatment .

You say `` no reason to panic '' but in the next breath seem to be saying `` people can expect one of their loved ones to die within the next year from swine flu '' ! Thanks for your comments MajorGallagher . Please point out to me where I suggest that someone close to you is going to die from swine flu in the next year ? I have never intended to imply that . Remember that `` pandemic '' means simply a global epidemic of an infectious disease . It does not imply severity . Thankfully , the vast majority of cases of swine flu so far have been mild . At present you need to have underlying health conditions or be very unlucky to be struck down severely ill with the virus . But the case of the 45-year-old man in hospital in Paisley - who had been otherwise healthy - shows that H1N1 is not always a mild disease .

Victora currently has 1,011 confirmed cases of H1N1 - the highest number per capita in the world . The Victorian government has moved from a Contain to a modified Sustain Phase of its influenza plan . Our daughter had no side effects from taking Tamiflu , but I read in the weekend paper about overseas findings of suicide tendencies in some young people after taking it . Neither my husband nor I had any flu symptoms at all despite being in close contact with our daughter the whole time . I understand that the authorities would only test for H1N1 if there had been contact with a confirmed case , even if someone had flu like symptoms . Consequently I heard of children who were ill , but not tested as there was no known contact with a confirmed case . The authorities in Victoria have struggled to deal with this epidemic and it 's easy to see how a pandemic of a more serious nature could claim many lives world wide .

Thank goodness only a few hundred thousand -LRB- or should that be a million or so ? -RRB- may die ... that way governments can justify giving only lip-service to the problem . At the end of the day there are some far more serious health problems worldwide so why bother about yet another one which is minor in comparison anyway ??? I pity my childrens generation ... they are going to face far far more serious problems and will have to make extraordinarily difficult decisions once world -LRB- i.e. non-localized -RRB- water and food problems start happening every year . i.e. they will simply have to say `` No , we only have enough to save ourselves ! '' But , on a positive note , the ONLY realistic way to achieve any significant reduction in CO2 is for major global population reduction ... so , we need - yes NEED - either a series of high-mortality pandemics , a high-mortality war -LRB- or two -RRB- , or mass starvation . But , lets be realistic , the most politically acceptable is , of course , an `` uncontrollable '' pandemic . It will happen ... world governments just wish it were sooner rather than later -LRB- that is IF global warming is accepted as a serious problem by governments in the first place ... which it appears not to be -RRB- .

When my colleagues and I went to film in Tiananmen Square last Friday , we were stopped four times by the police -LRB- normally we 're checked just once . -RRB- Officers told us that we were not allowed to use our camera tripod to do any filming - something we 've never been told before . In the embassy district in eastern Beijing , Chinese guards are currently wearing flak jackets or stab vests over their uniforms - something that I have n't seen before , and I 've walked past these guards almost every day for the last two years . When a colleague of mine mentioned Tiananmen Square during a mobile phone conversation , a Chinese voice interrupted his call for a few seconds . We get The Economist magazine mailed to our office every week . The most recent edition arrived with a page torn out of it -LRB- The contents page shows that the missing page contained an article about the Tiananmen Square anniversary . -RRB- If you 're in China , have you noticed anything similar ?

Blogs and internet pages in China have told the story and even if the exact details remain secret the attack on the students by the PLA as odered by the leadership is no secret . When the People 's Army attacked the People the relationship between the government and the governed changed . China of 2009 is a direct result of 1989 . The battle within the leadership and the need to change direction was percipitated by the events of Tiananmen Square . Things change slowly in this world and twenty years is not that long when discussing social change and in China that is a very short period for change . The disheartening thing is that this is a secret that everyone knows and the Chinese government insist on maintaining silence about these events . History is always written by the victors so it is never the truth . In Hong Kong the events are memorialized , so within China there is recognition , just not official recognition . It is also important to note that almost every country has had similar events where students or unions or refugees have confronted a sitting government and the actions to address such confrontations have been a show of force . China utilized extreme force and that was the nature of the insecurity of the leadership at that time . Twenty years prior had been the Cultural Revolution that scared an entire generation with fear and uncertainity . One day a statue will be erected in Tiananmen Square for the students , but that will come in time . Like the British saying the Anglo-Chinese Wars were about dis-satisfaction of the Chinese with their government when it was really about selling opium in China , the truth sometimes takes awhile to become an accepted part of a national history . A repressive and paranoid dictatorship at it 's best . No doubt the overseas Chinese will defend the government of a country where they chose not to live\\/have never lived .

The repression of the students ' rebellion resulted in social and political peace for China and an unprecedented economic growth and development . Thanks to social and political peace which permitted rapid economic development in China , hundreds of millions of Chinese no longer live in poverty and no longer suffer from chronic famine .

Yes , the students were killed , but for the sick of China 's stability , for the law and order , if they stay at that night , they should shoulder the consequences .

From a small group of student to huge amount of people including lots of people just came for fun . I 'm really serious ! At last some of them are just come for fun -LRB- such as me , that time I was only 7 years old -RRB- . You need to know . There are culture revolution before , in culture revolution , people could run to every place of china , and in that time , except some event , you could n't leave your city or villiage , you need to work . And all the people have his work assembled by gov , even the children need to go to school . But those day , all the school in Beijing stopped classes . So I can visit Tianmen for fun . And my father is a phd student that time . He really with to advice some thought to the gov. However , when we go to there , we found thing is n't right . Most of the people 's motion in there are crazy . The people who is calm as my father dislike that situation , so we leave . And lots of people leave also . Only the most crazy people are stay there more than one day . More things are , First I should say , I do n't discriminate the people who is n't live in Beijing , because both my parents are born in Shandon province . But a small amount people who came from other province stay in Tiananmen is n't peace . They burn and break the things to consume their angry ... Actually I did n't think all of them are really extrimely angry , some is only for exiting , that the first time they come to the capital of china , the center of capital , and its also the first time to destroy something which if they do in their own hometown would be punished very strict . One thing is ture , which may disappoint most of the anti-china medium . The students who come to Tiananmen first is n't anti-communism at all . Actually , most of them are communisms as my father . They think the direction of the country is n't right , and for a communist , he has the duty to correct the direction of the country . -LRB- It sounds a little ridiculous today , is n't it ? -RRB- My there are old word in china , that every people need to help the country to pass the bad times . And those communists are the one who bravely come out to advice the party the right way . So , no student is come to show their angry to the goverment at the begining time , they are going to give the goverment advice . However , after the priminister Li Peng refuse to accept the letter of the advice from the students several times . The students angry that they hav n't be respect . And some of them swear , if the Li Peng did n't come out to receive the letter , then they wo n't go back home . After some days protest . Li Peng was afraid , and call the army to protect the order . But at first , its only come to protect the order . The army went through my house , and the soldiers rest at the door of my house , they are laughly talking with each other , and it is definitely their first time come to Beijing , they are friendly to the citizens around them , and they really do n't know what will happened just several days after . However , disaster happened when a bunch of `` Football hooligans '' meet a coward priadminister Li Peng . And really , before the disaster happen , some soliders who watching the protest has been killed by some bad people , but no solider is killed by students . However , who can identificate who is angry student and who is mob ? Mob usually run away first when they say the gov is really angry , but the students who did n't know there are soliders have been killed , they do n't think the govment seriousely wish to repressive , they did n't leave and been killed without know why .

However , I wonder how the cities of London , New York , or Paris would do if their students gathered at the largest plaza in their countries eating , sleeping , and carrying out other humanly business for TWO months , in the name of , lets say , anti-globalization or anti-corporate greed ? Would these Euro-centric governments allow their national plaza turn into a public cesspool for TWO months ? I also wonder when their students were out on the largest plaza in their countries protesting their governments , would any of the governmental officials go meet and listen to those students . This is because for weeks before crack down on June 4th , ALL levels of Chinese officials from the City of Beijing to the President of China all came out to meet the students and listen to their voices at the plaza or in their offices which were all broadcast on Chinese national TVs . That has never happened or it would ever happen in ANY other Euro-centric countries ! In 1989 , the entire police force in the City of Beijing was not even 5 % of the police force in the City of New York . So what else could the City of Beijing have done differently to remove the students from their largest national plaza after TWO long months if not using the army at the time when there were no such things as anti-riot police or national guards like we have in the U. S ? While the Euro-centric countries can point fingers at China for what China did on June 4th 1989 , if the same thing happened in their countries , they would do the exactly same as the Chinese government did on June 4th . The only difference might be that the Euro-centric countries would NEVER allow their students to camp out on their national plaza for more than a couple of days , let alone TWO long months . About those student leaders , how could they ask others to hunger strike while themselves drink and feast ? And mostly , how could they ask other students to `` shed blood '' or `` sacrifice lives for democracy '' while themselves were already in contact with foreign agencies planning their own escape routes so that theyd not die for their causes and live in the U.S or Europe as that 's where most of them ended up days after June 4th 1989 ? 20 years later , as if it never happened ... because it was only significant to fewer than handful of Chinese when you look at the entire population of China and if you have just a little cultural knowledge about China . However , it is MOST significant for Euro-centric countries that want to utilize it for material means on contract negotiating tables in recent years and some years to come . One day on Michigan Ave in Chicago , I saw a car with bumper sticker says `` Be nice to us , or we will bring democracy to your country '' Nobody here , this site is blocked and who cares anyway .

As with any movement there are also hardcore instigators who will always refuse to admit they were wrong , and these are the ones that are glorified in the west but shunned in China . 89 as with any event in history , contributed to the outcome .

'' What the outside world needs to understand is that `` democracy '' is n't always the best option for 1.3 billion people at a point in time . Pressure from without will not change what the people want , it needs to come from within , and surely when the society advances to the point where it can support democracy , it will happen regardless of government control . You can cite Tiananmen all you want as an example of government suppression , but if the Chinese people really want democracy , it ca n't be suppressed .

The Health Protection Agency recorded more than 60 new cases alone on Tuesday , and although nobody has yet died from the virus , experts are warning against any complacency . And the hard work is only just beginning for scientists developing a vaccine . At the west London office of the drug giant GSK , there is a special unit for global planning on flu pandemic vaccines . A special sample of the swine flu or H1N1 virus has arrived at GSK in the past week , allowing scientists to begin a detailed analysis . The UK medical director , Dr Pim Kon , told me the six-month process has many uncertainties . Although the company has agreed to provide 60m doses of a vaccine , it is not yet known how many people that will cover . Dr Kon said : `` That is still to be determined , as it is based on how the production goes . The vaccine will be based on certain parts of the virus , so they 'll need to see whether those parts change `` The scientists will also be keeping a very close eye on whether the virus mutates . `` The vaccine will be based on certain parts of the virus , so they 'll need to see whether those parts change . '' The detailed scientific work is being done at GSK 's plant in Belgium , while executives in London negotiate global contracts . Health experts are monitoring H1N1 cases in countries like Brazil , where winter and normal `` seasonal '' flu is just beginning . Professor Ab Osterhaus , who is based in Rotterdam , has studied flu viruses for half of his 30-year career , and predicts various tensions in the months ahead . He said : `` If you start to produce the pandemic flu vaccine , it will go at the cost of the seasonal flu vaccine . `` Seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people around the world every year - so we still have a responsibility there as well . If we have a pandemic , there 'll be a problem with equitable distribution of these protective measures `` The production capacity is limited , and vaccines have to be produced within six months . `` There is likely to be competition between countries . `` The richer countries have ordered pre-pandemic vaccine . That is not the case for countries that do n't have so many resources . `` So if we have a pandemic , there 'll be a problem with equitable distribution of these protective measures . `` It 's a major issue for the World Health Organisation to consider . '' The Scottish health secretary , Nicola Sturgeon , has warned that H1N1 may be spreading in the community - despite efforts to contain it among known travellers and their contacts . Previous pandemics have started in a mild fashion , but developed in waves . You wait 20 years for a proper scare to come along - and when one does , people accuse you of crying wolf And although the figures do not now lead news bulletins , the number of swine flu cases continues to rise each day . After the initial flurry of coverage , questions were raised about whether the threat posed by H1N1 had been over-hyped . That is firmly denied by the health editor of the Independent newspaper , Jeremy Laurance , who wrote a strident front-page piece a month ago . He told me : `` People say there are only two kinds of medical story - the miracle cure and the deadly scare . `` You wait 20 years for a proper scare to come along - and when one does , people accuse you of crying wolf . `` I felt there was a real need to answer that charge - and that 's why I wrote the piece I did . `` This is a wholly new virus that we have n't seen before . `` And it 's estimated a third of the world 's population wo n't have immunity to it . `` That 's why we need to take it seriously . '' And in the meantime , the NHS is learning lessons . A leading light in the BMA doctors ' union , Dr Jonathan Fielden , works in intensive care at a busy hospital in the Home Counties . Dr Fielden said : `` We had a case of concern which led us to ensure we had special masks which were properly fitted . `` They give a higher level of protection than the masks we use in theater . `` So far , it 's been a useful test of our procedures , in circumstances where the flu has n't been severe at this stage . `` Our concern , as we come to the normal flu season in the winter , is that many of our resources are already under pressure . `` Although there 's been an increase in intensive care beds , we still have some of the lowest numbers in Europe per head of population . `` Those beds are often under great stress in normal circumstances - and in these circumstances , there will be pressure throughout the system .

No one can say definitively what the climate will do next . Anyone who thinks they can will probably end up looking like one of those TV scientists from the 1950s who said we 'd all be holidaying in space and flying around in hover cars by now . But why is it so very difficult to state anything with complete confidence about the behavior of our climate ? Even the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change -LRB- IPCC -RRB- , which periodically publishes ` the largest and most detailed summary of the climate change situation ever undertaken ' is only prepared to say that human beings are ` very likely ' to be the source of the problem . They are hedging for a reason . Admittedly , it 's a little firmer about the temperature itself , stating : ` Warming of the climate system is unequivocal . ' But then that 's a bit like saying that , today , it is hot . It does n't tell you very much about tomorrow . The weather is chaotic . Chaotic systems are infinitely complex and inherently unpredictable , -LRB- although not , as some suppose , random -RRB- . The climate is simply ` big , long weather ' - the atmospheric conditions of a region charted over a period of time - and is therefore also infinitely complex and inherently unpredictable . The IPCC attempts to predict this unpredictability by using climate models - fiendishly complex computer simulations of the Earth 's climate that explore 'em issions scenarios ' . Each of these scenarios looks at different levels of emissions , and from them the IPCC draws conclusions about where we might be heading . The models are not without their critics . In order to accurately model a chaotic system , you arguably have to be able to describe the starting conditions of the system and understand pretty perfectly how each of the elements in that system will act upon every other element in that system . But we do n't yet fully understand key issues , such as to what degree carbon dioxide warms the atmosphere or how clouds form and disperse , and ca n't yet accurately predict even complex human systems that themselves act on climate , like population growth and economic development . With this in mind it 's hard to see how a computer model with so much potential error in its starting conditions can accurately extrapolate what the climate will be doing in 100 years . That 's not to say they never will , although anyone who has ever relied on a British weather forecast for the next 24 hours will instinctively take any predictions with a pinch of salt .

By late Monday , the South East could be under a foot -LRB- 30cm -RRB- of snow and the North East under 20 inches -LRB- 50cm -RRB- . Thousands of school children across England and Wales woke up to the news that their school was closed for the day .

If I throw a dice I have a poor chance of predicting the outcome ; if I throw it 100 times my chances of predicting the 100th outcome are no better but I can predict the average outcome with some precision . Whether climate models can predict climate in 100 years I have no idea though I seriously doubt it but they do n't claim to predict weather but climate as in `` Britain will experience hotter , drier Summers and much wetter Winters '' . If you 're still not convinced ask yourself , `` Was the climate different in Britain during the early 19th century ? '' then ask `` Was the weather different then ?

This assumption is in every one of the 23 models that the IPCC use in the storylines . This is despite the fact that the IPCC acknowledge that cloud behavior is not understood . Does this make the models useful ? If they model on faulty assumptions then no. . For example , the only reason that the decreasing cloud model is assumed is because observations have shown that during the modern warming , cloud cover has somewhat diminished and the inference from this is that warming is the cause of the diminished cloud . However , this in logically fallacious since it is inferring cause from a correlation . It is equally plausible that something caused diminishing cloud cover and this has resulted in the warming . If this is in fact true , as it may well be , then the output from all 23 models will be erroneous . The storylines that result in predictions of 2.5 to 6 degrees C of warming , may turn out to be less than 2 degrees . Therefore , the cloud sensitivity issue is of paramount importance .

Ancillary questions , such as ; Why are we not concentrated on deforestation ? Why are we not concentrated on over fishing ? Why does over 1\\/3 of the world have no reliable source of clean drinking water ?

There are undoubtedly large uncertainties in how the climate will respond -LRB- as the IPCC reports make very clear -RRB- , but what the weather is doing today is not one of those uncertainties .

The blog seemed to imply that IPCC style climate projections are like weather forecasts and thus suffer from not knowing the initial conditions . This is not correct . I disagree that ` projections ' have no predictive ability . If they predict some of the evolution of the climate due to changing radiative forcings , then this IS predictive ability . Of course they will not get the year to year fluctuations , but that is not what they are trying to predict . Also - what do you mean by ` no forcing changes in isolation ' ? By the IPCC definition this is not true . Changes in the solar forcing are independent from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions . If a change in the solar forcing causes a change in , e.g. water vapor in the atmosphere , then this is a feedback rather than a forcing . In any case , short term fluctuations are not as important as the long term trend . At 1:46 pm on 11 Jun 2009 , SamuelPickwick wrote : xyz999 , if you know what is meant by a ` climate projection ' and how it differs from a prediction , perhaps you would be kind enough to explain . The climate is just as unpredictable as the weather . It also involves complicated nonlinear chaotic interactions , but different ones . It 's just that the time-scales are longer . Richard is quite right about this . Nobody -LRB- I think -RRB- is arguing that carbon dioxide does not lead to a warming . The question is to do with the temperature sensitivity . Your experiment would provide the sensitivity to say a CO2 doubling without feedback . Even this figure is not known exactly . For example , Lindzen gives 1 degree C for a doubling , and I believe the high end is around 1.5 degrees . No , the contention is over the way the models impute positive feedbacks . The first feedback we can consider is low level cloud cover . All 23 models used by IPCC utilise a positive feedback - increased warming from CO2 leads to reduced cloud cover , which allows increased insolation which leads to more warming which leads to a further reduction of cloud cover which leads to ... There is no proof that the world works in this way . The assumption -LRB- and that is what it is -RRB- comes from an observation that cloud cover is less when the climate is warmer . However , correlation does not imply cause and effect . It is equally plausible that the cloud cover decrease has another driver and which then causes the observed warming . If this is the case , then the models would have got cause and effect the wrong way round . The other main feedback is increased water vapor which leads to more warming which leads to more water vapor etc. . This sounds intuitive , and I suppose that 's why it was included in the models . However , there is not any empirical evidence that this is what actually happens . Why do I say that ? The Aquasat system , which is designed to detect just this increase in water vapor has so far not detected any , so this assumption is suspect . Further more , GHG warming predicts a decrease in outgoing long wave radiation emitted into space , since the greenhouse gases are effectively trapping heat . This also has not been observed since 2003 . If the models are programmed with the wrong assumptions , then their predictions will be seriously wrong . Whether climate is like weather or not -LRB- it is n't -RRB- does n't matter a jot if the physics is wrong . I thought I would get a second opinion on the extent of Arctic Sea ice so I checked the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Centre in Bergen . Seems like the Arctic sea ice extent is still above 2007 and 2008 although this has n't been updated since last Saturday . Re # 31 : Right ... this is the difference ... Both climate ` projections ' and ` predictions ' use the same climate models with the same future greenhouse gases , solar output etc. . The only difference is their starting point . A ` prediction -LRB- or forecast -RRB- ' starts from our best estimate of today 's state of the oceans , atmosphere , ice etc -LRB- in principle -RRB- . This is equivalent to an extended weather forecast . So ... if -LRB- say -RRB- the Atlantic Ocean is in a relatively hot or cold phase then the effect of this will be included in the prediction . A ` projection ' starts from a random state of the model and does n't worry about whether the Atlantic is currently relatively hot or cold . -LRB- In fact the models are generally started in 1850 and run forwards to the present day only using information about historical greenhouse gas levels , volcanoes , solar output etc , and continued into the future with projected changes in GHGs etc. . And , the fact that they follow the trajectory of the historical climate since 1850 gives us confidence that they have some chance of projecting the future . -RRB- Currently , the IPCC only uses PROJECTIONS . The reason being that the difference between the two -LRB- i.e. the starting conditions -RRB- only matters for a few years at most , as the -LRB- chaotic -RRB- weather slowly destroys the extra information contained in the current phase of -LRB- say -RRB- the Atlantic . As the next few years is not what the IPCC is generally interested in , they have used PROJECTIONS . PREDICTIONS are much harder to do , but will be included in the next IPCC assessment as the next few years are becoming more relevant . This may be as clear as mud , but it is why Richard is wrong . The future climate -LRB- beyond 10 years or so -RRB- does not care about today 's exact conditions . Likening a climate PROJECTION to an extended weather forecast is inaccurate and is why people here are saying things like ` but they ca n't even predict the weather 2 weeks ahead ' . It does n't matter for the climate in 50 years time , which IS predictable , as we are trying to predict the average of the -LRB- unpredictable -RRB- weather .

You say that the future climate does not care about today 's exact conditions , which is true . However , you can not conclude from this that the climate in 50 years time is predictable . Your logic seems to be : weather is unpredictable , but climate is not weather so therefore it is predictable . The evidence you cite for their predictive skill comes solely from the historical runs from 1850 . However , these runs , when we look a bit more closely , are no more than curve fitting exercises . A GCM has a large number of tunable parameters , and if you play around with the tuning long enough you can get a pretty good match to some dataset . This is a classic trap for backtesters of trading systems . They start with one sample of data and tune and tune the parameters until they acheive an extreemly optimistic outcome expectancy . If they do n't then apply the run to a set of other samples they are in trouble as soon as they start trading with real data . The problem with the GCM 's is the same problem as the backtester who uses only one sample . The backtester can correct by adding samples , but unfortunately for the modelers , there is only 1 sample available . The models are failing as soon as they try and project the future . None predicted the current decade of static then falling temperatures . And this is going to happen again and again because they have no predictive skill .

'' The starting conditions DO NOT matter for climate in 100 years time . As for the GCMs - I did not mean to imply that because weather is unpredictable therefore climate is predictable . The problem with your arguments over curve fitting is that the models are NOT tuned to reproduce the 20th century - they are tuned to get the pre-industrial or present day climate as accurately as possible . Implying that they keep tuning the models and rerunning them for the 20th century until they get the ` right ' answer is just not true . As for the current decade - what evidence do you have that GCMs do n't project the lack of warming in the current decade ? The average of all the models , by design , will not predict any of the natural fluctuations in the climate - have you examined each individual projection to see whether any have decades when there is no warming , or even a cooling ? Others have , and surprise , surprise , they do project decades when there is a cooling : There are simply periods where the natural variations in the climate system temporarily offset the anthropogenic signals , and the models DO show this . And , the Met Office have a climate PREDICTION system , which DID predict an offset of anthropogenic warming for the current period : the first link refers to a publication this year . Of course they will now say that models predict periods of cooling since they have to deal with that reality . My point is that I can not find any such statements made before 2003 . The second link is actually a prediction , that half of the future years will be warmer than the warmest so far . That is itself is a cop out imo because they have a 50 % chance of being right . The Hadley center I believe have predicted a decade of cooling due to the PDO entering a negative phase , so if I were a betting man , I would say that the Met Office will miss even this prediction . Climate models predict a continue storage of heat in the global system . Natural variations can not alter this , they can only hide it . In other words a cooling of surface temperatures may occur due to a natual variation that sequesters heat energy . This has to be so because the radiative forcing mandates that more energy is currently entering the system than is leaving . Hansen himself has written : `` The decadal mean planetary energy imbalance , 0.75 W\\/m2 , includes heat storage in the deeper ocean and energy used to melt ice and warm the air and land . 0.85 W\\/m2 is the imbalance at the end of the decade . So we would expect to find this heat turn up in the deep oceans . Hansen wrote this in 2003 I believe . According to Pielke , heat should be accumulated at the following rate of joules : 2003 ~ 0.98 \\* 10 \\*\\* 22 Joules 2004 ~ 1.96 \\* 10 \\*\\* 22 Joules 2005 ~ 2.94 \\* 10 \\*\\* 22 Joules 2006 ~ 3.92 \\* 10 \\*\\* 22 Joules 2007 ~ 4.90 \\* 10 \\*\\* 22 Joules 2008 ~ 5.88 \\* 10 \\*\\* 22 Joules But his observed estimation of accumulation of joules over the period 2003 to 2008 is zero .

Where would centralized profit come from if a rampant weed were utilised in place of a constrained and expensive resource in just that one example ? Here is one example of a pre-2003 projection showing both no warming and cooling decades in a projection : Thanks for the link . This does not look to me like a decade long period of non warming . What this shows is an upward trend from 2000 to 2010 , with a series of higher highs at 2000 , 2005 and 2010 . This suggest that the models were written to reflect the well known at the time ENSO events of a year or 2 , and definately not the longer term cycles such as PDO and AMO . Look , we 've had a decade of non warming , and several years of cooling . Hadley are predicting another decade of cooling . This is nothing like the graph you posted . The point I was trying to make in my last post is that projection of surface temps is a red herring itself , since this is a poor metric for measuring climate change . Let 's get to the core issue . The fundamental core of the climate models is that there is an ongoing radiative imbalance . Hansen has stated -LRB- in 2003 -RRB- that this should reach +0.85 watts\\/sq . This imbalance MUST result in accumulated joules of heat in the climate system . All I was trying to say in my last post was that this should be found in the oceans , but it is n't . Initially the argo network reported an apparent cooling anomaly since 2003 but this was later found to be the result of pressure sensor errors . This was corrected and the cooling disappeared . The argo readings now agree with gravimetric and altimetry measurements but still does not show the expected warming , as reported by Willis , Chambers & Nerem -LRB- 2008 -RRB- `` Assessing the globally averaged sea level budget on seasonal to interannual timescales . '' Thus since 2003 , there has been little if any global warming as diagnosed using ocean heat content . Since ocean heat content change has been shown to be a robust metric of global warmng and cooling , then in this sense , the models are not in agreement with empirical data . And , as I 've already said , the previously predicted ups and downs of a couple of years are nothing like the decadal divergences we are actually witnessing . I think you 're missing the point I 'm trying to make about these temperature PROJECTIONS - they 're not trying to predict the evolution of certain decades , they are examples of how the climate might evolve . So ... if you were asking for examples of projections which showed that even on a global scale climate models could show decades where there was a cooling , then I have demonstrated that they do -LRB- e.g. the 2080s in the last link -RRB- , and hence the current decade is not unexpected . If you wanted a PREDICTION of the current decade , then no-one has even tried to do that until the last couple of years , so there are no examples before then . As for the ocean heat content , there is clearly something to understand better there . No more from me on this topic . At 4:41 pm on 21 Jun 2009 , LarryKealey wrote : Jack_NZ , you are close in your distiction between weather and climate . Weather is the short term manifestation of the current state of the climate . You are right on in stating that if they ca n't predict the weather 5 months -LRB- or 5 weeks -RRB- from now , they have no hope of making accurate predictions nor projections of any validity for the climate 50 or 100 years hence . While they are different problems , in theory , making weather predictions is a much simplier problem than predicting -LRB- or projecting -RRB- climate change . To xyz999 , you are quite wrong in your distinction between projections and predictions . You state that the projections do not require accurate initial conditions . The earth 's climate is a very complex Chaotic Dynamic System . One of the key characteristics of Chaotic Dynamic Systems is `` sensitivity to initial conditions '' . Tweek the initial conditions only slightly and you can see dramatic changes in the output of the system . Also consider that the earth and its climate system is an incredibly complex system . The models used to day have hundreds or even thousands of interrealted variables . The interrelations of these variables are very poorly understood today . Additionally , modellers of today really focus only on CO2 as the primary driver ; hence these models all use a positive feedback with large sensitivity to CO2 . That is to say that small changes in CO2 -LRB- a trace gas -RRB- cause large feedbacks in the atmospheric water cycle - a cycle which is very poorly understood . We may yet find that the feedback associated with CO2 is negative , indicating a very low sensitivity to CO2 . While today , it may not seem intuitive , increased CO2 could acutally trigger other mechanisms in earth 's climate system which could usher in the next ice age . Or , CO2 may not be the `` primary driver '' for climate change at all , and doubling of CO2 could have a negligable effect on temperatures and climate as a whole . The whole point is that we do not know enough today to create models which produce accurate predictions nor projections . Basically , they are all meaningless at this point . Until the hard science -LRB- not tweeking models , but real world experimentation and study -RRB- is done , we have no hope of understanding the earth 's climate processes in any meaningful way . I applaud the author for presenting the reality of the current situation with climate modelling . He clearly points out that most models are used to explore possible reprecutions of various `` emissions scenariors '' . The implication -LRB- or assumption , if you prefer -RRB- here is that CO2 and GHG emissions will be the primary driver for future climate change . In fact , from what I can read , all the `` doomsday '' models are predicated upon CO2 being the ONLY first order forcing agent for climate change . An assumption which I find highly doubtful . While keep in mind that proxies are just that - effects of climate impacts on various things - such as tree rings and growth . Much of our understand of past climate is based upon proxies . Perhaps one of the best proxies we have today is the Vostok Ice Cores from Antartica . Now , before we look at the cores and jump to any conclusions , consider the uncertainties in the source of the data . First , while atmospheric CO2 is trapped in the ice at the time the ice is formed , it also can move through the core , contaminating the evidence -LRB- CO2 concentrations -RRB- at other -LRB- nearby -RRB- levels within the core . One must also consider that ice is not constantly being formed , during warm periods , we have some melt , re-freezing , even during cold periods , we can have sublimation . So , it is not an exact record . It is just a proxy - but probably one of the best we have available today . In analyzing the ice core , one will find two things that stand out . First , that CO2 levels generally lag increases in temperatures by about 800 years , rather than preceeding -LRB- i.e. driving -RRB- temperatures . The second thing the stands out -LRB- to me -RRB- is that atmospheric CO2 levels reached their peak , just before each of the last several ice ages . CO2 levels -LRB- and temperatures -RRB- were greater during the last interglacial period , 125,000 years ago , than they are today . This did not prevent the rapid onset of the last ice age . Simple fact : we just do n't know enough today to make any meaningful predictions nor projections . The author is quite correct in stating we should take all these models with `` a grain of salt '' - perhaps we should take them with a pound of salt ... lol . One of the earliest climate modellers was one of the pioneers of Chaos Theory , a gentleman by the name of Lorenz . In 1961 , while crunching a series of runs of a climate model on a computer , he decided to take a short cut - and start the model in the middle of the time series run . He used values for the initial conditions for the new run from the state of the model during a previous run . Copied them exactly from the previous run into the new run and went to get a cup of coffee . When he returned , he found something completely unexpected - the new run had very quicky diverged from the previous run - and was compelete different - no similarity in output . The reason , quite simply : Sensitivity to initial conditions -LRB- aka , the butterfly effect -RRB- - the numbers he punched in were `` calculated values '' , i.e. rather than exact values -LRB- digital vs analog -RRB- . The changes in initial conditions were extremely small , yet had a dramatic affect on the output . Prime example of `` sensitivity to initial conditions '' . An assoiate of his , Dr. Robert White -LRB- who later became director of NOAA -RRB- believed that because of this `` butterfly effect '' , we could control the weather and the climate by taking very small actions -LRB- i.e. a butterfly flapping its wings in china sets in motion a series of events which causes an outbreak of tornadoes in the Midwest US -RRB- . A belief that turned out to be quite wrong . Lorenz saw the falicy of this belief in that , while we could `` tweek '' the conditions only slightly and change the results dramatically , we could not predict the results of the `` tweeking '' . Another characteristic of chaotic dynamic systems is that while they are inheriently unpredictable , they are highly deterministic . Basically , take a look at the Lorenz Attractor -LRB- you can google a picture quite easily -RRB- , tweeking the initial conditions and parameters associated with the equation yeilds unpredicitiblity - you ca n't predict the path of the plot on the attractor , yet the plot will still lay with the confines of the `` attractor '' . Note that even today , the dynamics of the system -LRB- a model -RRB- used the generate the Lorenz Attractor are still very poorly understood . And this system had only three equations with three variables . Climate models today have thousands of variables - to think we can `` predict '' the results of this system is simply laughable . Put simply , we can induce changes in the initial conditions of the system -LRB- i.e. CO2 concentrations and emissions scenarios -RRB- , we can not predict the results of those changes with ANY degree of accuracy . The mechanisms , processes and interractions within the system far from being understood in any meaningful way . We will probably never be able to accurately predict the weather nor the climate changes that will come . Consider this - just by measuring a thing , we affect it -LRB- a well known tenat of physics - the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle -RRB- . Thus , we can never accurately measure the initial conditions of the system to any degree of accuracy , thus , given inherent sesitivity to intial conditions , we have no hope . Make all the predictions or projections you want - but they still have no bearing on reality . In today 's world , most every natural disaster is blamed on `` Global Warming '' or `` Climate Change '' . In my lifetime , which unfortunately is almost over , I have seen a dramatic increase in the impacts of severe weather ; however , I do not believe there has been a dramatic increase in the occurance of severe weather . Take New Orleans and Hurricane Katrina - often used as a `` poster child '' by the `` Climate Change Gang '' . New Orleans was -LRB- and still is -RRB- a disaster waiting to happen . First , much of the city is currently 15 ft UNDER SEA LEVEL . Hello ?? It is protected by a series of levies and dikes . The city was built upon a peat bog . As the bog dried out , it compacted . What was once 10 ft above sea level is now 15 ft below sea level . Katrina was a powerful hurricane , but still only a 3 on the Saphir-Simpson scale . The 1900 storm that hit Galveston -LRB- and killed 6,000 people , living on an island 5 ft above sea level -RRB- , the 1919 Keys storm , Hurricane Allen and Hurricane Carla were all more powerful - as have been many others - but none caused as much damage . In 1969 , I lived in Florida at Patrick AFB , next to Cape Kennedy . I watched Apollo 11 lift off for the moon from my back yard . At that time , one could drive down A-1-A along the coast and there were very few buildings and structures in sight . People did not have the arrogance to believe they could withstand the forces nature would occationally release . Take the same drive today -LRB- as I did last fall -RRB- and you will find just about every piece of land near the beach -LRB- low lying land -RRB- has been developed . Common sense tells us that hurricanes will continue to strike the area - and will be `` more destructive '' , but not because the hurricances are more powerful , but because there is more there to be destoryed . Even the ancient egyptians were smart enough to not build permanant structures within the flood plain of the Nile river . They knew that floods would be variable and they had no hope of `` controlling '' them . In fact , they prayed for the great floods , because it meant dramatic improvements in soil conditions and the yeild of food from the plain would be significantly greater following the great floods . It astounds me that we here in the US are arrogant enough to believe that we can `` control '' the mighty Mississippi river with dikes and levies , channeling all that water into smaller and smaller channels . Building in the flood plain is a bad idea - as is building structures on the beach at levels 4-10 ft above sea level . One thing is certain , as long as we continue to battle mother nature in this arrogant fashion , we will lose . Every 20 years or so , there will be a big hurricane or big floods on the Mississippi . Nothing we can do or build can withstand the power of the rising waters . And by rising water here , I am referring to floods caused by snow melt in the areas drained by the Mississippi as well as the storm surge and dramatic rainfall caused by hurricanes - not `` rising sea levels '' . In my view , and I have spent my whole life on the water , I see no rise in sea levels . I can take you to tide markers on Galveston Bay that have been in place for 50 to 100 years . They are not underwater today - ergo , the sea level has had no significant rise in the last 100 years . When I hear of the poor plight of the people of the Island Country of Tuvalu , often used another poster child for the `` Climate Change Gang '' , I have to wonder : How stupid do they -LRB- `` The Climate Change Gang '' -RRB- think I am ? Tuvalu is a small string if islands , mostly atolls . The highest elevation on the islands is about 4.5 M above sea level . They are considered to be on the front line of climate change and supposedly have already felt the impacts of rising sea levels . Like all islands in the Pacific Ocean , the islands are subject to a variety of mechanisms which have lead to erosion and sinking of the land . Put very simply , it is not rising sea levels that pose the danger to Tuvalu - it is subsidence and erosion - both natural forces at work . take a look at the Hawaiian Islands . The only island that is growing is the -LRB- currently volcanically active -RRB- `` Big Island '' . The Hawaiian islands actually stretch 1600 miles , from the Big Island all the way to Midway . Millions of years ago , Midway was `` the Big Island '' , but the volcanism that created the Hawaiian Islands migrated -LRB- with the tectonic plates -RRB- eastward , leaving Midway to succumb to the ravages of erosion -LRB- from both wind , rain and sea -RRB- . To blame the plight of the people of Tuvalu on sea level rise caused by `` climate change '' is downright misleading . Because of erosion , the islands will probably disappear . I say `` probably '' because , when the next ice age comes , we can expect sea levels to drop dramatically as great ice sheets form over North America and Europe . Perhaps the islands will re-emerge from the ocean for a time . No , because of the nature of Chaotic Dynamic Systems , the inability to make precise measurements and the complexities and interreactions involved in the `` Earth 's Climate System '' - we will never have the ability to make accurate predictions -LRB- nor projections -RRB- . Let us focus on spending our money and resources on real environmental issues such as better management of land use , forests , fisheries , pollution control -LRB- no , I am not talking about CO2 - which is not a pollutant , but an essential trace gas required for life as we know it , to exist on earth -RRB- and adaptation . While I will not delude myself into believing that I can change the -LRB- religious -RRB- beliefs of the `` Climate Change Gang '' , I hope that my words will invoke thought and some modicum of a return to common sense -LRB- not so common anymore -RRB- in the `` common man '' . Personally , I think at best , the `` Climate Change Gang '' are deluding themselves . I am astounded by their arrogance to believe that the `` science is settled '' or that the `` skeptics are wrong '' . When there is no room for skeptics in science , it is no longer science , but religion . Before we spend trillions of dollars -LRB- or pounds -RRB- on a percieved problem -LRB- CO2 emissions -RRB- , should we not develop a better understanding of the climate mechanisms involved ? In my view , it is sheer , unfounded arrogance to believe we can `` control climate change '' and that CO2 is the only first order climate driver . We understand so little and we have so many other pressing environmental and humanistic issues that are much more urgent that we need to spend our money and resources on . The older I get and the more I learn , the more I realize how little I really know and how much more there is to learn ...

'' A rugby ball rolled downhill will go down hill . That the ball 's path down hill will depends HIGHLY on how you let it go and all sorts of uncontrolled changes in forces upon it does n't make it roll uphill . @yeah_whatever : `` A rugby ball rolled downhill will go down hill . '' Probably true , unless it hits an obstruction which deflects it uphill , in which case , the energy of the ball -LRB- as determined by its inertia upon striking the obstruction and the energy lost in the impact -RRB- will determine how far uphill the ball will travel ... at which point , it may reach an `` equilibrium point '' and rest upon the ground , have additional energy , bounce and continue uphill , or it may begin to roll back down the hill . There are a lot of factors which will affect the behavior of the ball . And without a very RIGID set of assumptions , the behavior of the ball is in fact unpredictable . Of course , I make the assumption here that by a `` hill '' you mean a real hill , the surface of which is best described as fractal in nature , as opposed to a concrete `` perfect '' hill in which , from any point , there is always an unobstructed path -LRB- path of least resistance -RRB- downwards -LRB- like a `` smooth '' concrete hump - or something you might put in a computer model -RRB- . Well , I have seen a few hills in England and Wales , and from my observations , most are much like hills we have in Texas and California ... they are not perfectly smooth domes , if you roll a ball down , it will bounce , its path is unpredictable - it might even travel up-hill . Ah , but the devil is always in the details , particularly in the real world . We can only really say that a ball launched from a hill will follow the laws of physics and if unobstructed , will exchange potential energy for kinetic energy and accelerate . However , we can also state that eventually the ball will reach an obstruction and due to friction and exchange of energy through impacts , it will eventually come to rest -LRB- equilibrium -RRB- . We really ca n't say whether that will be at the top of the hill , somewhere on the slopes , or at the bottom , ca n't really say with any certainty . Depends upon the structure of the hill , the kinetic energy we impart upon the ball as we launch it , various aspects of the rugby ball -LRB- as well as many other factors -RRB- and every hill is different ... as is every toss , every ball . Now , please point out the falicies of my argument regarding the `` ball and the hill '' . Now consider that we have just been talking about a very simple problem . One that should easily be modelled . Yet the best we could really do is to say that `` under certain conditions - i.e. , on THIS HILL , under these wind conditions and humidity -LRB- blah blah blah -RRB- , if we launch THIS BALL with this trajectory and this much force it has a X % chance of following this path and reaching equilibrium at this point '' -LRB- X being a very small number -RRB- . Now think about that for a moment , and then consider the Earth 's Climate System - and just how complicated a system we are talking about . Most researches would agree with the following statement , regardless of their postion on `` climate change '' : The earth 's climate is a very complex non-linear dynamic system containing a lot of very poorly understood processes and mechanisms . So , if we ca n't solve the dynamics of a simple problem such as rolling a rugby ball down a hill with any degree of certainty , what hope have we of predicting , much less controlling the earth 's climate system ? `` IS clearly wrong . The starting conditions DO NOT matter for climate in 100 years time . '' And : -LRB- with regards to the models , those developed by the Met Office in particular -RRB- `` surprise , surprise , they do project decades when there is a cooling : First , the starting conditions DO MATTER A GREAT DEAL . This is one of the premises of all the GCM 's as well as one of the cornerstones of the science : sensitivity to initial conditions . The models all treat CO2 as the primary forcing agent , and assign a large positive feedback to CO2 - so small changes in initial conditions produce dramatic changes in the results , thus initial conditions are VERY IMPORTANT . Regarding the link you provided - yes of course , after a decade of cooling , they -LRB- the Met office -RRB- developed a `` model '' to `` account for this '' . That does not mean that they have the ability to accurately predict future climate change - and they will be the first to admit to this . Just read all the caveats in their report associated with the models and projections . `` First , the starting conditions DO MATTER A GREAT DEAL . '' Just like the initial conditions of rolling a ball down a hill even when the ball is oddly shaped and the ground uneven does n't have a great deal to say about the fact that the ball rolls down the hill . `` This is one of the premises of all the GCM 's '' `` as well as one of the cornerstones of the science '' Wrong too . The predictability of chaotic systems is a cornerstone of modern science . Have you not generated F = ma from the Schroedinger equations ? You have to treat the F = ma as the aggregate average result , but the Schroedinger equations give no concrete value for position . Heck , the National Lottery uses chaos to make a random number , but the results are predictable enough that the rewards for a result are set before the numbers are rolled and yet the company can STILL make profits . Same for the Ideal Gas Law . Random energy distribution , random collisions , random EVERYTHING . Yet from that , we get A surprising result if chaos means we ca n't predict things . What about Great Attractors ? The Lorentz attractor shows INCREDIBLE predictions about the random chaotic system it is a display of . See if you can think of some . The cornerstone of quantum mechanics is that randomness can be predictable if you think about what you can predict . Chaos ' breakthrough was what you CAN predict from a chaotic system . `` That does not mean that they have the ability to accurately predict future climate change '' Yup , they call them projections . Just like they can predict that if saturated fats are removed from a diet , you get a healthier populace and that you can save X pounds from your healthcare system , EVEN THOUGH they can not predict who will be better off and who worse or unchanged .

This paper is only evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the models \\* relative to each other \\* . It has nothing to do with the models ' absolute predicitive abilities or validation thereof . It 's studying whether we should treat some models as more reliable than others , nothing more . Nor does Gavin Schmidt 's quote mean that the climate is unpredictable after two weeks - he 's talking about the chaotic component only , which is why you need to look at long-term averages over 20 years . At that kind of timescale you 're no longer looking at the chaotic component , but at the more stable component of the climate , which is predictable . To explain it simplistically : weather forecasts answer the question `` will I need my umbrella tomorrow ? '' , whereas climate predictions answer the question `` how many times will I need my umbrella between 2040 and 2060 ? '' . You ca n't produce reliable weather forecasts for the year 2050 -LRB- obviously ! -RRB- , but you can produce reliable climate predictions for the decades around 2050 . That 's what Gavin Schmidt was saying . It seems various blogs and commenters are taking both the GRL paper you cited and Dr Schmidt 's quote out of context -LRB- or just misunderstanding their meaning -RRB- , which is a shame . What I got from seeing excerpts from Gavin Schmidts interview as well as reading Mr. Schmidt 's words where quite different than the meaning you imply . Might I provide one direct quote from Dr. Schmidt : -LRB- if you feel this is taken out of context , feel free to repost whatever additional paragraphs should be included before or after these two - but I think they make his points accurately and stand on their own -RRB- . `` How do we come up with new expectations when our models are no longer valid ? We need new information on which to base decisions being made now that will affect how we deal with the climate in 10 , 20 , 30 , 50 years time because we are now building infrastructure for with these kinds of timeframes . We have to ask questions about what expectations we may have for the future based on the physics that we presently know , on processes we can measure , and that resonate with our ability to understand the current climate . Among the questions we need to ask are : Why are there seasonal cycles ? Why are there storms ? What controls the frequency of such events over a winter , over a longer period ? What controls the frequency of , say , El Nino events in the tropical Pacific that impacts on rainfall in California or in Peru or in Indonesia ? '' ----- End of Gavid Schmidt quote ------------------- It seems to me that he is really saying two imprtant things here - first that we can not `` produce reliable climate predictions for 2050 '' . Please read the first paragraph and if you feel I have mis-interpreted it , please provide you reasoning . The second thing I got from this is the earth 's climate system -LRB- and weather -RRB- are very poorly understood at this point in time . I took his words -LRB- mind you these were his words , not those of a commentator or pundit -RRB- to mean that we have barely begun to scratch the surface of all we need to learn and all there is to learn . Science will never be settled . I also must disagree with your assertion that `` At that kind of timescale -LRB- 20 years -RRB- , you 're not longer looking at the chaotic component , but at the more stable component of the climate which is predictable '' -LRB- @eumenydes -RRB- . It just does n't work that way with chaotic dynamic systems . Small changes in initial conditions of a chaotic dynamic system can produce significant changes in long term output . This is referred to as `` Sensitivied to initial conditions '' . In working with a chaotic dynamic system -LRB- such as a model of earth 's climate -RRB- - you are usually dealing with a set of non-linear equations - in the case of climate models - a vary large set of non-linear equations - requiring supercomputer to `` iterate '' to solutions of all the variables involved for each run . Ideally , one wants to `` reduce '' the order -LRB- size or number of equations and variables -RRB- and thus simplify the system -LRB- figure out what is really important -RRB- . This can be achieved by applying the `` Center Manifold Theorem '' . This theorem basicaly states that most dynamic systems are composed of three manifolds -LRB- stable , unstable , chaotic -RRB- and that if one can reduce the equation to the center manifold -LRB- chaotic -RRB- - we can reduce the complexity somewhat - and still preserve the dynamics of the system . -LRB- I wrote a package in Mathematics -LRB- R -RRB- as part of my Senior Thesis at the University to do just that - in symbolic form -RRB- . It is the chaotic component of the system which is most important and the reason why we can not make reliable , accurate `` predictions '' of future climate states . I do n't wish to come across as being too arrogant here , but it was my field of study and I have made my career in modeling and to a certain extent - chaos theory . If not for the chaotic component , we would be able to really model the climate and make meaningful predictions . His point was that because of the chaotic nature , we will never be able to make meaningful `` predictions '' nor even projections . That is why I am a skeptic of the science . I am also very skeptical of the the suggested policies and programs currently being investigated -LRB- only one really : cap and trade -RRB- . There are other solutions . There are other answers . We have much left to learn , but why create a whole economy around `` carbon trading '' when we are pretty sure it ai n't gonna work ? There are other approaches - even if you are not skeptical of the AGW\\/CACC theories out there today . Why not focus on developing the third world with cheap energy - which will make it feasable for them to preserve and restore natural environments -LRB- like rainforsts and peat bogs . . -RRB- as well as reduce suffering and strife ? I am a skeptic , but so what - even if CO2 is the `` great evil '' - I have yet to see a real plan to `` solve '' the problem . Cap and Trade is not going to do it - its just going to make those whe area already really rich , even richer and the rest of us even poorer . Ok - I 'll get off my soapbox - sorry that was so long . I would also add that Gavin Schmidt discusses output from two models : one says the southestern US will be dryer with a rise in temperature - while another - fed the same data - projects that it will be wetter - they both ca n't be right .

In the first paragraph you provided he is n't talking about climate models not being valid , he 's talking about the existing engineering models -LRB- used for building infrastructure -RRB- which are based on historical climatology , which will no longer be valid in 10 , 20 , 30 years time because of climate change . Here is the full context : `` Everywhere you go you see societies based around certain expectations for what their climate is . How far do you build away from the shore ? How do you design your agriculture ? What kind of air conditioning system do you put in a building ? All of these things depend on the expectations you have for what temperature it is going to be during the summer time or how high a storm surge reaches when you have a Northeasterly storm . All of these things require an expectation that has been built over hundreds of years but that now is changing . When you have expectations based on past information that are n't any longer going to be valid expectations or you have a suspicion that they are no longer going to be valid , how do you come up with new expectations ? How do you inform decisions that are being made now that will affect how people react to climate in 10 , 20 , 30 , 50 years time ? '' He then goes on to explain how we have constructed climate models in order to answer that question . In the second paragraph you quoted , the questions he is asking are rhetorical ones - he 's not saying we do n't understand why there are seasonal cycles or why are there storms , he giving examples of the kind of questions that any climate model has to know the answer to if it 's going to provide a valid simulation of the climate system . If we really did n't know why there are seasonal cycles , then you 're quite right we would just be scratching the surface of climate science and would n't really have a clue how the climate works ! Fortunately we do understand most of these things , which is what Gavin Schmidt was saying - he was just listing the kinds of issues we have to build in to the models , as he goes on to say later : `` We have been quite successful at building these models on the basis of small-scale processes to produce large-scale simulation of the emerging properties of the climate system . We understand why we have a seasonal cycle ; we understand why we have storms in the mid-latitudes ; we understand what controls the ebb and flow of the seasonal sea ice distribution in the Arctic . We have good estimates in this regard . '' -RRB- Science will never be settled . I quite agree - in many areas of science every question you answer throws up two more . But that does n't mean we never know anything ! As it stands , theoretical physicists ca n't reconcile Einstein 's Theory of General Relativity with the Standard Model of particle physics -LRB- ie they ca n't reconcile gravity with the other three fundamental forces -RRB- . I fully expect that in the future we will have a theoretically self-consistent theory of quantum gravity , but until then it 's a mystery . That does n't mean gravity does n't exist , or that it 's not caused by an object 's mass , or that we 're actually being held on to the Earth 's surface by invisible fairies . The fact that we do n't know absolutely everything about gravity does n't mean we know nothing about it . Likewise you 're absolutely right to point out that on smaller regional scales climate models sometimes give contradictory predictions for things like rainfall . There is very high confidence in model predictions of global mean temperature , high confidence in their predictions of regional temperature changes , and reasonable high confidence in larger scale precipitation predictions - eg on zonal average or continental scales - but no , we ca n't say for sure what 's going to happen to rainfall in the American Southwest . After more work has been done on this question -LRB- and many others ! -RRB- and more improvements made to the models , I 'm sure we will be able to answer that - but we 're not quite there yet . That does n't mean the models ' other predictions are worthless . Hmm , this post is getting a bit long , sorry ! I 'll reply to your points about chaotic systems in a new post ...

His point was that because of -RRB- the chaotic nature , we will never be able to make -RRB- meaningful `` predictions '' nor even projections . With respect , I 'm not doubting your own knowledge of chaos theory , but on the timescales we are talking about the climate is \\* not \\* a chaotic system . It has a chaotic component which makes it impossible to make \\* deterministic weather forecasts \\* after a week or so because of the initial condition sensitivity you mentioned . That is why no climate scientist -LRB- much less the IPCC -RRB- would ever say `` on 28 July 2035 the temperature in London will be 22 degrees and there will be intermittent rain showers '' . That is weather forecasting , and is absolutely not what the climate models do . Climate predictions are over 20-year averages , which is a long enough time period for the stable , predictable component to become dominant over the chaotic component . Here is the full quote from Gavin Schmidt 's interview : `` The problem with climate prediction and projections going out to 2030 and 2050 is that we do n't anticipate that they can be tested in the way you can test a weather forecast . It takes about 20 years to evaluate because there is so much unforced variability in the system the chaotic component of the climate system that is not predictable beyond two weeks , even theoretically . This is something we ca n't really get a handle on . We can only look at the climate problem once we have had a long enough time for that chaotic noise to be washed out , so that we can see that there is a full signal that is significantly larger than the inter-annual or the inter-decadal variability . '' In other words , we ca n't predict climate from year to year or even from decade to decade because the chaotic component is too strong . On periods of 20 years or longer the chaotic noise is canceled out and we can look at the predictable component . That 's exactly what climate models are designed for , and exactly what climate predictions do . That 's not to say there are n't many uncertainties , but the climate is most definitely not inherently unpredictable on these timescales . For a better explanation than my -LRB- probably rather botched ! -RRB- Cap and -RRB- Trade is not going to do it - its just going to make those whe -RRB- area already really rich , even richer and the rest of us even poorer . Firstly , I have never heard any scientist say that CO2 is a `` great evil '' or even any kind of evil . CO2 = bad is a straw man argument that various cranks -LRB- such as in that Ch 4 `` swindle '' program -RRB- have come up with to try and discredit climate scientists . I 'm sure you did n't mean it that way so I 'm sorry to harp on about a throw-away comment , but I 've heard this so many times that it 's starting to bug me , lol ; - -RRB- CO2 is a necessary gas for the continuation of almost all existing ecosystems . It 's just that too much of it in the lower atmosphere causes an increase in global temperature and other effects . Likewise water is vital for life on Earth - that does n't change the fact that if you get too much in your lungs you 'll drown . A pollutant is n't an evil , it 's just too much of something in the wrong place . As to the policy aspect - I 'm not going to try and discuss policy or cap and trade as I do n't know enough about it to offer an informed opinion I 'm afraid . I too have reservations about its effectiveness and you may well be right that it wo n't help reduce CO2 emissions . However what I would say is that the scientific questions and the policy ones are completely separate and I wish people would keep them that way . Scientists answer the questions `` what is happening , and what will happen if we continue emitting CO2 ? '' . Politicians et al answer the question `` what shall we do about it ? '' . I would use the analogy of a medical diagnosis : A patient comes in who is overweight , drinks too much and smokes regularly , has high blood pressure and cholesterol and never does any exercise . The doctor will likely tell him that unless he changes his lifestyle he will almost certainly end up with heart disease , liver damage , increasingly immobile , with trouble breathing and at vastly increased risk of premature death from cancer or a heart attack . -LRB- And of course , each of those predictions has a different level of confidence attached ! -RRB- But whether or not he does change his lifestyle is up to him - he may decide that he likes his bacon , beer and cigarettes so much that he can live with the increased risk of cancer and if he has to have expensive and painful surgery for liver failure , clogged arteries or heart failure then that 's a price he 's willing to pay . He may even make a legitimate value judgment that the pain he will have to undergo in trying to lose weight and give up smoking and alcohol will outweigh the pain of the resultant health problems . That 's his decision and he may even be right . And even if he does decide to deal with the problem now rather than await the consequences , he still needs to decide how best to tackle it . Should he ditch the beer first , or concentrate on trying to quit smoking ? Should he go on a strict diet , or just do more exercise ? All are legitimate questions , and it 's up to the patient to decide on the best answers . But what he should n't do is say `` Eh , what does the doctor know - he 's just pretending things are wrong with me in order to make more money . And anyway , I 'm not overweight I just have heavy bones . '' Well , ok - I 'm sure many people do say exactly that , and I can even see the appeal of that kind of delusion -LRB- which I 'm sure is why `` classic denial '' is one of psychiatry 's stock phrases -RRB- but that does n't mean it 's accurate or sensible ! Heh - I promise I 'll shut up now ... In the first paragraph you provided he is n't talking about climate models not being valid , he 's talking about the existing engineering models -LRB- used for building infrastructure -RRB- which are based on historical climatology , which will no longer be valid in 10 , 20 , 30 years time because of climate change . Basically he is asking us to make changes to our building infrastructure , because of climate change , which , in his own words : It takes about 20 years to evaluate because there is so much unforced variability in the system the chaotic component of the climate system that is not predictable beyond two weeks , even theoretically . I 'm sorry , but that is not good enough .

The IPCC sensitivity range of about 3 degrees for a doubling of CO2 is actually pretty middle-of-the-road , and is well-constrained by observational and paleoclimate records as well as by theoretical and modelling calculations .

I only meant that because a substance has benefits does n't preclude the possibility it can have negative attributes under some circumstances , like water causing drowning or CO2 causing temperature increase . I did n't mean to imply that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere will pose direct health risks ! PS - thanks to your post I 've figured out how to use italics !

The spread of so-called swine flu , which has caused over 120 deaths globally , has sent public health officials into overdrive . Industrial farms are said to be a `` perfect incubating system '' As thousands fell ill in rural Mexico , those living near the outbreak raised suspicions about large industrial pig farms despite the owners ' saying their herds were clean and workers were healthy . Concerns over the border in the US have also centred on the intensive methods which have transformed pig farming in the past 20 years , Julian O'Halloran reports . Animal welfare campaigners may see the way pigs are crammed into their pens in industrial farms as cruel , but to some public health experts these pens are also incubators for viruses . This was the warning in a report published last year by American NGO , the Pew Charitable Trust , which funded a commission to study the possible spread of viruses and pathogens . The conclusion of the study , which took two-and-a-half-years to produce , was clear : `` The continued cycling of viruses and other animal pathogens in large herds or flocks increases opportunities for the generation of novel viruses through mutation ... that could result in more efficient human-to-human transmission . '' The commission 's executive director , Bob Martin , told BBC File on 4 the warning was prophetic , coming a year before this outbreak of flu in Mexico in March . `` The commission was very concerned regarding the concentration of swine . Swine are incredible incubators for viruses - they 're susceptible to swine flu , avian flu and human flu . '' He added : `` They can pass it back to you , the human worker and then back to the pig . They generate the novel virus , as it 's called . '' Mr Martin said the commission had based its report on research by the Iowa School of Public Health , where one of its commissioners was dean of the school . `` They came and addressed what a perfect incubating system a concentrated animal feeding operation or an industrial farm is for breeding novel flu viruses . '' He said the virology experts stated these farms could amplify the spread of flu and add to the problem in another way - by possibly increasing the risk that the virus will also infect humans . `` Many of the industrial farm operation workers are lower-income scale in the US - they do n't have access to immediate health care or screening and they would be a bridging population to bring the virus from the industrial farm to the broader population . '' However the farming industry believes its methods do not increase the risk of breeding novel flu viruses . Listen to File on 4 , BBC Radio 4 2000 BST , Tuesday 9 June 2009 , repeated 1700 , Sunday 14 June 2009 . Dr Liz Wagstrom , scientific expert with the US National Pork Council , insisted that a range of precautions are in place on US farms . `` There are all sorts of influenza viruses , pigs are one of them , birds are one of them , humans are one of them and there is a chance for these recombination events can happen in all three species so that 's why we have worked very closely with public health agencies to try to develop a surveillance and response plan to identify emerging viruses and respond to them , '' she said . The industry also rejects the term swine flu after meat sales fell following the outbreak of the new flu . And she said that America 's top public health officials now call the virus H1N1 . `` We worked closely with scientists and others to question whether this was an appropriate name and people within the scientific bodies came to the conclusion that even though there were pieces and parts of this virus that were consistent with viruses seen in swine , because it was not number one found in pigs and contact with pigs was not associated with infection , it was better renamed , '' she added . However , Dr David Morens , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases near Washington DC , is not convinced . `` It 's a swine virus - a virus that 's descended from two different pig viruses that have been in pigs for a number of years . '' He told File on 4 : `` If you had asked most virologists last year most would have said it was unlikely that a virus circulating in pigs could jump into humans and cause a pandemic . `` And yet that seems what we 're observing now ... it certainly is spreading in the direction of being called a pandemic . '' He added : `` Over the coming months , many public health officials in the world will be discussing these things and undoubtedly more research will need to be done and ask the question what can be done to limit the chance that something like this will happen again .

These themes were clearly occupying the minds of many of the world 's airline chiefs , more than 200 of whom gathered at the International Air Transport Association 's annual meeting in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia , this week . The atmosphere at the meeting was subdued , with many worried brows . Massive losses in the industry made even previously friendly chief executives , such as newly-installed Iata chairman Tony Tyler of Cathay Pacific , reluctant to speak to the journalists . Iata is projecting a $ 9bn annual loss for the commercial airline industry this year and as the global airline body , it should know . It counts 230 airlines as members . Giovanni Bisignani , Iata 's director general , reckons the industry is in survival mode . `` I am a realist and I do n't see facts to support optimism , '' he says . `` Whether this crisis is long or short , the world is changing . Travel budgets have been slashed and consumers will need to reduce their debt . It will not be business as usual in the post-crisis world . `` Governments , partners and airlines must use this crisis as an opportunity to build a stronger industry . That means resizing and reshaping . '' The resizing is already taking place . From Singapore Airlines to Qantas , planes have been grounded and carriers are reducing capacity . It will not be business as usual in the post-crisis world The ones in the Asia Pacific stand to lose the most - $ 3.3 bn according to Iata 's projections - so scaling back is imperative . However , the elusive chief executive of the region 's largest airline , Singapore Airlines , was keeping a brave face . Chew Choon Seng often eschews one-on-one interviews , but he was happy to talk to us on the sidelines of the meeting 's first cocktail reception about prospects for the future . `` Oil prices are still quite high in historical terms . The recession has affected our business globally . `` And on top of it , the H1N1 flu epidemic has dampened demand more in Asia , than perhaps in America or Europe , '' he says . `` We do not know when the global economy will turn around , but it will in due course , and when it comes around , demand will be there , there will be a revival and the challenge for all of us in the industry is to position ourselves in the interim until we get there . '' Airlines are cutting back in other ways . First-class travel may be on its way out if Alan Joyce , the newly installed chief executive of Qantas Airways is to be believed . The Irishman took the helm of the Australian airline last November , when his predecessor , Geoff Dixon , retired . Since he took over , more than 1,000 jobs have been axed , 10 planes have been grounded and the airline has delayed the deliveries of 12 Boeing 737s and four Airbus A380s by up to a year . `` What we 've done is said , how do we cope with the current environment where we 've seen 20 to 30 percent drop in premium traffic ? On some routes , we 've seen the first-class cabins particularly empty , '' says Mr Joyce . `` So the easiest thing to do in the short term is what we call a cosmetic configuration , which is not selling those seats as first class but selling them as business class , so effectively we have more seats on sale on the aircraft . We have introduced that on a number of routes . '' These worries over the global slowdown , though , did not dictate the entire agenda . Iata also outlined plans for the industry to become carbon neutral by 2020 . At the meeting , airline bosses committed to a global cap on emissions by 2020 . After that date , aviation 's emissions will not grow even as demand increases , according to Mr Bisignani . Airlines currently account for 2 % of global emissions and that figure continues to grow . The environment is only the last in a long list of concerns that continue to dog the industry , which may , more than most , encounter turbulence while riding out the storm .

More than 1,200 people have contracted the virus in Australia - none fatally . The total means Australia has seen a four-fold increase in a week .

The WHO held a conference call with governments on Wednesday , but afterwards said no decision had been taken on moving to phase six - the pandemic stage - at the moment . Gregory Hartl , WHOs spokesperson for epidemic and pandemic diseases , said if a pandemic was announced it would not be the `` apocalyptic situation '' envisaged when bird flu looked liked it would be the cause . `` What we are seeing now with H1N1 is that in most cases the disease is self-limting , lets say 98-98 % of the people we know to be affected recover without any need for hospitalisation , as far as we can tell . `` We do understand that the natural reaction of people if and when we declare phase six could be very strong . `` But we would hope that there would be quiet quickly an adjustment reaction , as happened in the US , when people realized they were n't getting seriously ill . '' The media must play a part here , emphasising the facts about this virus and not over-reacting BBC medical correspondent Fergus Walsh says it is true that the word `` pandemic '' sounds scary . But it simply means a global epidemic of an infectious disease . He says it is not a signal that the virus is getting more virulent - only a measure of its geographical spread . As the number of H1N1 cases in Australia passes 1,200 , Singapore has urged its citizens to avoid travel to Victoria . Authorities in New South Wales and South Australia , as well as the national capital , Canberra , have told children who have recently traveled to Melbourne to stay away from school for a week on their return home . The entire squad and staff of the Brisbane Broncos rugby league club have been put into quarantine as tests are carried out on a player suspected of contracting swine flu . Have you had the virus ?

It means the swine flu virus is spreading in at least two regions of the world with rising cases being seen in the UK , Australia , Japan and Chile . WHO chief Dr Margaret Chan said the move did not mean the virus was causing more severe illness or more deaths . The swine flu -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- virus first emerged in Mexico in April and has since spread to 74 countries . We have evidence to suggest we are seeing the first pandemic of the 21st Century Dr Margaret Chan , WHO director general Official reports say there have been nearly 30,000 cases globally and 141 deaths , with figures rising daily . Hong Kong said it was closing all its nurseries and primary schools for two weeks following 12 school cases . It is the first flu pandemic in 40 years - the last in 1968 killed about one million people . However , the current pandemic seems to be moderate and causing mild illness in most people . Most cases are occurring in young working age adults and a third to a half of complications are presenting in otherwise healthy people . Dr Chan said : `` We have evidence to suggest we are seeing the first pandemic of the 21st Century . `` Moving to pandemic phase six does not imply we will see increased in deaths or serious cases . '' She added it was important to get the right balance between complacency and vigilance and that pandemic strategies would vary between countries depending on their specific situation . It is global and fulfilling the requirements of a pandemic Professor John Oxford , flu expert And the WHO does not recommend closure of borders or any restrictions on the movement of people , goods or services . But the picture could change very quickly . `` No other pandemic has been detected so early or watched so closely , '' Dr Chan said . UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for calm . `` Let me stress : this is a formal statement about the geographical spread of the disease . It is not in itself a cause for alarm , '' he said . He warned that in the developing world the consequences of the virus could be more serious , and that the southern hemisphere was now entering the flu season . One factor which has prompted the move to a level six pandemic was that in the southern hemisphere , the virus seems to be crowding out normal seasonal influenza . Pandemic ` no cause for alarm ' The move was not prompted by the situation in any one country but the reports that it had spread in several parts of the world , officials said . The BBC 's Imogen Foulkes , in Geneva , says that while the number of cases has made the declaration inevitable , the WHO will have to manage the global anxiety the declaration of a pandemic will generate . Experts have warned that poorer nations , especially those in the southern hemisphere now heading into their winter season , face the greatest risk from the flu pandemic . There have been more than 800 cases in the UK with some areas of Scotland being particularly hard hit . The government has been stockpiling antivirals such as Tamiflu and has ordered vaccine , some doses of which could be available by October . SWINE FLU - THE BASICS Symptoms usually similar to seasonal flu It is a new version of the H1N1 strain which caused the 1918 flu pandemic Current treatments do work , but as yet there is no vaccine Good personal hygiene , such as washing hands , covering nose when sneezing advised England 's chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson said the WHO declaration of a pandemic would not significantly change the way the UK was dealing with swine flu at the moment . But he added there could be some minor changes to who received antivirals . `` The declaration of a pandemic per se does n't make a big difference to the way we are handling the outbreaks we have . `` We are going to continue to investigate every case that occurs and treat their contacts with antivirals even though they may not be ill . `` The difference is that the Health Protection Agency has learned a lot about approaching this question of antiviral prophylaxis and they are going to be treating the closer contacts of the cases , rather than the more far-flung contacts , because they feel that that is supported by what they know so far about how the disease is transmitting . He added : `` These flu viruses can change their pattern of attack , so when we come into the flu season in the autumn and winter in this country , when we expect a big surge of cases , we need to watch very carefully to see if the character of the virus is changing . '' There is concern that the virus might mutate in the southern hemisphere over its winter and become more virulent , but there 's no sign of that yet Scottish health secretary Nicola Sturgeon said a move to level six means that countries need to be ready to implement pandemic plans immediately but the UK was already operating at a `` heightened state of readiness '' . But it could affect the speed at which the UK gets pandemic vaccine supplies but that had been factored into pandemic planning . Flu expert Professor John Oxford said people should not panic as the outbreak was milder than others seen in the past century . `` It is global and fulfilling the requirements of a pandemic but I do n't think anyone should worry because nothing drastic has happened between yesterday and today .

The worst , Spanish flu in 1918 , killed perhaps 50 to 100 million people - but that was before the antibiotic era . The pandemics of 1957 and 1968 killed one to two million . Even that sounds alarming , but bear in mind that normal seasonal flu contributes to up half a million deaths per year . And H1N1 flu is currently so mild that , in terms of deaths , it might not be much worse than a bad normal winter of flu . But it is different in the groups it targets . Very few elderly people are catching H1N1 flu , probably because they have immunity due to exposure to similar flu viruses . Instead , the peak groups are children and young adults aged 5-24 , followed by children under five , and then adults under 50 . Most of those who fall seriously ill , with complications like pneumonia , have underlying health problems . People will want to know when they are likely to be exposed to H1N1 . That 's impossible to say with any accuracy , but the summer months may suppress the virus somewhat in Britain , and it may be the late autumn or beyond before we see a full-scale epidemic in every community . The government 's pandemic plans suggest that perhaps a third of the population could get infected , causing huge rates of absenteeism from work , and extra pressure on the health service . There is concern that the virus might mutate in the southern hemisphere over its winter and become more virulent , but there 's no sign of that yet . A pandemic vaccine is in early development ; it will be autumn before the first doses are ready ; they will be earmarked for front-line health workers and those with health problems .

All basic things and just to keep an eye on each other , If you feel unwell ring the NHS Flu number . I hope everyone who does get it will of course get better , We just have to hope that it 'll be over a lot quicker than it started . The real question is whether out of any of those low-risk deaths , did any show evidence of the pathological cytokyne response that supposedly characterized the Spanish flu ?

Each of those is tragic , but in the USA alone , over 100 people die EACH DAY from `` normal '' influenza strains . In winter , people tend to stay indoors more often , in closer quarters , breathing recycled air . We seal our homes to keep cold outside air out - We probably do n't bathe or wash our hands as often - What better way to spread viruses from person-to-person ? Your family had `` all the symptoms of swine flu '' ? What exactly are they and how can you make that Dx without lab tests . The symptoms of swine flu are exactly the same as for any number of the hundreds of influenza variants . The medical notes on symptoms are confusing because as you rightly state , seasonal flu and swine flu symptoms are virtually the same .

So no , it may not be a life threatening illness for me , but in terms of work days lost it is a disaster . I wonder if anyone else has this experience ? Most seasonal vaccinations are a `` cocktail '' meant to protect against several variants so I 'd go ahead and have yours anyway . Far as I can tell , the only real difference in outward symptom profile between H1N1 -LRB- swine Flu -RRB- and most of the other types is that they kill the frail and compromised while Swine\\/Bird flu variants kill the stromg and healthy .

Although I have heard of almost bizarre civil contingency plans - I even read once of plans to evacuate London to the South Coast by train in the event of a pandemic - the reality is that if you start evacuating people en masse , you will probably be moving both healthy and infected people together because you wo n't necessarily be able to always tell the difference and some people might not tell the truth because they do n't want to be moved or they do n't want to be separated from the rest of their families , or whatever . Having said that , so far the UK has taken measures like closing schools for a week or two , but how far do you transpose that idea . I do n't think so . If some MP contracts it , will Parliament be shut for two weeks ? I do n't think so . If someone in one of those huge office blocks full of civil servants contracts it , will hundreds of DOH , DWP , MOD , Treasury or whatever workers be told to stay at home for a week or two ? I do n't think so . So , for those sort of reasons we can assume the rate of infection will now accelerate rapidly as , for all intents and purposes , it is ` out in the wild ' and beyond realistic quarantine and isolation measures . However , people should remember that various civil contingency legislation does allow the relevant Secretary of State to issue various orders that could , if used , severely limit or change the way we lead our lives . I 'm not suggesting that is at all likely to happen , but the statutory framework does exist if things get seriously out of control .

There 's not much gain in washing your hands and then contaminating them a few moments later because the last person to use the office photocopier or the door entryphone does n't bother to wash his\\/hers . -RRB- Whatever - if I do get the thing , I might take paracetamol , or even Tamiflu , but I 'm not going to start munching through bars of Dettol soap !

At 5:20 pm on 12 Jun 2009 , SkylineOnFire wrote : Im really getting annoyed at the media coverage . Il point out the reasons this virus CAN NOT become another 1918 style mass killer . The basic one , a virus will only evolve\\/mutate when it deems it necessary to increase its transfer rate , and guaruntee its survival . Right now its doing a 99 percent perfect job of both of those , it has no need to evolve . Its highly contageous , and is being passed around perfectly . A very deadly virus gives itself a problem . It kills the host . If the virus kills the host , it doesnt infect as many people , so its counter productive to the virus to mutate into this form . In 2005 , a team of scientists from Mount Sinai medical school rebuilt the 1918 influenza strain using fragments of old lung tissue from the victims of that strain . It was noted this is such a rare occurence , once in a 10 millenia . And that was the very worst a flu virus can get . Even faced with that virus again , nowhere near that number would die . After world war 2 , poverty was rife , awful sanitary conditions , zero anti virals etc. ... and squalid conditions meant that the virus passed through the very unhealthy population in comparison with todays people , incredibly quickly and violently . If that strain ever made another pass at us , the death count would be at least three quarters less than it was then . Flu chromosomes are quite simple eight short strands of RNA that issue the genetic code for a grand total of 11 proteins . They break apart in a jumble inside cells they infect , and then they reassemble , picking up random bits of other flus , which makes the results unpredictable . The swine flu strain lacks several genes known to increase lethality , including those that code for two proteins known as PB1-F2 and NS-1 , and one that codes for a tongue-twister called the polybasic hemagglutinin cleavage site . PB1-F2 appears to weaken the protective membrane of the energy-producing mitochondria in an infected cell , ultimately killing the cell . Specifically , it attacks dendritic cells , the sentinels of the immune system . Its lethality could be accidental a protein good at killing sentries might just go on killing other cells once inside the fort . All pandemic flus , including those of the Spanish , Hong Kong and Asian flus , make PB1-F2 . So does the H5N1 bird flu . The current swine strain does not . The NS-1 protein also maims the immune response by blocking interferon , an antiviral protein made by cells . Hence the fact there are NO cytokine storms in any of the victims . Basically ... This virus can not even mutate into something as bad as the hong kong or asian flu , let alone the spanish influenza of 1918 ! It becomes resistant to tamiflu , which wouldnt be great , but since hardly anyone in the US is being given tamiflu out of the several million suspected cases they have had already , with only 30 deaths or so , most in previously ill people , its really nothing to be incredibly worried about . Right now its weaker than regular seasonal flu . And scientists cant see it getting any worse , it pretty much cant . The media have made the biggest crisis out of this as they can , and im sick of hearing two bit `` experts '' instead of the scientists who actually know about the virus . Just my two cents , and Fergus why arent you pointing these things out ? I see a lot of very scary headlines and very repetitive trivial news , but not too much in the way of facts ... Im baffled by the media response and the lack of widespread knowledge that this virus doesnt have the qualities necessary to become a mass killer .

The World Health Organization called the meeting after a steep rise in the number of cases in Australia . A BBC correspondent says it has little option but to declare a pandemic now there are nearly 28,000 recorded cases . Reports say that the WHO had already told member countries it had decided to raise the alert to pandemic level . Hong Kong said it was closing all its nurseries and primary schools for two weeks following 12 school cases . The last global flu pandemic came in 1968 over the Hong Kong flu . That pandemic killed about one million people . A disease is classed as a pandemic when transmission between humans becomes widespread in at least two regions of the world . The latest virus emerged in Mexico in April and since then thousands of cases have been confirmed throughout North and South America . The H1N1 strain has spread to 74 countries but the WHO has so far resisted labeling the outbreak a full-blown pandemic . SWINE FLU - THE BASICS Symptoms usually similar to seasonal flu It is a new version of the H1N1 strain which caused the 1918 flu pandemic Current treatments do work , but there is no vaccine Good personal hygiene , such as washing hands , covering nose when sneezing advised WHO chief Margaret Chan talked to officials from eight countries with large flu outbreaks on Wednesday in an attempt to confirm the spread of the disease . She said she believed the situation could be regarded as a pandemic but wanted clear evidence before making an announcement . The BBC 's Imogen Foulkes , in Geneva , says that while the number of cases has made the declaration inevitable , the problem is that the pandemic phase system is designed for a very different type of virus . WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said it had been expecting something more like the deadlier bird flu . `` It was believed that the next pandemic would be something like H5N1 bird flu , where you were seeing really high death rates , and so there were people who believed we might be in a kind of apocalyptic situation and what we 're really seeing now with H1N1 is that in most cases the disease is self-limiting , '' he told the BBC . Phase 1 : No infections in humans are being caused by viruses circulating in animals . Phase 2 : Animal flu virus causes infection in humans , and is a potential pandemic threat . Phase 3 : Flu causes sporadic cases in people , but no significant human-to-human transmission . Phase 4 : Human-to-human transmission and community-level outbreaks . Phase 5 : Human-to-human transmission in at least two countries . Strong signal pandemic imminent . Phase 6 : Virus spreads to another country in a different region . Global pandemic under way . Post-peak : Pandemic activity appears to be decreasing though second wave possible . Post-pandemic : activity returns to normal , seasonal flu levels .

The WHO will have to manage the global anxiety the declaration of a pandemic will generate , our correspondent says . It is concerned not to trigger panic measures such as border closures and travel bans and is expected to advocate careful medical management , including the moderate use of anti-viral drug tamiflu . Using it on a widespread preventative scale could simply create drug resistance , our correspondent adds . The WHO 's move follows Australia 's confirmation of more than 1,200 cases - a four-fold increase in a week . All primary schools and nurseries in Hong Kong are to shut for 14 days from Friday in a bid to contain the virus , the territory 's chief executive Donald Tsang said . It follows confirmation that 12 secondary school pupils have contracted the illness . Secondary schools are not yet being ordered to close . At least 50 people are now confirmed to have the virus in the territory . The head of the WHO 's global influenza program , Keiji Fukuda , said the situation had `` evolved a lot '' in recent days . `` We are getting close to knowing that we are in a pandemic situation , '' he said .

Although it 's not been officially confirmed , it 's understood that the first person with H1N1 swine flu to die in Britain was a 38-year-old mother who had given birth prematurely . The patient , who has not yet been named , was admitted to hospital with swine flu and gave birth earlier this month to a premature baby . The child was born at 29 weeks gestation . Few details have yet been confirmed by the Scottish authorities ; they have so far said only that the patient had `` underlying health conditions '' . Her death is very sad news , and everyone 's thoughts must be with her family , friends and the medical staff who cared for her . Before I go on to discuss the elevated risks of swine flu associated with pregnancy , it 's important to stress , as I do repeatedly , that the vast majority of people who contract this virus have a mild disease which lasts a few days . Many will have no symptoms at all . The official figure for the UK is 1,261 cases and this is the first death . But there will have been hundreds - maybe many thousands - of cases which have gone unrecorded . So instead of being one death in 1,261 cases , it is undoubtedly a lot less than that . With around 700,000 babies born in the UK each year , I know that many women and their partners will be concerned . So please be reassured that the vast majority of pregnant women who get infected will be okay , as will their unborn children . Having put all those caveats in place , it is true that pregnancy is a risk factor for swine flu . The director general of the World Health Organization , Margaret Chan , had this to say about pregnancy last week , in her speech declaring a flu pandemic : `` Without question , pregnant women are at increased risk of complications . This heightened risk takes on added importance for a virus , like this one , that preferentially infects younger age groups . '' But remember that pregnancy is also a risk factor for seasonal flu , especially in the last trimester . Flu poses a threat both to the mother and to the unborn child . Among the complications , the fever associated with flu can lead to a premature delivery . Health advisers recommended three years ago that pregnant women should be among the groups offered a seasonal flu jab . When a vaccine for H1N1 swine flu becomes available in the autumn , pregnant women may well be among the first `` at risk '' groups offered the jab . What about antiviral drugs and pregnancy ? During pregnancy , the concern with any drug is that it may pass through the placenta and affect the baby . There is a risk factor especially during the first trimester . Oseltamivir -LRB- currently best known as the brand name Tamiflu -RRB- is not usually recommended for pregnant women because the side-effects are unknown . But the lesser-known inhaled drug Relenza -LRB- a brand name for zanamivir -RRB- can be prescribed on medical advice , according to the Department of Health . `` An expert group reviewed the risk of antiviral treatment in pregnancy , which is extremely small - much smaller than the risk posed by the symptoms of swine flu . '' There are more details on pregnancy and swine flu on the government health pages . At 11:07 am on 15 Jun 2009 , sensiblegrannie wrote : Give pregnant women massive priority . The health authorities are dealing with two people , not one . Pregnancy and childbirth is a high risk time all of the time . If it is unwise to give certain antiviral drugs to pregnant women then it stands to reason , to reduce unnecessary contact with the rest of us until such time as the baby is born . We can reduce the risk to pregnant mums by keeping well away if we have been in contact with or have this new flu . Shopping for food online is a bit safer than the weekly scrum in the supermarket . Get someone else to do the supermarket run . Anti natal appointments could be run from an alternative location away from the germ ridden doctors surgery . Luckily , most hospitals for childbirth are set apart from the general hospitals . Home deliveries are risky at the best of times and should not be an alternative for safe hospital delivery , where specialists are always at hand . Pregnant mums may already have a toddler at the local nursery , playgroup or school . Other mums could reduce the risk of flu contact , by making sure their own children do not have symptoms of flu or other infectious diseases before sending them of to school each morning . It only takes two minutes to check a temperature . Schools and nurseries could be more pro-active and less politically correct and simply refuse to allow a child to attend if they are obviously ill . The temptation will be , to allow a child back to nursery before the child has got over the infectious stage , if the child appears apparently well . Do n't forget , if you knowingly take risks , you risk the health of others . That 's the first time - as far as I 'm aware - that anyone from government , or any journalist , has actually admitted that there may well be a significant difference between the ` official ' figure and the real figure of infections . Now , as has already been stated on these blogs , the official figure is the number of reported and confirmed cases - and it may be relevant to consider that some , perhaps even many , of these persons have recovered from the infection and would no longer be an infection risk to others . So in terms of people assessing how likely it is that they will come into direct or indirect contact with an infectious person and thereby risk becoming infected - these figures are particularly useless in many respects . And is n't that really what people want some idea about ? The risk to them ? In fact , I almost wonder why the government is bothering to constantly publish these figures and the media report them !

There is very little information about the virus and pregnant women in general , and I notice that even though there is a lot of data already collected by WHO about the cases -LRB- and disproportinately high number of cases involving pregnant women -RRB- the official documents regarding the virus have not been updated since they were first issued . It is appalling that only with the first lethal case some more information is siphoning through the media , though barely adequate . Here is an idea to chew on . A mad , random , scientific idea is that bacteria make the rain fall . The info is on the BBC site today and is on radio 4 tonight at 9 pm . As a child , when it rained , I was always told to wear a rain mac , dry my hair thoroughly , take an umbrella with me or I ` would catch my death of cold ' if I got wet in the rain . It always used to puzzle me because the same restrictions were not in place when I went to the beach and enjoyed bathing in the sea . Are viruses able to temporarily host on the bacteria that ` seed ' the rain and possibly make rain fall ? It is interesting , because if bacteria can alter the temperature that rain freezes , then it might explain why antifreeze works or why salt prevents water freezing at zero . The bacteria are being killed or attenuated by the salt and alcohol . Fergus , I would echo Sutara 's comment above . Far more relevant than the historic number of recorded cases is the number of recent cases within any geography . It may be , for example , that H1N1 has practically died out in some regions or countries that have previously reported cases , but we the public , ca n't tell . Could the BBC please issue a revised map of cases within the past 10 days , or some medically relevant period ? It ca n't be that difficult to produce based on the statistics published already .

And it is because people matter that many just want some clear idea about the risks involved , presented to them in a straight-forward way , neither hyped up , nor dumbed down . In the final analysis most people want to be self-determining and want the information so that they themselves can `` manage '' the risks involved to the best of their ability . Unfortunately , probably for a whole number of reasons including the operational cultures of Health Trusts and civil servants , the information being published is n't actually particularly helpful to the metaphorical man on the Clapham omnibus .

I am not an expert on this matter but I have information about flu types in general . My information is from a published source , not intended for the general public but for health agency workers in the field . Normal flu has an incubation time of about 2 days which can stretch out from 1-4 days . A new flu like H1N1 may behave differently and could range from 2-5 days , possibly 8 , who knows ? Infection time for normal flu is up to 5 days in adults and stretching out to about 10 days in children . Again , this is all depending on circumstances . It has been known for flu to last from 2-3 weeks , but that would be an exception and not the rule . How do you package that information into a sensible format that is not overreactive , straight forward and does n't confuse or alarm people ? Being overcautious is as harmful as not cautious enough ! We all have to interact with each other and continue normal lives . The economy is dependent on our ability to make sensible decisions and be available for work . A good piece of advice would to maintain a social distance of 1 meter wherever possible . The flu virus has difficulty infecting you at a further distance . Masks are suitable only for preventing your sneeze mixture of bodily excretion and virus , expelling out and jumping the 1 meter distance to infect someone else . A clearer idea of incubation time and infection time for H1N1 may be coming out of America where they would have been busy gathering statistics to plan for future outbreaks . I reckon it 's quite easy - you find a term , say ` stimated current infection rate ' . Based on the reported positive cases and when they were reported , you publish a figure , country by county in the UK , of the estimated current percentage of the population who are currently infected , perhaps that would be those whose infection was between 1 and 10 days old . You provide a simple explanation of the figure , clarify that it is n't written in ` tables of stone ' , and that it needs to be regarded as indicative only . Even if someone says their flu started last Monday , when it really started last Tuesday , it does n't matter as you work on the basis that such errors will either cancel out or have a fairly consistent effect on the figure . So you might then end up with a figure for Scotland of say 0.01 % , one for England of whatever , etc. . Whoops - that should have been ` estimated current infection rate ' . Unfortunately it 's not quite that simple . New cases reported on a particular day are really the cases that were confirmed in lab tests from the day -LRB- or night ? -RRB- The swabs for the tests would have been taken from patients presented to a doctor or nurse -LRB- for testing -RRB- at some point from say 12 hours prior to up to 48 hours , possibly more , before . How long depends on how fast the labs work , how long it takes for samples to reach them and be performed . Also , suspected cases will have been swabbed at different points in their infection . The cases that the postitive tests refer to could have started their infections anything from the day before to up to 7 days previously -LRB- assuming it took them 5 days to be tested and 3 days for test to run and processed -RRB- , possibly longer ago . There is also natural variation in how long incubation and infectious periods last in different people , even for a short lived infections like flu ; the upper and lower limits of these periods are still uncertain for the new H1N1 flu strain . So to calculate when confirmed cases first became ill accurately you need to know several processes with high precision , and mostly these are unknown currently . Frustrating , but that 's the trouble with asking good , tricky to answer questions ! Of course , one could always ask the cases themselves when they first got symptoms , which I 'm sure has been done by the HPA and other .

Bacterial pneumonia can be succesfully prevented by prophylactic antibiotic administration . I think it would be wise for GPs to prescribe antibiotics for the high risk groups even if it is not active on the virus but it would prevent the most feared complication , bacterial pneumonia . In my opinion , in our century , nobody should die of bacterial pneumonia , regardless of the underlying health problems , because even if it is sometimes difficult to treat , especially when the medication is administered in an advanced stage of the disease , prevention is a very simple , handy and efficient measure which could save the life of many people . Because , let 's face it : how many of us can say that they do n't fall in any risk category ?

Jacqueline Fleming , 38 , from Glasgow , died on Sunday at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley . Her son Jack , who was born 11 weeks early , died on Monday in a special care baby unit at the same hospital . The baby was not infected with the Influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- virus . He was two weeks old when he died . Ms Fleming had been suffering from underlying health problems since the birth of her son . In a statement , her partner William McCann said it was an extremely distressing and difficult time for the family . He said : `` My beautiful son was born on the first of June 2009 , 11 weeks early . `` He suffered from a number of complications and despite his brave fight he passed away earlier this evening at the Special Care Baby Unit at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley . '' She was a really nice lady , really kind , a quiet woman , just a family person really Ms Fleming lived with her two other children - one aged 18 and one of primary school age - and her long-term partner in the family home in Thornliebank , just south of Glasgow . William Docherty , who knew Ms Fleming , told BBC Scotland he believed she had been admitted to hospital following a stroke . A female friend of the family said : `` I think they are taking it really badly . She was in hospital for a couple of weeks and there were days she was getting better and days she was taking a turn for the worse . `` They hoped she was going to pull through and it was a shock when she died . The family are really devastated . '' She added : `` She was a really nice lady , really kind , a quiet woman , just a family person really . '' Scotland Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said : `` The death of baby Jack , especially coming so soon after the death of his mother , is a tragedy and I extend my deepest condolences to their family and friends for this unimaginably painful loss . '' The Scottish Government said Scotland had no new laboratory confirmed cases of swine flu . However , GPs in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area are now , in certain circumstances , diagnosing patients on the basis of clinical symptoms alone - without laboratory confirmation . There had been 71 such diagnoses , the government said . Scotland therefore currently has 498 confirmed cases , plus 71 which have been clinically diagnosed . Jacqueline Fleming lived in Crebar Street in the Thornliebank area In England , the Health Protection Agency said another 59 cases had been confirmed . Earlier , Ms Sturgeon said that while Ms Fleming 's death was tragic the public should take some reassurance from the fact that most cases of the virus were `` relatively mild '' . She said : `` It is important to stress that in any flu outbreak , unfortunately , we will see a small number of deaths and that does n't change the fact that for the vast majority of people contracting this virus the symptoms are relatively mild .

These are yet to be confirmed . At the weekend a 38-year-old Scottish woman became the first victim of the virus outside America .

But if , like me , you find them useful , then read on . I 'm indebted to my colleague Kate Merriam from BBC Research for collating these figures from the World Health Organization website , from the HPA in England and from Health Protection in Scotland . Before the numbers , here are some points to bear in mind . First , health officials have been charting the spread of H1N1 swine flu for around seven weeks now . Most of the cases mentioned will now be virus-free and healthy . Second , the WHO figures lag behind the real total by a couple of days . For example , the death toll for the US is quite a bit below the current figures from the CDC . But the WHO figures , while out of date , are reliable . Third , all the graphs vastly underestimate the actual number of cases . The CDC has said that perhaps 19 out of 20 cases go unrecorded , and the state of Victoria in Australia has stopped laboratory testing of uncomplex community cases . Given those caveats , I think the figures are useful . Global H1N1 swine flu cases First , the global tally from the WHO . As of 1700 BST on 15 June 2009 , 76 countries have officially reported 35,928 cases of influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- infection , including 163 deaths . Now let 's look at some individual countries . The number of confirmed cases in the UK now stands at 1,562 . There has been one death , that of 38-year-old Jacqueline Fleming , a mother who gave birth prematurely after contracting the virus . Yesterday , it was announced that her son Jack had also died . He did not have the virus . A further 141 patients were confirmed with H1N1 swine flu in England today -LRB- I think this is a record number for one day in England -RRB- , bringing the total to 952 cases . Of the new cases in England , 124 appeared in the west Midlands , where 512 people have been affected by the virus . There was one new case in Northern Ireland , bringing the total to nine . Three cases have been recorded in Wales . Health Protection Scotland said there had been 10 new laboratory-confirmed cases today , taking the total to 508 , with 414 possible cases under investigation . 17,855 cases and 45 deaths at 15 June . This represents a rise of 4,638 cases and 18 deaths since the last report on 12 June . 6,241 cases and 108 deaths with no cases reported in the last three days . This can surely only mean that the figures were not forthcoming or that the authorities are not testing in the community . I will try to investigate further . Yesterday , the US State Department said that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- had lifted the recommendation that American citizens avoid all non-essential travel to Mexico . Proving the virus is incredibly mild , just look at the statistics . And lets not even mention the CDC saying 19 out of 20 cases go unmissed , its such a weak flu virus right now . CDC in new york claim at least half a million cases in NY in may alone . Using the recorded deaths in NY gives us a death rate of ... 0.000024 .

Obviously it 's great that at the moment the virus is `` mild '' , but even if it does stay that way , it does n't mean we wo n't have severe problems because of it . I feel the biggest issue from a public health perspective is the societal impact of large numbers of people having the virus at the same time .

Now that IS the point , the whole point and nothing but the point . People -LRB- except virologists and academics -RRB- are n't particularly interested in how many people had the virus four weeks ago . They ARE concerned to try to factor in whatever degree of risk there may be to their interests and functional ability . Those interests might be trying to ensure a vulnerable relative is not exposed to the infection , or perhaps business continuity of a company , or local authority , or health trust in the event that the infection rate mushrooms . It 's all wrapped up in that term `` societal impact '' . At 3:32 pm on 17 Jun 2009 , Greenfrogflyinghigh wrote : I can completely take the point about societal impact and I agree that it would seem to be the real -LRB- economic -RRB- threat in this situation . However , I have an axe to grind about the way there seems to be a reaction to this type of flu that is way out of proportion - I mean new strains of viruses are constantly evolving , many far more virulent and dangerous , so why the huge fuss about this one ? There are , in fact , far more globally endemic diseases that claim millions of lives annually with far too few proactive resources in place in the countries worst affected . I have recently traveled back from the UK to a country in the Far East where I live and work . I 'm a community development worker in some of the poorest places in this region . Each day , each week , each year I am faced with the effects of preventable diseases that are also curable , yet no treatment is available , no effective strategies in place -LRB- despite apparent millions of dollars of aid -RRB- - TB is foremost in my mind , for instance , though I could name many others . Official figures for this country rate TB infection at 70 % . In the places I work , those without access to healthcare , our estimate is far higher and people are dying . Children are being disabled - yet there is no free medication or treatment program for children and their parents are too ill and too poor to afford drugs . Dengue - there 's another one . The unacknowledged presence of AIDS which I suspect underlies a large proportion of these fatalities . Why do I mention this on a blog on Swine Flu ? Well , on my return here last week I was astounded to see the latest technology monitoring body temperatures as we disembarked . All of a sudden every public place has sprouted disinfectant dispensers so we can all cleanse our hands . The government has produced a flurry of paperwork charting provenance , past travel , contact with foreigners and a part requiring a list of any possible symptoms . My daughter , suffering from jet lag , has been ordered to report to a hospital for tests . Everywhere there is paranoia and people react in fear if we , as foreigners , so much as sniffle . This paranoia is fuelled by posters that proclaim the dangers of Swine Flu - today I read with incredulity the bald , unqualified statement , ` This Disease is Fatal to Humans ' What is going on ?? Has the world gone mad ? Why is this such a perceived threat when real killers go untreated ? Why ca n't the resources ploughed into preventing such a mild infection be better targeted ? I 'm well aware of the devastation that H1N1 could wreak in one of the villages where I work - but the real problem would not be flu , it would be the pre-existing conditions that should have been recognized and dealt with a long time ago . Well , this flu is n't that great a threat in many respects , at least not a ` health ' threat . But it IS an administrative threat , meaning if civil servants and health experts are n't seen to be recommending and taking the best actions it could leave them open to criticism , or losing their jobs , or being sanctioned for poor performance . And it is a political risk . And it is a risk , as already suggested , to societal functioning . But in the main , it is not really a significant direct threat to most individual 's personal health . But you do have to factor in that if societal functioning were to be severely hampered by the effects of a flu outbreak , then the risks to an individual 's well-being and health might increase due to lack of access to medics , pharmacists , transport , etc. , etc. . Of course , it is also a journalistic risk . If the BBC do n't cover it , Sky or ITV will . And the BBC is funded to provide public service information as well as entertainment . So that might go some way to answering why there is so much media output about what is probably a comparatively minor risk when compared to some other infections . Finally , the number of infected people does have the potential to escalate significantly - whether it actually does that or not - so that is another reason for the quantity of media coverage . would suggest that the West Midlands region has had a higher number of reported and confirmed infections than Scotland per captita . The West Midlands has a slightly higher population -LRB- about 5.3 million -RRB- compared to Scotland -LRB- about 5.1 million -RRB- . But given that the first cases were in Scotland , the rate of spread in the West Midlands would seem to be faster . Of course , there could be many other factors in place . If , as may be the case , a higher percentage of the West Midlands cases involve children , then the involvement of medics may be more prevalent and , therefore , there may be better reporting and testing of cases .

The experts -LRB- and the Health Service -RRB- are hoping there will be a summer lull in new cases in the Northern Hemisphere with numbers not rising seriously until the Autumn -LRB- when we should have at least some vaccine stocks in place -RRB- . But I ca n't really see any sign of that yet . It would be interesting to know what the computer models are predicting , and at what point we should see the Northern Hemisphere case rate dropping off for the summer .

We 're almost at 200 now although I 'm sure there could be hundreds more cases that have gone undetected . True , we have more cases than most parts of the UK but the one place in England that has more than us , the West Midlands has seen far more cases then London and the same with Scotland . Perhaps its due to us being one of the warmest parts of the UK on average and thus the higher temperatures stop it from spreading as well as it would do in colder weather . Whatever the reason , it is an interesting thing to ponder . Hopefully , things will not increase here to the degree seen in Birmingham or Glasgow .

I think it should be well publicised , and strong warnings of the dangers of not completing full courses of Antibiotics , in Doctors surgery 's and on the Medicine packaging . It is , of course , worth pointing out -LRB- for the avoidance of any doubt -RRB- that antibiotics are thoroughly useless in treating flu itself in the normal course of events . The only time they would be used is in treating the occasional opportunistic bacterial infections that might arise as a secondary result of flu . In the vast majority of cases this does n't happen and antibiotic treatment would be a waste of time . The point about finishing the course of a drug is well made though in general terms . Notwithstanding rare side effects that make a drug impossible to continue with , it 's important to complete the course of any treatment to prevent resistance and\\/or reoccurrence of an illness . People should definitely be made aware of the necessity to complete drug treatments according to the correct instructions .

Beware any attempt to derive a `` death rate '' from such figures -LRB- which , by my reckoning , would come out as four deaths in every 1,000 people infected -RRB- . As has been repeatedly pointed out , the vast majority of cases go unrecorded , so the figure of 52,160 is a huge underestimate of the actual numbers . Work is clearly needed to get a more accurate figure for the mortality and morbidity -LRB- ill-health -RRB- associated with the virus . England has also seen a series of big daily increases in lab-confirmed cases in recent days . There were 204 new cases confirmed by lab tests today ; the total number in England has doubled in just five days , with the West Midlands accounting for half of all infections . The vast majority of those infected have experienced mild flu-like symptoms and fully recovered . There have been no deaths in England and one in Scotland . The graphs below will show you the figures for the six countries worldwide with the biggest case-loads , in descending order : United States , Mexico , Canada , Chile , UK , Australia .

The issue is also more about resources and how to maintain adequate staffing levels in hospitals to cope with the influx of flu victims . The country is in an economic downturn , which means that health authorities are forced to maintain strict budget controls , which means making choices . Hospitals need a full staff of trained , expensive workers to keep wards open , in a time when cut backs and cost cutting are necessary . The problem is that routine investigations and operations may be put on hold until the main rush of hospital dependent flu victims have all gone home . The problem is that the staff themselves could become ill , making it necessary to employ even more expensive agency workers . The problem is that isolation and preventative measures need to be enforced and this can become very expensive . Some of the flu victims are high dependency , needing specialist equipment and specialist nursing and adequate barrier nursing . The wards and equipment will then need to be thoroughly cleaned by trained cleaners . Specialist equipment takes up space and therefore the beds have to be spaced further apart from each other in order to make room for the equipment and allow for barrier nursing . It could be you who needs a routine investigation and surgery , which will now be either rushed forward or put on hold until the flu numbers subside . So we are not talking about doomsday or worse case scenarios , just economic realities and that is why I asked if the health service requires volunteers to help with some of the basic tasks . I agree that some people may have health anxieties but they may be for a good reason if they fall into one of the categories that may need extra attention .

I have an autoimmune condition and my immune system does n't cope well with viruses such as Norovirus , Chicken Pox and seasonal flu . My daughter has a similar problem with her immune system . We are both well aware of the distiction between flu and a cold . Our family concern is that we live in a rural area with adequate medical care being dependent on which GP you see at the time . If the teacher in the west midlands who has Lupus did n't get Tamiflu , in spite of being in a high risk area , working in an infected school and likely to communicate this to many others , how much truth IS there in the guidance being issued by the government and the NHS ?

However the transmissibility is much greater , hence a global pandemic , as opposed to an epidemic or an outbreak . The greater the number of infected people , the greater the chances of recombination . It may mutate into a form which is no longer a risk to humans , or it may not .

Although this could be attributed to the high levels of arsenic in the drinking water , I just wondered what you made of the death rate in healthy people . Also , I have read with great interest the notion that most of the illness from 1918 was caused due to the vaccinations that the soldiers received a mixed cocktail of before going to war . Civillians were also vaccinated when the soldiers came home sick . There are reports from those days of infantile paralysis in soldiers , something that is linked to vaccine poison . Also , the way the soldiers symptoms were treated , were likely to have killed them more than the diseases alone . What do you make of the point that it was the drug makers that killed all those people back then ? Do you think that the new vaccine will be safe ? Given that in 1976 it caused deaths and paralysis . I am v confused . I do not know if I want my two daughters to have the vaccine . I am also confused by the comparisons to 1918 in the media . Some say that it was purely bird flu in 1918 , some say swine . Swine is H1n1 , but Avian Flu H5N1 . So was the 1918 caused by swine or bird or all three ?

Buenos Aires health chief Nestor Perez Balino told local media that some non-urgent operations were being postponed to free up hospital beds . But he said the situation regarding the H1N1 virus was no more worrying than seasonal flu , and that patients who had died had suffered other medical complications . Swine flu `` is very infectious but no more virulent than regular flu '' , he said . The H1N1 virus first emerged in April in Mexico , which has recorded 113 deaths and 7,624 cases , according to the WHO . In an interview with the BBC , Mexican Deputy Health Minister Mauricio Hernandez Avila said his country was prepared for the outbreak , having had a plan in place for four or five years to deal with a pandemic . `` We took 10 days from the -LRB- first -RRB- case to alert the world that we were seeing a new virus , '' he said . `` We did , I think , a remarkable good job in ... preparing the world for this event .

Roche Holding AG confirmed a patient with H1N1 influenza in Denmark showed resistance to the antiviral drug . David Reddy , company executive , said it was not unexpected given that common seasonal flu could do the same . The news comes as a nine-year-old girl has become the third to die in the UK with swine flu . It is understood from her doctors at Birmingham Children 's Hospital that she had underlying health conditions . It is not yet known whether swine flu contributed to her death . Meanwhile , the Department of Health has announced a big jump in the number of patients in England confirmed with swine flu - up 1,604 since Friday , taking the UK total so far to 5,937 . Routine sampling in the UK has shown that there is currently no resistance to oseltamivir or zanamivir A Health Protection Agency spokeswoman Experts have been using tamiflu , also known as oseltamivir , in a bid to stop the H1N1 spreading in communities . If taken early , it ensures that symptoms are mild and reduces the chance of a victim giving the illness to someone else . This first reported case of resistance developed in a swine flu patient taking Tamiflu . Mr Reddy stressed that there were no signs of a tamiflu-resistant strain of H1N1 circulating in the community . This is in contrast to seasonal H1N1 flu where a Tamiflu resistant strain emerged last year and is now widely circulating . Experts fear if this were to happen , it could render tamiflu ineffective . Another antiviral drug , called zanamivir or Relenza , made by GlaxoSmithKline , is also effective against swine flu . The UK government has been stockpiling these antiviral drugs and currently has enough to treat half of the population , with a contract to bring that up to 80 % as soon as possible . Supplies of flu vaccine have also been ordered and the first doses could be administered in the autumn . A spokeswoman for the Health Protection Agency said : `` The Health Protection Agency continues to watch for antiviral resistance and will be carrying out regular sample testing throughout this outbreak . `` We have been monitoring antiviral drug resistance since the beginning of this outbreak . Routine sampling in the UK has shown that there is currently no resistance to oseltamivir or zanamivir . '' Virologist Professor John Oxford said : `` I 'm not surprised about this finding . The question is whether it is going to spread . We will soon know the answer .

If a resistant strain of H1N1 swine flu starts circulating it would be a concern . Britain has invested a huge amount in its stockpile of Tamiflu and will eventually have enough to treat eight in 10 of the population . If it does n't work in many people that would be a setback , but remember that the vast majority of people who 've been infected with H1N1 swine flu have had a self-limiting illness and have overcome it without antivirals . If resistance emerges it would also mean that the virus is mutating -LRB- as all flu viruses do -RRB- and there may be questions about what other surprises it might have in store in the months ahead . So what actually happened in Denmark ? David Reddy , Roche 's pandemic taskforce leader , said although Tamiflu-resistant isolates had been obtained from a patient it looks as though this was drug-induced . This means that the virus developed resistance while the patient was taking Tamiflu . There were other patients in the same cluster outbreak and no resistance to Tamiflu was found in any of them . The phenomenon of drug-induced resistance is quite different from having a Tamiflu-resistant strain in circulation . By contrast there has been a Tamiflu-resistant strain of H1N1 seasonal flu in circulation since 2008 . `` There is no sign yet of a Tamiflu resistant strain -LRB- of H1N1 swine flu -RRB- circulating '' said Mr Reddy . `` We fully expect to see more cases where the virus may begin to develop resistance while people are taking the drug . '' This is the statement that Roche has put out : Roche is providing comment on the report of an oseltamivir resistant isolate of an influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- obtained from a single patient in Denmark . Roche reiterates that such resistant isolates in people on the drug is to be expected , as resistance at a rate of 0.4 % and 4 % was observed in adult and paediatric populations respectively in the phase III studies . -LRB- 1 -RRB- It is therefore expected that in some patients receiving antiviral medication , resistant virus will emerge . However , it is important to note that this does not mean that the currently circulating pandemic influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- virus is resistant . Ongoing testing shows that other currently circulating pandemic virus remains susceptible to Tamiflu . Communications from Denmark indicated that this was not unexpected and was not a reason to change recommendations on the use of Tamiflu . WHO recommendations remain unaltered . In addition to monitoring by government agencies , WHO and other public institutions , Roche recently initiated the global Influenza Resistance Information Study -LRB- IRIS -RRB- , which will include 1,200 patients per influenza season from 2008-2011 and will assess the clinical impact of naturally-occurring and drug-induced resistance to antiviral drugs .

If we go all out to destroy the mechanism for virus replication we may inadvertently cause our own ability to replicate , to diminish . Last night I watched the film , Children of Men , and the follow up discussion , and have come to the conclusion that we as a species , are long overdue for a change of attitude . Whilst I can think of many possible ways that our human existance -LRB- at least as we currently understand it -RRB- may be under threat - e.g. global warming , peak oil , abuse of political powers , abuse of financial powers , revolution , war , terrorism and a whole raft of differing health risks , including some that we thought we had dealt with once and for all -LRB- e.g. TB -RRB- - I 'm just not putting this particular flu variant that near the top of the list . Rightly or wrongly , my guess is that humans will , in some way or other , remain the ` dominant species ' for a long time to come .

Influenza virus susceptibility and resistance to oseltamivir . Antivir Ther 2007 ; 12:603 -616 The sun has been shining , the temperature rising , and it really does feels like summer . So it 's not the traditional time one would expect a flu virus to flourish . UV light cooks the viral goose pretty quickly , and people are outside more , rather than being huddled together swapping germs -LRB- let 's not spoil this theory by mentioning air conditioning or public transport -RRB- . But the H1N1 swine flu virus is not like seasonal flu . It 's sufficiently novel and contagious that it is continuing to spread despite the warmer weather . Let 's look at what 's happening in the UK and USA . The number of cases of swine flu in the UK has doubled in a week . Laboratory confirmed cases stand at 4,322 . England saw its biggest daily increase today with 535 new cases , most of them coming because of a surge in London and the west Midlands . Both areas now have more cases than the whole of Scotland , where the virus continues to flourish in the Glasgow area . With the virus now very firmly established in London , it 's likely that further big increases will follow . And remember that many cases are going unreported . Does that mean a peak in cases - a full-blown national epidemic - will come earlier than expected , perhaps in late August or September ? Possibly , but the expectation is that once the school holidays begin , there could be a pause with a peak coming from autumn onwards . Then we could see tens of thousands of cases a week and every part of the UK will be affected . At present , in Wales , north-east and north-west England , there 's still hardly any flu at all , so the virus is still not fully embedded here . Now to the United States . The CDC in Atlanta has given another of its very helpful briefings to journalists . Dr Anne Schuchat set out the situation there : 27,717 laboratory-defined cases with more than 3000 hospitalisations and 127 fatalities . `` This virus is not going away , '' she said , `` and the reported cases are the tip of the iceberg . We are estimating there have been at least one million cases in the United States - not perfectly accurate but a ball-park figure . '' That estimate is based on some telephone polls asking people whether they 'd had flu-like symptoms in the past three weeks -LRB- not the most accurate way of estimating illness -RRB- and some community surveys which suggested 6 % of people in hot-spot regions may have had the virus . While not terribly accurate , the CDC appears confident that at least one million Americans have been infected . If so , that is very reassuring news because it means the fatality rate is really very low . North America is about a month or so ahead of the UK with its outbreak so what happens there is a good guide to what may happen here . So who is getting H1N1 swine flu in the US ? Dr Schuchat said the virus was affecting mainly younger people rather than the elderly and made these points : -LRB- 1 -RRB- nearly 80 % of those hospitalised have been under 50 ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- average age for hospitalisation is 19 ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- average age for those who 've died is higher , at 37 ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- about 75 % of those who have died have had underlying health conditions ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- there have been very few cases in people over 65 , so they are very unlikely to be infected - but when they do get it , elderly people have a higher risk of complications and death . So how mild is mild and what sort of symptoms do people have ? Dr Schuchat said that most had a fever and respiratory symptoms , a cough , a cold , with some having diarrhoea . People may be miserable in bed for a few days , but the illness clears up on its own . The US , unlike the UK , has restricted antivirals to those at most risk of complications , so comparatively few doses of Tamiflu have been handed out . The CDC ca n't say yet how many people are asymptomatic - that is , the number of people that have such mild illness they do n't even realize they 've had swine flu - but with a million plus Americans thought to have had swine flu , it must be a pretty sizeable number . A minority can have a much tougher time , according to Dr Schuchat : `` It 's important for everyone to be aware of the virus , and especially for those with underlying health conditions , asthma , diabetes , chronic lung disease , and pregnant women : these people need to be especially concerned if they develop a fever and respiratory illness . '' Some mention has been made of obesity being a risk factor . Dr Schuhat said that those who were obese , and especially the morbidly obese -LRB- those with a Body Mass Index , or BMI , above 40 -RRB- often have chronic lung disease , and that 's why they were at risk of complications . Being obese on its own does not seem to be a risk factor . To sum up : swine flu is here to stay . For the vast majority it is nothing to worry about . For a small minority , it can cause serious illness . It should neither be dismissed out of hand nor should it be a reason for panic . Scientists must continue to monitor the virus to see whether it mutates or becomes more virulent or becomes resistant to antivirals ; thankfully , there 's no sign of those at present . A briefing by the chief medical officer for England Sir Liam Donaldson and the new Health Secretary Andy Burnham yielded some interesting new thinking on H1N1 swine flu . In order to see this content you need to have both Javascript enabled and Flash installed . Visit BBC Webwise for full instructions . If you 're reading via RSS , you 'll need to visit the blog to access this content . Let 's start with antivirals . At present , everyone in the UK who is suspected of having H1N1 swine flu is offered them . But the virus is proving so mild that it has got health officials wondering whether this really is a sensible policy . The Department of Health , like global health bodies , was expecting the next pandemic to be a more aggressive virus with a higher mortality rate . There are plenty of antivirals to go round - enough Tamiflu -LRB- and the lesser-known Relenza -RRB- for half the population , and eventually for eight in ten people in the UK . Sir Liam Donaldson said that he 'd asked scientists to look into the issue . `` People with seasonal flu do n't get antivirals , '' he said . `` Should we be treating only those who are at higher risk of complications ? '' It would represent a big shift in policy on Tamiflu . Already , some of those offered the drug are turning it down because they do n't see the point in taking it when they have only mild symptoms or are simply a close contact of someone infected , or because they want to avoid possible side-effects like nausea . But before people say that the whole pandemic issue has been a lot of fuss over very little , a word of caution . Sir Liam pointed out that they were working on the basis of three potential scenarios for this autumn and winter : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the virus is largely unchanged and remains mild ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- it changes and becomes more severe -LRB- bear in mind that all flu viruses mutate , which is why we need a new seasonal flu vaccine each winter -RRB- ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- -LRB- and the least likely option , says Donaldson -RRB- it combines with another virus subtype and a new strain emerges . If -LRB- 2 -RRB- or -LRB- 3 -RRB- occurs , then the pandemic would become more serious . Another topic that came up was vaccines . Sir Liam said the government hoped to get the first doses of H1N1 vaccine in August . By the end of the year , we were told , there might be 60 million doses , enough for about half the population , based on the assumption that each person would need two jabs . Sir Liam said there was a `` cookery book element '' to vaccine production , which I took to mean that the yield and dosing strategy varied from year to year . As a result , we ca n't yet be sure when we will get all the vaccine . Another issue , not discussed , is that the UK is just one of many countries which has contracts for vaccine , and there will be pressure from all governments to get their doses first . Another issue that the government must grapple with is who to vaccinate first . Sir Liam said that they had to strike a balance between protecting people at higher risk and targeting the vacine to slow the spread of the virus . The latter could be done by vaccinating everyone in outbreak areas . But Sir Liam indicated it was more likely that at-risk groups would be protected first . Nothing was said about front-line health workers , but I would expect this group to be among the first to be immunised . Andy Burnham said that , as with all such issues , they would be `` led by the science '' . Mr Burnham pointed out that the vaccine contracts would eventually supply 130 million doses . But officials ca n't yet say when all the jabs will arrive . It 's quite possible that millions of Britons will encounter the virus before they are offered a vaccine - it all depends on what happens this autumn . But Sir Liam pointed out that the vaccine will be useful even after this autumn : `` In all previous pandemics , excess mortality has occured for three years after the virus appeared '' . Finally , how do you know what will happen if you , your child or a friend feels ill with suspected swine flu ? The answer is : it depends entirely on where you live . In parts of London , the west Midlands and east Berkshire -LRB- all swine flu `` hot spots '' -RRB- , there is a shift away from containment towards `` outbreak management '' because there are so many cases in the community . I will set out the three phases involved in managing the outbreak in the UK : Containment phase : this is still be used in many areas where there are few cases . Contacts of infected people are traced and offered antivirals , schools may be closed and all those suspected of infection are tested via nasal and throat swabs , to produce a laboratory diagnosis . In this phase , it is the Health Protection Agency that takes the lead . Outbreak management phase : this is the policy in hotspots . Only a small proportion of suspected cases will be swabbed -LRB- so that the HPA can keep tabs on the spread of the disease -RRB- and instead , GPs will do clinical diagnosis . Schools are unlikely to close . Contacts are not traced and Tamiflu might be restricted only to those with suspected infection . Areas will change to this policy once the virus is spreading widely in their community . Each area might adapt the policy to suit their local circumstances - `` flexibility '' is the buzzword . Treatment phase : this will be a UK-wide policy , according to Sir Liam . He suggested it would be triggered when there were `` west Midlands-style outbreaks in five parts of the country '' . The NHS takes the lead instead of the HPA and it 's treated a bit like a large outbreak of seasonal flu . But the aim would be to take pressure off GPs and to encourage people to use a telephone line to report symptoms . Those who are thought to have the virus will get a unique number which will allow a `` flu friend '' to collect antivirals from a collection point - which may not be a traditional pharmacy . The HPA willl keep tabs on the virus and check if it is changing or developing resistance to antivirals . The huge increase in cases of H1N1 swine flu in the west Midlands has led to a sudden rush of the `` worried well '' to casualty . The Heart of England NHS Trust , which runs three big hospitals , says it has had to set up sectioned-off areas in casualty to deal with people who fear they have the H1N1 virus . At Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham , up to 100 extra people a day are turning up at casualty , which is something like a 25 % increase as compared to usual . The hospital is having to tie up medical staff to assess the influx of supposed swine flu cases . Anyone who does not have a fever - a temperature of over 38 degrees - plus two other symptoms -LRB- such as cough , headache or diarrhoea -RRB- is being sent home . Many simply have a cough , a cold , or are feeling a bit `` under the weather '' . For a minority with obvious symptoms of the virus , the staff performs swab tests , and then sends those patients home as well . Dr Tony Bleetman , a consultant in the emergency department , says that if you do have the virus , you should n't be going to hospital , where you may spread the disease : `` Even if they have swine flu , it 's mostly behaving like the common cold and we would n't expect people to come to hospital with that . '' If you have concerns , the advice is to contact NHS Direct . But Dr Bleetman says that many of those turning up have done that : `` The problem is that significant numbers are being sent to us after consultation with NHS Direct and we think that NHS Direct are too quick to send people to hospital . '' The problem began last week as the number of cases in the west Midlands began to soar . The Trust has appealed to `` swine flu locals '' -LRB- as they phrase it -RRB- to stay away . I 've mentioned the problem of the worried-well before . It is a real concern of the WHO that the anxious should not clog up hospital emergency rooms during a pandemic . Imagine if what 's happening in the west Midlands gets repeated at hospitals across the UK as the virus spreads . What 's interesting is that the worried well have not been a problem in Scotland , where there was a peak in swine flu cases a few weeks ago . The Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS which covers a region of two dozen hospitals , told me that they had not noticed any sudden influx at casualty . Bear in mind that Scotland has had the only death from swine flu . Maybe the public health messages have been more effective there . Or perhaps there are simply more `` worried well '' -LRB- or , as harsher observers term them , hypochondriacs -RRB- south of the border . A sharp increase in the global number of cases and deaths can been seen in the latest figures from the World Health Organisation . The total now stands at 52,160 laboratory-confirmed cases including 231 deaths in around 100 countries and territories . Beware any attempt to derive a `` death rate '' from such figures -LRB- which , by my reckoning , would come out as four deaths in every 1,000 people infected -RRB- . As has been repeatedly pointed out , the vast majority of cases go unrecorded , so the figure of 52,160 is a huge underestimate of the actual numbers . Work is clearly needed to get a more accurate figure for the mortality and morbidity -LRB- ill-health -RRB- associated with the virus . England has also seen a series of big daily increases in lab-confirmed cases in recent days . There were 204 new cases confirmed by lab tests today ; the total number in England has doubled in just five days , with the West Midlands accounting for half of all infections . The vast majority of those infected have experienced mild flu-like symptoms and fully recovered . There have been no deaths in England and one in Scotland . The graphs below will show you the figures for the six countries worldwide with the biggest case-loads , in descending order : United States , Mexico , Canada , Chile , UK , Australia . The CDC in Atlanta has held another useful briefing on the progress of H1N1 swine flu in the United States . Since the US is the global center of the outbreak with far more cases than anywhere else , though fewer deaths than in Mexico , we can learn from that experience about how the virus is behaving now and what may happen in the coming months . Dr Daniel Jernigan , Deputy Director of the Influenza Division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made these comments : `` The U.S. will likely continue to see influenza activity through the summer , and at this point we 're anticipating that we will see the novel H1N1 continue with activity probably all the way into our flu season in the fall and winter . The amount of activity we expect to be low , and then pick up later . In terms of the numbers of infections that have been laboratory confirmed as H1N1 , there are now more than 17,800 of those in the United States , including around 1,600 that have been hospitalized and 44 that have died . As we have been saying all along , these numbers are likely an underestimate of the number of cases that are out there . There are some surveys that indicate that the amount of disease in the areas that are having activity with H1N1 is perhaps around 7 % of the population reporting symptoms due to influenza-like illness . The virus continues to impact mostly younger people . So far it is not causing significant illness and death in the elderly like we would see with seasonal influenza . And the symptoms that are being reported are consistent with influenza , that being predominantly fever , cough , some shortness of breath , fatigue and chills . There is some vomiting and diarrhea that have been associated with cases of this infection . Everyone needs to be alert to the symptoms of the illness , and especially if you have underlying conditions , such as asthma , diabetes and heart disease . '' For me , the 7 % figure jumps out . That would mean many millions of cases in the US already , and would be good news because it would mean that the risk of serious illness or death -LRB- already small -RRB- was even lower . Earlier CDC estimates reckoned that 19 out of 20 cases were going undetected . Jon Cohen from Science Magazine put this question : `` Jon Cohen : Dr. Jernigan , you said there might be as many as 100,000 Americans infected . With the finding that 7 % had influenza-like illness in affected communities , that extrapolates to 20 million Americans . Could you give an estimate that 's more up to date than the 100,000 ? `` Dan Jernigan : `` Well , the 100,000 , as you know , is a rough generalization to try to give a sense of the magnitude of infections that might be there relative to the numbers of laboratory confirmed that we actually had . And so as you can see , in some areas , where there have been a lot of transmissions , like New York City , they 're finding maybe around 7 % of the community was infected , or had influenza-like illness . There 's some other parts of the U.S. where some of our preliminary data suggests the same thing . I think it would be inaccurate to try and take an attack rate of 7 % or an area that 's highly affected and apply that to the U.S. population . Because as we all know , the amount of disease is different in different parts of the U.S. And so clearly there are hundreds of thousands of cases that have occurred in the U.S. . We are working to get a very good estimate of that . But at this point , it would be incorrect to take that percent and apply it to the U.S. '' So the CDC clearly does n't yet have a clear idea of the true number of cases in the US beyond saying that there have clearly been hundreds of thousands . One final quote from Dr Jernigan on those who are most at risk of complications responding to a question from Emma Hitt at MedScape : `` Dan Jernigan : Your question is , what numbers of individuals that are hospitalized have underlying diseases , and about 70 % have some kind of underlying disease . The most predominant of that is asthma . The second being diabetes . Immunocompromised status , either through cancer chemotherapy or other compromising conditions is about 13 % . And chronic underlying heart disease . The things that we see normally as underlying diseases that are associated with increased influenza risk are the same that we 're seeing with H1N1 . '' Cases seem to be declining in New York , one of the worst affected areas . For those interested in the impact on health and hospitalisations in the city , there is more detail available from the NYC Department of Health . A further sign of the spread of H1N1 swine flu in the UK has come with news that many patients in Birmingham who exhibit symptoms will no longer have laboratory tests to confirm the disease . Instead , doctors will rely on clinical diagnosis -LRB- in other words , a simple physical examination -RRB- . The west Midlands has just over half of all the confirmed cases of swine flu in England . Furthermore , in the areas of significant community spread in Birmingham , antivirals will be restricted to high risk and immediate contacts and household members , rather than everyone that an infected person may have been in contact with . This is exactly what was announced last week in Scotland regarding the outbreaks in Glasgow and Paisley . It 's entirely unsurprising , and a common-sense response once there are significant levels of transmission . One hundred and ten further patients under investigation in England were confirmed as having swine flu through laboratory testing today , together with 22 in Scotland . This brings the official total since April to 1,784 . The real figure will be significantly higher . The vast majority have had a mild illness with no complications . There are currently six people in hospital in Scotland who have the virus . Before the numbers , here are some points to bear in mind . First , health officials have been charting the spread of H1N1 swine flu for around seven weeks now . Most of the cases mentioned will now be virus-free and healthy . Second , the WHO figures lag behind the real total by a couple of days . For example , the death toll for the US is quite a bit below the current figures from the CDC . But the WHO figures , while out of date , are reliable . Third , all the graphs vastly underestimate the actual number of cases . The CDC has said that perhaps 19 out of 20 cases go unrecorded , and the state of Victoria in Australia has stopped laboratory testing of uncomplex community cases . Given those caveats , I think the figures are useful . Global H1N1 swine flu cases First , the global tally from the WHO . As of 1700 BST on 15 June 2009 , 76 countries have officially reported 35,928 cases of influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- infection , including 163 deaths . Now let 's look at some individual countries . The number of confirmed cases in the UK now stands at 1,562 . There has been one death , that of 38-year-old Jacqueline Fleming , a mother who gave birth prematurely after contracting the virus . Yesterday , it was announced that her son Jack had also died . He did not have the virus . A further 141 patients were confirmed with H1N1 swine flu in England today -LRB- I think this is a record number for one day in England -RRB- , bringing the total to 952 cases . Of the new cases in England , 124 appeared in the west Midlands , where 512 people have been affected by the virus . There was one new case in Northern Ireland , bringing the total to nine . Three cases have been recorded in Wales . Health Protection Scotland said there had been 10 new laboratory-confirmed cases today , taking the total to 508 , with 414 possible cases under investigation . 17,855 cases and 45 deaths at 15 June . This represents a rise of 4,638 cases and 18 deaths since the last report on 12 June . 6,241 cases and 108 deaths with no cases reported in the last three days . This can surely only mean that the figures were not forthcoming or that the authorities are not testing in the community . I will try to investigate further . Yesterday , the US State Department said that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- had lifted the recommendation that American citizens avoid all non-essential travel to Mexico . I 'm going to talk here about the risks associated with getting H1N1 swine flu during pregnancy . Although it 's not been officially confirmed , it 's understood that the first person with H1N1 swine flu to die in Britain was a 38-year-old mother who had given birth prematurely . The patient , who has not yet been named , was admitted to hospital with swine flu and gave birth earlier this month to a premature baby . The child was born at 29 weeks gestation . Few details have yet been confirmed by the Scottish authorities ; they have so far said only that the patient had `` underlying health conditions '' . Her death is very sad news , and everyone 's thoughts must be with her family , friends and the medical staff who cared for her . Before I go on to discuss the elevated risks of swine flu associated with pregnancy , it 's important to stress , as I do repeatedly , that the vast majority of people who contract this virus have a mild disease which lasts a few days . Many will have no symptoms at all . The official figure for the UK is 1,261 cases and this is the first death . But there will have been hundreds - maybe many thousands - of cases which have gone unrecorded . So instead of being one death in 1,261 cases , it is undoubtedly a lot less than that . With around 700,000 babies born in the UK each year , I know that many women and their partners will be concerned . So please be reassured that the vast majority of pregnant women who get infected will be okay , as will their unborn children . Having put all those caveats in place , it is true that pregnancy is a risk factor for swine flu . The director general of the World Health Organization , Margaret Chan , had this to say about pregnancy last week , in her speech declaring a flu pandemic : `` Without question , pregnant women are at increased risk of complications . This heightened risk takes on added importance for a virus , like this one , that preferentially infects younger age groups . '' But remember that pregnancy is also a risk factor for seasonal flu , especially in the last trimester . Flu poses a threat both to the mother and to the unborn child . Among the complications , the fever associated with flu can lead to a premature delivery . Health advisers recommended three years ago that pregnant women should be among the groups offered a seasonal flu jab . When a vaccine for H1N1 swine flu becomes available in the autumn , pregnant women may well be among the first `` at risk '' groups offered the jab . What about antiviral drugs and pregnancy ? During pregnancy , the concern with any drug is that it may pass through the placenta and affect the baby . There is a risk factor especially during the first trimester . Oseltamivir -LRB- currently best known as the brand name Tamiflu -RRB- is not usually recommended for pregnant women because the side-effects are unknown . But the lesser-known inhaled drug Relenza -LRB- a brand name for zanamivir -RRB- can be prescribed on medical advice , according to the Department of Health . `` An expert group reviewed the risk of antiviral treatment in pregnancy , which is extremely small - much smaller than the risk posed by the symptoms of swine flu . '' There are more details on pregnancy and swine flu on the government health pages . The death of a woman suffering from H1N1 swine flu in Scotland is a sad reminder that this is not always a mild infection . This is not only the first confirmed death in Britain , but the first outside of the Americas . But it is not a signal that the virus is getting more virulent or that people are at any greater threat . The vast majority of the 1,200-plus people who have had the virus in the UK have experienced mild symptoms and then fully recovered . Throughout the world , swine flu does present a slightly higher risk to those with existing respiratory illness , asthma , cardiovascular disease and obesity . It 's worth remembering that seasonal flu kills several thousand people in the UK each winter . The difference with H1N1 swine flu is that the virus is almost exclusively targeting people under 65 . It is likely that cases in the northern hemisphere may tail off in the summer months , with a much bigger outbreak in the autumn . The virus ca n't be stopped altogether , but everyone can help to slow its spread by observing simple hygiene measures , and by staying home if they get the virus . Do you want to avoid catching H1N1 swine flu ? You could find a remote , uninhabited island until a vaccine is created . I think that 's going a bit far . But the best defense is age . So far , the over-65s has been the group least likely to catch the infection . This has led to me receiving cheery comments from retired people saying that it 's the first time in some while that they 've felt glad to be old . So why are n't they falling ill ? The likeliest explanation is that they have built up immunity over years of exposure to other H1N1 flu viruses . That might also help to explain why most other people get a mild infection . But I 'm still puzzled as to why 30 - to 50-year-olds are suffering a disproportionate amount of severe illness . In fact , I 'm a bit puzzled as to exactly which age groups - under the age of 65 - are most at risk of severe illness . `` We know that the novel H1N1 virus preferentially infects younger people . In nearly all areas with large and sustained outbreaks , the majority of cases have occurred in people under the age of 25 years . `` In some of these countries , around 2 % of cases have developed severe illness , often with very rapid progression to life-threatening pneumonia . Most cases of severe and fatal infections have been in adults between the ages of 30 and 50 years . This pattern is significantly different from that seen during epidemics of seasonal influenza , when most deaths occur in frail elderly people . Many , though not all , severe cases have occurred in people with underlying chronic conditions . `` Based on limited , preliminary data , conditions most frequently seen include respiratory diseases , notably asthma , cardiovascular disease , diabetes , autoimmune disorders , and obesity . `` At the same time , it is important to note that around one third to half of the severe and fatal infections are occurring in previously healthy young and middle-aged people . Without question , pregnant women are at increased risk of complications . This heightened risk takes on added importance for a virus , like this one , that preferentially infects younger age groups . '' This was very similar - up to a point - to the briefing yesterday by the CDC in Atlanta . You 'll notice the same emphasis on younger age groups , pregnant women and those with underlying health problems . This is what Dr Anne Schuchat had to say about the US experience of H1N1 swine flu : `` It is a very new virus . 57 % of the cases that we 're having reported to us occur in people five to 24 years of age , and 41 % of the hospitalisations are in that same age group - the older children and young adults . But I also want to tell you about the rates , the cases per 100,000 population , and let you know that the highest rates of hospitalization are actually in children under five . And the next highest rates are in those people 5 to 24 . So it looks like this is a virus that 's disproportionately affecting younger people but there are still lots of infections and hospitalizations in older persons . `` According to the US statistics , 71 % of the hospitalized patients have occurred in people who have an underlying condition - respiratory illness like asthma or conic obstructive pulmonary disease , immune deficiencies , and so forth . As we have noted , there 's been a disproportionate amount of pregnant women among those who have had infection . '' Did you spot the difference ? Dr Schuchat made no direct mention of the 30-50 age group , although she did mention that there were lots of people over 24 who are taken to hospital . If the 30-50 year group is especially at risk , it would be good to know . I 'm still just in that age group myself , so maybe it 's self-interest at work here . No doubt all will become clearer in the months ahead . When it does , I will let you know . There were three in the 20th Century . The worst , Spanish flu in 1918 , killed perhaps 50 to 100 million people - but that was before the antibiotic era . The pandemics of 1957 and 1968 killed one to two million . Even that sounds alarming , but bear in mind that normal seasonal flu contributes to up half a million deaths per year . And H1N1 flu is currently so mild that , in terms of deaths , it might not be much worse than a bad normal winter of flu . But it is different in the groups it targets . Very few elderly people are catching H1N1 flu , probably because they have immunity due to exposure to similar flu viruses . Instead , the peak groups are children and young adults aged 5-24 , followed by children under five , and then adults under 50 . Most of those who fall seriously ill , with complications like pneumonia , have underlying health problems . People will want to know when they are likely to be exposed to H1N1 . That 's impossible to say with any accuracy , but the summer months may suppress the virus somewhat in Britain , and it may be the late autumn or beyond before we see a full-scale epidemic in every community . The government 's pandemic plans suggest that perhaps a third of the population could get infected , causing huge rates of absenteeism from work , and extra pressure on the health service . There is concern that the virus might mutate in the southern hemisphere over its winter and become more virulent , but there 's no sign of that yet . A pandemic vaccine is in early development ; it will be autumn before the first doses are ready ; they will be earmarked for front-line health workers and those with health problems . Along with Chile and Japan , these are the countries which are forcing the move to Phase 6 , a global epidemic or pandemic . Dr Ian Barr is the Deputy Director of the WHO Influenza Centre in Australia . He 's based in Melbourne , which is the center of the flu outbreak there . The state of Victoria has had more than 1,000 confirmed cases of swine flu and Dr Barr said that the government was now changing the way it managed the outbreak . `` If someone is ill then we will continue to ask that they stay at home and do n't go out and risk infecting anyone . But there wo n't be a recommendation for quarantining whole families as has happened . `` Unless someone falls quite ill they wo n't be given antiviral treatment like Tamiflu and we wo n't trace their contacts . We wo n't close schools if there 's a single case , so it 's a much more relaxed approach than we 've had prior to this phase . '' But Dr Barr said that the virus was not causing serious problems : `` We 've had just a handful of cases admitted to hospital and no deaths . `` There 've been very mild symptoms among the 1,000 laboratory confirmed cases and probably thousands more that have not been tested . '' With the southern hemisphere moving into its peak winter flu season , it will be vital to keep a close watch on what happens there in the months ahead . Scotland , by contrast , is heading into summer . That did not stop 47 new cases being confirmed there today , the highest number for a single day . It takes the total to 311 . Ten people are in hospital . Dr Harry Burns , the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland , said that there was no doubt that they were seeing community transmission well beyond the confirmed cases . `` The last figures I saw there were between 30 and 40 cases where there was no known source for the infection - it did not seem to be travel-related or connected to a particular outbreak . But sometimes people do n't always remember their contacts '' . Dr Burns said that there was also no doubt that there were plenty of cases going untested and unmeasured , just as was happening in other countries . I asked him whether it was time for a change in approach as is happening in Australia , with fewer school closures and so on . `` We are getting close to a change in strategy , but quite how and when it is rolled out we ca n't say yet . We will continue to take scientific advice . `` If you have a new travel-related case in a rural part of Scotland where there have been no cases , then you may look for contacts . That might be less so in other areas where there have been lots of cases . '' He has no doubt that the virus is here to stay and he hoped that it would remain a largely mild infection . `` But it 's worth preparing for the worst . The nightmare scenario a few years ago was that H5N1 avian flu would reassort with a human flu virus in pigs . `` If H1N1 reassorted with H5N1 , it would be important to have some initial protection against the H1N1 strain . That 's why it 's worth creating a vaccine . '' So it 's now just a question of timing . Within a day or so the World Health Organisation will officially declare a pandemic of H1N1 swine flu . The move to pandemic Phase 6 will be official confirmation that the H1N1 virus is here to stay and that it will continue to spread globally . It must be hoped that the world does not over-react . It will probably be months before most of us come into contact with the virus , and when we do , the vast majority will experience mild flu symptoms . It is not an indication that the virus is becoming more virulent . If those messages can be effectively communicated to the public , it could prevent a lot of unnecessary alarm . A key decision concerns vaccines . Several manufacturers now have an H1N1 seed virus strain , and will be doing safety and efficacy testing in the coming months . We do n't know how well the virus will grow or how many doses people will need to be protected . Given the moderate nature of H1N1 it would be inconceivable for the WHO to ask manufacturers to switch completely from production of seasonal flu to a pandemic vaccine . More likely is that companies will try to do a bit of both . Several countries , including the UK , have contracts to provide enough doses to immunise their entire populations . But despite upscaling in production in recent years , there wo n't be enough jabs to go round globally . The first bulk doses might be ready in the late autumn and would be earmarked for frontline emergency staff and those with chronic respiratory problems . It 's possible that by the time an H1N1 vaccine is ready , the virus will already be spreading rapidly in the northern hemisphere . We will learn a lot from what happens in Australia and other southern hemisphere countries in the months ahead . So are we over-reacting to swine flu ? I do n't believe so . Even a pandemic of mostly mild illness will still cause huge disruption to business and society during its peak because it mostly affects those of working and school age . Although the vast majority of those infected get mild symptoms , a few get seriously ill . The WHO estimates that about half the 140 deaths so far have been in young people who were previously healthy . We must also watch out for genetic reassortment - or drift - in the DNA of the virus which might make it more virulent in future . There 's no sign of that yet but it 's another reason why we should all take the pandemic seriously , without the need for panic . When is a pandemic not a pandemic ? When the World Health Organization says so . With the virus spreading in Australia , where there 's been a four-fold increase in cases in a week , it might seem surprising that global health officials have not yet moved from the current Phase 5 to 6 , which would mean that a pandemic had been declared . Predictions are a mug 's game - but , on BBC TV and radio this evening , I stuck my neck out and said that a pandemic declaration was likely within days , or possibly weeks at the outside . The reason for this was that listening to the WHO 's assistant director general Dr Keiji Fukuda in the weekly media briefing , it seemed to me that the WHO was holding back from declaring a pandemic for political reasons . I 'm not suggesting anything underhand , but simply that member states and scientists have advised the WHO that it must prepare the ground before making the move to Level 6 . The WHO ca n't ignore the surge in cases in Australia , and , to a lesser extent , the leap in cases in the UK and Chile . Dr Fukuda said that he feared `` a blossoming of anxiety '' - in other words , panic - if they suddenly declare a pandemic . It 's true that the word `` pandemic '' sounds scary . But it simply means a global epidemic of an infectious disease . It is not a signal that the virus is getting more virulent ; it has nothing to do with severity ; rather , it is a measure of geographical spread . And we must remember that the vast majority of people who get H1N1 swine flu have a mild illness . Dr Fukuda said that it was fair to say that we are `` really getting close '' to declaring a pandemic , but that the WHO wanted to avoid or reduce the sort adverse actions that had happened when it last raised the threat level , such as the culling of pigs , unnecessary concerns over pork , trade embargoes , travel restrictions and concerns about travellers from certain areas . `` These are the kinds of potential adverse effects you can have if you go out without making sure that people understand the situation as well as possible . `` In earlier pandemics , we have often seen that people who are worried , but not particularly sick , have over-run hospitals and led to a dsyfunction in the health system because so many are going to emergency rooms , adversely affecting people who really require emergency care . We 'd like to minimize the risks of that . '' Listening to that , it does seem sensible that the WHO first prepares the ground before moving to Phase 6 . The media must play a part here , emphasising the facts about this virus and not over-reacting . Governments , too , have a big role to play , ensuring that their pandemic plans are in place . And businesses must prepare for the coming of a virus which , even if it is mild , will cause huge numbers of absences from work . Remember , though , that when a pandemic is declared , it wo n't make any difference to most of us . Different countries will experience local epidemics at different times . What matters is when H1N1 begins to spread rapidly within your community , way beyond schools and unrelated to travel . Only then might the virus make a tangible difference to your daily life . Two experts on infectious disease in Australia say a flu pandemic has effectively already started because of the widespread number of cases there . Robert Booy , professor of Child Health at the University of Sydney in New South Wales , urged the World Health Organisation to take action regarding a shift from the current alert phase 5 to the top level , phase 6 : `` The WHO ca n't keep scratching their heads , they have to make a decision , '' he said . Professor Booy , who works at the Children 's Hospital , Westmead , said the H1N1 virus was `` unstoppable '' and would continue to spread around the world . He expressed surprise that the WHO had not already declared a pandemic - a global epidemic of a new flu strain - because the H1N1 virus `` fulfilled the criteria of community spread '' . As yesterday 's post made clear , the WHO has said once we have `` community level outbreaks '' in another region outside the Americas , then a pandemic will be declared . This means that the virus must be spreading widely , beyond schools and unrelated to travel . Professor Booy said his neighbouring state of Victoria now had so many cases they would no longer be testing people with flu symptoms in the community , but rather limiting the test to those who needed hospital treatment . `` We have community transmission in Victoria , '' he said . Victoria has by far the bulk of Australia 's swine flu cases . The Australian government said that of the country 's 1,211 total confirmed cases , 1,011 had been reported in Victoria . The number of cases in Australia have risen four-fold in a week . Professor Booy said this was unsurprising . `` The cycle of infection is about two days . For every one person with the virus , another 1.5 people get infected , so that gets you to a four-fold rise in six to seven days '' . Professor Booy said thankfully the virus was causing mostly mild symptoms . `` We have had some hospitalisations , and one person in intensive care , but all are doing well , '' he said . Fewer than 10 of the flu cases nationwide have required hospital admission . There have been no deaths . Raina MacIntyre , professor of Infectious Diseases Epidemiology at the University of New South Wales , said according to the WHO 's definition of a pandemic , `` we are in Phase 6 ; technically we are there already . '' But she added , `` it 's just a guideline , and when the definitions were devised they did n't factor in severity . I think the WHO approach is reasonable given that there would be widespread economic , tourism and trade implications if a pandemic was declared '' . Professor MacIntyre explained that the traditional thinking was that a pandemic would be caused by a new haemagglutinin antigen . This is one of the surface proteins on the flu virus , and is responsible for it binding to infected cells . `` We thought it would be caused by an H5 or an H9 type , rather than H1 which is not really new . When you look at the immunological response of the various age groups , people over 65 have a good level of protection , and only people under 18 have no immunity while many young adults have little immunity . '' Professor Booy , who helped draw up Australia 's pandemic flu plan said `` We had many assumptions and one was that a new flu virus would cause high mortality caused by something really novel . The H1 gene has been with us for centuries . '' But he warned that the virus could mutate or `` drift '' in the coming months . `` We already know of cases where people have got double infections - both H1N1 and seasonal flu - and that 's what you need for viruses to reassort . '' Apologies for constantly updating the figures , but I feel it 's necessary at the moment : first , because the virus is continuing to spread ; second , because of the dramatic surge in cases in the southern hemisphere . The World Health Organization 's latest figures show that 73 countries have officially reported 25,288 of influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- infection -LRB- more commonly known as swine flu -RRB- including 139 deaths . It 's worth comparing that with figures a week ago , when there were 17,410 cases in 62 countries and 115 deaths . It 's interesting to see the surge in cases over the past week in the southern hemisphere , which is entering its winter flu season . Australia 's cases have leapt from 297 to 1051 . Chile 's cases have jumped from 250 to 411 , with one death . The UK has also seen a big increase . A week ago , the WHO reported 229 cases ; today it had 557 -LRB- and remember that the WHO figures always lag behind national statistics by a few days -RRB- . If you are keeping track of what 's happening in the UK , the more up-to-date figures are these : in Scotland , 43 more cases were announced today , bringing the total there to 232 ; add four cases in Northern Ireland and two in Wales for a total of 664 - please forgive me if my arithmetic fails me at any point . 10 of the confirmed cases in Scotland are in hospital , including three in intensive care . Seven health care workers are now also among the confirmed cases . It 's worth stressing yet again that the vast majority of people who have contracted swine flu have got mild symptoms . So with 664 confirmed cases in the UK and more than a thousand in Australia , will a pandemic be declared by the WHO - and if so , when ? The WHO defines Phase Six : `` Phase 6 , the pandemic phase , is characterized by community level outbreaks in at least one other country in a different WHO region in addition to the criteria defined in Phase 5 . Designation of this phase will indicate that a global pandemic is under way . '' You might argue that we are already there . But the WHO is looking for what it calls `` sustained disease outbreaks '' in the community . We have plenty of these in North America , and are waiting for them to occur in another of the six WHO regions . According to Professor Anthony Kessel , Director of Public Health Strategy at the Health Protecgtion Agency , we are not there yet : `` The number of sporadic cases remains under twenty . These are confirmed cases of infection , but where there 's no obvious link with travel or a known case '' . Professor Kessel said that `` we would need to have a significant number of people where you really do n't know how they have got it , for it to be classified as sustained community transmission . We are getting closer to that , but are not there yet . '' Finally , a quick update on anti-virals and potential side-effects , which some have asked me about . Professor Kessel said that Tamiflu has so far been used mostly for children in the UK because of the outbreaks in schools . `` There have been reports of some side-effects , '' he said . `` The most common have been nausea and stomach pain , which is in line with the manufacturers ' written warnings . At the HPA , we have reiterated the advice that it 's best taken with food , as this seems to help . '' Professor Kessel said that when anti-virals were prescribed , the HPA was very clear that this was advisory : `` It 's up to parents and their children together to decide whether or not to take Tamiflu - there is no obligation to comply . '' It 's understandable that H1N1 swine flu has made fewer appearances on radio and television bulletins in recent weeks . There was massive coverage when the virus first emerged and when the WHO raised the pandemic threat level to five , one short of six when a pandemic is declared . But just because swine flu is not getting so much publicity , it does not mean it has gone away . Nor does it mean that the risk of a pandemic - a global epidemic of flu - has abated . A few figures just released show how cases of swine flu continue to rise . Health Protection Scotland has confirmed 22 new cases . This includes two doctors at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley , who are thought to have caught it from patients being treated there . It brings the Scottish total to 141 including four patients who are in a critical but stable condition . The Health Protection Agency in England has confirmed 27 new cases , bringing the total to 363 . Northern Ireland and Wales have two cases each . It brings the UK total to 508 . In the United States the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- has also put out new data which it says it will now update only weekly , on Fridays . It has 13,217 confirmed and probable cases and 27 deaths . At present the number of confirmed US cases is rising by about 1,000 per day . The World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- released a new global update earlier today . Although it lags behind national statistics , it is still the gold standard for assessing the spread of H1N1 swine flu . It reports 21,940 cases in 69 countries including 125 deaths - 103 of these in Mexico . Australia has 876 confirmed cases according to the WHO , up from 501 in two days . It now has the highest case-load outside North America . July and August will be the peak season for flu in Australia and there are signs that the virus is taking hold there very quickly . If widespread community outbreaks are reported in Australia -LRB- or the United Kingdom , Chile or Japan in the coming weeks it will be a signal for the WHO to declare a pandemic because the virus will have been shown to be spreading widely in two WHO regions of the world . The US has far more cases of H1N1 swine flu than anywhere else so they are beginning to get some more robust statistics which may help in our understanding of how this virus will affect the world . Dr Schuchat said there was evidence that flu activity was declining in the nation as a whole , with the start of the summer in North America . Young children together with young and middle age adults were those most affected by H1N1 flu . Unlike seasonal flu , the virus seems to be sparing the elderly . Here are the statistics - the US has : 11,468 probable and confirmed cases of H1N1 swine flu -LRB- it 's worth remembering that laboratory confirmed cases in the US represent only a small fraction of the real total -RRB- 770 people have been hospitalised 60 % of all cases are among people aged 5-24 years 42 % hospitalisations are among people aged 5-24 years Next highest group are children under 5 Very low rates of cases and hospitalisations in people over 65 Dr Schuchat said that the CDC had provided several manufacturers with candidate vaccine virus strains . This will enable them to produce pilot lots of vaccine which can be tested for safety and efficacy . That will probably take a couple of months . At that point , the WHO and CDC will have to make the difficult decision about whether to ask manufacturers to bulk produce an H1N1 pandemic vaccine . It 's a difficult call because it would mean reducing the amount of seasonal flu vaccine production . Given that manufacturers are mid-way through the production of seasonal flu vaccine for the northern hemisphere this autumn , those stocks are unlikely to be affected . It is next year 's immunisation in the southern hemisphere which would probably feel the first impact of any switch to pandemic flu vaccine production . Dr Schuchat pointed out that seasonal flu caused around 200,000 hospitalisations in the US each year and about 36,000 deaths , so this was a disease they took very seriously . Worst affected are people over 65 . She said the CDC would be recommending that the usual at-risk groups get immunised . In the US this includes children aged 6 months to 18 years -LRB- a group not targeted in the UK -RRB- , pregnant women , the elderly , those with serious health problems , and anyone who wants to reduce their risk of getting flu . I think it 's a safe prediction that there will be a record uptake for the jab later this year . So no decision has been made yet about whether to push the button on creating a mass stockpile of H1N1 vaccine in the US , or indeed the world . Dr Schuchat said they would await the outcome of test vaccine studies and carefully monitor the epidemiology of the virus . A decision , she said , would be made in the early autumn . One encouraging fact is that tests of virus samples from around the world have not shown any variations ; in other words , it does n't look like there has been any mutation or drift in its genetic structure . How many people in the UK have swine flu ? Do you want the official or the unofficial figure ? The number of laboratory-confirmed cases stood last night at 404 . But there are undoubtedly some cases which have gone undetected . Professor John Oxford , a virologist at Queen Mary School of Medicine , University of London , has come up with a figure . Speaking this morning on 5 Live Breakfast , he speculated that there could be 20,000 infected people in the UK . His theory goes that most of them have had such mild illness , it 's gone undetected . I spoke to him afterwards and he stressed that this is a pure `` guesstimate '' rather than a scientific analysis of the figures . He stressed that the number was not meant to be alarming - and that quite the contrary , it shows that the virus causes mild symptoms in the vast majority of cases . Professor Anthony Kessel , Director of Public Health Strategy at the Health Protection Agency agreed that there are some undetected cases out there , but he did n't think that it was tens of thousands . He said that the UK had among the best flu surveillance systems in the world and doubted there could be that many cases . That may leave you none the wiser . We may get a better idea by looking at what 's happening in the United States . There , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website says that there have now been 11,054 confirmed and probable cases . But it has also repeatedly stated that possibly 19 out of 20 cases are going undetected . As I said in a post on Tuesday , this could mean that there are 200,000 or more people in the United States who have been infected . So can you simply multiply the current official UK figure of 404 by 20 , giving us around 8,000 cases here ? It 's quite a lot less than Professor Oxford 's guesstimate , though still a lot . But there are two differences I can think of between the UK and the US which may make that figure lower . First , the virus is not as well established here as it is in North America . We are seeing cases pop up out of the blue , but most are linked to current outbreaks . Second , the UK does have a very well organised flu surveillance service , one of the features of our GP network set within a national health service . Contrast that with the fragmented healthcare on offer in the US and it 's little wonder that surveillance here is likely to be better . All that probably means that fewer cases are going undetected here than in the US . Whether it 's a few hundred or many thousands though , it 's impossible to say . A nurse in Scotland has become the first health worker in the UK to catch swine flu . The 26-year-old , who works at a Glasgow hospital , had been treating a patient who is now in intensive care with the virus . The details were given by the Scottish Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon . The nurse is now recovering at home . There are now four people , critical but stable with swine flu , in hospitals in Glasgow and Paisley . A 23-year-old woman from Paisley was admitted today . Initially , it was thought that she had no underlying health problems , but Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board later ascertained that this is not the case . It was only a matter of time before Africa recorded its first case of H1N1 swine flu . AFP reported that a 12-year-old girl who 'd traveled from the United States has been confirmed as Egypt 's first case of swine flu . A government statement said that no other passengers on the flight showed signs of infection . Egypt has also had sporadic cases of H5N1 avian influenza , the latest reported yesterday . Of the 78 cases of H5N1 reported , 27 have been fatal . Thankfully , H5N1 is very hard to catch and almost always requires direct contact with infected poultry . It is not an infectious human disease like H1N1 . What the world is most anxious to avoid is the two viruses mixing . I 've just finished listening to the now-weekly press briefing on H1N1 swine flu given by the World Health Organization in Geneva and here are some of the main points . Dr Keiji Fukuda , WHO 's Assistant Director-General , said that the virus had now reached 64 countries with 18,965 laboratory-confirmed cases and 117 deaths . `` We are getting closer to phase six , '' said Dr Fukuda , which would mean that a pandemic had occurred . He divided the global outbreak into three types : countries in North America where virus spread is advanced - Mexico , the United States and Canada ; the group of countries - which he described as being `` in transition '' , some in Europe , some in Asia , also Australia - where a larger number of cases is occurring , many linked to institutions ; countries where there is no real evidence of spread into communities and cases are largely travel-related . Dr Fukuda said that the countries in transition are moving towards community-type spread and include the UK , Spain , Japan , Chile and Australia . `` But we are still waiting for evidence of widespread community activity , so that 's why we are not in phase six yet '' . He went on to say that the WHO was choosing not to describe the outbreak as mild . `` This infection can be fatal - in those who have underlying medical conditions , pregnant women and in some people who were otherwise healthy . '' And he said that we do n't know what will happen in the southern hemisphere in the coming months , or in the northern hemisphere later in the year . The severity of the outbreaks , he said , would vary from location to location , according to the vulnerability of populations and their preparedness . I asked Dr Fukuda which age groups were most likely to catch the virus and to die from it . `` The majority of people who have got infected are under 60 years of age , although some people over 60 have also got infected , '' he said . `` Those who have got severely ill - with complications such as severe pneumonia and those who have died - have tended to be younger to middle age adults aged 20-40 or so , but not exclusively . '' That ties in with the pattern one might expect from a flu pandemic . Normal seasonal flu tends to hit the elderly most severely ; in pandemics , it is often young adults who are worst affected . As yet , neither person has any known links to other cases , to travel or to each other . The man is believed to be the first person in Britain to be taken critically ill , suffering only from swine flu . The woman is said to have underlying health problems as does a third patient , a 38-year-old man , who was admitted to intensive care at a hospital in Glasgow last week . If you ask most people where you are most likely to catch H1N1 swine flu , my guess is they would answer , Mexico . That was the case initially , but has not been for some time . Although most deaths from the virus have been in Mexico , it 's the United States which has been the center of the global outbreak for several weeks now . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- CDC H1N1 Flu website has reported 10,053 probable or confirmed cases of swine flu , up from nearly 9,000 on Friday and 17 deaths . Furthermore , the virus has spread to all 50 states . In one sense that would be worrying , as it would indicate that H1N1 is well and truly here to stay and that a pandemic is almost certain . But it would also confirm that the virus is causing mostly very mild illness , and mean that the death toll from a pandemic might be no worse than with seasonal flu . Remember though that scientists are still learning about the virus and are unsure how any pandemic might The World Health Organisation says the global number of confirmed cases of H1N1 is 17,410 in 62 countries , including 115 deaths . Since then , Bulgaria and Luxembourg have confirmed their first cases of the disease . One of the UK 's leading flu experts has predicted that a pandemic of swine flu is likely to strike Britain in the autumn . Professor John Oxford , an expert on virology at Queen Mary School of Medicine , University of London , says that children going back to school , universities reopening and people going back to work after the summer break would give swine flu the `` opportunity '' that it needs to spread . Another fifteen cases of swine flu were confirmed yesterday by the Health Protection Agency , bringing the UK total to 244 . One of the cases was in Wales and is believed to be the first there . But Professor Oxford thinks that many cases are going undetected : `` Already , sporadic cases in the UK have been shown that are not linked with cases that have traveled . That does suggest that the virus is silently spreading around . '' However , he said that people should behave as usual , as far as possible , if a pandemic strikes . `` What we do n't want is people stopping at home and not going to work , because then you have an economic problem on top of a pandemic , '' he said . `` The best advice is to carry on as normal but to be sensible about it . `` This includes a bit of social distancing and shielding people from coughs by coughing into the crux of your arm . '' Professor Oxford said that in the next few months , global health officials will be keeping a close eye on what happens to the H1N1 swine flu virus in countries like Australia and South Africa . The southern hemisphere is entering its winter and the peak period for flu . On Friday , the World Health Organization reported that Australia has had 147 confirmed cases ; Argentina has had 37 ; and none so far in South Africa . What happens in the southern hemisphere in the coming months will be a good indicator of how the virus will behave in Europe and North America later this year . There would be particular concern if H1N1 mutated substantially to become a more virulent illness . Thankfully , there are no signs of that yet . The Australian Science Media Centre is an excellent resource for anyone wanting to know what experts are thinking about the spread of the virus there .

Sameerah Ahmad died at Birmingham Children 's Hospital on Friday evening after contracting the virus . Her father Imran Ahmad , from Edgbaston , attended the opening of the inquest at Birmingham Coroner 's Court . The hospital 's Dr Gale Pearson told the court that Sameerah had a condition which had weakened her immune system . Her death is the third swine-flu related fatality in the UK . The other two were in Scotland . There must be a lot of parents who are worried and are very aware of your grief The Health Protection Agency confirmed on Tuesday there are now 6,538 cases in the UK . Aiden Cotter , Birmingham and Solihull 's coroner , confirmed Sameerah had been infected with the H1N1 virus when she died and gave details of other serious health problems . She was born with a rare genetic disorder affecting the small intestine called microvillus inclusion disease , which causes severe and often life-threatening diarrhoea , the inquest heard . A post-mortem examination was due to be carried out on Tuesday and the inquest was adjourned . Sameerah 's body was released to her family on Tuesday afternoon and her coffin was taken to the family home where relatives and teachers from her school paid their respects . A rare genetic disorder of the small intestine Causes chronic , severe diarrhoea in newborn babies , which can lead to serious dehydration and a condition called metabolic acidosis Nearly always fatal , but can sometimes be treated by intravenous feeding or an intestinal transplant The six-year-old attended Mayfield School , a school for children with special needs in Lozells , Birmingham , which has been closed until Monday . Mr Ahmad told the court his daughter had suffered during her lifetime . Asked if he wanted a post-mortem examination to be carried out , he replied : `` Obviously I do not , because she has been through a lot already in her life . '' However , he said he accepted it , if it was `` the law '' . Mr Cotter told him a post-mortem examination was necessary to find out how his daughter had died , but was not strict law . `` It may be that , when we have all the evidence in , we still wo n't know but it 's important we try and find out , '' the coroner said . Mr Cotter said he was releasing more information about Sameerah 's death than was usual at the opening of an inquest . `` I think it 's very important that the public have this information . `` There must be a lot of parents who are worried and are very aware of your grief . '' Mayfield School head teacher Paul Jenkins said pupils and staff were being offered support over the death of Sameerah . `` She was a wonderful , happy , child and her death is a great loss to the school community . She will be sadly missed by everyone here .
